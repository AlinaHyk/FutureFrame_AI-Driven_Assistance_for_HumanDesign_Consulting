6th Line Characteristics
Transition – the authority, no longer really interested/committed, role model, administrator, objectivity, optimist, wariness, leadership, the peacemaker

This line grows through three stages:
٭    Trial and error from birth to 28 (the 6 is a 3)
٭    The “on the roof stage” from 28 to 50

٭    This line Views and sees everything and doesn’t tell

٭    They can spend their lives being aloof, standing back

٭    They can develop a pessimistic point of view when they go through their trial and error process
٭    The evolution out of pessimism is for them to re-discover their optimism 
٭    They can be deeply aloof not feeling like engaging in the world 
٭    After the Chiron Return they must commit themselves to what they recognize as correct. When the sixth line     can come down off of its hill and help the rest of the villagers build the ark, then it completes its     process. It leaves aloofness and recommits itself to a dynamic life of participation and becomes a “Role     Model”
٭    They show the rest of us that life “begins” after 50
