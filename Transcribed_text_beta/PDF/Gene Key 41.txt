The 41st Shadow – Fantasy
The Genetic Wheel of Samsara
Th e 41st Gene Key and its various frequencies comprise a truly remarkable archetype. It stands alone
within the human genetic matrix with a very important function. It relates to what is known in genetics as
the ‘start codon’. Since this is such an important Gene Key it may help to understand exactly what it means.
Below is an example of a section of genetic code transcribed into letters. Th e genetic code is made up of
combinations of only four letters A, T, C and G. Th ese letters are called ‘bases’ and represent the basic build-
ing blocks of the entire code. Hidden within these billions of letters are specifi c instructions for the body to
follow. In deciphering the code of life, scientists discovered that there were places within the sequence where
the body always seemed to know to begin building. Th ey found that whenever the body sees the letters atg
in a sequence, it always acts on the instructions that follow. Th us they called this the ‘start codon’ because it
operates like a front door key into the code itself.

From the above description, you should see how important this 41st Gene Key is. As a genetic archetype
of functioning within human consciousness, its message is of huge import to us all.
At the Shadow level of consciousness, the 41st Gene Key centres around the issue of fantasy and dreams.
Being in the thrall of the 41st Shadow of Fantasy is like holding the key to your dreams in your hand, but
never turning it in the lock. Whether you have this 41st Shadow in your hologenetic profi le or not, you are
undoubtedly available for its infl uence because like all the Shadows, it exerts its greatest power through the

Emanation by people who dream of a better life but who, for one reason or another, are unable to bring
these dreams into reality.
The 41st Shadow creates a continual pressure within humans; it is the pressure to evolve.
When this pressure is distorted by a low frequency field, as is the current state of humanity,
it becomes distorted into the pressure to feel happy. Thus begins what the ancients named the
Over half of ‘Wheel of Samsara’ — an endless cycle of suffering in which humans become trapped by the

in this Gene Key. It is not desire itself that is the problem, because desire (the 30th Shadow)

So how is it that we have misread such a vital code within our nature? And is there any-
from an
thing we can do about it? There are many answers to be found within the higher frequencies

of this Gene Key as you shall see. For the moment, let us try and see how this Shadow works,
evolution.
and how effectively it keeps human consciousness from flowering. The key to the problem, as
ever, lies within your mind. The evolutionary pressure that surges up in human beings carries
our entire genetic history within it; that is, our evolution all the way from amoeba to Homo
sapiens. Over half of your genetic code derives from other organisms from an earlier evolution.
All this history carries an enormous weight inside you. In one sense it drags you down, but in
another it urges you to want to break free. To face the pressure of all this past inside you takes
enormous courage and, as you let it in, you want to run and distract yourself away from it in
any way possible.
Because of the ‘ancestral weight’ carried by this Shadow, it has a deep connection to human
appetite and energy. This deeply uncomfortable pressure coming straight out of the 41st Shadow
causes us to literally hunger for a better future. By the same token it has connections with
eating, not eating and depression. The distortion of the 41st Shadow can lead to all manner of
weight problems and energy problems — from chronic fatigue to hyperactivity. All of these
issues are ultimately rooted in the mind and its ability or inability to fantasise about the future.
This Shadow constantly shuffles between the dream of being full and the urge to be empty.
When the gauge reads ‘empty’, you fantasise about being full. Whether that means dreaming of
meeting your perfect soul mate, having lots of money or devouring a bar of chocolate depends
upon your individual mind and its conditioning. Conversely, when the gauge reads ‘full’, you
can sink into heaviness in which you feel weighed down by your past and you experience the
urge to purge.
The Shadow of Fantasy prevents you from feeling complete because the mind doesn’t rest
in the now, but swings between dreaming of the future and rehashing the past. However, the
greatest problem with this Shadow is that it prevents you from actually fulfilling your dreams.
You become addicted to the hope that the dream brings to your mind, rather than actually
launching off in the direction of the dream. This is a major reason why people live off the fanta-
sies provided by their culture — the movies or alternative realities created through technology

The 41st
and the internet which have become humanity’s latest great fantasy addiction.
The 41st Gene Key is also always involved with issues of leadership. The leader that knows Gene Key
how to manipulate fantasy can have enormous impact over others. The programming partner
to the 41st Gene Key is the 31st Gene key with its Shadow of Arrogance. This 31st Gene Key’s
y
theme of leadership is marred at the shadow level by false humility, which is really the same
thing as arrogance. True leaders have to overcome a deep fear of humiliation, because when the
41st Gene Key declares its dreams aloud and stands behind them, they risk being very easily
misunderstood. Those who bring the new into the world have always faced this challenge.
In conclusion then, the 41st Shadow of Fantasy sets up the great ‘maya’ or illusion in which
most human beings live. As a primary evolutionary pressure it triggers a ‘false start’ into a mental
representation of your life, thereby short-circuiting your ability to live in the present moment.
Fantasy itself is a beautiful thing, but if it prevents you from really living it becomes an escape
from life into the mind. Once you have become trapped in these addictive mental patterns, it is
very difficult to recognise them and break out of them. However, in every turn of the wheel of
fantasy, as the cycles of your life periodically reset themselves, there is that chance that the next
time round, the code will be correctly interpreted. When this happens to you, you will engage
the true start codon rather than its shadow. Instead of escaping back into the vicious cycle of
fantasy and hope, your higher purpose will be unleashed and will manifest in the world.
Repressive Nature – Dreamy
The repressive nature of the 41st Shadow is about escaping life through dreaminess. These
people have an agenda that is dictated by fantasy. They really do not live in the real world.
Whatever you say to such people, they will interpret it through their dream. Such people do
not actually want to fulfil their dreams, but are addicted to the inner worlds created by their
minds. They are governed by deep-seated fear that doesn’t allow them to have proper human
relationships. This dreaminess often presents as a kind of lethargy that gives rise to the gradual
break-down of the energetic systems within the body — in particular the vascular and the
digestive systems. The only way for these people to break out of their mental cycle is to begin
manifesting their dreams on the material plane.
Reactive Nature – Hyperactive
The reactive nature of this Shadow can be a sheer bundle of nervous energy. These people
are always ahead of themselves, being absolutely carried away on the fuel of their dreams. This
kind of nature inevitably leads to burnout as the power of the fantasy they are trying to bring
into the world outstrips the limitations of the material plane. Their insatiable hunger drives
them into deeper and deeper problems, whilst placing enormous pressure on their nervous
system. The inevitable breakdown of such a nature is often highly dramatic and destructive for
anyone else involved. The hope for these people pivots upon their ability to allow others into
their inner life and relinquishing their one-pointed obsession with manifesting their dream
exactly as it appears inside their minds.

The Prime The 41st Gift – Anticipation
Emanation
The Ring of Origin
As we saw with the 41st Shadow, this Gene Key represents the basic pressure to evolve — to
seek out new pastures and new experiences. This evolutionary impulse is the secret to the 41st
Gift — the Gift of Anticipation. There is an interesting phenomenon that occurs the more
you raise the frequency passing in and out of your DNA. You become more and more sensitive
to the hidden properties in the world around you. One of the things you become particularly
aware of is the presence of morphogenetic fields. Morphogenetic fields were first postulated
by the scientist Rupert Sheldrake, but many older cultures have spoken of such energy fields
throughout history. Essentially, a morphogenetic field is an invisible energy grid that commu-
nicates specific information across time and space. Depending on your sensitivity, you can pick
up information about the past or the future from the field.
The 41st Gift is a particularly special Gift. As higher frequencies begin to operate through
this Gene Key, it picks up very specific information from the morphogenetic field. Every one of
the 64 Gene Keys operates out of a particular morphogenetic field. For example, the program-
ming partner of this Gift, the 31st Gift of Leadership, attunes itself to all higher frequency
leaders on this planet, even inspirational leaders from our collective past. Each Gene Key draws
strength and power from those who have come before and, at the same time, also attunes to
those who have not yet been born. It may explain why certain people seem to have premoni-
tions about the future. Both of these Gifts — Anticipation (41) and Leadership (31) — operate
together, one reinforcing the other. The greatest leaders are those who build upon the past and
anticipate what is coming. Likewise, people with the Gift of Anticipation are naturally held up
as leaders.
The 41st Gift has a single genetic agenda — it is always attuned to the next evolutionary
energetic grid that is waiting to descend into form. Behind it are hidden the blueprints of evo-

When you are able to maintain a high frequency through this 41st Gift, you will be able
to literally ‘download’ all manner of beautiful things from the morphogenetic field. All works
of genius emerge from this field. Mozart is a fine example of a man with a strongly activated
41st Gift. His ability to ‘read’ the completed scores of all his finest works straight from the

morphogenetic field is well documented, although it may not have been described in this kind
of language before. Mozart was born into a world of music and was intensively tutored by his Gene Key
own father, one of Europe’s leading musical masters. It is unsurprising then that Mozart picked
up on the burgeoning musical morphogenetic field of his era, now known as the classical style.

He anticipated its maturation and manifested it in the material plane. This is the real difference
between the 41st Gift and the 41st Shadow. It is the difference between genius and non-genius.
Genius manifests whilst non-genius dreams.
Since the start codon and its amino acid methionine are only coded by this single 41st Gene
Key, it has a remarkable place within the system of chemical rings known as the Codon Rings.
The 21 Codon Rings are threaded together as chemical chains that relay biological information
between each other in a fractal manner. This method of information relay means that the body
can essentially operate like a quantum biocomputer, organising multiple levels of information
in response to stimulus from the inner and outer environment. Within this interlinked ring
system, the 20 amino acids can be combined and recombined to create all manner of chemis-
tries within the body. Nested in the heart of the ring matrix sits the 41st Gene Key — the Ring
of Origin - pulsing with the source code that it then transmits to the networks of codon rings.
Even though we may look at DNA as a double helix with the four bases strung out along a line
of code, its actual functioning within the body as a whole is in no way linear.
The implications of the above are astounding. Every single start codon inside every single
cell of your body is electromagnetically linked to each other. This is the foundation of the holo-
graphic body, which in turn is linked electromagnetically to the holographic universe. Every
impulse inside you is therefore communicated to the whole, just as every impulse within the
whole is chemically mirrored in your DNA. Once you have discovered the knack of influencing
your own DNA, you can literally reprogram every cell within your body. However, in order to
activate secret chemical formulae inside your body that accompany the highest states of con-
sciousness, you must learn to overcome the inertia of humanity as a whole. This is the domain
of the 41st Siddhi.
The 41st Siddhi – Emanation
The Ouroboros
As we have examined the 41st Gene Key, we have risen to the awareness wherein the physi-
cal body can be seen as a holographic mirror of the universe, the source of which is this very
Gene Key. When we extend this model at a macrocosmic level to its ultimate frequency, we
reach something both spectacular and terrifying. The question is: What does the cosmic start
codon look like, and what does it mean to arrive at the source of all being? As the source of
being, the 41st Siddhi is the Siddhi of Emanation. Emanation is a word that has been used by
many ancient metaphysical and mystical systems as a means for understanding something that
is really unapproachable. One of the best known of these systems is perhaps the Kabbalah,
323
The Prime
whose central tenet is a map known as ‘the doctrine of emanation’.
Emanation In a nutshell, the doctrine of emanation points towards a fractal model of the universe in
which everything emerges infinitely as a mirror image of itself. The cabbalists used the symbol
of 10 spheres or ‘sephira’, one emanating from another, to represent the various levels of spirit
descending into matter. The ultimate source, known as the ‘ain soph’, represents the unname-
able, inconceivable limitless light from which all else emanates. Although the Kabbalah is an
incredible model of the universe, with many different uses and dimensions, it remains a flawed
model because all models are flawed by the limitation of language. No language is able to
approach this word ‘emanation’. It is a word that contains the concept of infinity.
The ancient Chinese named this 41st hexagram of the I Ching ‘Decrease’, which is rather
profound because the 41st Siddhi is nothing less than a black hole. As you approach it, it begins
to pull you into pieces. It sucks in language, it sucks in time and it even sucks in space. It reduces
everything down to nothing. It represents the source of everything. This source has been given
so many names by so many different traditions as man has tried to understand it. What is
so fascinating about this 41st Siddhi is that it is the source underlying all true siddhic states.
No matter what manifestation comes through our genetics, they are all ultimately grounded
through this Siddhi that is not a Siddhi. In many ways, this is the nameless Siddhi, but we call
it emanation because we have no other way of approaching it.
There is another interesting point that emerges from deep contemplation of the 41st Siddhi.
Somewhere deep within your DNA lies a code whose sole purpose is to trigger the state we
call enlightenment. In certain vehicles the body picks up a specific set of secret genetic instruc-
tions and triggers the neurological process of enlightenment. It may come as a shock to many
mystical seekers that this process cannot be triggered by what we do up on the surface. Within
the hologram of the universe, enlightenment is a spontaneous ‘acausal’ non-event. You could say
that Grace triggers this process, but the point is that it is a chemical process and

a spontaneous ‘acausal’ The one whose body has undergone the process of true enlightenment can-

because no one remains present to experience anything. This Siddhi triggers the
death of experience itself, which is impossible to comprehend from outside this state. From
within this state, there is no underlying agenda — any manifestations of so-called heightened
states of consciousness are meaningless. Bliss is meaningless, ecstasy is meaningless and God is
meaningless. All the other 63 siddhic states are meaningless since they are all subtle expressions
of the prime emanation. From the viewpoint of the 41st Siddhi everything is reduced down to
mere physiology, which is why this Gene Key can be so terrifying for human beings. It makes
a mockery of all your efforts, meditation, morality and systems for understanding life. There is
no ‘how’ within this Siddhi. This is the terrifying sentence for us because it means we can do
absolutely nothing to trigger this state, which in turn means that we are utterly helpless.
The one in whom the 41st Siddhi is made manifest faces a terrible dilemma. If they speak,

The 41st
they know they will speak with an agenda. Even if they do not speak, people will interpret
this as another agenda. Such people know that they are trapped. They know that their state Gene Key
can never be communicated and there is nothing that they say that can help anyone. In fact,
whatever they do say will probably be misinterpreted. One thing that can be said about such
y
people is that their ‘state’ triggers great hunger in others. Whether that is a good thing or not is
unknown! All they know is that for them there is no more hunger. They have somehow fallen
off the wheel of samsara and in doing so, there is no longer any pressure to evolve. There is no
evolution of consciousness. All evolution is a figment of our imagination and belongs in the
domain of samsara itself. In a great final twist, even the 41st Siddhi is sucked into the very void
from which it emanates, just as the eternal serpent of consciousness — the ouroboros — is seen
endlessly devouring its own tail.
