Analyst Preparation: Overview
Your Role as PTL 1 Instructor
After Rave ABC’s and Rave Cartography, Human Design Education divides into distinct
General and Professional educational tracks. Analyst Training belongs to the Professional
Program.. As the trainer of Analysts, the Professional Training Level 1 Instructor takes
on a very specific responsibility not duplicated elsewhere in the IHDS structure:
responsibility for a particular group of students for a full year, preferably meeting
together as a class for one weekend a month (this is the ideal format) and closely
supervising their development as Analysts in training.1
This means that, as their Instructor, you will be critiquing and supervising student work,
empowering and supporting students individually, and both demonstrating and instilling a
standard of professional excellence. There are specific ways in which in PTL 1/Level 3,
in certain aspects, you become less of a teacher and more of a coach/trainer. In essence,
your role also becomes “the first line of defense” in new Analyst quality control. This
will occasionally require you to make unpopular decisions or even ask a student to leave
class. You are also responsible, through your work over the year, for providing the
foundational skills that will prepare students for their eventual certification. (See below.)
When admitting students to this course, it can be wise to conduct a preliminary interview
and to inform students of the above, particularly because only those students who
demonstrate that they will become good professional Analysts will be allowed to
register for the Keynoting sequence that completes this training cycle (and even
though they will already have paid a significant tuition fee). Part of your responsibility as
an Instructor will be to guide other students into other tracks in Design (see Keynoting,
1 Alternatively, since this exact frequency is not always possible, you can, for instance, meet for four days every two months or six
days twice a year adding short intermediary “live” meetings and/or regular online meetings in the interim for intensive oral practice
and while still requiring, reviewing and commenting on monthly MP3 assignments. (Learning comprehension and skill will suffer in
the twice a year format unless there are steady practice sessions scheduled in between.) If you have to schedule less frequently once in
a while, do make sure your students always have assignments and other methods of oral practice to keep them busy and build their
knowledge and memory base in the interim.

Sequence III of this Manual). The recommendation of the student’s Rave Cartography
Teacher is also required to attend PTL 1.
Course Content and the Rave Analysis Method (RAM)
PTL 1 Content focuses on the detail of Human Design--Gates and Lines--and builds the
full skill of synthesizing all Human Design information into a single analytic surface. In
the course of this year, students will study all the Gates and Lines, complete monthly oral
analytical assignments, practice extensively in class, become virtually literate and
technically proficient if they are not so already, and eventually keynote Charts. As their
instructor, you will also personally (or by inviting guest experts) provide access to an
enrichment program of supplementary skills: vocal delivery, communication and
technical skills (computer skills), coaching techniques, marketing and entrepreneurial
skills, etc. Some concise aids and support for this enrichment are offered in this volume,
but you will probably have to go beyond this and offer additional resources for the
student.
Course content continues to be presented in Bodygraph structure. Together with the skill
of analytic synthesis, the bulk of the course content consists of teaching Gates and Lines
in Streams (which you can vary with minor Circuits, Center framework, etc) and through
Rave I Ching Structure. The course concludes with the Keynoting module.
Teaching Principles Focus for PTL 1
Here, a review of the core principles and goals of the full educational program:
1. Becoming fluent in the very articulate and multilayered visual language of the
Rave Bodygraph.
2. Keynoting in context of this language.
3. Oral practice and play stressing precision and, later on, poetry.
4. Rave in motion: every aspect of the Rave is always in movement, it contains
no fixed points; only “close up” screen shots of a synthesis in perpetual
motion
5. Type: There are no specific instructions for addressing Type in any level
because Type is always a constant.
6. Every level of education delivers its own level of Reading competence.
Introduce a theme in one level; repeat it with additional depth in the next
level.

This is the level where it all comes together. The surface and basic single value Keynotes
(i.e., 236 Keynotes without synthesis) were established in Rave ABC’s. In Rave
Cartography, this awareness deepened into sophisticated exploration of open Centers,
Definition, Authority, Channels, and Profiling, along with the introduction of the skill of
chart synthesis. Along with Gates and Lines, fluency in analysis and in visual language
on all levels of the Bodygraph is established here as a foundation for learning, in
Sequence III, the professional skill of Keynoting. Surface, intermediary, and depth level
(Gate, Line, and a basic awareness that there is something below the line) layers of
content are all available and required areas of proficiency in PTL 1.
You are now giving your students a license to play all the octaves of the basic
Bodygraph. Therefore, teach and use the full spectrum of available Bodygraph
perspectives and synthesize surface and detail into a single analytic surface.
As students move through this course they will learn how to move technically from the
detail of Human Design (i.e. the Line level with at least the awareness that it is only an
intermediary level of detail) to the big picture of Type, moving through Gate, Circuit and
Channel, with the skill to synthesize Line value as appropriate and within Center
framework. They will also learn how to move from the surface of the chart (Type) back
to the detail. As their teacher, lead them through the process of beginning an analysis at
any of these entry points: from the smallest detail of line to the big picture and back
again, always working through Type. At the same time continue to teach them the detail
of Human Design from the perspective of the Human Design as a moving surface, always
a Line in motion, never a fixed point.
This technique of synthesizing the Bodygraph information from surface to detail and
back again or beginning anywhere in between with an awareness of the visual nature of
the language and how it essential moves is called the Rave Analysis Method (RAM).
Student proficiency in the Rave Analysis Method, including Keynoting is the goal of this
pre-professional preparation course.

Course Method
The method is delivered through 6 basic avenues:
1. Demonstration of content and method through example charts.
2. Oral practice and play to mastering and memorizing the detail of the system.
This supports both analytic skills and memorization (essential to delivering a
professional Reading and also conferring essential depth and experience to the
Analyst generally).
3. Monthly MP3 homework assignments shared with other students in class and
critiqued individually by you (the Instructor).
4. Required Reading and listening of syllabus material assigned from the HD
library (as assigned by you or your national organization).
5. Technical enrichment program of other skills essential to being a good
Analyst: virtual literacy, coaching skills, vocal quality and care, etc. You can
provide this yourself or you can bring in outside experts.
6. Type, Strategy and Authority as constants you teach, mentor, coach, and
critique.
And, of course, continued living of one’s own unique Human Design experiment with
built-in class and Instructor support.
Oral repetition creates neural pathways in the brain and strengthens
analytic skills. Design heals, empowers, and supports through its precise
language. The constant of oral practice allows for not only the level of
skill but also the comfort and mastery each Analyst will eventually need.
As usual, any text printed in red comes directly from Ra Uru Hu.

Reference Materials
This manual contains a collection of visual and verbal reference to empower and support
you in this process. These include:
• Outline of Content Topics Without Developmental or Practice Session (provided
at the end of the Introduction).
• Alphabetical List of Content Topics. (Also provided at the end of the
Introduction).
• Visual and Verbal Reference (i.e. Channel and Stream Keynotes following related
diagrams and Rave I Ching Left Hand and Right Hand Pages with features
labeled) provided chapter by chapter and topic by topic throughout. Weekend
7/Fixation, in particular, offers a very carefully developed series of mechanical
and example charts that covers a range of dynamics in Individual Chart Fixation.
• An essential structural outline for each Sequence (I, II and III) at the head of each
of the three sections, which you can use as, is or modify, as you like. Within each
Sequence, each chapter fills out and expands and varies the essential outline,
including Practice and Play variations developed specifically for each content
section.
• The basic organization of the coursework moves from month to month to provide
guidelines for twelve discrete modules of teaching, which you are, of course, free
to modify or vary. The detail level of organization is for your convenience only
and to provide an example. Course plan details will naturally differ according to
teacher, student, medium, language, and culture.
Educational Goal
The goal of this course is to create highly skilled professional Analysts who can easily
take their place in a global professional class using a standard training method that allows
for uniqueness in both learning styles and analytic methods (i.e. taking into account
individual Designs) while simultaneously training all students to a uniform, quantifiable
level of excellence. When they leave this class, their eventual certification examinations
must be almost an afterthought due to the level of familiarity they have with keynoting in
their own unique style within the Human Design standard. Students graduating from this
course must have facility and skill with both the detail and big picture of Human Design
System, be able to synthesize the information from any entry point in the Chart, keynote
effectively, and deliver a quality recorded reading in an MP3 format. There is no other
developmental sequence in the making of Human Design Analysts, Levels IV and V
return to more of an information-delivery format. thus the full responsibility for training

well rests here. (See the Introduction to Sequence III: Keynoting for more on this
subject.) PTL 1 is it.
Give students keys in Rave ABC’s. Maneuver inwards in Rave
Cartography. In Professional Level One, you go deep, deep, deep and
then you start moving up again into the larger view and finally get to the
point where you students aren’t just stringing Keynotes—the Keynotes
have a context.
About Student Assignments More Specifically
There are many suggestions for assignments (both for the monthly MP3 delivery and
simply to practice and learn the material) throughout this course. However, to fulfill the
needs of your particular students and teaching style you may also need and want to
develop your own “Surface” style assignments, which address the big picture and
continuity of Human Design. These would include the suggested monthly Home Study,
which might be assigned to in each of the six months of the Line sequence assignments.
For example, students would study all 64 lines of each value, from 1-6, month by month
to discover how they are related. Process oriented assignments address and provide an
experience of the Human Design System’s depth. Going through each Hexagram Line by
Line to experience its full process, alone or in symmetry with a harmonic or mirror Gate,
is a depth-oriented process.
Also consider developing assignments and Practice and Play sessions that address not
only Type (i.e. pairing Generators off with each other and inviting Projectors into deeper
structure of the system) but also reinforce the expression and learning needs and styles of
the range of Circuits. For instance, to reinforce through the Abstract style, you might use
colored pencils to draw Gate Definition down to the base level when teaching the full
narrowness and depth of the line of Definition. Ask Individuals to find music or sound
that expresses different lines of one Hexagram, then have them present or perform the
Hexagram concert that results. Invite the Logical to graph the developmental pattern of a
Stream or Circuit as they see it. Etc. Various suggestions and reminders to create or
include this type of assignment will also be found in the text itself.
Teachers need to come up with an example chart package that they like. I
used the same ones over and over again for years. Your chart package
also needs to account for a cross section of different ways in which to look
at continuity: for instance, beginning from the Line, or the Keynote, or
the Gate.

Required Student Reading
As analysts in training, students taking this course must own one, and preferably two
copies of the Rave I Ching (one to mark up), Line Companion Volume 1 and 2, and the
Rave Dictionary. Please note that students must own a hard copy (printed book) version
of the Rave I Ching because the visual page layout (i.e. side by side and both full pages)
is an essential element of its content and will be used extensively in class. There will also
be other recommended books and recommended audio, including, of course, your own
personal recommendations from the HD library.
Required Student Reading Assignment Prerequisite
Before the course begins, students are required to read both the Rave I Ching and Line
Companion according to Type. Generators are requested to read responding to the
material and looking at their own Chart. Projectors will absorb the material while looking
at the Design of an important person (or people) in their lives. Reflectors are required to
read while looking at the Just Now (transit) Chart of the moment in which they are
reading, while Manifestors can read the material however they prefer.
Required Student Technical Tools
Computer that runs MP3 recording software with CD burner (at the time of this writing,
that might mean a fast PC laptop with Sony Sound Forge.) and a fast internet connection
(at the time of this writing that means broadband or DSL, although what that means
exactly in capacity varies from country to country, so please research local conditions as
necessary). Headset, microphone, and an e-mail address with storage allotment and
maximum attachment size sufficient to send and receive ten minute MP3 files. Many e-
mail services limit their attachments to 10 MG, which is sufficient for ten minutes of
MP3 especially if not saved or recorded at highest quality rate. Optional but convenient:
web or server access to a service that will send large files quickly. MMI software of the
most current version upgraded at least to the level of the Rave Analysis Pack. A laptop
computer is highly recommended. This way, students will be able to bring their laptops to
class and you will be able to view example Charts together in the electronic medium,
simultaneously empowering students’ mastery of the software and the ability to read off
of all the information offered by MMI. A portable outboard hard disk or thumb drive is
recommended to transfer and store audio files, which do tend to fill hard drives quickly.
Again, specific technical requirements are likely to change over time as technical
standards and opportunities evolve.

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
Virtual Literary and You
On the technical level, this course also shifts in its requirement for teachers. You yourself
must be competent and fluid with MP3 recording software, the broadband medium, and
working with and in a virtual classroom. Obviously, you are not required to provide a
personal technical help support desk, but it wouldn’t hurt to have an expert on tap to
speak to students, during the first month or so especially, and to have one available for
yourself as well. Providing an FAQ on common technical problems, which will of course
change as the technology evolves, is recommended. Resources may of course vary from
national environment to environment.
What This Book Includes and What It Doesn’t
You already have a Rave I Ching and Line Companion. We aren’t going to make this
volume heavier and more expensive by duplicating them here. What we are going to do is
provide reference material those books don’t have: Stream order, Bodygraph order, and
lots of teaching examples and reference on the method: the visual language elements of
the Rave I Ching, exactly how the Gate is a location as opposed to a fixed point in space,
and mirror Circuitry. We will also provide detailed Keynotes such as Gate groupings
(Deafness, Stillness, Aloneness, etc.), and Streams. We also give tips on how to teach
and/or remind you to get advice from experts on vocal delivery, technical issues,
marketing, etc. We do not include some Gate and Circuitry information that is already
available in concise form elsewhere or all information that students will need.
We occasionally continue to give practice and play models and reminders and include
perspective from long time Human Design teachers on what works at this level of
education and what hasn’t for them, by Type. And of course, as usual, there is plenty of
input, and this time also extensive example analysis from Ra Uru Hu. (It’s his method
after all.) Speaking of which:
From Professional Training Level 1 onward, 80 percent of success is
based on how much students want to study. You can only teach them
keynoting. They have to be committed to doing the work and the study.
There is not much study in Levels One and Two. You only want people at
this level who are interested in a professional career.

Be Mechanical, Not Mystical
Helplessness and blamelessness will help us to deal with students who will
never get it, the ones who think they’ve got it, and the ones who don’t care.
There is a grace available to all of us in this knowledge to accept beings as
they are. We cannot change the world and we are not here to save it, because,
frankly, we can’t. We can only change one being at a time. However, there is
a huge potential in numbers of people who are actually ready for this and it is
just a matter of the right fractal line reaching them. Therefore, we must put
our words in the correct contexts. We are not missionaries or messiahs. We
are mechanics.
In terms of your work as a teacher, demystify yourself. You will get a lot of
projection placed on you; a certain look that comes your way when you
change the way a student sees. That look corrupts some people and they end
up wanting only that. We have to see what our job is and keep it in context.
I want students to feel they are being given a technical skill, not a mystical
path. This approach will help us establish a proper foundation for this
knowledge. I don’t care if you are mystical in your own life. Just please don’t
bring your beliefs into the classroom.

Technical requirements and skills
• Determine whether all students dispose of basic technical equipment (i.e.
laptop and accessories) and can use it. Suggest resources if some students do
not. You may want to have a technician attend part of the class to answer
questions, give advice, and troubleshoot broadband and recording issues.
• Practice sending each other MMI Charts in *.rave format through “My
Computer” (the standard as of the time of the writing) if there is sufficient
broadband access in the class environment. Otherwise (and also in addition)
make this part of the assignment to be carried out over the course of the
month.
• Practice recording MP3 files and discuss different methods of transferring
AIFF or WAV to MP3, recording straight to MP3, or other file conversion and
recording options that may become available, or necessary, over time as
digital audio technology continues to evolve.
• Discuss and recommend particular microphones and the headsets. Fine tune
audio input and output settings.
• Discuss the role and range of allocation of memory in the audio format and
remind students of the conveniences of external hard drives and thumb drives.
• Stress the need to back up all data. Give recommendations how this can be
done.
• Address electronic record keeping (i.e. session date, audio data organization,
cross referencing to text and information management) and share habits and
what works. Some students will come in with more electronic expertise than
you have and others will need to be helped along.
• Remind students of Human Design web resources in your country and
internationally.
• Determine whether or not they all have their books. If not, ensure that they
are obtained.
How To Record A Reading
Everything about a reading is based on the quality of the audio. The Analyst
should record the reading onto his or her computer using a good headset
microphone. He or she should always do a sound test by recording and listening
to the recording. Ideally, you want a recording program that shows your levels.
It should not be so low you have to strain to hear the voice nor so high so that
the volume is maxing out. If you are going to upload the file to a server or send

it via email then it should be burned in MP3 format. (If you then burn a CD it is
best to burn it as a .WAV file, since that plays universally.)
In terms of recording quality, you want it to be a 4800 sample rate at 56kbps. I
find that recording in Stereo and then saving in Mono gives best results. If I send
the reading to the client over the web I make the audio 32kbps. I have a good
sound card so the quality stays good. For beginners, 32kbps might create too
much sound loss; in that case, burn your reading at 56kbps. I save a master at
96kbps and keep that as a backup. Of course, this usually creates an audio file
that is too large for e-mail if you are doing a full Reading, so you have to upload
it to a server which is a whole different can of worms. A ten-minute file can be
sent easily.
--Gennaro Brooks-Church
Which Mics, What Software?
At the time of writing, a good PC microphone choice when doing live readings
is the Sony ECM-ZS90, however, by the time this book goes to press there may
be a better option. For MP3 files created for PTL 1 or for remote clients, a
headset usually delivers the best audio quality.
Audio Programs: On PC, the recommended Programs are Sony Sound Forge 7.0
and higher. Professionals in the Human Design Community are also satisfied
with Adobe Audition, Super MP3 Recorder Professional, and Cool Edit Pro 2.0
and higher, and Audiograbber. At the time of this writing, on Mac, Sound Studio
3.0 is straightforward, inexpensive, and produces excellent results. You can also
record audio tracks onto Garage Band.
If a PC’s standard audio card does produce not clear sound, an upgrade to a
higher quality audio card is recommended. Macs have excellent sound quality
and do not require audio upgrades.
Keep in mind that all Jovian Archive software applications are designed for PC
only, require VPC to run in an Apple environment, and always have slower
screen refresh rates and stream more slowly than on native PC platforms
although they tend to run fine.
Shock your students out of what they got earlier — the days when they
just got easy techniques and then were sent out the door to practice are
all over. They are going to have to accept being educated. Lay out the
ground rules.

DAY TWO
Review of Prerequisite Reading (Rave I Ching and Line
Companion) by Type and Presentation of Rave Analysis Method
(RAM).
Reviewing Student’s Required Reading
Have students share what they learned in the required Reading assignment (see
Introduction). Consider comparing and contrasting the experience by Type, Strategy,
Authority and even Circuit type Definition.
Optional Practice Session #1: Practice with example and each other’s Charts in class to
see where your students are at and to review. Review the visual language of Design and
the principles and how using them has worked out practically when Reading other Charts
after completing Rave Cartography.
Optional Practice Session #2: The Home MP3 Assignment for Month 1 will be a 10
minute reading of the student’s own chart (see below).
However, you can also, between the first and second days of this class, if you like, assign
an unprepared reading of their own chart and also a ten minute live reading of a chart you
have chosen. Students can keep these recording until the end of their professional
education as a baseline against which to measure their changing skills.
The purpose of giving assignments to describe charts with preparation, and also without,
is to show students the difference, and how to manage an unexpected situation. Consider
giving prepared and unprepared analysis assignments during the course of the year,
recording all of them.
If you choose this option, ask other students to give feedback after the student has
presented the prepared and unprepared Reading according to the guidelines presented
below. Afterwards, both encourage them and tell them there is a long way to go!!
For these first month assignments, use whatever chart reading skills your students have
entered the class with.

A Few Rules of Thumb for Giving and Receiving Feedback
Peer feedback from other students on MP3 assignments is valuable not only for its
content but so each student Analyst can experience the different ways in which analysis
can be experienced by different Designs. Below is a list of guidelines (not the only
method for a good one) for peer feedback sessions. Consider reviewing these with your
class before you begin your first MP3 Review session.
Students can choose to give or receive MP3 feedback—neither one is mandatory.
Student feedback is understood to be subjective, i.e. the perception of the person giving it
and not an objective measurement.
Student feedback is Resource Oriented: i.e., do not give critique at a skill level to which a
student does not yet have access, i.e., omission of line values when they have only
learned Gates so far. This applies to Instructor and student feedback both. Only use the
current skill base in your critique and commentary.
Students do not grade each other.
Rules of thumb for the student offering feedback:
• Only provide feedback if the other student wishes to receive it
• Highlight the features in the assignment which worked well
• Offer feedback that is appropriate to the needs of the person and the situation
• Try to formulate everything in I-messages (, i.e., “I think you should…” no
“we think” or “you ought to,” etc.)
• Do not diagnose or adopt a therapeutic approach to other student’s character
• Be concrete and practical in your feedback
• Only discuss the assignment at hand
Rules of thumb for the student receiving feedback:
• Only ask for feedback if you can handle it. Once given, only accept feedback
that feels appropriate to you (according to your Strategy)
• Be open to listen
• Accept it as it is
• Do not defend yourself
• Think it over

Rave Analysis Method (RAM): The Gate Surface in Synthetic
Context
We are not going to teach Gates as isolated values. They are always
taught as a movement, an integrated force.
Rave Analysis Method
Rave Analysis Method is the primary technique used in this course. It technically
establishes the foundation that students will need to keynote freely, for themselves and
eventually for clients, when they reach Keynoting Sequence III and eventually become
professionals.
It is the third generation Human Design Analysis technique that synthesizes generations
one and two of Human Design Analysis education and practice.
Generation One (Foundation): detail of line only. Line by line readings. Depth but
not simple surface dynamics, strategy, or synthesis
Generation Two (Binary): Focus on chart surface at expense of depth and detail
Generation Three (Quantum): synthesizes surface and depth of the Rave into a
powerful moving language that heals as it names and reveals the unique differentiation of
the individual. Works and is organized within the different layers of the Bodygraph
structure itself.
Rave Analysis Method uses a simple method to train students technically and
linguistically to interpret every element of the Rave in context of every other to provide a
solid technical foundation and skill depth that prepares them for the poetry of Keynoting.
It begins by interpreting the 64 Gates in context of the surface of the Bodygraph (RC
knowledge level: 236 and 4 View Keynotes). It continues by teaching the 384 Lines in
the context of the Gates. All this detail and depth content exists in a moving continuum
with the surface of the chart and is interpreted as such.

Figure 1.1: Ra Uru Hu’s 62nd Gate
(Example Gate is 62 because it is the Gate of Naming, see above)
First Generation: “You really have to name and organize detail because you have the
62nd Gate.”
Second Generation: “You impact mutatively with the help of the logic you can access
easily.”
Third Generation: You are designed to mutatively impact others by universalizing in the
now as you manifest your will. Part of your impact lies in your ability to logically
investigate, organize, and choose the names that will transform the Collective.”

Example Chart
Authors’ note
This Analysis demonstration was generated spontaneously when Ra Uru Hu
asked the class members to pick any Gate to demonstrate the Analysis and
Teaching Method. The requested Gate was 27. Ra opened his Chart file and
pulled out the Design of Monica Lewinsky, a 5/1 Emotional Generator on
Distraction, Personality Sun 56.5. Monica Lewinsky was, of course the very
young White House intern who, along with then American President Bill
Clinton, precipitated a political scandal the pertinent details of which are
included in the analysis.
We demonstrate the technique through an edited version with key points of the method
bulleted alongside the text and the method itself “boxed” along the side for efficient
reference.
Of course, you can start an analysis like this from any gate in any chart, as Ra Uru Hu
mentions often. The formula, along with this particular analysis, is provided for your
convenience and reference as you develop your own example chart package and teaching
style. This one linguistically demonstrates how to move from any gate surface in any
chart to its synthesized overview, move out to other gates, back to the overview, and then
the original gate again to deliver the chart’s essence. It is highly recommended that you
stock your own example file with charts with which you are quite familiar in a variety of
Types and which offer many possible variations on how to approach the Human Design’s
central theme. This way, you are best equipped to move richly in a number of different
directions and demonstrate to your students that wherever they go in their analysis, they
will be safe and won’t be making a mistake.
Also, your teaching focus is never the specific Gate information itself (that information
can be found in the Rave I Ching and Line Companion) but rather gate context and how
the information moves. You are not teaching students the structure of the reading itself,
but a linguistic skill that moves the information while always stressing and repeating
Type, Strategy, Authority and Profile within your Chart Type synthesis. This, as Ra
remarked, sounds more complicated than it actually is.
Finally, about repetition: the example analysis was delivered in very intentionally
repetitive style and most of that has been just as intentionally retained. Repetition
logically reinforces the central message to the client and learning in the student --first,
through listening in class, and later, through repeated oral practice. One way or the other,
please make it your own.

Ra Uru Hu’s Example Analysis: The 27.1 and Monica Lewinsky
Figure 1.2: Monica Lewinsky
Where you start is where you left off in their education. Circuits, Circuit
Groups, and Channels. In this case, you will begin with the nature of the
Channel 27/50, what the keynote of Support is all about, what the Defense
Circuit is all about, and, how powerful it is as the heart and core of life. For
instance, the Defense Circuit brings in feelings and intelligence linked to our
reproductive capacity.
Then go at the gate at another level. How do you take the gate and line out of
being isolated as a piece of information and turn it into a part of continuity of
the whole? The Line stands alone unless you have a way of integrating it, and
when it stands alone you have the assumption that it is everything and it’s not.
A terrible line is just an aspect within a configuration. It’s not you. Let’s read
the line.

27.1: Selfishness The ego-driven first law of caring for oneself which is not
necessarily at the expense of others. The power to care for
oneself first.
Envy and its attendant misfortunes. The power of selfishness
that is manifested through envy.
What you are really saying to students is, don’t give me the line reading. Tell
me how the 27.1 works in this design.
Establish Context with Students using Q & A
Where does a Gate come from? From a Center. Which Center does this gate
come from? The Sacral. How does the Sacral operate? By response. Therefore
this gate in this chart operates correctly in response.
The only thing that matters in a Generator’s chart is to tell them that what is
correct for them comes out of response. So here, what is correct to say is,
“you don’t know how to care for yourself in response. If you honored your
Strategy, you would be correctly selfish.” All I am trying to show is that the
gate needs to be integrated into the overall view. More than that, since this is a
first line in a 5/1, “You don’t even know what you should be selfish about
until you deeply investigate and discover what deserves caring. You don’t
know anything about this yet. It is impossible for you to figure out on your
own how to be correctly selfish because you have absolutely no access to
this.”
In this chart, selfishness is conditioned by Type, Profile, and Definition. After
all, this is a living adjective in a dense primary Definition field and a very,
very complex aspect of the Split. What a circus, what a life force in this girl!
Look at all this Definition: Synthesis, Determination, Discovery, Exploration
of Form, Acceptance. If you look at all the definition without the Split-off
17/62 you can see that the 27 is a living adjectival influence, and that
everything this being is doing is being conditioned by the demand for
selfishness that is there; therefore you better follow your Strategy and inner
Authority, because otherwise you will never be correctly selfish.
In practice, this is the whole point and the practice is easier than the theory.
No matter what aspect you see, you have to be able to see it and pull it into
everything else. For instance, dealing with this 49th Gate is a real dilemma:
how difficult it is to have a weak Emotional System! There is only one gate
coming out of this one and its only definition is unconscious in the way it
enters into emotional system. It doesn’t matter that it’s part of a full Channel.

At the Not-Self level, this person has no access whatsoever to that, and on top
of that, this is the Channel of Being Sensitive. So she is sensitive to touch, and
always looking for the best resources through flirtation, but has no conscious
connection at all to this sensitive, needy emotionality of hers or to its wave.
This girl spends most of her time being upset but doesn’t know why. Take a
lot of time using ABC’s and RC level information and show them how they
weave this into a design.
Once you have laid out an overview you must go to other places in the design
and reinforce what that overview tells you. It’s not enough to just lay out
surface, i.e. that is that she is an Emotionally Defined Generator with an open
Ego. You don’t need to read every single line, but go to those places you
already know are an obvious dilemma. You always need to pay attention to
the gate activations of the Cross configuration in your class examples because
this helps students to understand how a specific quality of a gate can influence
the overall dynamic of a Cross, and how when it gets integrated into the
vehicle it has a very specific interpretation.
In this case, the Design Sun in the 27 doesn’t have enormous power because
it’s not operating in the Definition field like the 34 and 29, but her fulfillment
of purpose requires that those Definitions be able to operate correctly;
otherwise caring doesn’t work correctly, and she is never going to be selfish
the way she could be. The 55.6 tells us that selfishness is the foundation of
caring. But this is not selfishness that is here to hurt anyone. Rather,
selfishness that says, “When I can give you I will.” Not, “I can give you but I
will not.”
There is a natural tendency for students to say what the Gate is: nourishment
and caring. Good for you. So what does it mean in the configuration of a chart
relative to what the chart is about? If you can’t articulate that, you don’t
actually know what the gate is. No gate operates in isolation: It can’t; never
will. The other thing for them to see is that the way they will describe a gate
will vary. With an undefined Sacral an entirely different configuration
immediately jumps in and that will further vary depending on whether you are
reading a Projector or a Manifestor or Reflector.
Any understanding of any aspect has to be integrated in to the whole and then
you must demonstrate to them how to get there.

Associate with 236 Keynotes
By this point your student is becoming lost and desperately needs context. So
bring the class back to the 236: ‘don’t tell me about the hexagram. Tell me the
236 of this; is it conscious or unconscious, and what does that means? What
does it mean to care for and be selfish unconsciously? Do you understand
that? This is in a Defense Circuit, part of the Tribal Circuit Group, and has the
keynote of Support. That means it has to be supported and to support
unconsciously. Then take them to Line as a formula: the First Line formula is
investigation and introspection. Then, to whether the Center is defined or not.
And then whether it is a hanging gate in an open Center or a gate that is part
of a defined Center, and correlate to the line value, and from there to Type,
Authority, and Profile. That is how they have to understand a Gate. It has to
develop in a chain of association generated out of an overview.
This is a Split Definition, Emotional Generator who is responding over time,
playing hard to get, always thinking about things that don’t matter and always
trying to improve herself. She has problems with her thyroid and metabolism
due to the mental split. As a 5/1, her investigation skills are unconscious. She
is paranoid on the surface. You take that and go back down to that gate level
from there.
Some people have a natural gift for synthesis while for many others this will
appear on the surface to be frightening. However, the synthesis is not really so
far away from the actual gate itself. You need them to go from that. Take the
theme of that 27th Gate. It is only operating correctly if it is operating through
the Emotional Sacral combination. Very practical and difficult for them to
look after another-- even if they are looking after themselves--because they
are suspicious of what other people want from them. There are additional
levels you can keep on layering using the gate as overview, and you can do
that with any gate in the design. My technique in a reading is no matter where
I go in the reading I always bring it back to the overview.
The chart Sun is in the 56th Gate so you put that up. This line is all about
attracting attention: Unusualness, innovation, and sometimes genius as
guarantees of eventually attracting attention and support. Stimulation at its
most innovative and unusual. And the detriment: All too often the tendency to
attract attention that is self-defeating in its effects. The power of stimulation to
provoke and disturb. Imagine having to live your whole life as someone who
is famous for a blowjob. Just imagine going into history books for that. The
56 is a metamorphic Gate; it believes or not. These people will believe or not
believe in their capacity to attract. Either others believe in them or not and

they are great storytellers. For example,” You won’t believe what happened to
me at the White House today. You just won’t believe it.”
What we are dealing with in this 56 is that it can’t actually do anything, and
this cut off mind is not an inner Authority and has no right to make decisions.
So you tell the client, “The fact that you are able to attract attention and tell
people stories is not something you should ever initiate in your life. The only
way the throat is going to operate correctly and your Sun is really going to
shine is if you only speak in response. Don’t stand up and volunteer what
happened to you! Everything about the fifth line personality is that if you
disappoint people your reputation is destroyed. If you don’t deliver, people
will say terrible things about you.”
Monica Lewinsky’s reputation was smashed. It wasn’t very practical to attract
attention that way. That was stimulation that provoked and disturbed. This is
someone who didn’t operate correctly and fives carry scars that don’t go
away. In this global age, if you are a Heretic and mess up, it is all over the
news. The video clip of Monica being kissed on the cheek by Clinton on some
line outside the White House was shown on TV about a million times: the
Not-Self culture loves to see a good witch burn.
What gets punished is the reputation, and this Sun is in a gate that likes to
shoot of its mouth about things that may or may not be true. The 56 is here
and the 27 is there. The only way you can give to the other is if you are selfish
and if you are correct in the way you respond. The fact is, the only way this
being can attract attention they deserve and is correct, is if they are selfish,
and it is correct. Every gate in the chart feeds into this: the 15th Gate cannot be
in the flow unless it has responded and the 58th cannot be joyous and the 45h
cannot attract like forces. It cannot initiate gathering together. It can only
respond to. And it goes on and on and on: every single chart aspect brought
back to the same place. As long as your students begin to understand what
they look at it in Human Design they can bring it back to a central theme and
it doesn’t matter what chart you show them or where they or you start, they
will never start in the wrong place and will always start in relationship to
overview. It is a framework.
You Are Not Teaching How to do a Reading - You Are Teaching Linguistic
Ability
We are not teaching them how to do a reading; we are teaching linguistic
ability to describe continuity from any level in the chart. That is all you need
as a tool. You start with a synthetic image and keep on going to different

places in the detail and the overview and bring them back up to this whole
flow.
At the moment, you are not interested in looking at Not-Self. We will
establish actual reading framework and the Not-Self in Keynoting. This is just
a linguistic chain that serves as a guideline for opening up the Reading. You
are just beginning the process of showing them how everything in the
Bodygraph is related. This is one of the most difficult stages. It’s like
someone who is just learning to play chess: they learn one move at a time, and
slowly, they learn that there are lots of other moves to be made. Your concern
at this moment is expression: how well an Analyst can describe what they see.
The moment a student can take that track and follow it anywhere is the
moment they are going to be confident about their ability to explain a gate,
not just read it. So they can see how this works.
In this case: “It is so important for you to look after yourself, and you never
have, because you haven’t had access to this. This is a Gate of Caring. You
have to know how to care for yourself first, but you don’t know how because
you aren’t connected to that. You are never thinking, “I know how to take
care of myself first.” See this 29th Gate? You would like to say yes to a lot of
things and jump into them without understanding how important it is for you
to look after yourself, and you will only really care for yourself when you stop
initiating and respond. In this life you are here to respond. This gate is a
responding gate. You only know how to care when you are responding.
”And see this over here, this is an Emotional Center and you don’t have a
dependable contact to that either, and unless you sit back and wait you are
never going to learn how to care for yourself and get the resources you need
in your sensitivity.”
I did practically nothing with describing that gate except use the word caring
in context. This is only an aspect of who this being is and will only act
correctly if the being operates correctly and that whole story.
And you can do this even if you start over here in the 27th Gate: which doesn’t
mean anything, frankly.
If I were analyzing this chart, I would start with the Sacral Emotional System.
Then go to her open Ego, then the Split Head and then the Gates. Visually,
that’s the way I would see what is essential and be able to talk about that. But
to be able to talk about any aspect of the chart, I look at it in context of the
whole.

Note to Teachers
In this course, you will be assigning 10 minute MP3 Homework Assignments
for students to practice this technique. Please keep in mind that what you are
practicing here (RAM) is not an Overview Reading or a Reading at all; it is a
linguistic ability that will eventually evolve into the capacity to give a reading.
However, at this point in the course, the students’ assignment is simply to
describe charts to learn the technical language and to train them to see every
aspect of the Rave in context and then describe it.
RAM PTL 1 Homework Assignment: ten minutes describing a chart using
Gates in Streams. Not done by professionals for clients.
Overview Reading: Brief reading that Keynotes a chart without using technical
language. A Professional Reading done by an Analyst for a client.
Repetition and “The Question”
By now my client has heard twelve or fourteen times, “You are an Emotional
Generator, you have to wait for the moment so you can see it clearly- wait and
play hard to get. So by the end of the Reading, what they remember is what
you have hammered into them, the surface, you are an Emotional Generator,
get it. That is what you are doing. And when you are giving to your Analysts
this gift, you are not going to give a mind numbing, useless, meandering Line-
driven Reading again. You have the privilege of not having to do the
groundwork or deep description because it already exists. You are not here to
do my original teaching. That is in the books.
No gate stands on its own outside the context. The only thing you need to tell
people takes about five minutes, so make it last forty five to make the price
reasonable, then keep on returning to the main point every five minutes, and
then when you mention these gates, they know what the point is. The moment
that you mention that selfishness and integrate it into the whole you are
answering the question they came in with, which is—“What can I do to make
my life better?“ Well you see this thing over here that you hate about
yourself? Well it will be ok if you operate correctly. At any time, you can take
any aspect and weave it back into the whole, which is why we have a
universal principle of Strategy. It covers all of this. That is why we say,
“Wait.”
Hopefully what they are having is a real transformation and you can only add
to that through repetition. Over and over and over again. Humans only learn
through logical repetition. Over and over and over and over again on the long

road to perfection. You cannot imagine how confident they get and how
comfortable that is. Every time you do that your client nods. You have no idea
how magical it is to take a Gate out of its cold theoretical value and integrate
it into someone’s design.
This is the only way that the Reading can do what is there to do, and that is to
answer a question. Whether they know it or not.
Note on the Dynamics of the MP3 Assignment
It is not uncommon for students to be extremely anxious about making and delivering
their initial MP3 assignments for review. Unless they have performance backgrounds or
experience recording sessions from other disciplines (and maybe even then), it can take
time, repetition and patience on everyone’s part before they relax enough with
themselves and with each other, to actually “risk” interpreting or describing a chart.
Be prepared for Not-Self dynamics to emerge in both the assignments and the class itself.
At the beginning the course, consider encouraging students who are considering
becoming Analysts to begin making their own sound file recordings (at their Rave
Cartography level of competence in chart description) in the class break between RC and
PTL 1 to prepare. We also very strongly suggest you assign several 10 minute MP3
assignments a month, or even weekly assignments (although you only need to listen to
and review one of these) in at least the first couple of months of class to reduce pressure
on the anticipated success or failure of any one assignment and accelerate their comfort
with their own and each other’s process.
Practice and Play: Practice the Rave Analysis Method. Pull out more Charts and have
students practice this technique: for instance, tell me about this person, but start with their
activated 11th Gate. Out of that, go into their design.
Suggested Enrichment Module for Weekend Two: Vocal Delivery and Breath work.
Have an expert in, or see page 110.
Everything is part of the process interconnected in the illusion of the
whole and every Analysis has to relate to the whole. This is the only way
the Analyst gets to reinforce the essential thing that the Reading is always
there to do: to answer the question they came in with. And whatever the
question is, the answer is, follow your Strategy and your Authority and
the rest is a synthesis that reinforces this.

If there is still time, review ABC’s and RC content, focusing on synthesis skills
and eventually beginning to demonstrate how to go deeper, to the Gate level.
Demonstrate with an example Chart from your set. There is a detailed series of
Q&A exercises to review ABC’s and RC material, including Gate and Channel
Keynotes, in the Rave Cartography Manual and we recommend repeating that set
of exercises here.
Other suggested review/foundation topics for Weekend One:
If you have new students, check in with them to see if their educational level
meshes with your continuing students’ level
Generally establish the foundation for a year of hard work on all three main
levels: Tribal (technical and personal support), Collective (sharing experiences
and experiments) and Individual (allowing unique contribution).
Give homework exercises designed to review the ABC’s and RC (there is a good
series given in Q&A format in the Rave Cartography Teacher’s Manual).
MP3 Assignment #1: recorded ten-minute analysis of the same baseline chart,
which will be shared the following month in class as a baseline Reading. This is a
mandatory first month MP3 assignment.
Assigned Reading: whatever you choose to reinforce the content of this class or
establish the foundation of the next one. This can also include other assignments
that augment the MP3 assignment. Continue to assign reading as appropriate in
following months.
During the break
During the month break, contact each student individually by e-mail to see if
electronic contact is working correctly. Also set up a meeting online for everyone
to gather at to practice with the medium and test technical issues.

APPENDIX TO CHAPTER ONE
The MP3 Assignment, First Line Themes and the Arc of Student
Skill Development
You and Your Students’ Development
As adults, our parents still treat us like kids and we resent them for not
acknowledging our development because we are always waiting to see who
we have become through their eyes. Students have similar needs. As they
move along in this course, part of your role will be to acknowledge their
increasing depth of and skill with the knowledge through how you relate to
them. For many years I taught young people between the ages of 12 and 16,
and part of what I learned was that the recognition of advancement or
development, even if it was simply a matter of tone, made an enormous
difference in spirit.
Study is an insecure, first line business: filled with all kinds of fears. You
only have to mention to your students that there will be a test to see their
adrenaline move. Whenever we go to school we run the risk of failing. There
is inherently a lot of pressure on your students. Most teachers are so wrapped
up in their own ego dilemma of whether or not they are good at what they do
that they often forget to take into account how important it is to the teaching
process to transform their relationship with their developing student to match
their level of accomplishment as they develop.
When I first meet someone in Design I treat that person with a certain
distance. And my physical attitude is, “you are too fucked up to get close to
me because I really don’t want to get contaminated. “ As I observe that person
go through a process, my attitude toward them changes to the point where
with certain students I can’t even be their teacher any more. So instead I
become a sort of Design conversationalist. The moment you enter into that
kind of relationship with a student, the physical aura changes. In fact, the aura
changes first. Going through this process is what PTL 1 is all about. This is
where your students will either drop out competent or go all the way to
becoming a professional.
By the time you reach the Keynoting module that closes the course, you will
have watched the psychological progress of students over three levels of
instruction and therefore will have achieved a lot of depth with them.

Student Fear: First Line Themes and How to Address Them
So many things are going to test student fear. First there is the audio work,
which includes the fear of technical skill and also of having their words frozen
in time. Any Analyst who has been an Analyst for a while would like to
gather up some of his or her early readings with a cosmic vacuum cleaner, but
the truth is that all your readings are forever frozen in time. When you give
somebody their reading it is their companion for most of their life: even the
ones who totally reject everything you did will pull their tape or CD out five
years later.
As sophisticated and as big a field as this level is, part of your attitude must be
to push students to the point where they either quit or make it. We don’t want
people out there who cannot with confidence be frozen in time. This is just
part of the age we live in. The only reason we don’t know Jesus’ bad lines is
because there was no such a thing as recording equipment back then. We live
in a different age. Your students must see that everything they deliver gets
frozen, so make sure you are not afraid to supervise that process and deal with
their fear.
The first test is the moment when you give them their first project: this is a lot
of pressure for them. They have to send it to you, they can’t take it back and
they can’t fix it. So you really have to want to do the job to take the class and
this assignment is the beginning of the process of discerning who deserves a
transformation of our attitude toward them.
As a teacher, until you reach the Keynoting section, there is a part of you that
will step down to help the lowest common denominator in your students come
up to Level. But when you get to Keynoting you will no longer so much be
teaching as giving guides and guidelines and throwing in a little teaching here
and there, mostly to add color. What is Keynoting after all but everything we
have been teaching them about context: the whole movement of context, the
gateway as a frame, and to understand that can be seen through
context—Centers, Circuits, Type, Strategy, Authority or Profile.
At this point the student knows how to move the information from any point
to the larger whole. They know all Keynote formulas although they may not
remember them all, but that’s not the point. They will have support at home to
prepare. However, by this time the ones who are still having difficulty with
expressing themselves and working within context should be pointed toward
other areas that may be of value in Design but not toward a professional life
as an Analyst such as Research or General Education.

Audio Assignments: Coaching and Evaluation
There is one more responsibility as a PTL 1 Instructor that you don’t assume
at any other level: judging student audio material, grading it, and advising on
reading and presentation styles.
Teach the foundation for developing audio style and presentation and
remember students are never given any assignment more than ten minutes
long; so, in this module, your job is mostly to teach them to compress and to
be more concise and accurate in pulling all the lines together.
When they go on to Professional Levels 2 and 3, they will go back to just
being in class and receiving information. Those levels are “just teaching,” and
do not focus on skill development. By the time they leave PTL 1, your
students will be chomping at the bit for this. They will have reached a stage
where they have mastered producing their short audios and pulling out a
synthesis and the only thing that is missing is training in Partnership and basic
Transits. But by then your attitude becomes totally different—these are soon-
to-be colleagues. You already accept as fact that they have the basic
equipment to do a reading and you are simply going to enrich their process.
The reason I put so much emphasis on PTL 1 is that it occupies the center of
the educational sequence. The Rave ABC’s and Rave Cartography supply
simple surface competence and PTL 2 and 3 fill in finishing information about
planets and Crosses, but only this level focuses on analytic skill. Therefore, so
often the success of this course will depend on the kind of guest speakers that
can be provided to help people with certain aspects of the analytic process:
exactly what it means and what it takes to sit down beside somebody and
reveal them. And, also, what you as an Analyst take into your system and how
the person sitting beside you is conditioning the kind of reading you are going
to give and how if you are not careful they will get what they want to have
and not what you want to give them.
If you are well rehearsed and a firecracker goes off while you are singing,
you don’t break a note. You stay on automatic pilot. PTL 1 is about training
the rote system. The more recordings your students do and the more clearly
you reflect in your attitude that they are improving, the better. What they are
doing takes courage.

The Analyst Selection Process
This also is the only level where people will quit in the middle. By the time
we get this far in the process you will see you have a stable core of students,
and you will also have those students who will fall apart under pressure. You
need to see it’s ok if some students fall apart and must leave the training
sequence, and that their experience can still be a very important one to get out
of the way because their Not Self brought them to class and discovering that
being an Analyst is not really what it’s all about for them is actually an
essential part of their process. In this particular class setting, you will have
access to a level of honesty and clarity you don’t have available in other
situations, and it will be quite clear to you who is having problems and the
avenue will exist for you to address that.
The flip side of the coin is someone who loves the work and is happy to do
recordings that are awful. They can be awful for many reasons. Not everyone
sounds good as a voice or can speak and articulate their thoughts clearly.
Some people have the sort of physical presence that is better suited to online
interaction. Others are just too shy or sensitive or tentative to sit regularly
with individual clients in this role. These people will do best on-line or in
research positions. Therefore, The PTL 1 Teacher carries a deeper burden
than any other, not so much because she or he will throw anyone out, but
because she or he will tell the truth. So please direct your students accordingly
if and when necessary.

of Circuits, including Channel and Gates, to refer to as you teach Gates in Context and
also reference materials for Streams. These are your locally available overview “maps”
for the surface level and layers of the Chart at this Gate level. We continue to use the
classic Human Design system teaching order. This chapter presents Individuality, the
Power Column and Formats, along with Stream and Circuit reference. The following two
chapters address The Collective and The Tribe respectively in Context, and also present
alternative methods for framing Gates (by Circuit, in this case the Ego Circuit, and also

by Center, in this case the Channels of the Head and Ajna with those two Centers as the
frame) as Ra Uru Hu demonstrates variations on his own classic order. You are not
required to use either of these orders. You can start anywhere in the Bodygraph you want
to as long as you teach the material and cover all the Streams and other areas of the Chart
in context. As Ra Uru Hu mentions below, a Center is in many respects like a subway
station and the Gates are just places in the journey between Centers. So, to extend the
metaphor, you can start at any subway station you want as long as you travel along the
line (or lines) that leaves from there, i.e. Gates, Channels, Streams in Bodygraph structure
and make sure you ride the whole system. Of course, you can supplement these materials
with other available materials.
Suggested Order and Pacing for Teaching Gates and Lines in Context
Again, the order below begins with the Integration Channel and Circuits of Individuality
by Streams and continues through the Collective and the Tribe. It provides prompts for
you in the form of short phrases, mechanical illustrations, and substantial Stream,
Channel, and Gate reference (both Keynotes and visual illustration) for your use in this
order
You have three months of class sessions to teach your students the surface layer of the 64
Gates in context. You do not need to give every single Gate the same amount of attention.
Sometimes you may wish to focus on one or two Gates in the Stream in context and
remember that the detail of the Gate and Line is not taught until Sequence II Weekends 5-
10, (64 Gates and 384 Lines). Students can complete their study of Gates to which you
might give less attention throughout the class reading and in class practice. Simply teach
the surface of the Gate in Bodygraph context as outlined below, and in the following two
chapters.
Option of Using Rave I Ching as Reference at a Surface Level
Rave I Ching Format (the content of the graphic layout of each Gate in the Rave I Ching
Book) is taught in Weekend Five/Month Five, which begins Sequence II. You have the
option of presenting what is needed, in terms of surface Gate level keynoting (i.e., the
traditional Hexagram name, The Clinging Fire, as a surface Keynote for the 30th Gate and
context for the experiential Stream) here or at any point during the Gates section. Ra uses
the technique of discovering a Gate through the traditional Hexagram name in the
example below.

Summary Guidelines for Teaching Gates in Context
For your convenience, these guidelines distill the RAM technique for teaching the Gates:
• Teach Context as a mechanical method that can be practiced irrespective of
specific Gate content. (In the example, Ra demonstrates the method using the
Root Center.) Focus on this technique and reinforce it as a straightforward
mechanic as you move through the Bodygraph. Along with the Stream,
Circuit, and Center, also contextualize with Mirror Circuitry, and 236
Keynotes.
• Use two levels of illustration (mechanical illustration of the Stream or other
frame itself and live example Charts) so students can always see the layers
surrounding the content
• Stress Circuits.
• Emphasize the moving nature of the Bodygraph (and the Human Design
System as a whole); i.e. the Gate is just a frame in space through which
information moves.
• Do not teach any Gate in further depth until you reach Sequence II (Month 5).
Teach Gates in Context only. Teach Context as a mechanical technique that
any student can use to extract the sense of a Gate without getting into the
depth or detail of any one Gate individually and to train students in the habit
of always being aware of the full Bodygraph and how it moves.
• Whenever possible, always balance and contextualize a Stream with its mirror
(i.e. Experiential pressure with Logical pressure as in the example). Mirror
Circuitry exercises for oral practice are provided.
• Reinforce the depth of the material with other previously acquired skills, such
as 236 Keynotes, and the Four Views. Use Q&A to reinforce the depth and
enhance student memorization skills. Always synthesize your analysis back to
Strategy, Type, and Authority.
• Include plenty of oral Practice and Play.

Levels of Depth of the Bodygraph (to the Line Level)
To teach (and be a student of) PTL 1, it can be useful to visualize not only the surface but
also the levels of depth in the Bodygraph to the Line level:
• Surface (Rave ABC’s)
• Entering Below the Surface (Rave Cartography)
• Gate in Center Context Reinforced by ABC and RC Keynotes (PTL Sequence
I)
• Line in Gate Context Reinforced by ABC, RC, and PTL Sequence 1 Keynotes
(PTL Sequence II)
• Keynoting, integrating all of the above (PTL 1 Sequence III).
Technique Demonstration with Instruction
Below, Ra Uru Hu’s demonstration of the technique in October 2004, with our notes,
describing the technique, and highlighting specific elements when necessary. It begins
with teaching students Context as a technique using mechanical illustration (the core
principle of RAM) and then moves on to address the Gates of the Stream of Feeling (also
known as the Human Experiential Way) using a live example chart.
Begin by Teaching Context as a Mechanical Technique
Students should be able to determine the quality of any Gate in a live Chart through its
framing and the layers around it. This framing begins with the Center and the quality of
the Gate’s specific activation in that (i.e., conscious or unconscious out of a defined or
open Center for any given Gate). The formula is mechanical. The specifics are in the
example below, which uses the Root Center:
The Root Center carries nine different pressures. When I teach, my questions
tend to be rhetorical, but you can actually ask your students questions. So,
what is the Root Center? What does it do? Don’t be blasé about it. The
associations are simple but they are powerful and your students have probably
never thought about them quite this way before you teach them. For instance,
every single one of those Gates coming out of the Root Center is a powerful

P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D T W O
pressure valve. Everybody knows that if you don’t allow the pressure in that
value to release it builds up and can be very uncomfortable and explode. So a
gate in the Root Center has a certain value. What is the value? Ask your
students: what is the difference if the Center defined or undefined?
Every Center has a generic value that is a binary: active or dormant. If the
Center is defined, it is a fixed, consistent way of being pressurized. You never
really know it other than as an annoyance and don’t want anyone to try and
change it because it’s you. Fixed pressure people aren’t easily placed under
pressure. Instead, they are under consistent pressure to respond or be Splenic
or Emotional.
A dormant Center is dormant; it isn’t “nothing.” It’s just that nothing is going
on in it, and isn’t working, and there is no pressure, until something makes it
not dormant. Think about what it is to have a pressure gate in a dormant
Center. When that gate gets pressurized, it doesn’t just get pressurized, it
amplifies, so it is going to take in as an experience even more pressure, and
because it’s not its own familiar reliable personal pressure, it is going to want
to get rid of it.
Therefore, you can also have a hanging active or dormant gate.
Centers have a generic value that is a binary. They are either active
(defined) or dormant (open). It is never accurate to say, “I don’t have
anything there.”
Sometimes people with open Centers say they don’t “have anything” there.
But if a Center is open, that doesn’t mean that it is ”not anything.” It means it
is dormant. A dormant Center is constantly polluted and amplifies when
activated. Because this is unnatural and uncomfortable, when activated, a
dormant Root Center has a need to get rid of the pressure.
A Center’s value is generic and binary in that it defined or not. And every
Center has its unique quality. In this case, the quality is the adrenaline system
and the language of pressure as a generic term. We have looked and seen that
if there is a Gate it will operate differently depending on whether it is defined
or not. What you are doing in essence, is introducing the language of
differentiation: active or dormant, and the specific quality of being
adrenalized.

Next, ask your students, is the gate conscious or unconscious? Weave in the
ABC’s Keynotes as a logical pattern that you are reinforcing. If the gate is
conscious and the Center is active: you are going to be able to describe the
fixed quality of their nature where the client is being consistently pressurized,
and the client will nod their head in response, because that’s who they think
they are.
If it is Conscious and dormant (because the Center is open), the Gate is
consistently placed under pressure as soon as it is defined. If it is unconscious
and active: the Gate is a consistent force pushing you with which you are not
identified.
Gates can be conscious or unconscious out of an active Center or
conscious or unconscious out of a dormant Center. Each type of activation
has a different value.
An unconscious and dormant gate is really uncomfortable; because when it is
placed under pressure you don’t really know it. An active pressure gate in a
defined Root Center always operates at the same steady speed; whereas an
active gate in an open Center does not. Therefore, people with an active gate
in an open Root Center are people who always drive as fast as possible.
So we haven‘t even gotten to the actual gate yet, we are still layering things.
Don’t just jump into the gate. Ask what is the Center framework? That is the
point. The only thing that makes one gate different from another is where it
comes from. Not only is the gate part of a larger generic, which we call a
Center, but also has very specific biological functions. Everything you are
giving them at this level is taking all this information and giving them ways to
structure their perception of any gate at all so they never just look at it its
number and name in isolation. This way, students don’t even need to know
the name of the gate right away. They understand that Center and condition of
that gate sets a framework, and when they get the name of the gate they go
”Uh huh, that fits.”
There is an enormous pressure there in that 41st Gate, the start codon, the
source of the Human Experiential Way, and before you can talk about feelings
and what it means to emotionally sense and experience things, you have to
frame the Center so students can see it in a way that allows them to give it real
respect.

I am starting with the Root because it is really ignored and you ignore it at
great risk. With my own open Root, I really understand the power and the
necessity of the Root to drive all life formats.
The Splenic system and the perfection of the Logic system are entirely
dependent on the Root. The fact that the Spleen has an unusual interface with
the Sacral doesn’t mean that the Sacral is feeding the Spleen. The Sacral
doesn’t do that at all. The natural flow of the 34th Gate is to the 20th Gate. The
Spleen gets a lot from the 57, but without the Root, we have a collapsed
adrenal system and no intelligence.
What we are really teaching is Centers, Streams, Circuits and Channels with
the Gate as a focus point. Because when you get to the Lines, you are trapped
in the gates, and then the gate becomes lines, and then the line is an allusion to
Color, etc. The gate is a generic portal. That is all. Don’t get lost in the gate
information as a surface.
An active pressure Gate in a definition field operates at a steady speed. But
this Gate in an open Center is not a steady speed. This Center when dormant
has absolutely no movement, it is at a stand still: Keeping Still Mountain.
Nothing. And then, all of a sudden, super speed. One minute inching along,
and, in the next flash, running 8 million miles an hour. People with open Root
Centers under pressure are people who drive way too fast.
See the gate as a subway station. People get more interested in the track
without understanding that it is the station that tells the story and everything
else is a nuance. I can lump every Sacral Gate into the term Availability. This
theme is the heart and core of the Sacral and the best word in the Maya to
describe the Sacral being. Available. And unless you understand that, you will
not understand the Sacral. The gates and lines are just nuances of availability.
This is life, not just some kind of abstract or logical pinpointing on a black
board; and life is complex. Nothing stands on its own, and nothing within us
can be isolated on its own and always has to be seen in context. It’s the
Instructor’s role to be able to establish the context. You can read what a gate
is, but you have to understand the context before you get to the nuance so you
don’t take it out of context. This is what people often do when they get to
Design; take gates out of context.

Every Awareness Center includes three Streams of Awareness. Each of these Streams
belongs to a different Circuit.
Every Stream consists of a Fuel Gate (coming from a Pressure Center), then moves on to
Potential and Possibility, both of which come are Gates in Awareness Centers.
The final Gate in the Stream is its Expression. In most cases, Expression Gates are
located in the Throat Center. The exception is the Ego Circuit, where expression takes
place in the Heart Center.

Example Chart: Monica Lewinsky
Figure 2.7: Monica Lewinsky
Example: The Stream of Intuition empowers Intuition. This leads to knowing
whether you have the fuel to struggle (38). This fuel energizes the potential of
Awareness about what to struggle for (28). This awareness leads to the possibility
of struggling for clarity (57) and then to express clarity (or not) by saying, “I
know I am now”.
In Monica Lewinsky’s chart, the fuel to struggle and the potential of Awareness
about what to struggle for is unconscious, so she has no access to that. The
possibility of struggling for clarity is conscious and therefore she knows it well.
But it is not possible for her to express what she is struggling for; she needs others
around her to be able to express that.

Class Q&A Exercise for the Knowing Circuit
The Knowing Circuit
Q1: What is distinctive about this Circuit in terms of its Center
involvement?
A: It involves every Awareness Center and the Now is the important
time frame.
Q2: Which sense is correlated with this Circuit?
A: acoustic/ears
Q3: How many Symmetries does this Circuit contain?
A: Three
Q4: What are they, and what about them makes them symmetrical?
A: The Symmetries of the Knowing Circuit can be found in its
Streams: Emoting, Knowing, and Intuition: Emoting /Intuition;
Knowing/ Intuition, Emoting/Knowing.
Q5: Describe the Gates and Channels of the Knowing Circuit in view of
the symmetries
A: (one example that can be used as a template for every other Gate)
The 38th Gate is the Gate of the Fighter, and the 39th Gate is the
Gate of Provocation: fighting is provoking. The 61st Gate is the
Gate of Inner Truth: wanting to know inner truth is provocative
and can lead to a fight for knowledge.
Teacher Reminder: Acknowledge student development through change in your attitude
when appropriate.
Monthly MP3 Assignment: ten minute chart description using top down or mirror
Stream skills (or both). This is a suggested assignment.
Reminder: “Top Down” means describing the chart from the surface of the Bodygraph
(i.e. Type, Strategy, Definition) and synthesizing down to the Gate level (i.e., stopping at
Definition on the way).

Tip for Symmetry Assignments: students can get confused about the layers of
symmetry in a specific Rave Chart.
For some students, it can help to give a technical assignment in which students only
describe the symmetry, if any, in activated Gates or Channel in any given individual chart
to learn and practice the mirror symmetry context of Streams.
However, it is also fine to work creatively where any Gate is described with a descriptive
base that includes the Keynotes of its mirror gate in the Bodygraph, whether or not the
mirror gate is activated, to enrich context.
Some students may need to practice both of these options in class and/or as an MP3
Assignment. Also be prepared for questions about this in class.
The short answer is, always look to the opposite gate (in the Bodygraph) when
interpreting. It’s that simple.
Option: Enrich comprehension and assimilation by assigning other exercises, perhaps
according to Type, Profile, Definition, or Circuit learning styles, as preparation for the
MP3 analysis. See assignment section for more ideas on this. This approach can be
implemented at any point during the course.

The Gates of the Experiential Stream in Context Using Q&A Technique
Once you frame the Channel and the Center, describe the Gates within this
context. For instance: The 41st Gate is the Gate of fantasy and the start Codon.
The Experiential Stream consists of the 41st, 30th, 36th and 35th Gates. Going
to the next layer, take the 30th Gate. These are both part of the Abstract,
Sensing Circuit.
Q: What is this Stream?
A: It is the Stream of emotional Feeling in the Sensing Circuit.
Q: What is this Channel?

A: The ability to recognize a feeling.
Q: Which one recognizes the feeling, the 41 or the 30?
A: The 30. Feelings carry an inherent intelligence that is masked
by the motor. Motors mask feelings, so the 41 is the pressure
of fantasy, which cannot feel. The Experiential Way is the
most purely motor -dominated of all processes. It is the way
of human life.
Set the context of the Channel through its mirror the 18/58 (the energy to
logically judge). Recognition of feeling is an identical process, except we
judge or discern or identify a feeling instead of a logical pattern.
Unfortunately we have no language for this yet.
Tip: Again, observe the movement of the example Q and A. It moves from a description
of the Stream to its specific Keynotes: Channel, Gate, and Mirror Stream in order.
Framing a Gate Through Its Own Context
If you do not know the Gate well, start your presentation with an element of its context as
provided in the Rave I Ching.
For instance, the traditional name of the 30th is The Clinging Fire. So, ask
your students, what hot thing is being clung to?
This is the way emotional recognition works. Emotional recognition is
physical. The pressure of the 41 is to release the potential of feeling. It is in
many ways like all kinds of different colored threads streaming out of the 41st
Gate. The 30th Gate grabs and clings to one of them, to a thread of the flow.
Compare and Contrast through Mirror Circuitry and Other Channels in the Circuit

P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D T H R E E
Mirror your Stream with its symmetrical Stream (when possible)
The mirror of the 41/30 is the 18/58. This is the energy to logically judge.
Recognition of feelings is the emotional mirror of the same energy. It is
judging in that sense a feeling. Actually recognizing a feeling. Unfortunately
we have no language for this, because the motor remains the force, so the
feeling is masked. We call this Stream the Human Experiential Way, which is
the most purely motor dominated of all processes: The way of life.
The 18th Gate can only correct or challenge one thing at a time. Likewise the
30th Gate can only feel one thing at a time; it clings to one specific feeling and
feels its fire. The quality is like the quality of grabbing an ember out of the
fireplace, because the moment you grab onto that thread you have one of
those Fates up there in the 30th Gate holding out the scissors. For most
Abstract beings, all of life is one thread they cling to. The variations of this
can be found there in the context of the emotional system. We don’t yet have
a language for feelings. The possibilities of that language are in this Gate. The
62 and 56 are metamorphic Gates. The 62 is the language of the Maya and the
56 is about belief systems and still caught in the motor which drives it to
search, but at some point 56 Gate has within it the capacity to define the
language feeling, and we have no language for it.
We are talking about holding onto something that can really hurt us. The
18/58 represents a challenge that’s intended to hurt someone else: an
authority, a law, something chosen to be rightfully knocked down a peg. But
in the Abstract process the challenge is internal. The 30th Gate gives us an
illustration of the image of holding an ember that can actually hurt us, not
someone else. So in this case, the challenge becomes: How long do I
personally have to hold on to this burning ember? Because when you cling to
this thread you don’t know what the hell you are clinging to and have no idea
where it is going to lead.
Meanwhile, the 18 wants to knock you down and replace what you are doing
with something else that’s better. It is one step in a logical ordered pressure
where everything progresses in numbered steps and you can predict the future.
This is not the human way or experiential way; certainly not the emotional
way, which is that you do not know at any moment whether the string you are
holding onto the will be cut, frayed, turned into an electrical circuit, and fry
you. The mirror context provides all the information you need.

Profile as Frame
As you frame Gates you can also introduce things that will help students later
in their process, for instance, looking at these six lines, will add to
understanding or sense of what Profile is. The 30th Gate is the only Gate that
will give you philosophical advice. This is one of the great signpost Gates.
What’s important as we move along in life is to have signposts, and one of
those signposts is how you respond according to what your philosophy should
be according to the Fates. If you cannot match the line of your personality
with the line of the 30th Gate in your quality of response, then there is
something wrong. For instance, the 30.5 is Irony and the 5/1 is here to
respond to life ironically, because you never know what is going to happen.
As a 5/1 I am here to respond to life ironically.
Framing a Gate Through The Process of its Stream
You also can’t talk about the 30th Gate without talking about sex: this is one
of most sexually obsessed of all Gates. The 36th Gate is the one that actually
has to do the penetrating and it is convinced it can create metamorphosis, but
it is 30 that hungers. It will grab something and hold on to it regardless of
whether what it is holding on to is life or death, pain and suffering. The 35th
Gate at the end of the Stream is never satisfied in a logical context. But it is
deeply influenced and conditioned by its mirror logical framework in that
these people are supposed to take in the feeling, experience the feeling, and
then get rid of it which is a logical process. The whole Stream is a fuel gauge,
and the 41 always shows empty and the 35 always shows up full, but will
always empty out to get back to the 41 again. The whole Stream is a process
of intake and release.
The ideal experiential being is just chewing up experience and spitting it out
without holding on for a moment. But you also get people who hold onto the
Stream and can never let go of it and they really get burned. The context sets
the framework.

Unify Gates through Channel and Stream
The moment you have established the context, unify Gates through Channel
and Stream. Demonstrate how these two things have an attraction to each
other in this Channel and when they meet something else happens. Give the
general context of how that is all intended to flow by example.
For instance, when a conscious 30 meets an unconscious 41, the 30 is being
pressurized without knowing where that pressure is coming from. Then the
Center explodes into activity and amplifies. This is someone who can become
very, very, very obsessed. The conscious 30 is so caught on what it is holding
on to as a feeling, but can be conditioned to hold onto things that are not
necessarily right for it.
Meanwhile, The 41st Gate is laying out a fantasy spectrum. There is a limited
Line, Color, Tone, and Base structure within the infrastructure of the 41 and
therefore only one thread that will catch the attention of the 30 at the other
end. And that process becomes the foundation of the quantum in that Stream.
Relate back to Student Experience and Knowledge Base
Tip: Move back from the depth detail (the Stream) to the Simple Surface to orient and
ground students and synthesize the information.
Students don’t have to get lost. The point is to get them think in growing
circles of recognition. In many ways, this technique has little to do with the
central features of that Design. So now bring them back to it: how this
information relevant within the context of the being as a whole? How is their
Profile going to deal with an open emotional system with a hanging thirtieth
Gate?
In this case, the Chart is a 3/5. Who do they think they are? A 3.
What does that mean? They have a martyr complex.
So how will they avoid feeding that false desire that isn’t the right thread for

will have spent most of their life trying to pretend they are worthy by holding
on to a desire that they can never fulfill. The moment of enlightenment for me
for the Generator is the one of fearlessness in the face of not knowing. The

Again, don’t be worried about the pure Gate information.

this way, to never see something isolated from its context. You can’t imagine

Class Exercise For the Understanding and Sensing Circuits:
Ex 1: What is distinctive about these Circuits?
A: In the Collective Circuit Group every Awareness Center is
involved. Therefore, future and past are set as a “time frame.”
Also, all Collective Channels and Gates are inherently “social.”
Ex 2: What are the main differences between these two Circuits?
Answer:
Understanding Sensing
Future Past
Right eye Left eye
Starved of energy Has access to more energy (motors)
Splenic Authority Emotional Authority
Clarity in the now Clarity over time
Experimenting Experiencing
Repeating Do it once and move on
Focused Cyclic
Logic Abstract
Facts Stories
Ex 3: Which senses are connected to these Circuits?
A: Sight/eyes.
Ex 4: How many symmetries exist within and between these two Circuits
A: There are two symmetries within each Circuit, and two symmetries
between each Circuit.
Ex 5: Tell me what they are and describe them.
A: The Symmetries can be found each Circuit: Taste/ Understanding;
Feeling/Sensing. Within the Group, you can also see a distinct
symmetry between each Circuit which, again, is revealed by their
Streams: Taste/Feeling; Understanding/Sensing; there is also
symmetry of the Circuits within the Formats and the Power
Column.

Ex 6: Please describe the Gates and Channels in symmetry context.
A: (Example that can be used as a template for every other Gate or
Channel) the 18/58 is the Channel of Judgment; whereas 41/30 is
Emotional Judgment. 41 is the pressure for a new experience, and
58 the pressure to experiment (i.e., do something new in a logical
context) so that patterns can be corrected.
Data Collection Habits
A reminder to please first instruct your students, and then train them, in good data
collection habits, beginning somewhere in Sequence I of this course (its advisable to do
so at the ABC’s and Rave Cartography Level also, but essential here when training pre-
professionals). These habits include careful data entry and verification, sources for
finding good example chart data, and the danger of using noon charts (i.e. charts with no
given time). Using your own examples, demonstrate to them how the Rave can
occasionally change Type very dramatically over a few minutes time. Show them how
example birth data can change even when carefully researched, so it’s a good idea to keep
up with professional sources in this area.
Common data errors include but are not limited to switching AM for PM, using the
current year or time instead of the actual year or time (i.e. forgetting to enter the correct
year and just running the chart using the current year), errors that occur while you enter
in chart data while multi tasking, using a friend or colleagues inadvertently inaccurate
data without verifying it independently, not confirming data you find on the internet with
one or two additional references (just because someone else is using it on the internet or
has loaded it into an online database doesn’t mean its accurate—even the best-maintained
databases contain inadvertent errors that are routinely rectified as discovered).
Everyone makes a data error occasionally. Show your students what they are, and how to
correct them. Consider making one yourself on purpose and then correcting in class as an
example.
MP3 Assignment: (suggested) ten minute Analysis using especially mirroring Stream
skills with both Circuits, for instance, doing a chart comparing Streams like Taste and
Feeling. Or stage this assignment out with the two suggested in the previous chapter
where Streams are introduced.
Option: Enrich comprehension and assimilation by assigning other exercises, perhaps
according to Type, Profile, Definition, or Circuit learning styles, as preparation for the
MP3 analysis. See assignment section for more ideas on this. This approach can be
implemented at any point during the course.

Head Center
Figure 4.1: The Head Centers and their Channels
The 61st Gate Framed in Biochemical Context of Head Centers
The Not-Self is by its very nature mental. It is not physical. It is a construct
based on a reaction to the physical. And in some ways the Head to Ajna
Channels mirror Root to Sacral Channels with the crucial difference that
neither Head Center is a motor.
Due to the fundamental relationship between the gray area and neo cortex, if
you are going to talk about the 61st Gate you are going to talk about storage.
The Head Center is just the gray matter and scientists say they think that our
ability to absorb information in our gray matter is endless. Therefore, the
pressure of the Head is based on being the receptacle of the experiential field;
it takes in lots of information it isn’t designed to know how to get back out.

The moment that you are trying to get at something in that gray area and you
can’t, it delivers doubt, confusion, and discomfort with not knowing and
questions. It’s like a cow that needs to be milked.
We take that question and say that it is pressuring us with doubt and
confusion. But it’s not. This is not the Root Center, so it doesn’t pressure us in
the same way. The Head is more like a dolphin that doesn’t know how to
breathe by itself. Because it’s not a motor, it doesn’t know that it has pressure
and the Ajna just sucks that pressure up literally. Seventy percent of humanity
has open Head Centers and they are all doing a never-ending, dolphin-style
inhales. They can’t breathe out. Not being a true motor, it has no way of
organizing the pressure or noticing how much it’s built up.
The thing about breathing in is that there is endless lung capacity. So the gray
matter doesn't even realize it has taken in a lot of stuff. So the Ajna is
constantly milking the holy consciousness cow. The Ajna Gates pulling this
down from the Head Center are the ones really under pressure. It’s a two-
Centered system. It’s not the Head Center that gives you a headache, it’s the
Ajna.
The Ajna is always saying to the Head, “you are giving me this doubt and
confusion,” but actually the Ajna brings this in on its own. You have to
conceptualize to milk that stuff. Otherwise you don’t really know that it’s
there.
It’s very easy to exalt the 61st Gate, but when this is activated, all you are
really breathing in is only the unresolved pressure in the gray matter. If you
can actually measure what a 61 is willing to store in the gray areas it is what
they have no real access to. There is nothing worse than a Knower who
Knows. The 61 breathes in all that which is unresolved. Meanwhile the 24 is
making a selection; pulling something out as a focus. Same as what the 47
does and what the 4 does as a focus with the 64 and 63.
The 24 is the Gate of Rationalizing. The Return. But the dilemma of pulling
out that which is unresolved is that you cannot conceptually resolve it, you
can only refer to it. You're in a pulse and you loop back in context. Lots of
people who have the 61st Gate or the whole Channel activated but split off are
in the revealing business and have found something to be revealed in occult
knowledge.

Example Chart: Alan Leo
Figure4.2 : Alan Leo
Alan Leo has the 61.1 in unconscious Mars as part of the full Channel so there
is no indication that he is always breathing in. I have the same line hanging
unconscious out of the open Center. When that inhale is pulled back out by
the 24, something else comes in to land in my Head. The Head Center is about
inspiration first. This is the first teaching theme. It is a flow of inspiration that
is being filtered through this Gate.
What is it about the Gate that gives it proper context? All Head Gates are
begging to have their thing pulled: ‘I want more occult to come out.’ The
moment you speak of an Individual Gate you must also speak of its chemical
context, melancholy. All Individual Gates operate in the context of a mood
frame and are therefore going to have the chemistry of sadness. So the 61 is
breathing in sadness. Most of what it wants to know is how to avoid sadness:
and all the Individual wants to do is get rid of noise. That’s another layer of

the context. You pull sound of out of the Individual and a visual out of the
Collective: the need to get rid of the pressure, and the acoustic, and the noise
and 61’s have a potentially very noisy process. This person doesn’t even
know that what is pulled out of it is deeply melancholic and sad until it starts
to conceptualize it.
Nothing is more difficult than to have a Head Ajna combination cut off from
the Throat, because the combination is always working on something it can’t
get out. The most common thing for the defined Ajna and open Throat to do is
to decide how it is going to act before anything happens. I worked in Los
Angeles for a while and discovered that actors in Hollywood often have this
configuration: they have cut-off Heads and are tired of having their own lines
stuck in there which they can’t deliver. In the context of theatre, someone
gives them a script and they can say what is on their mind. But the natural
lines are split off and without a bridging connection they cannot be
communicated. So they get stuck with the pressure.
When you talk about any Awareness Center, you must talk also about fear.
The Ajna pretends to be certain because it is afraid of the consequences if it
does not. Fear is unappreciated. If there is no fear, there is no awareness,
intelligence, or feelings and so it should be. Fear is at the heart of everything.
In this case, it is the fear that you cannot make sense and cannot know at this
level. Unconscious activations create more fear than conscious activations. It
is frightening to know why mind works in a certain way. When the mind is
conscious you know what it’s doing and that fear is bothering it. But
unconscious mental gates are frightening.

In dealing with context use all of the basic ABCs and RC Keynotes. Every
time you go back, you go back to them at a different level. Here I used a lot of
red and black Keynoting and defined versus dormant keynoting to deepen the
biochemical context. We’ve got to deal with complexities of the chart, open
Center strategies, and the rest. Keep on repeating, referring, going back,
deepening the layers of context. And always frame gates from the Center.

Class Exercises: The Mental Stream
Again, this exercise is given as an example and model for your reference. Feel
free to adapt it or to use as is but substituting the specific gate content you are
working with your students this month. Notice that three of the four questions
include biochemical associations and the fourth is based on mirror symmetries.
Ex 1: Why do the Collective Mental Streams cross Bodygraph sides when
they reach the Head Center?
A: The optic nerve crosses over in the brain
Ex 2: Pick a Head Gate and describe it in Stream and Center Context using
the perspective that each Head Center Gate /Channel is
fundamentally similar, because they each connect the same Centers,
but at the same time are not exactly identical—what makes the Gate
you have chosen similar to but different to the Gates that mirror it?
Then, extend out to include all the Gates and Channels in your
analysis.
Ex 3: Why is the connection Ajna to Throat so difficult?
A: These are Metamorphic Channels in which visual or acoustic
signals from the mind need to be translated into language)
Ex 4: Practice keynoting head Gates or any other Gates you choose to teach
this month in context that includes their biochemical associations.

Gates in Context: Using Biochemical Associations of Centers as Framing
Layers for Gates (The Ego Center and the Ego Circuit)
Center layering may be a simple technique but its execution can become very complex
and nuanced. A prime example of exactly how complex it can become is found in the
Ego Circuit.
A Brief History of the Ego Circuit
When I first saw the Bodygraph, it wasn’t flat the way it appears on paper--I
actually saw it floating in three-dimensional space. One of the things that was
interesting about that was how its Channels don’t necessarily all operate in the
same plane as they appear to when represented on the page. You can get a hint
of this in the way the Ego Circuit, the only Circuit to cross other Channels,
appears in the graph and cuts diagonally behind the Power Column to connect
with the Spleen on the 44/26. We know the Ego doesn’t make contact with the
Power Column. And, in fact, in 3-D, the Ego Circuit operates and extends far
beyond and outside the other Circuits almost perpendicularly and to the back
and the Ego itself is located diagonally and behind the G Center.

This is because the whole Ego Circuit was imported from one of our
ancestors. The Ancestor of the Collective Individual is Integration. But there
was also this creature called Homo erectus, which carried this thing we call
the Ego Circuit that didn’t look then the way it does now. As a species, we
have a complex vehicular history that includes the various biological stages
we have gone through on our way to becoming Homo sapiens. And in a sense,
different pieces of our Circuitry are grafted together from our various genetic
ancestors.
This goes all the way back to the mitochondria. Our cell structure had to go
through an evolutionary process and this process did not take place in human
bodies but rather as the most independent and simplest of life forms like
amoebas. Components of human cell structure were entirely separate at
certain times in evolutionary history. At some point billions of years ago the
mitochondria was on its own and formed a symbiotic relationship with
another cell component and from that the cell and its metabolism as we know
it evolved.
Likewise, the Ego has its own realm and was grafted on to the Collective
Individual. Collective and Individual Circuitry were mutations on top of
Integration which was already a very successful biochemical life system. One
side of our past is attached to the Identity but the other was attached to the
Ego. So when you are looking at the Ego Circuit, you are also looking at our
history, which should give you added respect for the power and the impact
that are available here in this system.
Therefore, the moment you see something different in Bodygraph context,
you should immediately sit up and notice because it means something, and
there is something clearly different about Tribal Circuitry. Defense may be
completely symmetrical, but in the context of the rest of the Bodygraph, and
in its apparent asymmetry and lack of bias toward metamorphosis as outlined
above, the Ego Circuit is very unusual.
Unlike other Circuits, its Streams do not find their expression in the Throat:
its primary function is not metamorphosis, but empowerment of the Ego itself.
The Bodygraph is inherently balanced and dualistic so the Collective Circuits
mirror each other symmetrically; Individuality is symmetrical. In contrast, the
shape of the movement of the Ego is almost a diamond shape. It has no
symmetry with any other Circuit in that sense. It fits in with the rest of the
Bodygraph Circuitry without sharing its history. Here the Throat Gate is more
of a bridge or a link or a hook than a final expression of the energy. The 45/21
is just an adaptive mutation that developed to lead us to our next evolutionary
step, as the 45 bridged and linked and hooked the potential of the 21
contained within this diamond loop, so it could be fed and circulated to the
Human Design International Training Manuals. 91
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
rest of the Bodygraph. It’s the only thing that connects the Ego mechanism,
which has no Sacral Center, to the rest of the Bodygraph. The purpose of this
mutation was support, which is found in the diamond shape; not in that
bridge, which is why the expression of the Ego Circuit is found in the Center
itself, and also why the Circuit itself is so self-contained; it literally came
from somewhere else. It is some kind of precursor of the whole hominid line
and was something that was very much on its own and still is.
And, that said, of course, the Ego Circuit maintains a symmetrical relationship
with the rest of the Bodygraph because the Bodygraph is a binary. However,
in this case, everything else in the Bodygraph is on one side of the binary and
the four Channels of the Ego Circuit are on the other, and they are equal in the
sense that regardless of their different proportions as far as sheer numbers are
concerned: Only together and juxtaposed can both binary elements give us the
essential evolutionary mix that resulted in Homo sapiens. The ultimate
initiation occurred in the 25/51 that eventually brought together the Identity
and Ego in harmony.
Framing the Ego Center
If you are going to deal with Ego Circuit you are going to have to deal with
the Heart Center. It is here that this unique biological power was developed.
The Ego becomes empowered by anything in its Circuit. The moment that you
bring these two strains together of Circuitry (Collective Individual versus
Tribal) in the mutation we call the modern human, the tendency is that all
movement should end up and reach its expression in the throat.
The moment that there is instinctive energy present in the Spleen there is pull
to go to the throat but actually energy should never go directly from the
Spleen to the Throat. Instinct was intended to feed the Ego and its power and
as a motor the Ego pulls that energy to it. This is the natural movement of the
Bodygraph.
Individuals have a hard time with the Ego because they are not throat oriented
or identity oriented. They are constantly being pulled to the Ego. The 26 and
40, the denial gates, are in the Ego Center because only the Ego has what it
takes to deny identity and metamorphosis and deal with the emotional system.
Everything else is simply overrun by emotions. Only Ego and Emotions
actually form a bargain in the Bodygraph: “Yeah, sure, you go up and down
but I can handle you, baby.”

Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D F O U R
Ego is always pulling emotions: “Bring ‘em over here; bring it on.” This is
because they don’t want the emotions to escape to those horrible collective
individual idiots. And the Ego says,” I am the heart!” Meanwhile, there is this
meek polite little voice over there going, “err, ummm, excuse me, I’m the
lymphatic system?” And the Ego says “Yes, yes, very good, there, there. It’s
my beat, baby, it’s my heart. ” And that is the essence of the Tribe.
In this era of Collective globalization that supports the growth of the
Individual so many horrible things are going on just because the Tribe is
yelling, “Hey! I am the heart! The heart! You can’t forget about the heart”
while the identity keeps on maintaining, “Well, OK, but I am the lymphatic
system and we can have peace and everything can be healthy and organized
and fair.”
The 26th Gate in Context (and Framing other Gates in the Tribal Circuit)
Even above and beyond that, the Ego Center is the soldier, the killer, the
weapon. When you think about the T cells and thymus being associated with
the Ego this can be reassuring, but actually if you consider what a T Cell does
you cannot imagine anything so gruesome. Imagine a soldier that eats the
enemy. This is the 26 Gate. Don’t fuck with the tricksters of the Tribe; they
will eat you alive. They will send out their young and their women and they
will bomb you with 18 year old girls who are carrying sacks of ammo and
blowing themselves up. The 26th Gate is the heart and soul of the killer
monkey. This Gate goes back to our deep, deep simian background and heat
and cold. This Ego system is so powerful! “I am the stomach. I am the
stomach.”
So when you are looking at the Ego and want to put it in context you have to
provide the depth that is there, and recall that we live in a world of dualistic,
not tripartite conflict. There are always dilemmas between the Individual and
the Collective, but in the end, they are more similar than anything else.
However, both of them are always in counterpoint to the Tribe and the Ego-
dominated environment. And since only 35 percent of humanity has a defined
Heart Center, only 35 percent of the planet forms our core and the glue
holding us together. Only 35 percent of us are holding up that end of the
binary in that sense, the piece that actually makes us Homo sapiens and glues
us together.

If you want to see glue, go to the 19 Gate because it is a veritable glue factory:
sticky, sticky, sticky. My God, our God, your God; who do we sacrifice
today?
It’s not a problem after all. It’s an evolutionary process. But one of the most
difficult Lines within Design to see analytically is the pressure of anyone who
has to deal within themselves with mixed Tribal, Collective, and Emotional
Definition because they are the synthetic field.
I don’t know that tension from personal experience. But such beings are in
deep conflict because Logic and Individuality and Tribal emotions are, for
instance, very, very different priorities. There is a real mystical quality to that
Tribal gluing, and nothing more impressive than going into a southern Baptist
church in Tennessee and seeing all those people swinging and swaying and
dancing and going into heights of bliss and getting off on the wave and
coming out thinking they have had a real experience when actually they are
just glued. This is what religion always tries to do, and religion is a result of
the 19th Gate: the need to have God as your glue. The fence around your
border as your glue. Confining people to a ghetto as glue.

The Two Streams of the Ego Circuit:
Instinct and Sensitivity
All this maintains or recreates the world of separation: a glued, protective
force. The Tribe brought to us something that the Spleen cannot. The Spleen
can only be an instrument of unique survival. Whereas, Ego says to us, “If we
stand alone we die, but if we stand together, we confront anything, and life as
a monkey is enhanced when you work together. You cannot stand alone
against the lion.”
The moment you have an Ego is the moment you cannot have one great
warrior who saves everyone when they need to saved. That’s a Collective
concept. The Tribe has armies where everyone is a warrior, and God help you
if you don’t join in. They will all turn against you. They won’t try to glue you
back on. They will just ostracize you, alienate you, and kill you. This is the
glue that holds us together. And the glue is breaking down as we move toward
the mutation of 2027, which is really a transformation away from the glue,

which has been a theme since 1610. Because we are about to be unglued. So
as a result we get a world with a plague of heart disease, stomach problems,
and deep threats to the immune system that enter through the 26th Gate
because the glue is breaking down.

Black indicates the Mystical Channels, Red is the Mystical Bridge
The break-up of the nuclear family since the 1960s is the glue breaking down.
And the place that is most evident is in the religious glue that holds us
together. The 19/49 is the Mystical Channel and the 37/40 is the Mystical
Bridge: The bond that joins the world of Identity with the world of Ego. And
that bridge is breaking down. All of these religions are getting unglued in that
sense. The number of people who want to go into religion in materially
successful societies is falling rapidly. The Tribal God only remains a driving
force in disenfranchised areas of the world. According to the Tribe, the
problem is that we have lost our glue.
To fight for survival, the Tribe must have an enemy. The Individual doesn’t
want to be caught in this or that because it might result in being imposed
upon. And when the Collective goes to war they borrow Tribal things and

cannot fight without Tribal soldiers, so all wars become Tribal wars: “We are
right and they are wrong,” in the style of George W. Bush’s crusade. Inside of
us this is the part of us that fights. It doesn’t struggle. It fights.
In that it takes in everything, the collective consciousness does the best of all
the Circuits and can sort of survive. The four Tribal Channels can’t muster the
same volume as the larger Circuits so eventually the Tribal Circuit in us will
disappear entirely and get absorbed like an appendix.
The Ego and the Spleen fight with each other. Unlike the Ego, the Spleen does
not want to die when it goes to war. It goes to war to make things correct. It
will often avoid the most dangerous situations because it is afraid of dying. In
contrast, the 26th Gate is the Gate of the suicide bomber: the ultimate solider
who goes into battle not simply to die but to be an expendable weapon. The
Spleen doesn’t know how to fight that kind of soldier. The 26th Gate is just
here to provide continuity. As far as it is concerned, the most important thing
it can do is to be glue and when these people die as weapons they become the
glue for those that survive. So there is an inherent conflict in us as a species
between the collective solider who is afraid to die and the suicide bomber.
You only get the nice side of the 37/40 if you are part of the glue. Otherwise,
the Tribe will starve you, blow you up, or otherwise get rid of you. The vast
majority of uncontrollable violence is rooted deep, deep, deep in the Ego,
which is a magnificent instrument but very primitive—in this Circuit, only the
44th Gate knows how to duck. Once you get to the point of understanding the
Ego and its helplessness, you will understand that any Ego being is a warrior
who will die for his cause. I’ll fight to the death to get Design out. The 40th
Gate says, “If you are not with me, fuck you. I don’t care. But if you are I will
feed you until you are more than full.” That is what happens in the Tribe.
They don’t just feed you; they fill you up because food is part of the glue. So
just be correct. The Tribe is sweet, sharing dreams and feelings when the Ego
doesn’t have to think about threat.

Note to Instructors:
Please note that you are not required to teach the Ego Circuit in context
specifically this month; the examples illustrate the technique of using
biochemistry as Gate context and how complex this level of keynoting can get.
These class exercises can easily adapt to whatever Stream or Circuit you happen
to be teaching this month. If you have chosen the classic Design order and began
with Individuality, you might, for instance, be working with the Collective this
month. In this case, of course, simply adapt this class practice session to your
specific content or substitute your own. The point is simply to provide class
practice opportunities at this level to you students.
Q and A for the Ego Circuit
Q1: What is distinctive about the Center involvement of this Circuit?
A: As a Design it is a Manifestor, and has no mind or time sense aside
from the eternal present.
Q2: Which senses are connected to this Circuit?
A: Touch and smell.
Q3: How many Symmetries does this Circuit have?
A: Two.
Q4: Tell me what they are and why?
A: The two Streams in the Circuit, Sensitivity and Instinct, can be
interpreted as symmetries.
Q5: Pick a Gate in the Ego Circuit and describe it in the Context of the
Circuit’s Channels and Symmetries as they have been described
above.
Example: The 32/54 is ambitious and wants to be recognized for how
hard it works in its career, whereas the 19/49 is needy and wants to being
recognized for how hard it works for its family.

Q6: What are the “Communist” and “Capitalist” sides of the Ego Stream?
A: The Stream of Instinct represents the “Capitalist” side; Stream of
Sensitivity represents the “Communist” side.
Q7: Why might the two Streams of the Ego Circuit find their expression in
the Heart Center?
A: It can be speculated that due to the origin of that Circuit, that it was
imported from one our ancestors, Homo erectus. Therefore the Ego
has its own realm.

The Power Column
Ex 1: Describe all the Gates of the Power Column using the hypothesis that
they are all generically the same, because they connect the same
Centers, but yet they are not identical—what is the same and where
does the differentiation lie at the surface level?
Example: whether they are Sacral or G Center Gates, All these Gates
relate to the Identity of the Self (the Sacral Gates are available to define
Identity when fixed by the corresponding Gate in the G Center). The
Difference is that one, the 2/14, is Individual, and 2, the 5/15 and 29/46
are Collective. The 5/15 is experimenting and repeating to come into the
flow while the 29/46 is experiencing to discover the sense of an
experience.
Ex 2: What are the Tantric Channels?
A: 5/15 (Rhythm), 2/14 (The Beat), 29/46 (Discovery)

Ex 3: What single Name can you give to describe the Channels that connect
the G Center and the Throat Center?
A: These can be interpreted as “leadership Channels”
Format Channel Exercises:
Ex 4: Describe all the Gates of the Format Channels using the hypothesis
that says every Gate /Channel is basically the same, because they
connect the same Centers, but yet they are not identical—what is the
same and what is different?
A: All these Gates pressure the Sacral with the pressure to work. The
difference is that the 3/60 is Individual and pulses, while the 9/52
and 42/53 are Collective. The 9/52 is focused on experimenting
while the 42/53 is cyclic and experiential in nature.
Ex 5: Why are the Format Energies so important?
A: Because even one activation in the Format Channels (i.e. a hanging
Gate, not a defined Channel) patterns and influences (formats) the
entire Rave Chart with its quality.
Minor Circuits:
Ex 6: Why are Minor Circuits so important when they activate Channels in
the Chart?
A: The minor Circuits lend their quality to any other Circuit.
The Centering Circuit makes everything more Individual. The
Defense Circuit makes everything more Tribal.
Ex 7: What is the shared characteristic of these Circuits?
A: Each involves 3 Centers and 2 Channels and both minor Circuits
are pure Generators as Types.

Role Gates Option 1: The Role Gates plus Gates 6 and 50, which are the eight Profiling
Gates, were introduced in Rave Cartography Level II Vol. 2 as part of presenting Profile
in Weekend 4 (you can also find the 2006 update on Role Gate profiling keynotes there).
In Professional Level I, please teach Role Gates in detail. You can bring them in here
because there is room in Month 4, as a way of summarizing and reinforcing RAM.
However, to teach the individual lines of the Profiling Gates, you may want to wait and
introduce them specifically and in depth in Sequence II, 64 Gates and 384 Lines as you
move through all the Lines in Bodygraph format. In any case, please readdress the line
level material in its own context as referred to in the Template Outline for Sequence II
near the beginning of that section of this book.
MP3 Assignment: Suggestion: practice the technique of keynoting Gate in context that
includes biochemical associations.
Optional Enrichment Segment: Now that the gates of all three Circuit groups have been
taught in context, here is a good moment to invite an outside expert to come to class for
an enrichment session: possibilities might include vocal quality, breath work, etc.

Six Steps for Freer Vocal Resonance
The sounds we make vibrate through our bodies, particularly through the head
and chest. Loose muscles allow for greater resonance. Tight muscles create
tight sounds, and tight sounds make other people tense. If you are somewhat
aligned in your spine, your muscles can relax and resonate instead of having to
hold you up. If you stretch your muscles, they relax further. If you sound
through those relaxed muscles, your tone will be richer and reveal greater
variety and subtlety. If you warm up the tongue and lips and do a few diction
exercises not only will your sounds be clearer, YOU will be clearer as well. The
goal is a clear, resonant voice that reveals your truth rather than muffles
it. Stretching, alignment, breath, resonance and diction are the key areas to
address.
Step One: Stretch
a) Raise arms overhead to the ceiling
b) Then interlace fingers, turn them inside out and stretch up over your head
again. Then take those same, inside out interlaced fingers and press them
straightforward with straight elbows
c) Put your arms down and roll your shoulders in circles
d) Neck – relax your neck over to the right side with the face forward and the
ear to the shoulder (not chin to the shoulder). Pull head further over with your
right hand reaching overhead to help the stretch, as face remains full front. For a
greater stretch, pull the left hand down towards the floor simultaneously, or bend
the left hand up as high on the back as you can while the left elbow pushes down
toward the floor. Reverse.
Next, relax head forward, put hands behind head and push down. Relax the head
more and push down further. Repeat, but this time leave your head down and
push it up against your resisting hands for a second and third time.
e) Squeeze hands together behind your back, pointing down in reverse prayer
pose, straighten your elbows as much as possible while squeezing shoulder
blades together
f) Squeeze shoulders into neck and then release.

g) Pull one arm across chest to open shoulder blade; then reverse.
h) Leaving your interlaced hands behind you, bend all the way over, keeping the
knees relaxed, and bring straight arms overhead as much as creates a
stretch, then relax the arms a bit before bringing the arms even further over. Be
sure to bring arms back down straight behind you before rolling up the spine.
i) Yoga is also very effective--Sun salutation, spinal twists, cobra, fish.
Two: Align
Bend forward and roll down one vertebra at a time, leaving knees unlocked and
keeping weight over the middle of the feet. Drop loosely when or if back gets
tight. While bent over, let head bounce gently, shimmy the shoulders as sigh out
sound, then roll up one vertebra at a time. Imagine energy, or light shooting
straight up from the tailbone in a narrow column as each vertebrae stacks or
hooks on to the column. If you’d like repeat several times adding different
points of concentration-- The column of light can change colors, you can your
press feet into ground as roll up so you'll feel more grounded, and/ or can sense
the seven vertebrae stack up that make up the cervical (neck) portion of the
spine... This can be done while seated if back begins to feel too uncomfortable.
Only if your neck is in adequate shape, use a wall to lean on at a diagonal. Stand
with your back to wall and step forward about eight inches keeping your back
straight. Using your hands for support on the wall, step forward until ONLY the
back of the head is on the wall, the shoulders and neck are off the wall
completely, the body is in diagonal line, and the hips are aligned. Remove your
hands from the wall and remain in this position for 10 seconds. When you come
out, be sure to put hands back on the wall and bend one leg back a step for easy
support before bringing your head off the wall (i.e., do not shove yourself off the
wall). You should feel a little rush go to your head and will feel like sitting, or
walking straight from this exercise, along with the roll-up. This will leave more
room for your breathing to function freely and better support a comfortable
voice.
Three: Breathe
a) Take 5 or 6 breaths high in the chest and sigh them out to relax the chest area
and the emotions. Next, fill up the belly area with air, sighing out loosely. Don't
push out or you will get dizzy. (And if you do, just sit and wait a minute till feel
normal).
b) Fast rhythmic panting from the belly, letting air in through the nose. Pant
again through the mouth, being sure the belly is naturally bouncing in and out

(i.e. and not the chest. Some people find they can “pant” more easily by using an
image--such as pretending they are a dog happy to see his master, leaving their
"paws up" and tongues out!
c) Shake your belly with your hands: in and out, then up and down.
Four: Resonate
a) Repeat 3 c) above (shaking the belly with hands-- in and out, then up and
down) while sounding different low pitches. (Notice how the pitch goes up a
little every time you push in and relaxes back as your hand relaxes. This is
because faster air lifts the pitch.)
b) “The Shakes:” sigh out different pitches while shimmying the shoulders,
while shaking one leg at a time, while jiggling the knees, while hitting the chest
like Tarzan, and while rolling up and down. Cup your hands together in front of
you around jaw level, and shake (leave your jaw in a relaxed open position
while doing this and the shaking will relax the jaw further. You don't need to go
to very high pitches, but if choose to try to breathe from your belly area (the
diaphragm, NOT the chest), stop before your throat gets tight.
c) Hum or sing a song while shaking and shimmying!
Five: Wake Up Your Diction
a) Make funny faces to warm up face muscles-- stick out your tongue and open
eyes wide (Lion face).
b) Make circles with your tongue outside of your mouth.
c) Massage your jaw with your mouth gently open.
d) breathing from belly, hummmmm at different pitches and move your mouth
around. (You can move your mouth as if you have mouthwash inside.) Massage
your cheeks with jaw open while sounding long pitches.
e) Repeat the following two letters: b d g d,. bdgd, bdgd, etc. Then try: p, t, k, t
ptkt, ptkt etc. then n, l, t, d. The first consonant combination uses both lips, then
the tip of the tongue to the gum ridge, then back of the tongue to the palate, and
back again. Add as many different vowels and speed to the basic structure as
you can: buh duh guh duh, buh duh guh duh, buh duh guh duh, etc be de ge de,
bah dah gah dah, bo do go do, bow dow gow dow do.
Repeat the process with pe te ke te, pah tah kah tah, po to ko to, pow tow kow
tow etc. Again, Add any vowel and combinations you would like to.

Do same with “tongue tip sounds n, l, d , t, ne le de te, etc...
f) Say BE BAY BAH BO BU and add these endings that “buzz:” d , v, g, l, dz
vz gz lz(these last ones are usually spelled ds vs gs ls but are pronounced as z ).
Example: BEV BAV BAV BOV BUVBEVS BAVZ BAVZ BOVZ BUVZ.
g) You can add different prefixes and suffixes such as, pleems, plames plahms
ploms plums.

SEQUENCE II σ 64 G ATES & 384 L INES
114 Human Design International Training Manuals.
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
Sequence II Overview
As we begin the six sessions of PTL 1, devoted to the 64 Gates in Depth through the 384
Lines, we address the topic of Lines in context while continuing to review the original
Human Design teaching tradition of getting down into the detail of the lines.
Originally, the 384 Lines were taught as discrete bytes of information in order to
establish the detail foundation of the System, now available in the Rave I Ching and Line
Companion. In the Rave Analysis Method the 384 Lines are taught visually through
streams and the graphic elements of the Rave I Ching format. This method locates the
lines within a fixed but moving synthesis base. As such, each Line is only one quality in a
continuum of 384, and always points beyond its own arc of influence toward the surface
of the chart, and is also qualified by the narrowing definition fields of color, tone and
base below. Even in all of its articulate and mysterious detail, each line can only exist in
relationship to, and while refracting, the full illumination of its context.
Instructor Goals and Tools for the Module
The Rave I Ching As Teaching Tool
The visual format and content of the Rave I Ching was designed to efficiently deliver the
detail of Human Design. This Line sequence presents the Rave I Ching as a database and
uses it as the primary tool for delivering line keynotes, context and content. However, it
may also be of use to you in the Gate section, for instance, when teaching keynote level
feature (top of right hand page of the Rave I Ching) in suggested Weekend Two (Gates in
Streams) to support the technique of working with a traditional gate name to discover that
gate’s quality.

Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
The goal of the Line work is to get students to the point where they know how to use
every feature of the Rave I Ching effectively to read charts. Because Sequence II is six
weekends/months long, you can afford to take your time teaching it. Please make sure to
explore and practice with every feature of the book. (See suggested class outlines below).
Also, please make sure your students have two copies of the book version of the Rave I
Ching: one to use with clients and one to make notes in.
Teach Lines by Hexagram in Bodygraph Structure
The Lines themselves are taught, Hexagram by Hexagram, over six sessions in
Bodygraph structure (in Streams, Circuits, framed by a Center, etc.) to deliver the full
depth of the Line process. This technique is reinforced with the usual monthly MP3
assignment, and also balanced by a suggested enrichment assignment for students to
explore the common line themes of all 64 Hexagrams by values 1-6, one per month, in
order to deliver the surface and breadth of the line information.
Use Repetition (We Do)
We continue to repeat key points to reinforce technique for your students and give you
the luxury of not having to flip around in the book to find the points of reference you
need when you might need them.
Line Commentary Resources
Along with The Rave I Ching, the basic text for this class is the Line Companion. Base
your classes on these texts. In addition, as a tribute to the first and second generation of
Human Design teaching, and also to give you some texture to work with (i.e., something
to impact or respond to…) along with Ra Uru Hu’s own commentary, a few first
generation teachers of the method give a few words of insight and experience on some
lines of note. These small Sidelines lists appear throughout these six chapters along with
suggested lesson plans and oral assignment styles and enrichment techniques, also
available as guidelines and creative elements for classes. Of course, you may opt to
design your own classes any way you like, as long as you deliver the content, and
encourage and develop the necessary analytic skills in your students.

Student Development and Enrichment
Please fine-tune your attitude toward your students to match their develop skill levels as
the module progresses. Also, as you approach the midpoint mark of this course, begin to
notice who, if anyone in your class might not be Analyst material and, by the time you
are halfway through the Sequence, either coach them (or suggest they find outside
coaching when appropriate) to develop lagging skills, or begin to prepare them for other
options in Human Design.
At the same time, make sure you are enriching your class programs with the appropriate
and necessary enrichment units. Please make resources for enrichment in vocal delivery,
counseling techniques, and boundaries, including session opening and closing, available
to them. Toward the end of this section you might want to discuss the business of a
Human Design practice, marketing by Type and Strategy, etc. If you haven’t already,
make available chart data resources for students and discuss the importance of data
accuracy, etc. IMPORTANT: Completion of PTL 1/Level III does not qualify students
to be Analysts. Reading technique is introduced in Sequence III of this course, but
session dynamics and their specifics are part of Level VI Mentorship and Certification
Preparation.
Educational Goals
By the end of this section, students must able to keynote out of the interpretive base (line
keynote plus line value = interpretive base) the 384 Lines of the I Ching, either through
memorization or facility with the technique, Bodygraph knowledge and 236 keynotes,
and a Rave I Ching. (You don’t have to cover every single line in class, or be responsible
for you students memorizing every one of the 384 Lines, although some teachers can and
will).
Students must be familiar with the following terms and concepts: the professional
features of the Rave I Ching (Right hand page: Gate, Chop, Gate Title, zodiacal arc, the
basic binary of the line, planetary values, the mechanics of fixation. Left hand page: the
Quarters, the Channel, basic familiarity with crosses, the nodes add in what is needed).
By this time, they should also be demonstrating that they are becoming ready to become
professional Analysts, or that they are more suited, for instance, to research or general
education.

Two Possible Teaching Flows (Yes, this Course has been Designed as a
Binary)
As we synthesized and organized this course material, we noticed that there were two
distinctly different yet viable ways of teaching the line material. Both of them are based
on teaching through Rave I Ching format and the 64 Gates and 384 Lines in Streams with
lots and lots of keynoting practice and MP3 assignment homework. The first structure is
the one you see here. It is very deliberately paced and goes into different areas of content
and principles presented in the Rave I Ching databases for the first day of the first four
months of the sequence, with the second day of each of these sessions reserved for gates
and lines. Enrichment, oral class exercises and practice with line and context keynotes,
and homework review break up the content and line sections. Many exercise examples,
example charts, and diagrams are also provided, both within the content, and in the back
of the book all in one place, so you can refer to them all together. In this teaching flow,
the last two weekends are left to finish the lines, and also to do some detailed and
advanced explorations of the gates and lines as you like.
The second method is designed to appeal to the more technical, or perhaps Projectors. In
this version (not written out in the book), teach every last feature of the Rave I Ching
format in the first weekend and a half, or two weekends, and spend the rest of the course
teaching the gates and lines in context, orally drilling every last aspect of the gate and
line (in context and as per Rave I Ching structure) using Q&A and other oral techniques
until your students beg for mercy. In this case (the class organization, not begging for
mercy…), break up all the oral drilling and detail work with enrichment topics and
continue to assign and review MP3 assignments in class.
The first version (again, which this book offers) contains what are basically full lesson
plans, and lots of suggestions for customizing for the first four months, and provides
more latitude in the last two. It is recommended for new teachers, or those who are not
technically oriented, or do not have a large population of technically oriented students, or
perhaps have Projectors in their student population. In any case, use your own Strategy
and Authority to decide what works for you.
The emphasis on oral practice, monthly MP3 and Line Enrichment Assignments, and the
need to break up the actual content features with these sessions is identical in both
versions, as is the imperative to mentor your students through their developmental
process as pre-professionals, and to instill and maintain professional standards. Only the
order of content presentation varies.

Sunday Lecture Series, February 2006, available from Jovian Archive) if you did not
introduce them in Chapter/Weekend Four. Or, reinforce and examine the Role Gate
Lines in depth if you did.

Student Q and A and Teacher reinforcement of material
More example charts repeating the gate and lines in question, ask questions, i.e., what
are the keynotes of the 46th Gate?
More Gates and Lines (if needed)
It’s nice to break up the content into sections since it is so detail oriented, and because
there are ten gates and sixty lines plus to cover every month. It may also be advisable to
balance this with very creative or lively Practice and Play sessions, in which students can
really move and play while they integrate their work. It is strongly suggested that you
add other senses, aside from the acoustic, during the practice sessions as well, such as
images or art, movement, or simply changing locations (i.e., for instance, to a more

symbolically Tribal or Individual setting) to balance and integrate the detail of the
material being learned.
Practice and Play
To learn and repeat the lines, have students describe them in context.
Example of one technique for doing this:
The 22.3 (conscious) is someone who mutates into an enchanter through a trial
and error process of learning what grace is. Becoming an enchanter is a process
that develops over time. Enchantment happens through waiting out the wave and
then responding with unique emotional perspective when clear. Enchantment is a
function of the nervous system working through the Solar Plexus. This person
thinks they are enchanting, and when the whole Channel is activated, can impact
existing social structures through the power of their emotional wave.
The 58.4 (conscious) is a person who finds opportunities to focus on the joy in life
that can be found by participating in a network of others, feels love of live as a
physical pressure, and wants to transmit this to others as a logical process in order
to correct what is spoiled. They think they are here to correct with focus. Focus is
a genetic term that biochemically derives from adrenal function and the pressure
of being alive in a body.
This technique has been affectionately dubbed, “This is the House that Jack Built” after
the English nursery rhyme because, if you would like to, you can begin with the base as
above, and each month add a descriptive sentence to practice verbalizing and getting
loose with a different quality of the line, i.e., exaltation and detriment, fixation, if nodal,
etc., as in the nursery rhyme, some of which is included in Chapter Five.
To begin to practice chart-reading skills up to the surface from the line (bottom up) and
from the surface down to the line (top down), group students for practice sessions using
charts. Have them technically practice the movement from detail to surface and back
again as they describe charts.
Reinforce or experientially introduce other forms of Design knowledge through your
choices, i.e.:
• Pair them by Angle: same and different
• Harmonic Profiles
• Same Profile (if possible)

Review Line Enrichment Home Study Assignment
Assign Line Enrichment Theme for the Month
Each month, along with the MP3 assignment, give students an assignment to study all the
Rave I Ching keynotes of each of one of the six lines to discover what they have in
common (this assignment is “broad” while assignments including gates and lines in
bodygraph format is “deep”).
This is another great opportunity for reinforcing Design knowledge through non-
intellectual means, i.e., instruct students to do their assignment in an abstract format one
month (i.e., illustrate what they learned through a collage of magazine pictures), an
understanding the next (i.e., create a graph or chart and describe it). Have them do the
assignment by Definition Type, i.e., if Split, have each part of the Split complete the
assignment in the way that is correct for it. An Abstract Projected Split might describe
what they discovered as if looking back on it from the year 2027 while the 34/ 57 takes
brief, vivid notes.

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
Assign MP3
You can vary these between assignments that stress practice of content (i.e., keynoting a
gate or two, line by line) with those that begin to read the chart. Or, try assigning 2 MP3s
a month as you move through this sequence, as students are ready; one technical and one
where the student begins to/gets in the habit of reading a chart with linguistic abilities
learned so far (i.e., without Keynoting but with accumulated verbal skills and knowledge
base). In the chart reading assignment, you would specifically instruct students on how
to include this detailed knowledge proportionately within their description of the surface
of the chart.
Multiple MP3 assignments help students to get or stay loose with and accustomed to the
medium. As their Instructor, you only need listen to and evaluate one each, but if they
complete more and send them to you, their skills ought to improve more rapidly, and they
will be markedly less anxious about their performance, which can hinder their process
(for more about this, see discussion of fear and student development in the Appendix to
Chapter 1 of this book).

Present The Rave I Ching
Teach students how to use the Rave I Ching as professionals. The book was designed
with a very specific visual structure. Be a guide to the Rave I Ching and to what students
get to see through each of its aspects. Give a very basic workshop in how to use it and
how to see it. Because you have six weekends or months in which to teach the 384 Lines,
you have time to consider each feature carefully. Take your time.
The Rave I Ching is where you are going to do all the main work. Work
with them so they are comfortable looking at lines, and establishing the
value of a line, for a client. If students understand a gate in its context, a
line will take on unique specific value and that is what we want.

The Left Hand Page of the Rave I Ching: The Context of the Line
The left hand page of the Rave I Ching (like the right hand page we will look at later) is a
formula. Start by teaching your students to see it as such. Every feature in the left hand
page database teaches the Gate context. Now that students have learned gates in Streams,
show them how this page concisely formulizes Gate context.
“Nothing is in this book for no reason. It is a little thing. And it’s packed.
And every single right hand page and left hand page is a formula.”
Begin to teach the line’s context as expressed by the graphic features on the left hand
page of the Rave I Ching, which describe the Gate context. (“Above the line” - below the
line are incarnation crosses which are discussed in Weekend 8/Month 8).
Go through each item briefly and concisely, keeping in mind that you will go into quite a
bit of depth about most of them later in the course.

The Gate of the Determination of the Self
What passes through that particular frame brings Determination of the Self, which is a
huge generic. When all the individual combinations of color, tone, and base are
considered in addition to the line level, there are 1080 different versions per line of each
Gate activation, adding up to a total of 6480 different possible activations per Gate. It is
possible to extend the differentiation calculation below the base level—differentiation
does not end with base.

The next column to the right and under the Gate description contains the name and Gates
of the Channel to which the Gate belongs. The Channel, Discovery, is what is succeeding
where other people fail. Succeeding where others fail has nothing to do with either Gate
alone. It is a life force that is created when both Gates are present and quantum into the
Channel.

This is a good moment to work in some repetition and review of Rave Cartography
material to reinforce its depth. For instance, remind your students that the analogy for a
hanging gate is the inanimate object. It is the full Channel that is alive. Only when life
force is present (i.e., the Channel is defined) is the term, ‘a design of’ used. This term is
never associated with any single gate.
While reviewing and drilling (Q &A is a suggested technique for this) teach this precise
language (“a design of”) to your students and stress its importance and actual content.
The advantage of a layered, developmental education is that you can
constantly remind them of what they have already learned to reinforce its
depth.
The Harmonic Gate
Harmonic Gate: 29 The Abysmal
The 29th Gate is Harmonic to the 46th Gate. The Harmonic Gate fixes the definition life
force available in the Channel. When it is activated, the life force is “fixed in.” When its
harmonic is dormant, there is no life force available to an individual gate for activation.
This is why you can never forget the harmonic gate when looking at fixation, because this
is what gives definition and life force, and that is why the harmonic is listed. Through this
Gate, we address the threat of being fixed and having the nature of your life force
irrevocably changed.
Life force is a function of the quantum: to “lock in” or “fix” a specific, very limited,
twisted, fixed and animate line of definition with pinpoint precision within the vast
generic of the Channel in question. The Gate can only come alive when the presence of
its harmonic in the individual Design, or the conditioning field (planetary or human)
provides the reliable and specific life force mechanics required.
Begin to teach the line’s context “above the line” as expressed by the graphic features on
the Left hand page of the Rave I Ching. (“Below the line” are Incarnation Crosses which
you can identify now, but which are discussed more concretely in Weekend Ten).

Go through each item briefly and concisely, keeping in mind that you will go into quite a
bit of depth about most of them later in the course.
Within this framework, Lines 1-3 of any gate remain unaware of the other side of the
Channel. Lines 4-6 naturally look to and are aware of the harmonic gate because, due to
their transpersonal nature, they want to change their life force status, and are aware of the
other. Line 6 (perspectival) is always aware of its entire Circuit.
These harmonics are very important because it is through harmonics that
we see the threat of being fixed.
Fixation will be addressed when we discuss the right hand page of the Rave I Ching,
next.
Gate Center and Circuit
Center: G
Circuit: Sensing
Because all of this is about identity at one level or another, the next two columns address,
step by step, the nature of identity: Identity is a function of the G Center. The G Center
is, in turn, part of the Sensing Circuit. These two columns describe the layers and context
of the life force potential.
You can drill these two columns, as well, through the Rave I Ching in combination with
example charts.

Associate the line text with the line graphic (numbered line) on the page: i.e., here is the

therefore this line has a Yin quality.
Show them that the pages work from the bottom up, working from the first line at the
bottom, and the sixth Line at the top, so visually you are really seeing the Hexagram.
Hexagram “Title“
GOOD FORTUNE THAT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS THE RESULT OF
SERENDIPITY BUT DERIVES FROM EFFORT AND DEDICATION
The only thing that speaks for the Gate as a whole is the traditional Hexagram title at the
top. This title presents the potential of contemplating this Hexagram as itself. A
Hexagram’s real value can perhaps only be seen in context. Alone, it is difficult to grasp.
Line Keynote As Priority; Keynote Plus Value Equals Interpretive Base
1 Being discovered
Every single one of these Lines has a name: their keynote. A Line’s keynote is always the
priority for the student to digest. The verbal keynote plus the line number value equals its
interpretive base. In the example, being discovered is based on investigating.
Human Design International Training Manuals. 135
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
This immediately gives students a practical interpretation base that
guides them away from the theoretical (generic surface) interpretation.
Suddenly, the line has a specific keynote attached to it. To this, they add
their existing context base: this keynote relates to the identity in the G
Center, is existential in its experience, abstract, and shares. If students
can digest keynotes, place them in context and framework, and relate
them to the line theme, then they have another level they can transmit to
the client.
Blue “Umbrella” Line Introductions
Being discovered Dedication in obscurity that is unexpectedly
discovered.
The 46th Gate First Line has a blue “Umbrella” introduction (see above). A blue
introduction to a line indicates that the associated quality is a process that must be grown
into, whereas lines without umbrella introductions describe qualities and fixed traits that
are present from birth. Therefore “Being Discovered“ is a process that you must grow
into. It develops, like the brain. Part of its basis is to understand a process. These are
potentials that may or may not flower and are totally dependent on interaction.
In contrast Line 6, Integrity, does not have a blue introduction:
6 Integrity
020 56’ 15”- The wisdom to secure one’s identity through careful
consideration of the restrictive potential of
commitments. The determination to say no to
restrictive commitments.
030 52’ 30” Deceiving oneself and others by overextending one’s
resources and eventually being in the position of
having to break promises. A drive for success that will
not say no and will end up breaking promises.
Therefore, you either have Integrity or not. Integrity is not a quality you can develop over
time. It is a “built in” genetic trait. Ra Uru Hu points out that for him the blue
introductions are, in a way, philosophical because there is not a lot of specific Gate
information, and the Gates themselves are more context and frames than content itself.

The moment you can look at lines this way, you can begin to see how interesting that
variation is. Students can quickly add this variation to their keynoting base and their Rave
I Ching studies from the foundational level.
Zodiacal Arc of Line
1 Being discovered
28o 15’ 00”- 11’ 15”
Underneath each line keynote is its zodiacal line arc. Lines are never fixed points; they
are always moving arcs. The line, in this case “Being Discovered”, is just a generic term
which covers a broad bandwidth. For instance, if you opened MMI and calculated a chart
for this line, you might find that this degree of arc is only 6 percent into its first color, 38
percent into its second tone, and 94 percent into base two. Unless this person has very
accurate birth time, a shift can take place in the base calculation within seconds or
minutes. We are only safe with color because it is a four hour band.
Any chart activation is a tiny fixed point in the percentage of color, tone and base. Not all
“Being Discovered” lines are the same. Color is not part of this course curriculum. But
“Being Discovered” based on the motivation of fear is different than being discovered
based on the motivation of hope. The line may be specific, but it is still a surface generic.
Lines activations are never fixed points. They are always calibrated as a movement
within fixed space.
Practice and Play
Demonstrate line level keynoting in context within the Rave I Ching context. Begin with
the interpretive base of line value and keynote, then add other layers to enrich
understanding of it. Then do a practice and play session using line keynotes. As always,
work in context and framework of Streams, Centers, and minor Circuits.
(This technique has been affectionately nicked named “This is the House that Jack Built”
after the Mother Goose nursery rhyme, see below.)
Examples:
The 23.2 (unconscious) is someone who is unaware that they are naturally self-defensive,
and self defensiveness is a quality of expression related to the thyroid (the Throat). When
correct, this person will express their melancholic, self- protective knowing frequency in

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
a very individual and melancholic way, which both empowers the other, and protects
their own unique form of expression. However, unless they are a Manifestor, they must
wait for an opportunity to respond, or for an invitation to communicate their uniqueness
if they want to be correct. This quality must be practiced over and over again, over time,
to develop. And since this is a Projected Channel, the 23.2 always operates best when
invited regardless of Type. It always feels best to be invited. (Note: this is a very
underlying theme, but still plays a role if you talk about the Channel or Gate.)
The 22.3 (conscious) is someone who mutates into an enchanter through a trial and error
process of learning what grace is. Becoming an enchanter is a process that develops over
time. Enchantment happens through waiting out their wave and then responding to other
people with unique emotional perspective when they are clear. Enchantment is a function
of the nervous system working through the Solar Plexus. This person thinks they are
enchanting, and when the whole Channel is activated, can impact existing social
structures through the power of their emotional wave.
The 58.4 (conscious) is a person who finds opportunities to focus on the joy in life that
can be found by participating in a network of others, feels love of live as a physical
pressure, and wants to transmit this to others as a logical process in order to correct what
is spoiled. They think they are here to correct with focus. Focus is a genetic term that
biochemically derives from adrenal function and the pressure of being alive in a body.
Note:
You can drill the Rave I Ching features separately as keynotes if you want to, or
break up or build the keynoting technique into as many different oral practice
sessions as you want to or may be necessary for your students. Each of the
above examples begins with the simple technique and builds from there.
For instance, you could start very simply with Line keynote and value only, in the Rave I
Ching version of the original ABC’s Line value practice session. For example:
The 23.2 (unconscious) is someone who is unaware they are naturally self-
defensive.
Add a second session that practices articulating context:
….and self-defensiveness is a quality of expression related to the thyroid (the
throat). When correct, this person will express their melancholic, self-protective
knowing frequency in a very individual and melancholic way, which both
empowers the other and protects their unique form of expression. However,
unless they are a Manifestor, they must wait for an invitation to communicate
their uniqueness, or communicate their uniqueness through response if they want
to be correct.

Obviously, this part of the practice session can be broken down further into Circuit, 236,
Center framework, and Type keynoting sessions if needed.
A third session for process keynote or not:
This quality must be practiced over and over again over time to develop.
Reinforce the technique through practice in subsequent class meetings as well as through
MP3 homework. This technique is a foundation for learning the Lines through the
Hexagrams and will be repeated.

The above technique for learning Lines in Gates has been affectionately nick- named
“This is the House that Jack Built” for its structural similarity to the nursery rhyme that
keeps adding linguistic elements to the same rhymed story (above). As you move
through this sequence, you can guide your students in continuing to describe the line in
question, the same one they or you started within month 5, or another as correct, adding
content to their description according to the sequence, i.e., first adding exaltation and/or
detriment descriptions, then fixation, then nodal quality, etc.
The arc is a region, a space. Remember, everything is movement. You go
through a being discovered zone.
The Gate as Moving Frame
This is an edited version of the core teaching on Gate as Frame (allowing from the
movement of quantum life by defining zones of the stellar neutrino feed and life force
imprinting) as given in October 2004.
Following it, and through the subsequent class session sections of this manual, you will
find some of its principles broken down into class exercises and homework assignments
as a guideline. Feel free to create your own, but do convey to students the inherently
moving quantum nature of the Gate and Line level, and introduce them to the reality of
how vast the neutrino stream actually is, even as you teach them the fairly precise
technical formula of line level keynoting.

The Gateway as a Frame in Space
In China there is a tradition of erecting Gateways in the middle of nowhere.
They look like the 20th Hexagram with the four broken yin lines on the bottom
and the two full Yang lines on top. They are just Gates. And there is this
meditation of stepping into the Gateway, wherever it happens to be, and
pausing inside it, and in that moment of pausing, there is only the existential
experience of being in the Gate. Everything in life is either in front of you or
behind you. The Gate itself is nothing—just the context of being in the
existential now. The only difference between this Gate and the 64 I Ching
Gates is that every Gate holds a different existential quality. In the nature of
the quantum, blue is different from red, which is different from black, which
is different from Cambodian, which is different from Tahitian. There is a
different quality and frequency attached to each existential frame.
What does the 46th Gate frame? Good fortune. Stand in this Gateway, and
good fortune may be in front of you. It’s like the American television show
from the 60’s “Let’s Make a Deal,” which was a great 37/40 game. It had this
host named Monty Hall standing in front of three big doors and the whole
audience would dress in crazy costumes: there would be someone dressed like
a porcupine, and someone else dressed like a banana, and they all had a
chance to win what was behind one of the three doors, except they didn’t
know what was behind any of them, and had to choose one. Door 46 is a
lucky door. But walk through some doorways and all hell breaks loose. For
instance, just try the 36th doorway, and it will catch you on the side and slam
in your face.
What matters is whether the Channel is active. A hanging gate it is not alive,
so nothing is moving through. It is waiting for the spark. We give gates names
the way we give big highways names, so we can refer to them somehow. See,
there’s that fat road over there, and once you are on it, you have to go through
that tunnel, look out. The point isn’t the road itself. It’s where it might take
you. It isn’t what the gates are named, but where they can take you, and what
you can potentially experience there. So, the 46th Gate brings good fortune,
which may be perceived as a result of serendipity, but derives from effort and
dedication.

Gates Frame Stellar Life Force
The by-product of all stellar life is the neutrino stream, which is always
feeding a particular and consistent flow of quantum energy through a given
gate’s frame. So the 46th Gateway is located on the cusp of Virgo and Libra, a
very specific location whose vast star density streams its specific neutrino
spectrum through space all the time. So that gate as a frame has its own very
distinct existential quality, and very specific consciousness flow, and, as such,
imprints. It is a vast generic that simply frames certain parameters of
influence from the stellar environment. In its content, the neutrino flow that
comes from Aries is very different than the one that comes from Libra.
Different stars feed neutrinos through each arc of space. And aside from the
few that we ourselves create artificially as a by-product of experimentation
and nuclear fission, and (for our purposes anyway) the planet Jupiter, which
produces neutrinos due to its gas core (all gas giants are in some sense failed
stars) neutrinos can only be made in stars.
So when we are talking about an activation, Mars or Mercury or Venus or any
other planet, these planetary objects are not actually producing neutrinos
themselves. They can only filter them. That neutrino stream moving through
Mars is a distinct consciousness stream, and Mars is simply coloring its
process. Mars doesn’t originate the consciousness. It actually interferes with
it.
Activations are just objects that happen to be in the specific programming
zone that has been defined as that particular arc of the zodiac associated with
the gate, and that is listed under the gate name. What you are looking at in the
line is a variation of the consciousness field moving through that zone within
that arc. If we did an investigation, we could pinpoint and correlate stars to
every single available base for any given line, which, by the way, would be a
lot of stars.
The Gate is so wonderful because it is one of the greatest illusions of all.
There are no gates really. The Gate is simply a quadrant of potential being
constantly impacted by a specific strand of the consciousness field. So, every
single gate activation each of us bears genetically inside of us is attuned to a
different stellar feed. It is only our crystals that can respond to a single quality
of that vast feed, accepting one neutrino at a time. So when you are looking at
the wheel or a Gate, see it for what it is. A section of arc of the zodiac. And
within that section of arc is a boundary, and within that boundary is a certain
quality of consciousness that is arriving via the neutrino. The moment you

have an activation, all that is really happening is that you are hooking onto
one tiny aspect in that consciousness field.
Locate Gates and Their Qualities Within Zodiacal Zones
It is important for your students to see which qualities stream in from which
signs and locations in the zodiac as you teach Gates and Lines.
Introduce the general consciousness field where that gate and line is located,
and point out which qualities are streaming through there all the time. All
seven splenic Gates are in Libra, all in a row: the 18, the 48, the 57, the 32,
the 50 and the 44. So that zone of the star field contains all of our
programming about fear. Fear does not live here on planet Earth. It is just
passing through from that quadrant of the sky.
And then there is the question of love. If you look at the four Gates of Love in
the G Center, you’ll see that none of them are located together in the sky.
They are actually located at four different points of the zodiac entirely. So
love is not together. That is the joke. It’s just four different places, and the
crystal consciousness of planet Earth is its synthetic filtering zone. That is
why you can never really put your thumb on a gate: it’s like comparing it to a
codon or a Hexagram which are also basically empty frames. You can’t really
put thumb on what either of those mean, either - there are other energies
involved in their definition. There, too, you go deeper within to find all of the
potentials relative to the generic surface zone.
So introduce your students to what the lines really do: grab aspects of the
overall theme of that zone.
One of the things for them to see is that because a gate is a zone, and a line is
a generic, they can stop being so uncomfortable with it and intimidated by
interpretation. It’s not like they are really pinpointing anything precisely.
They can be very, very safe using the first line keynote and interpretive base,
“Being Discovered”, in combination and in context. “Being Discovered”
requires investigation, so they know you can’t be discovered right away. And
that the only way you may be discovered is if you study being discovered, and
investigate being discovered, and if you see it within the context of the larger
frame--the Gate-you know there is good fortune that comes with being
dedicated and putting in effort. If you have the 46th Gate active in your design

you really have the opportunity to be lucky. The framework is easy. You are
in the lucky zone. All you have to do is tap into it. But the moment at which
you can actually go into the Line, there your work really begins.
Suggested At Home (i.e., Overnight between Day One and Day Two) Exploration of
Blue Umbrella Introductions:
E: How many lines of each value 1-6 have a Blue Umbrella Heading?
What does this tell you?
A: First Line 32
Second Line 32
Third Line 43
Fourth Line 41
Fifth Line 40
Sixth Line 44
About half of the 384 lines are here to be developed over the course of a lifetime. There
is no real significant difference here in numbers among how many each of the 6 lines
have blue umbrella introductions and which do not. The only distinction is that each of
the first two lines offer slightly fewer themes of development than the other four. In the
case of the First Line, you are here to discover anyway, and in the case of the Second
Line you are a natural anyway!!
Class exercise to grasp what a gate is through a sense of its lines:
Have each student choose one gate (or the same gate) and write out its gate and line
keynotes. Then ask the student to tell you about the gate in context using the line
keynotes:
Example:
Gate Keynotes: 46, PUSHING UPWARD, THE GATE OF THE

Description: You only can push upward if you determine yourself, have the right
pacing, and develop integrity. This will lead to being discovered and having a lot
of impact. Then people will project on you and you will end up being a prima
donna!!
Q and A Practice With Gates
Example:
Begin with keynoting the line in context as above: The 29.2 is someone who
doesn’t know they naturally assess before they say yes. Commitment is a function
of creative availability and an abstract process that is shared with others. Its
source is the abysmal, the deep of the deep, an energy of availability.
Q: What’s the harmonic Gate to the 29?
A: The 46.
Q: What is the nature of the 46th Gate?
A: Discovery, an energy of identity and direction. When the 46th Gate
is activated along with the 29 it will fix the energy of commitment
into a Design of Discovery, which is an aspect of life force.
Q: Which gates precede and follow the 46th Gate in context?
A: The 6th Gate precedes it and the 48th Gate follows it.

DAY TWO
Lines in Context: Lines in Gates by Hexagram Part 1 of 6
Working in Bodygraph format and in context, begin to teach the Gates in Hexagrams,
line by line. Teach each Hexagram as a process in context of Stream, Center, 236
keynoting, Circuitry and Mirror Circuitry, Definition, Openness, Authority, Strategy and
Type.
Vary contexts and analysis movement: use both bottom-up and top-down movements and
stream, mirror stream, Center quality framework, Minor Circuit, Power Column, and
Format contexts. At this point, you can also start in the middle (Gate or Circuit), and
move both down to the line level, and up to the surface of the chart in your examples.
Again, you have six weekends/months in which to do this so you have plenty of
time—that is officially ten or eleven gates a weekend, if you cover all gates. Again, you
aren’t required to go deeply into the depth of all ten or eleven gates, or all sixty to sixty
six lines. Students must do their own work out of class.
Every teacher may have different ways of teaching the gates. The technical focus and
method remains the same: build them orally, step by step, out of your existing knowledge
and skill base, adding features as you go. The suggestion is to build your class practice
sessions in the manner they have been built so far, adding features as you go, and always
reinforcing previous knowledge with repetition and question and answer technique, and
by modeling the skill yourself, and by reinforcing, and enriching, with other technical
skills.
So, use your skill base (Line keynote plus value = interpretive base, framing out to the
Center and other frameworks and the 236 keynotes) and continue to stress the movement
of the Rave.
Reminder: As you reach the Profiling Gates (1,7,10,13,59,27,6,50) please emphasize
them line by line, including the classic teaching (Reference Tables in Rave Cartography
Teacher’s Chapter 8) and as updated in the 36 Roles February 2006 from Jovian Archive
and Rave Cartography Volume II.
Reminder to Teach and Account for Type, Authority, Circuit Emphasis, and
Profile: Ask Generators if they would like to respond to each other. Invite Projectors to
participate. Have Reflectors locate the flow of stellar life force within them and explain
that to the class, if possible (i.e., give the weather report at this level to illustrate the day’s
content). If Manifestors are not impacting or being impacted, inform them, and empower
or support them if correct. If they are overly impacting, coach the class in using Strategy

and Authority (i.e., use strategy-based group dynamics) to make this a creative
experience. Create the opportunity for the emotionally defined to ask questions
concerning content that was taught earlier in the day, or the day before. Etc.
Enrichment: Possibilities for this section might be technical and recording nuances, or
inviting a voice or breath coach, or a memorization expert.
Student Development: continue to monitor and acknowledge your students’
development and attitude as they progress.
Monthly MP3 Assignment:
To reinforce the students’ own process, assign them a ten to fifteen minute presentation
of the lines of their own chart in defined Centers in the context of the “moving rave”
principle, Using Rave I Ching format and resources, Describe each line in context: Gate,
Channel, Stream, Circuit, Circuit Group, Center, Conscious/Unconscious, Authority,
Type.
Line Enrichment Study Project: Outside of class, also have students investigate what
might be common about all first Lines in the Rave I Ching (not just the first line
keynotes, but in all the first lines).
Have them use their Type, Authority, Profile, or even Circuit group predominance to
conduct their investigation. They can draw their discoveries if Abstract, graph or
formulize them if they are Logical, create a Tribal identity for them if they are tribal, or
perhaps sing them if they are Individual. This exercise can be shared in class (verbally of
course) or simply kept in a journal form for students’ ongoing benefit from month to
month until all six line values are explored.
This ongoing assignment delivers the surface of the system and a personally relevant
experience of the common themes of each of the six lines.
This project can be assigned now and be completed right along, month by month, with
the Lines Sequence, or you can wait a couple of months until students have a feel for
more of the Gates at the Line level, and completed at the end of the entire PTL1 Course
(Keynoting Sequence III).

The Line as Binary
Exaltation and Detriment
Planetary Values
Review MP3 Assignment
At this point, it is time to become increasingly specific in your review of student MP3
assignments and developing analytic skills. Also review the home line study project (first
line) from last month, if you would like to do that in class. Remember to acknowledge
student work and progress as part of the developmental technique.
The Binary Nature of the Line and Interpretation
The Line’s Inherent Binary: Exaltation and Detriment
Before you can even begin to read the line, you have to see the inherent
binary. We have singularities with no exalted/no detriment, but it always says
so. There are also rare triplicities. But even the triplicity will be given within
the duality line reading itself except in some very rare cases like the 11th Gate.

Trying to work with them is to understand why planets are associated with
lines and what exalted and detriment really mean. This is a basic step in
getting them to master interpreting lines.
Exalted and detriment are just “this and that”. Not, “this is good and this is
bad.” It’s very easy to interpret the detriment as bad, but detriments are much
more valuable than exaltations, and they are also more interesting. When you
have a detriment you really have to get your hands dirty, where exaltations put
people on a real trip.
We’re just talking about the “this and that” of the entire generic framework.
You don’t get a different color if you got a detriment rather than an exalted.
Every single moment is actually a binary of what is in that particular sample
of the neutrino stream itself anyway. There are always “thises and thats" in
this general frequency we are getting.
Demonstrate the Binary and Alternate Line Practice with Practical
Experimentation with the Binary.
Introduce and teach the binary of the line. (Do not introduce fixation, at this particular
point. Fixation will be taught in depth on its own next month.)
Read lines within Gates, consider the differences and also the similarities between
exaltations and detriments.
(Note: You may want to choose Streams or configurations that offer binaries, lines
without polarities, and even a triplicity to teach during this section.)
Have students keynote by adding the line binary to their practice and experimentation.
Each element of the line binary (exaltation and detriment) is itself a binary. It consists of
two interpretive sentences, one written in regular text and the other written in italic text.
Explain the difference between, and genesis of, the first sentence (i.e., the non italicized
one) and the second sentences (i.e., the italicized one) in each of the binary Line
Readings. The first sentence comes from The Black Book, written by Ra Uru Hu in 1989
in Frankfurt-am-Berg Germany, first published in March of 1992, and sometimes referred
to as the first generation Rave I Ching. The second interpretive sentence comes from The
Book of Letters, or second generation Rave I Ching, also known as the White Book, also
written by Ra Uru Hu, and which was first published in 1994.
Class Exercise Option: Describe the exaltations and detriments of a few different lines
using keynote + line value = interpretive base. Remember to place the binary nature of

the line within context, i.e., it is just part of the flow and nature of the quantum system.
Give practical examples of how this works.
Lines Beyond the Binary: No Polarity and Triplicities
In class, find and address lines without exaltation or detriment such as the 54.4,
and the 47.5.
5.6 Neptune π no detriment
11.4 Moon π Venus π Sun σ
25.4 Venus π Jupiter π no detriment
37.1 Venus π no detriment
47.5 Venus π no detriment
47.6 Sun σ no exaltation, no polarity
54.4 no detriment, no exaltation
54.5 Sun π no detriment
57.3 Mercury π no detriment
58.2 Uranus σ no exaltation
Class discussion topic or assignment: what do lines with no polarity tell you about the
qualities they describe and what do they tell you about the binary?
Authors’ Note: not all versions and editions of the Rave I Ching are consistent
in their exaltation and detriment notation for certain lines.
Class Exercise Option: Consider the 11.4, which is a triplicity (the exaltation line
reading mentions that both the Moon and Venus are exalted and gives different line
readings for each position). Ra Uru Hu has said that on rare occasions you can find other
triplicates within the Rave I Ching, although this is the only one that mentions more than
one planet in exaltation or detriment within a specific line. Can you find other triplicities
within the Rave I Ching that might come under this description? What are they? Why
might these lines be triple? And using your context skill base, how, or would you

about the binary?

DAY TWO
Gates and Lines in Streams
Continue to drill using all keynoting techniques learned so far and always working with
the right hand page of the Rave I Ching as you teach Gates line by line. Remember to
create more class assignments that work with Type, Strategy and Authority at this more
schematic and detailed level of the line if necessary.
This month, emphasize the binary of the line as you teach, integrating material from day
one into your practice. Also, below is a Practice and Play option that builds on the depth
of previously learned material and context which you might wish to use here to reinforce
learning.
Practice and Play Option
Practice and Review Gate and Line Skills Learned So Far
(Note: class exercise sessions should not be too lengthy in order to avoid student
boredom. Practice and Play or class exercise should last between 45 and 90 minutes.
Exercises and teaching should “shake hands.”)
Begin by repeating last month’s Gate and Line keynoting exercise, aka, “This is the
House that Jack Built.”
Example:
Gate Keynotes: 46 PUSHING UPWARD, THE GATE OF THE
DETERMINATION OF THE SELF
Line keynotes: Being discovered; the prima donna; Projection; Impact; Pacing;
Integrity

Example:
Gate Keynotes: 46, PUSHING UPWARD, THE GATE OF THE
DETERMINATION OF THE SELF
Line keynotes: Being discovered; the prima donna; Projection; Impact; Pacing;
Integrity
Description: You only can push upward if you determine yourself and have the
right pacing and integrity. This will lead to being discovered have a lot of impact.
Then people will project on you and you will end up being a prima donna!!
Next, add line value and blue headings to the paragraph following the principle Line
Keynote As Priority; Keynote Plus Value Equals Interpretive Base.
Example:
You will only end up at the right place at the right time if you love your body. As
you determine yourself, you will push upward. To accomplish this, you need
integrity, which has three stages or perspectives. Begin by making mistakes, next
see it from a roof perspective, then, once you have discovered the pacing that is
practical for you, become an integrity role model. You will discover that you can
make a huge impact in your network, by being friendly, which will lead to
projections that you have to adapt to, and in the end you will be discovered. Being
discovered is a developmental process and requires lots of research—not
something that just happens innately because you are born with the genetic
marker. You start by feeling insecure about it, and then you grow into it, and start
behaving like a prima donna, and become a natural, in that, it all leads to
serendipity.
Class Dynamics: Account for “inter-type dynamics” i.e., at this point Projectors may
become very interested in the geometric schematics of Astrology, or the details of the
binary, while Generators will be more likely to want to look at their own charts, or
someone else’s, to integrate the detail of the teaching. Reflectors will feel the planets in
their bodies. Etc.
Enrichment Reminder: Voice, Breath, PC or Communications Coach, Counseling
Supervision are all possibilities.
MP3 Assignment: Include binary awareness and planetary keynoting in the monthly oral
assignment
Line Value Enrichment Assignment: Over the month, have students explore the
common themes of all the second Lines in the Rave I Ching.

Fixation: A Frustrating but Important Topic and Technique
The most important things are not the most exciting to teach. In fact, they are often the
most frustrating to teach. The topic of fixation falls into this category. It is hard for
students to grasp how fixation works because although the principle isn’t actually that
difficult, its execution can become deeply and, occasionally, inexplicably complex.
When students read the lines, certain questions relating to fixation inevitably come up.
These range from, “Why are these planets listed here?” to, “How does fixation work?”
And, “Uh oh, why aren’t any of my planets listed next to my line? Is this a problem?”
Even once you explain it to them, Students often need time, practice, and lots of

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
examples to understand the fixing mechanism easily, so you are going to have to spend
time on it.
Go through lots of charts, and be sure to explain exactly how the fixation principle works
in each one. Illustrate the mechanism very concretely with multiple examples for each
category of fixation (individual charts, transits, and composites), and also for each
variation of the fixation mechanism: simple fixation, where a planet fixes an activation in
the gate and line it activates, and harmonic fixation, where a planet activating one
harmonic Gate fixes a line activation in the other harmonic Gate. Also include examples
of all of the varieties of fixation itself: in exaltation, in detriment and in both exaltation
and detriment (i.e., where both fixation symbols superimpose and resemble a double-
pointed star).
Be sure to cover exaltation, detriment, and both exaltation and detriment in each
category. Use student’s own designs, demonstrate the fixing effect of transits on their
charts, and introduce them to composites on a surface level.
Please keep in mind that Transits and the Other per se (Composites), along with planetary
values at a more complete level, is the topic of PTL 2/Level 4. Although these topics are
introduced here, they are only introduced at a simple, basic level. Your students will
have plenty of time to explore them in depth at the next level of their education.
This is the head-scratching weekend. You can get confused yourself on
this weekend. I have never understood why fixation is confusing, but it
really is.
The Fixation Principle (Illustrated by the Harmonic Gates of Discovery, the
46th and 29th)
Be very concrete in your explanation and illustration. A selection of examples of how to
do this follow. This is because some students will learn better through some styles than
others. Some are verbal and some are visual. Of the visual examples, some are charts
that specifically illustrate the fixing mechanism, while others are Rave charts. Please use
all three means in your classes.

Simple and Harmonic Fixation
This first example uses the 29th Gate, which is harmonic to the 46th.
29.3 Evaluation In this context, properly assessed inaction.
Ä π Despite the urge and cost of inaction the knowledge that it is
sometimes better to fight another day. The power to wait.
Å σ A preference for withdrawal in principle with little regard for effect. The
inability to make commitments. The power of caution.
If Jupiter is the activation in the 29th Gate of the individual chart, and the gate is activated
in the third line, the presence of Jupiter will fix the third line in detriment. (See above.)
(If you are looking at your Rave I Ching, notice that this will also occur in a sixth Line
activation in the 29th Gate because Jupiter is also in detriment there.) This is simple
fixation.
If the entire Channel is defined, any Jupiter activation at all in the 29, (i.e. not just the
third or sixth Lines) will also fix any line in the 46th Gate that has the symbol of Jupiter
next to it. (In this case, once again the first line.) A Channel is a single life force unit;
therefore it is also a unified fixation zone. A planet activated in one Gate of a Channel
will always also fix a line associated with it in the harmonic Gate. When the fixing planet
occupies the harmonic Gate, while another planet that is not fixing activates the same
gate and line, the mechanic can be referred to as harmonic fixation.
46.1 Being Discovered Dedication in obscurity that is unexpectedly discovered.
È π Art for arts sake. Any creative endeavor that is self-fulfilling sooner or
later is recognized. The potential for creative success through
dedication.
Å σ The ability to judge the potential of those in obscurity but often solely
to benefit one’s own success. The determination to recognize and
benefit from the success of others.
Figure 7.1:
Above, Jupiter fixed in detriment in the first line of the 46th Gate.

Take the example of an individual design in which the Channel of Discovery is defined,
Jupiter activates the 29.1 Gate, and Venus activates the 46.1 Even though Venus does not
place the 46.1 in detriment, a downward pointing triangle will still appear next to the 46th
Gate activation in the chart database because Jupiter operates in the identical fixation
zone. This is because the fixation zone consists of the entire Channel and not just the
individual Gate. (Harmonic fixation.)
A third way of looking at this principle is graphically:
Figure 7.2:
Look up the planetary activations on either side of the Channel to see if they have a
fixing effect on either Gate: in this case, JU activates the 29.6 and therefore fixes the
46.1 through harmonic fixation. VE activates the 46.1, but fixes neither it, nor the 29.6,
because it is not a fixing influence on either of these lines.

Grey arrow: the activation does not have a fixing effect.
Red arrow: An example of harmonic fixation. The chart activation of the 29.6 fixes
Jupiter in detriment in the 46.1 because Jupiter is listed as the detriment in the 46.1 in the
Rave I Ching. The 29th Gate is the harmonic to the 46th and the other half of a single
unified fixing zone that consists of both Gates. Therefore, it gives any planet activated by
the 29th Gate exactly the same fixing effect on lines of the 46th Gate as a planet in that
line of the 46 would have.
Violet arrow: An example of simple fixation: the detriment is activated by Jupiter’s
presence in the same Gate, the 29.
Note that Jupiter also activates the detriment of the 6th Line of the 29th Gate through
simple fixation.

Figure 7.3: Example Two (above):
This example demonstrates a simple fixation in exaltation.
Check which planets activate each side of the Channel if they activate simple or harmonic
fixation (i.e. to see if any of them fix the same or harmonic Gate). In this example
specifically, see if MA fixes the 29.6 or 46.1, and if VE fixes 46.1 or the 29.6.
Grey arrow: no planetary fixation
Yellow: simple fixation activation of exaltation due to MA within the same line and
Gate. Because Mars does not fix the 46.1, no exaltation or detriment is activated in this
line.

This is a very complex example involving three planets, but it is easy to follow the
fixation pattern if you do it step by step.
1. Check the planets activating either side of the Channel if they have an effect
on either Gate. Specifically, check MA on the 29.5, 29.1 and 46.1, VE on the
46.1, 29.1 and 29.5, and JU on the 29.1, 29.5 and 46.1
Grey arrow: no fixation activated.
2. Red: detriment activated due to JU in 29.6 as indicated in the Rave I Ching
through harmonic fixation, although JU activates 46.1 in the chart.
Green: exaltation due to MA in 29.1 through harmonic fixation as indicated
in the Rave I Ching, although MA activates 29.5 in the chart.
Again, it is often helpful to work with both repeated visual and verbal and explanations
(not just charts) when working with this topic.
By the way, your students won’t necessarily understand all three of the explanations
above, although they will probably follow at least one. The first definition above was
more conceptual (i.e., individual) while the elaboration in the paragraph directly above
was more logical (i.e., it gave specific examples of a pattern while describing the visual
symbols and was therefore abstractly and logically collective). The third was also
collective (it reduced the principle to a visual pattern). By the way, if you can come up
with a really good tribal explanation of fixation, let us know. The following one has been
offered for comic relief at this particular moment: Jupiter is our leader and Venus is our
enemy’s leader and she has entered our Discovery territory to steal our food so we will
ask our defender Jupiter to overpower her and make him an offering in return.

Fixation in the Individual Chart
Figure 7.5: (for example chart above).
A chart with a few different examples of fixation activated by both of simple and
harmonic fixation. Use this chart or your own examples to continue your illustration
and teaching if necessary (or go on if it’s all clear).
In this case, ME in the 56.4 fixes not only Design ME in detriment (simple fixation) but
also the Personality and Design activations of the 11.5 in JU because ME fixes both of
these activations by harmonic fixation. Design SA in the 38.6 exalts this position, but not
the corresponding Personality SA in the third line of the same hexagram. And Design NE
in the 28.5 places the Personality Activation of Mercury in the 28.6 in detriment through
simple fixation because it occupies the same Gate as Mercury even though it is a separate
activation.
The person who has an exaltation or detriment becomes totally
dependent on that side of the frequency. They don’t get the benefit of the
full spectrum of energy available through the Channel.

Figure 7.6
A chart in which Neptune was also activated in the 46.1 would have both symbols next to
it – a six pointed star (because the line would be fixed in detriment by Jupiter by
harmonic fixation from the 29, and in simple exaltation by Neptune in the 46.1). This
would be referred to as a juxtaposed fixation.

Blue arrow: JU activates the detriment out of its position in the 29.1 NE activates the
exaltation due its position in the 46.1. This creates a symbol that resembles a six pointed
star.
A line that is fixed in both directions—exaltation and detriment---receives a six pointed
star symbol (the exaltation and detriment symbols superimposed). A juxtaposed fixation
can indicate extreme fixedness.
I am convinced that all backaches are created by transits that create the
six-pointed star.

Figure 7.7:
Juxtaposed fixation. In this chart, two activations are fixed in both exaltation and
detriment, resulting in a symbol that looks like a double pointed star but is actually two
fixation symbols. Each of these two fixing activations is the result of slightly different
planetary dynamics.
On the Design side, the 2.4 is fixed in exaltation and detriment. The activating planet is
Mars which is in detriment in the 2.4 (simple fixation). However, the Personality Venus
activation in the 14.1 in the same Channel, in this case, The Beat, also fixes this
activation in exaltation (harmonic fixation).
The dynamic of the personality side activation is a little more complex. The Personality
Sun is fixed in exaltation and detriment because in the 43.6 the Sun is exalted while Mars
is in detriment. Since Personality Mars also activates the 23rd hexagram, the Sun also
receives the detriment through harmonic fixation. However, Mars itself is exalted in the

23.6, so that activation is fixed in exaltation (simple fixation). In other words, Mars exalts
its own activation while applying the detriment to the 43.6.
There is something in that essential in the detriment for you to confront
and deal with, and that is that detriments aren’t necessarily bad. If you
are operating correctly, the detriment becomes a benefit. There are
things it brings to you if you are not revisiting it, or falling into it, and
following its Not-Self quality.
Tips for Generating Chart Examples with Fixations in Exaltation and
Detriment
Chart Example Tip: to easily generate example charts with double pointed stars if you
are short on them, go through charts with the 37/40 and 43/23 (the 34/20 doesn’t have
activations that meet this criteria) and look for inner (i.e., fast moving) planets such as
Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars that also operate within the fixing zone, but with the
opposing fixation value (i.e., detriment if Sun or Earth is exalted and vice versa). The
fast-moving planets occupy the same Channel more frequently due to their faster orbits,
and Venus and Mercury are never that far from the Sun, so it is easier to “catch” them in
the Channel, and on the line you need, than it is the other planets. For instance, the 40th
Gate has Sun or Earth fixed in five different lines, while the 37th Gate has fast moving
planets fixing in all lines, providing several possibilities for double fixation within the
Channel.
Also, for similar reasons, look for Gates and Lines that have the Sun or Earth and an
inner planet fixing the same line. (The 43.6 is an example.) The other easier way to catch
these activations if you need to is to take advantage of the slow movement of Pluto
through Gates. Since Pluto moves through a zodiac sign in 13 years, and therefore takes a
couple of years (2-3) to move through a Gate, and spends months in individual lines, you
can also generate charts that contain activations that are doubly fixed, because an inner
planet moves more cyclically through the Gate and Line that slow-moving Pluto is also
in.
Pluto began the 20th century in Gemini, and at the time of this writing is in late
Sagittarius. Many current young adults and older teenagers have Pluto in the Gates of
Scorpio: the very end of the 50, the 44, 28, 1, 43, and the 14. And many older current
young adults (bridging the Saturn return) have Pluto in Libra: the 18, 48, 46, 57, 32, and

most of the 50. The late middle to end of the American post-war “baby boom” into “Gen
X” is Pluto in Virgo: the very end of the 29, the 59, 40, 64, 47, and 6. And the heart of the
American “baby boom” and the sixties generation is Pluto in Leo: the tail end of the 56,
the 31, the 33, the 7, the 4, and the 29. Etc. So lines like the 6.4, fixed by Pluto and the
Sun, and the 43.3, and 31.5 that are fixed by Pluto and the Moon will also create this
configuration, and are not that hard to generate. Neptune and Uranus can also be useful in
this regard, although they occupy Gates for somewhat shorter periods of time.
It might take you a few minutes to puzzle through why and how this works, and which
planet does what where. But it does. It’s just one example of how fixation can even
confuse the teacher.
Planetary Keynotes as They Relate to Teaching Fixation
What do the planets mean? This is the next question that is likely to come up. Therefore,
teach very brief, superficial planetary keynotes as they apply to individual design
interpretation (again, do not cover planetary value, or the transit field to any depth
here—again, these are topics for PTL Level 2) and demonstrate keynoting them through
your gate and line base-using example charts or each other’s charts.
For your reference (This list combines planetary keynotes from a few different
generations of Human Design System sources):
Sun life force; where the light shines
Earth grounding and stability; roots
Moon what drives, moves and triggers
Mercury communication and what must be communicated
Venus values, morality, harmony, sociology
Mars immaturity, energy dynamics, action, desire
Jupiter law and protection; the inner laws of the individual
Saturn the judge; area of suffering if not correct; discipline
Uranus chaos and order; the unexpected, shock, charisma, science
Neptune illusion, spirituality, dreams, veiling, art
Pluto truth, individual inner truth, the grandmother, psychology
The Nodes are not included in this discussion because they are covered on their own in a
later class segment. Nodes can be fixed in a chart if another planet activated in the same

definition has also been fixed, i.e., in a chart that has the moon fixed in detriment in the
57.1, a nodal position in the 57.5 will also be fixed in detriment.
Kiron and Sedna mark Cycles (Sedna marks cycles for Rave children) but do not
differentiate the basic individual design.
Remember to discuss the strong influence of Sun/Earth (the incarnation cross markers) in
comparison to other planetary activations.
Whenever something needs to be pointed out to you, it comes in the place
where Saturn is activated in your design. As long as you are correct,
Saturn is not problematic in the chart.
The conditioning of fixing is far more powerful than conditioning of an open center. It
really is changing your nature, not your nurture. It is a very, very powerful conditioning
force. You can’t do anything about it other than avoid aura that fixes it, and if it’s Pluto,
you’re in big trouble because you’ll have to travel a really long way to get out of reach.
Use very superficial planetary keynotes to describe the variation
Fixation is how to make money. Everything about our associations with
the other; the Pentas we live in; is all about fixing, fixing, fixing. This is a
deep theme. At the moment you show students the relationship they can
see that as soon as a planet fixes a line, it filters in a unique way. So you
can be very, very superficial in your keynoting and describing. Mercury
filters differently than Mars. Use superficial keynotes to describe the
variation. This is a layer that is going to become very important when we
get to PTL 2 and start dealing within influence of planets.

Fixation in the Integration Channel

within the Integration Channel. It is common for charts with Integration Channel
Definition to have many fixations due to the complexity of the Channel and the many
opportunities for harmonic fixation due to all the different available definition fields.
Q & A :
Q: Why is the 10.6 conscious in detriment?
A: Because 10.4 unconscious is activated by SA and therefore results
therefore in the detriment of 10.6 (PL ex, SA de in this line)

Q: Why is 34.6 conscious in detriment?
A: Because 34.1 unconscious is activated by JU which fixes the 34.6
in detriment. (EA ex, JU de)
Q: Why is 34.1 unconscious in exaltation?
A: Because 10.4 unconscious is activated by SA which fixes the 34.1
in detriment (SA ex, PL de)
Q: Why is 57.3 unconscious in exaltation?
A: Because 10.6 conscious is activated by ME and therefore fixes the
exaltation of the 57.3 (ME ex, NO PLANET IN DETRIMENT)
…etc., through all the applicable fixations in the chart if desired.
Continue using simple planetary keynotes to describe the fixation action in this chart or
another chart. For example:
This line communicates acute intuition powerfully (57.3 exalted).
Then, keynote in context:
This 57.3 is someone who is learning to survive intuitively through trial and error
adaptation, and unconsciously knows how to acutely communicate what they
spontaneously hear in order to ensure their own survival. Survival is a function of the
spleen, empowers others, and illustrates the extraordinary power of clarity.
Planetary filtering keys: Venus and the Moon
Certain planets are filtering keys for the totality. Venus is exalted or detriment in almost
every single hexagram. The Moon is mentioned in almost every hexagram. By the same
token, one’s own Venus and Moon positions are guaranteed to frequently bring out
exalted or detriments in others.
This is the beginning of finally getting to the planets and realizing how key they are: this
is the imprinting. The special effect of a planet in that area is that it distorts the flow (of
neutrinos) there. If you don’t have an exaltation or detriment, you are better off. You get
the balance, the full energetic flow.

Fixation by Transit
Next, demonstrate how transiting exaltations and detriments color and texture the chart.
Explain how MMI only shows the exaltation or the detriment if the line is fixed in either
direction in any given chart because in this case the line’s quality is fixed, which doesn’t
mean it is good or bad.
Since you cannot get to PTL 2 (Transits and the Other) until you do keynoting, all you
are going to show students here is that someone can fix your gate and line in the “just
now” transit sense--are any of the transiting objects fixing a line of theirs?
Every time the moon goes through any gate in Integration it fixes me in
over sensitivity because it fixes my 10.1 Personality Jupiter in detriment.
This is inevitable and unavoidable. For students, this inevitably is the
harshest thing. Certain days and people will always yank you due to
fixing. It’s a prime example of Helplessness: you can’t even control your
exaltations and detriments.

Class exercise: using the Rave I Ching to find the answers, ask students to find out how
much time every month the moon spends fixing the Integration Channel, and the different
states one can be fixed in, depending on the available lunar activations within the
Channel. Then have students look at the transit field for the month (you can provide this
in chart form) and find where in their charts they might be fixed on the day of the class,
or will be fixed during the coming month.

Caption: Pluto was in the 34th Gate from October 1, 1996 until December 29, 1997

kind of fixation by transit provides an interesting contrast to the very brief and frequent
fixations of the Integration Channel by the Moon in this chart.

My son, Jiva was born with Jupiter in the 22nd Gate, which locked my 12.1 in
detriment. The 12.1 is the line of the monk and the detriment is Simon the
Stylite. This is the line of total and often absurd withdrawal - -Simon the
Stylite being this crazy monk who spent his whole life sitting on top of a stone
column. What a nut! And since Jiva was born, I rarely leave the house. The
little guy even enjoys keeping me at home when he leaves. He just watches
me in my studio and waves goodbye. The Gods had a great sense of humor,
giving me a child with this activation. But I was born to be fixed that way:
what to do?
Conditioning can be deeply physical; it can change your whole behavior. It’s
biological. You know like the line, “he used to be such a nice guy until he met
his wife,” or something to that effect. The vehicle is the life, and now I am
Simon the Stylite. And I will be Simon the Stylite until my son grows up and
leaves the house, and then something else will happen.
When there is no fixation, we get both sides of the neutrino stream activated
within us in our lifetime; we see both sides of the picture. But if someone in
your life fixes an aspect of yours, you never get to experience the whole
picture of that aspect of yourself when you are with that person.

SIDELINE
From Richard Beaumont, Director of Human Design United
Kingdom and Human Design Films
The second line person walks on the path where other worthy ones have walked.
Deeply spiritual, the second line is the way of the pilgrim. Adamant in their
devotion, they will not be distracted from their mission. Their self-esteem is
bound together by the force of their convictions. Equally though, should they
ever discover that the focus of their devotion is not up to its projected
saintliness, their retribution is final and terrible. Although for many of them
'spiritual' is, as you would expect, connected to God or some such higher power,
for some 'spiritual' could be the peace that comes through knitting or painting or
reading or the highest (or darkest) love - in all cases, self-motivated devotion is
the key.
In their cave they weave secret patterns, known only to them. This hidden
power can be deeply magical if sanctified with enough focus and childlike
innocence, and, indeed, even alter external reality in a way that it bows in a level
of respect that matches such love. However, if such power is exercised without
this motivation, its workings can be profoundly illusionary and they can become
trapped in a web of their own making.
Second lines resonate especially with children, for in truth, they are themselves
forever young. Nature and the natural world is also something that calls most
second lines: conversely, in the binary, a few may have a love of the city alone.
All second lines say 'Leave me alone' - I have never seen an exception to this -
and require plenty of time in their own space. So to be healthy they all need to
have their own room/house/island. For those who do not have this, a deeper
misery I cannot imagine. They also often surprise others with their natural gifts
and do not really see their own genius.

Their harmony to the fifth line often projects them into high profile positions,
which will only be sustained if they can have plenty of time alone.
Many of them can be untidy in their environment (or the opposite), but know
that changing the position of anything placed by them is regarded as an
unwelcome interference.
Second lines are currently 'out of time', they do not fit into the current world
environment, and they often wear clothes that consistently resonate with a
particular historical period. At certain times of day or night, they often shimmer
and look unlike the face one is familiar with; even those who are naturally
involved in the world have an other- worldliness about them. Hidden between
the first and third lines, they each contain a mystery that is not so much revealed
as encountered. They can dazzle and enrich with their natural light.
Whether the second line is a 2.4; 2.5; 5.2 or 6.2 makes a big difference to the
recipe - the most spiritually motivated would be the 2.5 or 5.2, the most
missionary the 2.4 and the least innocent the 6.2. Their whole flavor however is
as described, although the quantities of each ingredient differ depending on the
profile.
58.2 Perversion
Often misunderstood as something distasteful and sordid, this gate and line is
really about the compulsion to revel in one's own joy. I see it as an insatiable
appetite for what those who do not have it would say is an 'acquired' taste, but in
truth, those that have it, surround themselves with a world that is entirely natural
to them –again, it is not so much acquired as revealed. A natural twist that
cannot be smoothed out.
34.2 Momentum
Once called by the fifth line, such beings can rarely be stopped. Their power is
awesome. They can be a boon or a liability, for though they contribute much,
they often will not listen to necessary guidance until it is too late. Like a horse
destined to gallop, once called, you'd better know how to hang on or get out of
the way.

lines in the Rave I Ching at home this month.

We return to the zodiacal arc of the gate. This is the last entry provided in the context
database (left hand page of the Rave I Ching) and a doorway for opening up the
significance of the stellar ocean/neutrino information feed and consciousness. This theme
in turn leads into a discussion of the Nodes and their significance including an example
chart analysis.
Neutrino Consciousness
When I first began to give introductory lectures on Design, I would describe
the neutrino ocean and Mars. The Rave Mandala is just an abstract graphic
with borders and limits that are more conceptual than actual and, of course,
what actually surrounds that wheel is an enormous star field generating a
neutrino ocean in every direction all the time.
We on this planet, in our solar system, in this galaxy, are being penetrated by
neutrinos everywhere. They come through here from so far back in time that
there were no beings of any kind here on this planet when the neutrinos
emerged from the star they came through or from. All of us are also always
moving around a powerful neutrino instrument, our Sun. Our Sun dominates
the neutrino consciousness since over seventy percent of neutrinos are
generated by our Sun, and the electromagnetic relationship of the Sun and
Earth. We all share the same solar system, and the same worship of the sun;
we are all in the thrall of the Sun, and yet there is this vast, vast, information
pool that is also filtering in from beyond.
All Mars or any planet or object does is get in the way of starlight. If, in your
Design, you have Nodal activations without planetary conjunctions to them,
then you have the benefit of being activated by pure trans -solar system input.
The Nodes are perpetually open windows for receiving both the pure and

influenced stellar ocean, and all Mars has done is to be in it. Neutrinos and
objects are cars banging into each other. Red paint gets left on the white car;
white paint gets left on red car, and this is physics. Neutrinos, coming from
wherever Mars happens to be orbiting in the galaxy at that nanosecond, just
slam into and through it, and pick up its white paint as they move through. In
the world of humans, the equivalent is the Left Angle because it is always
crossing geometric lines.
We are Star Material
We ourselves are star material. Certain elements in the human brain have only
existed since stars were born and died. Stars have an enormous organic and
energetic influence on our lives. The Carthaginians, who were travelers, relied
on stars to guide them in their movement. The sailor cultures of
Mediterranean were also very star conscious. The Arabs named many of the
stars.
Every star provides a current or fount to the neutrino ocean. Some of them,
like, the Pleiades, Sirius and Dubhe, the Great Bear, have powerful
personalities that have equally enormous recognition impact on humanity, and
are all mentioned in the Old Testament, New Testament, Koran, Bhagavad-
Gita, and by Confucius. But they all have personalities, and the streaming that
comes from each of them is something we recognize. In the 19th century, the
British author Vivian Robson collated all this material into a single book,
placed the stars in the heavens, and gave them values.
When, as teachers, we open up this arc to our students, we must make sure
that we remember what this arc is: a quadrant of the consiousness ocean; a
slice of space. Don’t you dare in your arrogance think that you can understand
how many stars fill that quadrant with light.
As each neutrino passes through your personality crystal it oscillates, and as it
oscillates it changes. Its life does not end in the physical realm of you and
your experience because the instant it imprints you, it’s gone.

In your lifetime you lay out an information aura that expands endlessly, and
does not stop just because you die. It keeps on moving out and out, like
ripples in an enormous sea. This is what it is all about. This is the deepest
level of mystical thought. We are one with the totality, and we are each
making a unique contribution in consciousness to the totality all the time.
Think of the trajectory of consciousness we have been putting out into the
universe, layer after layer, throughout all time. And of all the new stuff is
pouring back into this enormous roiling consciousness ocean, and the birth
and death of stars, and us at the center; taking it all in, getting it all. This is the
magic. You yourself are a filter of the entire consciousness field, and how
grand and magnificent that is.
We are not here to be inanimate— we are here to be conscious. And beyond
consciousness, we are here to have the potential for awareness, and beyond
that, we have the potential for awakeness. But first one has to accept what it
means to be conscious. Consciousness is us being a filter. First we filter it,
and then we put it back out. It goes through us and then through the other.
Being imprinted means having a unique interference pattern. Just like Mars
does, or any other planet does. Our students are being given generics in
dealing with what is ultimately an absolute, which means until we get to the
very bottom of the pattern everything is a generic.
What to Do
Open up this topic in class. If you like, point out the major fixed stars in sections of the
zodiac that correspond to each gate. (You can find this material in Robson or other fixed
star reference books and web resources.)

The Nodes
The Nodes are the most unusual thing in the calculation and first must be
understood visually. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
curving in space. This is precisely what the Nodes represent. They are not an
object; only a position (the degrees where the orbit of the moon crosses the
orbit of the sun) and an out position, and cannot be discussed other than
through line. To understand them, go back to the “2,” Personality and Design,
Road and Tunnel. When you are looking at the nodes, you are looking at a
very, very long elevated road with a tunnel underneath it, and the two join
together from the starting point to the finishing point. The name of this road
changes at midlife, but the road stays the same, and when the name changes, it
brings you a different world. It’s your road, after all.
So if you are a right angle, you go down the road bumping into the things, and
if you are a left angle, you go down looking for someone to help you go down
the road better. Profile is a costume; and some people trip over theirs. The
Sun/Earth are doing the programming and the Nodes are the line you move
along. The very sophistication of Design has led to obscuration of things
people need to know, and understanding the nodal road is something very,
very important for your students to grasp. It’s like a double-decker bus that
has all of its windows covered on the first level. The Personality is sitting up
above it all looking around and sees the elevated highway.
You have to introduce certain things in a chart, and then you must introduce
lines of Nodes.
If you have a third line Personality and third line Personality Nodes, your bus
is on a third line road, which looks like a terrible one. Its mantra is, “If I don’t
make money, I will never get down the highway.” There are so many things to
discover on that road; so many things to learn, and you are going to learn most
of those other things because they bang into you. That road just isn’t safe.
And if the unconscious Nodes are also in the same gates, but let’s say the 6th
Line, then the vehicle is on same damn road, but just underneath. The
Personality Node is actually just an illusion, a perception of what the road is
like. So in this case, the Personality says there will be bumps in the road.
Meanwhile, the Personality itself is still looking for the Nodes. There can be
conflicts between your Profile and your road. For instance your profile is a
tuxedo, but your road leads you through slums. We are attracted to people

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
whose Nodes have the same lines as our Profiles. Our Profile drives us down
the roads where they live, and if there is a conflict between our Profile and our
Nodes, we think they have a better road than we do. For instance, a 5th line
vehicle has a hard time with 3rd and 6th line roads.
Regardless of your Profile, it is the people on your road (the ones who
conform to your Sun/Earth or Nodes) who will matter to you in your life. You
will see these relationships. They are just there. For instance, it is very
common for parents to have their Sun/Earth configured to their child’s Nodes.
Dissonance between Profile and Nodes
A midlife crisis is born out of a bad relationship between the profile and
nodes. For instance, my 5th line Personality can’t handle the 3rd line road but
my 43/23 3rd line Nodes can. My mind can relate to that road.—I am an
awake capitalist and I say it with sheer pleasure. I am in a third line process:
this highway is all about that.
But what about a 5/1 with a sixth line nodal title? What would that guy do?
Take a detour? Build another highway? Could he stop his 6th line node from
being attracted to a 6th line road? Your personality is designed to have a good
relationship with the node but it’s not always meant to be nice or easy.
Otherwise, you don’t develop any intelligence or feelings. It is meant to be
something you only accomplish in surrender and the mechanics of surrender
are Strategy and Authority. This is the only way to work out the incongruities
and dissonance of your Design.
Class Exercise on the Nodes
To reinforce their own process, have students look at their own charts and analyze the
lines of the Nodes and Sun/Earth. Ask them to each describe their Nodal direction and
how it feels to them in their life. (This allows students to learn from other students, so
that they can apply this technique later on with clients, and also to see how they are
moving along in their life according to the relationship of their Profile and Nodes.)

Oppositions: At this point you may, at a very surface level, introduce the nodal pairs (the
32 oppositions in the wheel) and how they tell stories about scenes and directions and
views in life.
Cross of Life: Discussion of the Oppositions leads directly into an Overview of the
Cross of Life if appropriate.
The Incarnation Cross: Here, you also have the option to superficially introduce the
Incarnation Cross, or, if you have already introduced it when reviewing the left hand page
of the Rave I Ching, review it briefly in this context. Since the major fixed stars
(influencing the quarters) have been mentioned, you also have the option of briefly
introducing the Quarters in association with the Incarnation Crosses. However, if you
have not had training in Quarters or Incarnation Crosses, please obtain and refer to the
Channel 88 seminar on the quarters before introducing this material. Of course, none of
this material can be covered in any depth until PTL 3/Level 5 Incarnation Crosses (after
the planets and transits have been covered in PTL 2).

DAY TWO
Introduce Next Section of Gates in Streams
Practice and Play Possibilities and Reminders
Keynote and Context Scrabble.
Examine and discuss the flow of Gates (the Gate in question, the one before, and the one
after) in the available contexts: for instance, by chop, astrological sign or fixed star
quadrant, Gate keynotes, center framework, biochemical (body system) associations, etc.
Type Tip: Since this level of line context enters classic Projector and Reflector territory
(it’s systematic and the context is no longer the Bodygraph, but The Program), remember
to stream Generators into the process by, for instance asking them questions they can
respond to about the material, or suggesting ways they can use the left hand context page
as a response process.
Possible class discussion topics: How might the understanding or interpretation of an
individual line benefit from this level of context? Is it possible to synthesize this level
context in a reading, or a does it simply enrich the awareness and depth of the analyst’s
skill and development? Is there any way the awareness of the vastness and timelessness
of the neutrino field can be conveyed through a reading of the surface of the chart? Or
does this level of awareness also simply enrich the analyst’s development of awareness of
and depth in the system?
Memorization Techniques and Process
When I was a teacher, I took a class of fourteen years olds who were
considered difficult students. In about four months, I taught them the history
of the whole universe. As part of the course, I included a memory technique
where you would put things you learned inside an object in your head, like a
cube. And after they did they that, I would take the first letter of each of the
things in the cube and make an anagram and the anagram would open up the
cube.

The point was not artificially creating an illusion, but having an artificial
technique for being able to say what is going on. The mind is good at storing
and providing connectivity and is a source of structure in that sense. The Ego
provides ability to build the structures.
SIDELINES
“First Generation” Gates Reference chart from J.R. Randy Richmond
Chairman of the IHDS (International Human Designs Standards Board) J.R.
Randy Richmond began this document in 1999 after Ra Uru Hu taught him
circuitry in two days in Sedona. It contains some very specific detail keywords
about gates that analysts educated in later generations may find precious. He
added a bit to the document over the next couple of years, but points out that the
structure and wording of the system as written here is consistent and logical with
the teaching of Human Design into the present, a quality of the Human Design
System that Projectors, in particular, tend to recognize and point out for the rest
of us. Chart begins on the next page.

fourth lines in the Rave I Ching. Option: Also consider the fourth line’s resonance to the
first line. How do the fourth lines externalize the first lines? How does context enhance
students’ understanding of this process and the relationship between these keynotes?
How does Circuit keynote and Channel Type enhance it? Continue to review the depth of

Advanced and Detailed Exercises for Class and Home Study
Review MP3 Assignment
If you haven’t already, consider acknowledging what is stylistically unique about each
student’s readings according to their Design as you review the assignment. Another topic
to consider is the emergence of Not-Self strategies in analysis technique. Or, review each
student’s Outer Authority and articulation possibilities thereof (see Outer Authority in
Gates Month 4).
Gates and Lines in Streams
Now that most of the basic content of the Rave I Ching has been taught, simply continue
to teach gates and lines in stream context, drilling, practicing orally, and keynoting as
above. This chapter contains more sophisticated class oral practice ideas and home
enrichment assignments. The home enrichment assignments can also be done or begun in
class if you would like. This is a good moment to assign them because you will be able to
review them, if you like, next month as you prepare students for the keynoting sequence
that completes this course.

Advanced Class Practice Ideas
Describing Gates and Lines By Type
Have Generators work in pairs and describe gates, lines, and any other feature of a chart
to each other. Have them describe the lines in their own and each other’s charts. Have
Projectors work with each other’s charts or charts they bring in to class of people they
know. Reflectors can work with the composite of their chart and the transit field; what
definition and fixation might this moment bring?
Continue to stress context, framing and the depth of the material. As they begin to gain
competence at the detail level, always remind students to work their way back to the
surface level of the chart in the context of Type, Strategy, Authority, Profile, and the 236
keynotes in their descriptions.
Describe Gates and Lines of Another Type to Your Type
Then, have each Type trade charts with another and practice with those charts focusing
on the context of Type.
Describe Gates and Lines to Another Type
Pair up “mismatched” Types, e.g. Sacral with non-Sacral. And/or “mismatch” authorities
instead, e.g., pair the Emotionally defined with the Splenic. You can also pair up defined
Heads and Throats with undefined Heads and Throats.
For instance, how, or does, the line readings practice experience change for each person
when they work with another Type? Can each student feel his or her energy field being
conditioned by the Type or definition of the other? Look at student charts.
Is it more difficult for the open Centers to express themselves when working with a
partner who is defined in that same Center? Can students with open Heads, Ajnas, and/or
Throats express themselves more or less clearly when working with defined Heads,
Ajnas, and/or Throats? Etc.
Invite the class to share their experiences and discoveries with each other.

Class Exercise: Line Mirrors
Sometimes, if you look at the lines (line by line) of one gate next to the lines of its
harmonic gate, each informs your understanding of the other through the context of the
specific gate and line keynote harmonics.
For instance:
The 15.6 and the 5.6 can be both interpreted as referring to the other hexagram. The 15.6
refers to weeding out the weakest part of an extreme flow (Self Defense), which can be
interpreted as fixing a pattern. Meanwhile, the 5.6 is Yielding. In the exaltation: the
growth of awareness that comes with bending to the universal flow.
All the lines of the 23rd hexagram have blue umbrella introductions, while none of the
lines in the 43rd hexagram do. This suggests that unique insight is always instant and
genetically available from birth, but individual expression of this insight is always
something that must be learned over time and in interaction with the environment. It is
easy to weave a story from here.
Often, the lines of the 37 and the 40 mirror each other by being part of the clearly
identical process of supporting community, the difference being that the 37 supports the
process by bringing together, and the 40 supports the process by removing that which
threatens it. For instance: The 37.5 supports the community through Love (“perfected
sharing” in the exaltation). Meanwhile, the 40.5’s (Rigidity) umbrella introduction
describes: The recognition that to achieve liberation all negative forces must be rejected.
Pair up students to explore harmonic gates line by line in this manner. Share favorite
results. While students share, use Q and A prompting to make sure they can articulate
what they have discovered in Context up to the surface level of Type, Strategy and
Authority. Or, have them begin with a line’s Type and work back down in context to the
level of their line level discoveries.
The Special Effect of Slow-Moving Planets (Pluto and Neptune) in
Exaltation and Detriment
The 25.3 is one of my favorite Gate and line combinations because it
functions so oddly. Pluto is in detriment, but because the 25.3 is on the
Pisces/Aries cusp and it takes Pluto well over 260 years to go around the
Wheel, and it will be another sixty or seventy years to get to that degree,
no one is alive today has the detriment, which means it doesn’t operate. It
is not in the world now. So someone carrying the 25.3 automatically gets

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
the exaltation. What is so interesting about that for me is, that in the last
hundred and twenty years or so, there has been an enormous ability for
human beings not to fail, and the tremendous amount of power of
initiations in the scientific realm is based on this ability to withstand
failure and keep moving on; obviously very much a third line theme to
keep one’s balance, on one’s feet.
Using an ephemeris or a chart generated by the teacher to show the slow movement of
Pluto and Neptune through the gates over the past hundred years (not hard to create),
have students find other lines in the Rave I Ching whose exaltations or detriments are not
currently embodied by life force in the world now. What might this mean? Conversely,
are there any exaltations or detriments of Pluto or Neptune that have been prominent in
the world in the last hundred years but will not be present later?
Repeating Keynote Line Study
99 lines of the Rave I Ching have keynotes that can also be found in other Hexagrams
(sometimes more than one other Hexagram). For instance, the keynote of the 4.2 is
Acceptance, as is the keynote of the 60.1.
Ask students to find all 99 of these lines over the month and prepare to verbally compare
and contrast each identical keynote (or a selection of them) using Context. Have them
present their results in next month’s class. (Line keynotes may be repeated up to four
times in the Rave I Ching. See the list below.)
You can also assign this as a home exercise.
Note: non-English translations do not necessarily have the exact same repeating
keynotes. Discussing this variation would also make an interesting exercise.

DAY TWO
Gates and Lines in Context
Teach your next selection of gates and lines in context. Use the exercises
above or any others to practice the material.
The 54.2 holds back a lot of its potential and can have water problems. The 54
is the ultimateGatefor the 2nd line to be in because it is the great calling gate.
The 19 flirts to find its resources, but the 54 is always looking for someone to
call it. It tries to attract attention: “Look at me, I am good, I need a raise.” It
can also be perceived as disloyal because it is not aware of consequences of
being called. There can be jealousy within the Tribe when the 54.2 is raised
up.
There is a vast spectrum of being recognized in the 54.4. The recognition
could be completely mundane, and it could be completely transcendent and
fry your brains.
The 44thGateis an arm reaching up to the sky and a hawk flies down and lands
on it.
The 41.5 is desire with limitation always. With no outlet. But fives are the
ones that have the ability to present a heretical desire. Due to this, by the way,
the beginning of each genetic sentence is an instruction to project on the five.
The 41.5 says, “I am jumping over this chasm” and the Other says, “If you
can, I can.” When you have the 41.5 and are on the experiential path, you are
going to take the heat for anything going wrong, and fantasy will not come
out the same by the time the Fates get through with you. Someone will read 5
seduction, but see 2 magic. The resonance is completely practical.
All sixth line beings are under deep pressure and must be able to yield (5.6) to
stay healthy. They are also yielding to the inevitability that the road leads to
death. That is always the punctuation that is at the end of any process. To
yield to pressure is to be able to flow. And the moment you accept yielding to
the flow, the flow will reveal its process.

SIDELINE
Breath of The Professional Human Design Analyst’s Voice by
Chiara Gasparro, second generation Human Design System
Teacher and Analyst and Breathing Coach.
Each Human Design Analyst’s voice is uniquely designed to awaken others.
Words are sculptured exhales formed by the movement of air passing through
the respiratory system and vibrating the vocal cords. Communication is then
empowered by the inhale in this automatic cycle of energy generation and
distribution. Every Throat Center Gate has its unique vibration that “breathes” to
support the health of the throat, thyroid, and all related bodily functions. Every
Analyst’s voice is unique.
The Inner Foundation for Each Throat Gate’s Outer Expression
Gates 23, 8, 12, 20, 16, 35 and 45 are grounded in receptivity to the “seeds” of
expression “planted” in one’s consciousness, maturing into verbal
communication.
Gates 62, 31, 33, and 56 are centered in a solid inner core formed from
experimental and experiential data that flows into that core then outward into
verbal communication.
Gate 23’s outer knowing voice insightfully empowers the communication of
inner knowing that is solid and centered as the mountain.

Gate 8’s outer creative voice empowers verbal contributions that flow into
other’s lives as easily as water falls from the sky and travels over the earth.
Gate 12’s outer mutative voice empowers creative expression from the still
point in the center of one’s daytime and nighttime universe.
Gate 20’s outer voice, expressing in the now, empowers communication like a
tree grounded in the earth, yet easily bending with the winds.
Gate 16’s outer voice of experimentation shares communication enthusiastically
with the arousing quality of the thunder and lightning that releases the
nourishing rains.
Gate 35’s outer voice of experience shares a hunger for progress and change,
expressing with the vitality and totality of sparks flaming into the fires of
transformation.
Gate 45’s outer voice of the gatherer attracts and gives supportive
communication like the waters held in the lake for all kingdoms of life to use
and enjoy.
Gate 62’s outer voice of organizer of opinions, shares through communication
of logical details with the arousing quality of the thunder and lightening that
announces the arrival of the nourishing rains.
Gate 31’s outer voice of leadership shares influential communication like the
waters held in the lake for all kingdoms of life to use and enjoy.
Gate 33’s outer voice of wisdom shares memories from the still point in the
center of one’s daytime and nighttime universe.
Gate 56’s outer voice of stimulation shares universal ideas expressing with the
vitality and totality of sparks flaming into the fires of transformation.
Breathing That Is Solid and Centered
Activities connected with mountains/rising terrain and related art, music and
stories are reminders to connect with mountain energy. Breathing deeply as the
vertical spine rises upward from a stance with feet planted solidly on the earth,
balanced, as arms and hands rise up, up, upward will nourish a solid and
centered analyst’s natural voice.

Sit quietly. Focus on a Gate’s inner and outer image, its word and/or sound.
Connect with your breathing. Allow breath to flow naturally for the
empowerment of the inner and outer voices of that Gate. Notice the Gates of
your Throat Center: totally open? Open with dormant Gates? Defined with
active Gates? Connecting with other Gates to make Channels? As each Gate’s
inner and outer image, its word and/or sound activates your breathing, you will
be “breathed” by these primitive elements of nature to empower your voice
whenever you speak your Human Design.
Enrichment Options: Now that you know your students well, this is an ideal month to
invite an enrichment expert in an area you select especially to support their unique needs.
You can repeat an area you have already discussed in class at a more advanced or specific
level if you like.
Home Line Enrichment Exercise: Have students consider the common themes of the 5th
lines in the Rave I Ching. Also, have them consider how each or a selection of 5th lines
call out the corresponding 2nd line in the same hexagram. In addition, can a 5th line of one
Hexagram call out the 2nd line of another?
MP3 Assignment: Develop an assignment that balances an awareness of line detail in
the reading with an awareness of the surface of the reading. Have the student keynote up
to the surface from the detail or down from the surface to the detail as clearly, helpfully,
and articulately as possible.

At this point in the course, before you move on to Keynoting, you might wish to play the
first “baseline” oral assignment each student completed (after Month 1) and compare it to
this month’s assignment as you review. Compare and contrast.
The line is setting foundation for Keynoting. It is the frame of the third
level of this course, Keynoting, which is the vehicle for recognizing and
analyzing chart continuity.

Review Lines and Prepare Students For Keynoting
Drill students intensively on line framework at the line level to see what framework they
have and what they have within it. Your information base is all of the lines, gates, and
streams you have covered in context so far. (You can also switch the review and gates
and lines structure this month, teach the lines first, and then review everything the second
day if you wish.)
Keynoting is the stringing of things together. Up to this point you have taught
students the foundation of it. The line is written there and if it is read outside
of context you have no way of framing it.
For example:
46.2 The prima donna: difficult and demanding nature or unrealistic demands.
You ask: Realistic demands about what, concerning what? And how do you
get to make unrealistic demands directly? When you finally get to line, there
honestly isn’t a mystery.
The basis of keynoting is to take that line and string it out, and work it back
up to the surface. This is the poetry of the geometry. Introduce students to the
concept of keynoting and prepare them for it without specifically teaching it at
this point.

The line has no umbrella introduction. It’s a binary. It relates to the
determination to say “no” to restrictive commitments on the one hand, or to
deceive onesself or others by having to break promises.
For this person, integrity is an either/or thing, a “this or that”. This is all about
commitment: how you can either enter into a commitment or not.
The 46th is the Gate of serendipity, good fortune. If you add the keynotes of
the 29, you see that the G Center, Identity, Self, and Integrity are very
important to identity of that person. Their sense of Self is based on their sense
of integrity. The G Center is defined to the Throat, so their expression is an
expression of their identity and their integrity.
Therefore, this Emotional Projector gets into a lot of trouble shooting off its
mouth and the adjective is the 46. Everything that comes out of this person’s
throat is unconscious, and you can bring it back to that Gate, because the only
conscious gate in the configuration is the 46. This person deeply identifies
with this identity and is always trying to verbalize it.
We have a 3/5 personality dealing with 6th line harmony. With a third line
personality, anything that can go wrong will go wrong. There is a depth of
acute intuition in the 57.3
Make sure the student can take the line up into the more general context of the
chart. With the line “prima donna,” this person thinks that they are a prima
donna, but they are not. Prima donna is only one aspect of their nature within
the general context you have created for them.
So, what is the function or proper interpretation of the 46th Gate?
To answer this, go to the 33/13. This is where experience gets codified as
memory. We need prodigal memory, which is the end of the abstract process.
This quality of integrity as expressed by the 46.6 is being pulled into that
experiential process, so the way of being a witness has two conditions. Either
this person is going to witness themselves saying “no” to restrictive
commitments, or this person is going to add to the collective memory of what
it means to not say no and break promises. And both of these ways will affect
the way a Prodigal stores experiential memory. If someone comes into their
life carrying the Neptune in detriment, their integrity will operate as such and
the voice that says “I remember” will be fixed to one side. In this case, that
person will share how integrity gets destroyed through breaking promises, and
they will experience the destruction of their integrity because they break
promises. I guarantee this will happen as long as they are operating out of the
Not-Self and as an initiating verbal gunslinger.

Tell this third line personality that it is here to see how easy it is for its
integrity to break down. It is here to see how to make commitments, so it can
maintain integrity or make money, and if you don’t operate correctly your
integrity will not only be stripped from you; it will be spat upon.
All you have to do is follow the track to “bake the cake.” That is, follow the
moving track of the chart. Whatever it is you are talking about, you can place
it in the context of the whole chart. This is Keynoting.
Begin to prepare your students for this keynoting using this approach. Practice with as
many lines and contexts as possible. Also, you can break up into pairs and groups
according to Type, and as appropriate for Type, to practice with this technique using a
variety of charts.
Conclusion: No Choice
The conclusion of this stage of training is to get students to see No Choice.
All vehicles are annoying because we can never just drive any of them
ourselves. The only thing to do is give up conscious suffering and mental
authority. Give it a break. Your students are the cream of fucked up Not-Self,
otherwise they wouldn’t be there in the first place. We are not here to change
anything. We are here to figure out how to make the best of what they’ve got.
Not-Self human beings don’t know how to be correct with their resistance; be
spiritual. You show me someone who thinks there is such a thing as a mistake
and I’ll show you someone is who is totally godless. Earth is about war and
peace, in and out, up and down, and it is all o.k.
All I ask is that if you are gong to be a lover, be correct, and if you are going
to be a killer, be correct. Killing wouldn’t go away, but we would have a lot
less of it.
We don’t even know what righteous killing is. Love is no different. It’s all
because of the Not-Self. The deepest love that is possible can only come in
awakeness, and there aren’t even enough awake people to throw a party. Until
that happens, whoever you see when you wake up is who you love and that’s
it.

The 384 lines constitute all human experience. All 384 lines are deeply rooted
in our genetics and that includes bigotry, perversion, and corruption. And at
the same time there, we are so deep in our own judgments and think that’s
terrible.
My teaching has always been about staying within the context of a mechanical
science. And yet because it is so revealing and deep you cannot avoid its
mysticism. We are dealing with these very large questions, and the deepest
question for students for years will be whether No Choice is real. Do we have
any choice at all? Anywhere? It is so difficult for the neo cortex to get around
the fact that it is a filter and not a kind of universe unto itself.
A woman once asked me if she could do anything about all her moons in
detriment. And I said, well, forty or fifty atomic bombs in the right direction
would do it, but the rest of us wouldn’t like it; we’d all drown.
If you are very lucky, you will follow your fractal to awakeness; and if you
aren’t lucky, at the very least you will be unburdened. You do not have to be
responsible for your life. You only have to be responsible as a witness. This is
what we are here for. To be a passenger in these vehicles is to be a perfect
non-interfering filter of the totality.
Your students are ready for a conversation about No Choice at this level. Please include it
as part of this weekend’s training and the culmination of the line level training.

DAY TWO
Gates and Lines, Final Selection
Finish teaching remaining Gates and Lines, drilling them with students all the way up to
the surface of the chart. Of course, use any of the techniques in this manual or the ones
you may have developed for your unique group of student analysts. You may also, of
course, switch this part of this month’s curriculum with the practice session and
technique outlined above.
SIDELINE
When “Bad” Lines Happen to “Good” People by Ilse Sendler
The last word goes to Ilse Sendler, First Generation Analyst and Teacher and
Director of Human Design Austria, who was asked to say a little about
interpreting her favorite “difficult lines”. We were delighted to receive the
assignment beautifully packaged as a mini-lesson and example of using mirror
circuitry, (a stream of the Sensing Circuit and mirroring of Harmonic Gates) at
the line level to enhance and deepen interpretation. You might wish to use this
example or design your own of line-level mirroring in this last of six gate and
line segments.
1st Line Examples:
34.1. The Bully The indiscriminate use of power
To find out about power you have to learn how to apply it – and this process is
always immature and insecure in the beginning. The goal is to become an
authority over time (this is a line with a blue umbrella headline). You have to
know and learn what and who is worth being ‘bullied away.” This is the
integration circuit, so individual survival is one’s theme, and this line is not here
to listen to others or obey general/collective rules.
Always look at the opposite gate!
57.1 Confusion
You often need this ‘bully’ energy to cut through the confusion and arrive at the
truth – and be an archetype…
Human Design International Training Manuals. 225
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
20.1 Superficiality
The bully quickly brushes over things on the surface – and can be impressive
and artistic (and charismatic) in his power…
10.1 Modesty
An innate sense to know and accept ones place (the only ‘positive’ line in this
configuration.)
It might be necessary to modestly accept that you have to be the bully and scare
things and/or people off to be able to follow your convictions.
2nd Line Examples:
58.2 Perversion
‘Leave me alone’ says the hermit – and makes the collective angry because he is
not interested in sharing the precious energy he possesses. He enjoys things
others might not – and makes sure that even those things are enjoyed and
motorized – and can be processed and judged and perfected… (This line has no
blue umbrella introduction; you simply have it.)
Opposite gate: 18.2 Terminal Disease
You have to learn that some things cannot be corrected – no matter whether this
seems ‘perverse’ to you or to others.
This channel shows how important it is to invest your energy only according to
your design – no matter what others may think about it.
Just like 28.2 Shaking hands with the Devil – the judgement about what is
tasteful and what isn’t, is a personal one – but the 28 is an individual gate so,
here, survival cannot depend on general rules. And remember how many new
things were originally considered to be ”evil”— the apple, for starters, and then
there was the idea that the earth might actually be round, and, now
cloning…with this line, you can thrown out of paradise, accused of heresy, or
put into prison for things that become obvious and natural a few generations
later.
3rd Line Examples:
4.3 Irresponsibility
226 Human Design International Training Manuals.

P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D T E N
Higher efficiency guarantees better chances for success – in any way! If the only
new formulas that are put to the test are the ones that will work well (i.e., if only
the responsible ones were tested) – there would be no progress. The fool who
carelessly tries something out may make the sort of discovery that a traditional,
established scientist never would.
Trial and error always speaks of the ‘cost’ of mistakes and the ‘gain’ of new
discoveries. And any new test and its results add to your experience.
Opposite gate: 63.3 Continuance
Always maintaining the established principles stops progress - the whole
channel speaks of the balance between its two sides.
4th Line Examples:
50.4 Corruption A lack of enriching values
Notice that it is very important to DEVELOP enriching values – as they are not
there from the beginning (this is a line with a blue introduction). You are a ‘dark
horse’, an empty page. To change values, you first have to get rid of the old ones
(because, for instance, they may be outdated.). Only then can evolution
proceed…and new, enriching values be created.
It is also very interesting that this is a 4th line – corruption can only happen in
company! If you are alone, corruption is irrelevant! And the judgment about
what is corrupt and what isn’t is always dependent on your personal point of
view (or if you gain or lose something…).
When King Albert married Wallis Simpson and abdicated, people complained
about the deterioration/corruption of values – but it was one step towards the
acceptance of divorce and divorced people. (Things are easier for Charles and
Camilla now!)
Opposite gate: 27.4 Generosity
Corruption keeps Generosity in balance and vice versa – and only in this way
can caring be established and sustained.
5th Line Examples:
The 5th line theme of perfection must incorporate both sides of the binary. For
instance, if your body resorted to non-violent resistance when attacked by flu
viruses, and your T-cells did nothing but chant and dance to repel the attack, you
would be dead within hours. Your life cannot be sustained if you only exhale…

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
38.5: Alienation A stage of opposition when one is totally isolated
Holding on – no matter what. This is how our species arrived at the end of the
food chain.
Opposite gate: 28.5 Treachery The abuse of trust
Is it OK to shoot down a plane full of innocent passengers to avoid a new 9.11?
If the enemy is too big for you - is it OK to incite one ‘bad side’ against another
and have them wipe each other out?
Individual engagement following your instinctive awareness might alienate
others and force you to give up or betray alliances, but how else can difficult
projects be carried through? We live in the Maia where life is a game and
Struggle should/can have a ‘game-like’ quality.
Casanova (59.5) manipulates (44.5), the Saviour (13.5) destroys old obstacles,
and being seduced (4.5) also means being a victim (3.5). Good or bad depends
on your viewpoint and is often a projection!
6th Line Examples:
47.6 Futility A difficult position
It may be our goal to become wise but the mental process can never have inner
authority. Trying to solve mental questions often is futile and if we base our
decisions on it we certainly end up in ‘a difficult position’.
Opposite gate: 64.6 Victory
To overcome confusion is a victory, but still futile because it has no authority.
Real victory and wisdom keeps perspective.
If you follow the abstract circuitry from the 64 down to the throat:
The inspiring victory (64.6) needs to be put into perspective (accept the futility
of mind) of the 47.6, it cannot be the basis of any decision but only the basis of
many ideas which help you to adapt (11.6 Adaptability). If you do not want to
endanger the potential of these ideas you have to be careful about how you
express them (56.6 Caution).

Acknowledgment of Student Development: Give your “graduating” students positive
feedback by calibrating your attitude toward them toward “collegial” rather than
“professorial.” Become even more of their mentor or guide. Consider acknowledging
them for the transition they are making at the end of the class.
Student Enrichment: At this point, the choice is entirely yours based on your
understanding of your students and their particular needs.
Home Line Enrichment Assignment: The sixth line. Have students explore the
common themes of all of the sixth lines in the Rave I Ching. How do these lines relate to
their harmonic line, the third line? Within the context of having explored all five other
line values over the duration of the line module, how exactly might the sixth line
represent “the total stacked” of the hexagram? How might it represent “the total stacked”
or be “transitional” in a particular hexagram or selection of hexagrams?
MP3 Assignment: Your choice (that was a joke) based on student needs. By now you
must know who will proceed to Keynoting and who will not.

Essential Outline: Sequence III Keynoting
Two Day Weekend Class Structure
Months 11 and 12 (2 Different Outlines)
NOTE
Aside from the specifics of the Keynoting skill itself, the two months of
Sequence III are much less structured than those of Sequences I and II, although,
of course, you can make them more structured if you would like to. By now,
you know your students best, and what they need most is to practice.
The two months are also slightly different in flavor and structure, see below.
This Sequence includes a very essential Keynoting technique description and
Example base for your convenience, the same information plus more exampling
and charts can be found in the text below in context of the material as it is laid
out in its entirety.

The first ten months of PTL 1 can, in a sense be compared to a right angle process in
which students build a personal skill and power base. Sequence III is the left angle,
transpersonal completion of this process where the student Analyst learns to effectively
apply his or her deep detailed knowledge and practice to the Other.
Demonstrate Keynoting to Your Class using Example Charts (or theirs or yours)
Keynote the True Self
Keynote the Not-Self
Make sure to turn to the definition in different directions, use the keynote in different
orders, play with it, and return to Type, Strategy, Definition, and Authority often. Weave
in gate and line keynotes.
Teach the Technique
Keynoting is in essence the simple technique of creating a visual map or word palette that
collects all the surface formulas of a chart. Once created, the base provides countless
ways for the Analyst to move with a chart’s information.

6 Simple Steps for Keynoting
1. Collect superficial keynotes for Profile, Cross, Quarter, and Type and write
them at the top of a page.
2. Collect keynotes for Self and Not-Self and record in the middle of a page (or a
second page).
3. Write a sentence using the surface level keynotes of Profile, Cross, and
Quarter to describe the chart’s surface mythology.
4. Using definition keynotes as verbs, hanging gates and adjectives and 236
keynotes as appropriate, write a single sentence (it might be a long one) that
describes the chart’s True Self.
5. Repeat step 4 for the Not-Self.
6. Using the Keynoting Base as if it were an artist’s palette that paints the
moving truth of a Design in words, repeat this same process two more times,
the focus being to express the poetry of the same chart differently every time.
All versions are true. The more closely a person comes to living their True
Self, the more varied and infinite will be the ways in which the poetry of their
unique mythology expresses itself.

Provide feedback
Provide feedback to each of your students (you can move around the room as the practice
if you like). Focus as much on the level of their ease and the potential artistry of their
presentation as you do on their technical mastery of the knowledge, if not more so,
because anyone you have admitted into the keynoting sequence is already competent in
technical areas.
Enrichment Section Option
If time permits.
Assign MP3
Since this is the last assignment month, consider assigning more than one MP3 and, also,
perhaps one between the first and second day of this weekend and the final weekend, for
as much practice as possible.

MONTH 12
Review MP3
Month 12 contains more advanced Keynoting source material, including the latest source
material for Readings by Type as of the time of this writing, but since, by now, you know
your students and their needs and what they need to finish the course best, the suggested
outline is freeform.
Required elements:
Reassign MP3 or In-Class Keynoting of Same Example Chart as Month 1
We do this so students can assess their progress from the beginning of the course as a
celebration and closure.
Review of Reading by Type Dynamics as appropriate
Lots of Practice
Closure and Acknowledgment of Skills (i.e., “Graduation”)
We recommend that this include a discussion of how to continue to enhance and practice
their Keynoting skills as they return to a more information-based class setting in PTL
2/Level 4 Transits and the Other.
Remind students that although their skill base is now vastly enhanced and they have all
the technical skill base and much of the knowledge they need to become Analysts, that
they are not yet certified Analysts who can charge money for readings. At the same time,
review the skills and reading situations that they are empowered for. Please check in
with your National Organization and IHDS recommendations for what these are.
Finally, consider assigning “Senior Project” style MP3 Assignments for the next 30 days;
see below.

Review MP3 Assignment: A good time to acknowledge continuing students for their

88o of the Training Sequence
Everything up to until this moment in this course has contributed to the
process of creating the mechanical vehicle necessary for being an Analyst.
Keynoting is the 88o point. Now the moment has come to bring in the whole
flavor of what being a professional means. Begin by informing students that
to become professional Analysts they require your recommendation. Of
course this provides you with a natural power trip opportunity, but I have to
trust that your integrity as teachers is significant.
Adjust your attitude towards your students one final time. It is as if they have
just arrived in the upper grades of high school: reward them by talking to
them as if they were already Analysts: describe your own experience as an
Analyst, and what you do and have gone through as an Analyst. Also let them
know that the analytic training, coaching, and evaluation process is almost
entirely complete. PTL2 (Transits and The Other) will return students to a

traditional classroom environment where the focus is transmission of
information. It will include no coaching. At that point, the only remaining
question about students’ professional qualifications will be how well prepared
an Analyst each of them will be because each student will have already
proven he or she has what it takes. So let them know that if they have gotten
this far, you are confident that they will become competent professionals.
Introduction to Keynoting: The Formula
This Professional Sequence as a whole is designed to repeatedly start with the surface, go
deep, then bring students back up again. The simple formula that is Keynoting brings the
student back up to the surface of the chart for the last time.
Keynoting is in essence the simple technique of creating a visual map or word palette that
collects all the elements of the surface formula of a chart.
Once created, the keynoting base provides countless ways for the Analyst to move with a
chart’s information to accurately and powerfully reveal its essential mythology. To use a
metaphor from the Human Design System itself, the first ten months of PTL 1 can be
compared to a right angle process in which students build a personal skill and power base
in the knowledge of and skill with the Human Design System. The Keynoting technique
is the left angle, transpersonal completion of this process. In these last two weekends, the
student Analyst learns to effectively apply his or her deep and detailed base of knowledge
and practice of the Human Design System to the Other. Students fully analyze actual
people and live charts as opposed to Example Charts or Bodygraph elements in context.
The magic of the technique is revealed, not only in the details of the simple formula, but
also through the experience of actually keynoting as students string together the range of
the possible in the binary to reveal the Not-Self, the True Self, and chart continuity as
they also open up its mythology.
Keynoting is an art that succinctly reveals the poetry of individual geometry. It is also a
science that reveals the unique genetic differentiation of every being (you can find source
passages on the topic of genetic differentiation below). As the completion of their
training process, students become empowered with a very powerful and succinct verbal
healing technique that must be regarded, on the one hand, as a freeing, creative art form
and, on the other, with great respect for and understanding of its analytic power.
Weekend Eleven focuses on teaching the technique. Weekend Twelve applies Keynoting
more specifically and practically to the dynamics of a client session. Since there are only

6 Simple Steps for Keynoting
(Note: these six steps are also excerpted in the outline at the beginning of this
sequence for quick reference.)
1. Collect superficial keynotes for Profile, Cross, Quarter, and Type and write
them at the top of a page.
2. Collect keynotes for Self and Not-Self and record in the middle of a page
(or a second page).
3. Write a sentence using the surface level keynotes of Profile, Cross and
Quarter to describe the chart’s surface mythology.
4. Using definition keynotes as verbs, hanging gates as adjectives, and 2 3 6
keynotes[JP1] as appropriate, write a single sentence (it might be a long
sentence) that describes the chart’s True Self.
5. Repeat Step 4 for the Not- Self.
6. Using the Keynoting Base as if it were an artist’s palette that paints the
moving truth of a Design in words, repeat this same process two more
times, the focus being to express the poetry of the same chart differently
every time. All versions are true. The more closely a person comes to living
their True Self, the more varied and infinite will be the ways in which the
poetry of their unique mythology expresses itself.

Chart Analysis: Felipe of Bourbon, Prince of Asturias (future King of Spain)
[Note: at the time of this analysis, Felipe of Bourbon was in the news for his marriage to
the former television anchorwoman Letizia Ortiz. At the time this book goes to press,
their almost year old daughter Leonor may well become the first female child to inherit
the throne of Spain by succession.]
This person may be a Prince, but this is not the chart of an Alpha: this person
is not a leader. The first thing we have to deal with is the business of the
Throat, and here there is nothing to look at. The chart is a Split Definition and
we are always looking for the context of Type and Authority. So this is the
chart of an Emotional Generator, and everything about this being is locked in
the Solar Plexus; and all of that is being adrenalized under the pressure of the
Root.
So take a look at what that really says: He is deeply sensitive to the need to be
intimate and he is looking for marriage. Intimacy will change his principles
and needs, and he doesn’t actually give a damn about the Tribe.
The 26/44 is not the core of who this person is; in fact it’s his problem. The
only way he can make a decision is as an emotional response over time, which
means that although he may desperately need intimacy, he cannot go looking
for it. He has to respond to it. And in the meantime, he is running away to live
in his bridge, which is the ambition to take care of everybody. We are not here
to run away from our bridges, we are here to cross them as ourselves. So this
is the story of what that person is: someone who really wants to transmit how
wonderful it is when you finally get what you need...ahh, intimacy is so
wonderful.
The 59/6 is actually the hardest activation for finding intimacy because it is
actually an aura breaker. As a Channel of Reproduction, it’s all about the
penetration of the Ego. Just because people with this Channel can penetrate
other people’s auras, it doesn’t mean that they are being intimate. It just
means that they get inside auras. So for them, it’s really something to get to
the point where breaking an aura goes beyond breaking an aura, and into
finding the real intimacy and deep bond that’s possible for them.
The “I need you” of the 19/49 is so incredibly powerful because the basic
pressure of our existence is to have the resources we need. There is nothing
needier than this Channel, it’s completely driven by need; and in this case, the
refrain is, “Oh, I need the intimacy!” If this being surrenders to who he is,
Human Design International Training Manuals. 247
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
intimacy must come first. Only out of intimacy does the basic, the
fundamental, tribal, “I need you, I do not have a life without you, I do not
have a future without you,” become possible.
Yet there is a very important condition placed on this fundamental need for
intimacy being fulfilled: the condition of the undefined G Center. There is
one thing an undefined G Center must know before anything else: absolutely
nothing in their life is going to work for them unless they are in the right
place.
If you have an undefined G and you are in the right place, you meet the right
people. As long as this being is in the right place he’s going to have a good
life. People with open G’s find the right place by responding over time. So
once Prince Felipe is in the right place, he will he meet and find the right
people, and, finally discover the bridges he needs to express his creativity; not
as conditioning, but as himself. Then he will transmit the by-product of finally
finding, through intimacy, the real principles and needs in life. When he is in
the right place at the right time, his need to be intimate, in response, over
time, discovers the way to surrender through those who bring ambition and
caring into his life.
The Not-Self doesn’t care about the True Self; it cares about its Not-Self
issues. A Split gives you the distillation of conditioning. So that is the genesis
of the two major Not-Self issues in this chart: The 54th Gate says, “I have to
be ambitious.” while the 27th Gate says, “I have to care and nurture and look
after others.”
Tribal language conditions this chart because Tribal gates bridge the Split. So
this person thinks that only living out these themes will show him that he is
really living up to his potential. However, as we have already seen, these
themes are not who this person is. He is only pretending to be ambitious and
caring to provide continuity to the Tribe.
As long as he is playing out that role, he’s living out the Not-Self, and he’s
going to be a deeply, deeply unhappy person in his life and never gets to who
he is.

hanging Gates as adjectives and adverbs.)
Potential Mythological Role (first sentence): You are an emotional, mutative martyr
heretic who is here to find your way by responding emotionally over time to be dedicated
to meeting the forces and transforming yourself and others.
True Self Definition
Variation One: You are here to be intimate and experience what it means to need and be
needed through responding emotionally over time, which will mutatively, cyclically,
while giving direction, and also enhanced by the memory of what it means to burn out
your own passion, also allow you to surrender to your own humanity in a way that can be
instinctively of value to managing the survival of the species.
Variation Two: You are here to respond in a highly emotional way to ride out your wave
before deciding which auras to penetrate to disperse your creativity with difficulty,
depression, and a frustrated slavishness that erupts unpredictably and with way too much
oversensitivity as you respond to create intimate bonds based on sacrifice and mutual
need-- but only when they are plenty of resources available (which you will tend to burn
out if you aren’t completely disappointed with what they get you first since you are
always being conditioned to enjoy the artful and beautiful of form including your own in
all the wrong places) and, by the way, whenever you are recognized as a tribal
materialist, you struggle to maintain financial resources and to not risk the values and
intelligence that instinctively sustain and protect your community, and are always
unconsciously terrified that in this you will fail utterly, and as a result your life will have
had no purpose.
Not-Self Definition
Your Not-Self is here to attract attention with stories about your past in which you are
always quite certain that you were oppressed, and constantly answer questions about
things that never mattered anyway, and feature freaky insights that don’t make any sense
to anybody else anyway once they leave your mind, and your ambition may be to nurture
a family, but, unfortunately, you never know where to go, where to experience
serendipitous love in your life, which would come to you over time if you only waited to
respond.

Examples Follow, but it’s all in the Practice
The point is to get creative with it, free with it, move with the information, get as concise
and efficient as possible in your keynoting. More carefully edited source material from
more than one Keynoting workshop follows for your reference and inspiration. However,
once you have taught the basic technique in the presentation manner of your choice,
encourage and even require your students to practice and play extensively. Have them
begin with their own charts, then consider providing example charts to.
Encourage both creativity and precision as you demonstrate how this simple technique
can render the nuance and magic and wonder of any chart’s unique genetic differentiation
(more on genetic differentiation in the next chapter). And, as usual, always stress Type,
Strategy, and Authority.
More than One Right Answer
Remember, at any level of keynoting, there is always more than one “right”
answer. There are, in fact, as many “right” answers as there are descriptive
possibilities within the keynoting base.
The point is to take the main themes, constantly mix them around, and see
how many different ways you or a student can describe the same definition.
Give them a sense of being a painter with a palette. The palette is the
collection of keynotes. Each color is a different color you can paint with, and
then you paint lots of pictures with them.

Keynoting Seminar often use values from the chart of a 4/6 Generator on the Cross of
Consciousness in Quarter of Civilization)

We begin the keynoting process with all of this outer stuff. For instance, let’s
say this is a 4/ 6 Opportunistic Role Model on the Right Angle Cross of
Consciousness in the Quarter of Civilization where purpose is fulfilled
through form.
This entry tells students that when they enter into keynoting, they are going to
be discussing terms that will not be concretized until PTL 2 and 3. You are
giving them keys to think about this context. The most important thing is to
start with the profile because it is the key to establishing the inner map.
Establish the Chart Binary by Creating a Map/Palette of Definition and True
and Not-Self keynotes
Chart analysis always synthesizes a basic binary. So we continue to lay out
our keynoting base by creating a dualistic map. The map consists of keynotes
of conscious and unconscious definition and of the True and Not-Self. It lays
out the binary only. It does not synthesize. Synthesis only takes place in the
analysis.
To this end, using the same keynoting example, think of the 4/6 profile as a
way you can initiate your map with language. Everything about this chart’s
personality is going to exist and be analyzed under the umbrella of 4th Line
opportunism. Everything you may talk about in relationship to the personality,
in one way or other, can be brought back to this 4th Line personality and its
opportunistic nature.
The same goes for the unconscious. In this case, the unconscious is tripartite.
The 6th Line theme of all three phases can be seen in the context of becoming
a role model.
Every category in the keynoting base has a specific language:
Type

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
For example, with the Generator we can work with frustration, response, and
non-initiation --terminology that is inherent in our description of Generators.
The Generator literally has to generate a keynote, whatever that keynote may
be.
Definition
In our mapping it is essential to be able to see where bridges don’t exist and
that there is a difference between single definitions and splits. The keynote
language of the specific split needs to be written out and indicated. Always
have the language for it.
Definition as Grammar
In our discussions of definition as the life force we have seen that if you have
a gate activation, you have part of an active Center, but not the whole
definition. A hanging gate just influences that particular life force definition
with a specific quality.
In the grammar of keynoting, definition is the verb and any hanging gate
relating to that definition is going to be adjectival, that is, descriptive of the
verb.
For instance, if we have a 15/5 Definition as in the example chart, the verb of
the sentence is to be in the flow. But we also have to describe the adjectives to
add their quality to the experience of being in the flow. If the chart has a
hanging 7th gate, it is not being in the flow, except that as part of the flow, you
have a role. At that point, we can say to student, what kind of role? And they
can go down to the line within the context of the center and see how that
adjective affects the way in which that flow works.
Any other hanging gates also need to be synthesized into this function.
Therefore, such a being would have to have a role in the mutative flow and an
ability to express themselves in the mutative flow, and the only way that they
are going to care about doing this is if they have a role of self-expression in
the mutative flow. Just play with the basic keynotes that are there, and the

moment you have a definition, associate it with anything that adds an
adjectival quality.

The Map Stays Still; The Analyst Moves (Ra Uru Hu Keynoting His Own
Chart in Different Strings)
The nature of the poetry of this geometry is that the map itself doesn’t go
anywhere. It just exists so you can see its components, because, in fact, you
can travel in any direction along it. You can line up its keynotes in any
direction you like. What you are teaching your students is not to specifically
follow this exact technique in this exact order, but rather to be able to always
have available, and in context, the various chart layers and keynotes so they
can pull them together however they like.
For instance, look at my Personality; it has so many adjectives hanging
around the quality of my pure individuality. There are three activations of the
7th Gate and two of the 48th Gate. The 26th and the 40th Gates are also all part
of my single definition, which means I cannot look at that life force definition
on its own. Splits also have their own unique grammar. Theirs is verb,
adjective, bridge, verb, adjective.
But there is no right way when it comes to stringing keynotes. For instance, I
can take the keynotes of my personality and keep mixing them up over and
over again, and every time I set them they would be different in form, but it’s
still the same stuff. We are not simple, and keynoting is a variational skill.
You can turn your keynotes round and round and say something different
every time. Keynoting moves just the way the chart and the system move. It is
not a fixed point or description any more than the Bodygraph contains fixed
points and measurements.
I have the 25/51. So I can be really cool and call this the initiating force and
add it to my keynote string. However, I can also say I am very competitive.
Being competitive in the now has a totally different feeling to it than being an
initiator in the now. But I am both. It’s all about how you move keynotes
around and what opens up as a result of moving them around again, and again
brings us back to the complexity and the mystery of being ourselves. It also
brings students back to Helplessness because they want keynotes to run just
one way--and they don’t.
Students will often either give you just the version of themselves they wanted
you to get; “Jesus, I smell like a rose!” or they will give you the worst
interpretation of themselves, “Here it is: you can tell I am a competitive,
denying, nasty, antisocial creature in the now.”

It’s the magic of keynoting that says there is so much that can arise out of all
of these components, and the only way you can operate correctly and get the
proper balance between keynote values is to operate correctly as yourself.
Then you can see what consistently appears to be the real poetry that is you
and describes you, is always changing. We are not creating a map carved in
stone. It is more like having lots of little kernels we can work with.
More on Splits And Other Complexities
With splits or complexity, continue returning to the umbrella at the top of the
chart context (Type, Authority, Profile) where you can bring the split together.
When authority is one aspect of a split, I put all my attention there. But we
need a place to bring them back to, so I bring them back to the place that
makes the decisions and refer every dilemma, such as the bridging of a split or
an open center, back to their definition.
Varying the Keynote String
For instance, a 4/6 Generator on the Cross of Consciousness is someone who:
*Responds to the opportunity to be a role model
*An opportunist who respond to being a role model
*A Role model who responds to opportunity
*A responding role model who is opportunistic
*Is responding to externalize transition
*Responding to the opportunity to be a mutative role model.

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
Mutative opportunism is different than mutative role model.
Mutative responding is different than mutative role model--is it the
opportunistic role model or the responding role model who is opportunistic?
Is the opportunist mutated, or is it the role model, or is it responding itself that
is the mutation? It is in all of that that you find the magic.
The same thing happens in the sciences when you are dealing with chemistry
or genetics. When you change the order of their components, the net result is
that you end up with a different formula.
Keynotes are nothing but formulas which you can mix together in different
ways to come up with different results, and yet it is all the same result: a way
of looking at what is fixed and what is the life force of the person; whether the
life force is going to move this way or that way is similarly dependent on
whether they are correct or not. If correct, they are going to live out all of the
variations that you could possible discover, because that is the fulfillment of
their potential as a true being. Your true purpose and mythology are
embedded in your ability to be the whole story that frames all the poems. You
become the whole poetry anthology.
The beauty of finding out how everything works is when you know nothing. It
doesn’t matter how many different ways you see the damn keynote, you have
no control over living it this way or that; therefore no control over restising or
participating in one variation.
Keynoting in Languages Other than English
You are just turning the words around. Turning them around. The ease of
keynoting also depends on your language base. It isn‘t the easiest thing to
keynote in a language other than English because often you need to add lots of
additional constructions to turn the words around in a way that makes sense.
However, if the nature of your fractal connection is to describe it within that
specific tongue, that doesn’t stop you from doing it.

The Psychology of Learning Keynoting
You will have students who will only want to write out the most positive
version, and the ones who only want to write out the most negative version.
So, have them do it three times without telling them that they are going to be
doing it three times: ask for one string, then have everyone read theirs. Repeat
twice.
Notice whether they leave an element out of their keynote string. If they do,
that is a problem, something they don’t want to deal with. Discuss this as part
of the class exercise.
There is no wrong way to keynote. The only way you can be wrong is to insist
on one, and only one, right keynoting string.
Class Exercise: Have each student make a keynoting “map” of their own chart and
practice keynoting it as per the example above. Begin Type and the external frame of
Profile, Cross and Quarter. Continue with Definition (verbs plus hanging Gate adjectives)
and Line. Keynote the True Self. Then do the same with the Not-Self.
Have students do three variations of their own keynoting. Do not tell them that they will
be doing three. Instruct them to do one version. Then share the version. Then instruct
them do it again. Share again. Then instruct them to do it a third time. Generally, you will
get the very positive version the first time and the very negative one the second time,
although for some students the tendency will be the opposite. The idea is to show them
that there are many possibilities. Three times is enough.
Later today, or tomorrow, have them keynote each other or example charts of your
choice.
Special Note for End of Day One Weekend/Month 11: Since this weekend is spent on
learning the technique and, primarily, applying it to one’s own chart, and next month is
spent on keynoting the Other and preparing students for the analytic session, you may
give an assignment tonight to be completed overnight in addition to the usual monthly
assignment.

DAY TWO
Genetic Continuity
Introduce the principle and use examples of Genetic Continuity as a support to keynoting
as described above and to further enrich synthesis skills.
Genetic continuity can be defined as a quality that becomes apparent in every aspect of a
chart, i.e., in the Type, Definition, Gates, Lines, etc. For instance, you may discover that
every line in your chart somehow relates to teaching and leading, as does your Definition.
Or, every line in your chart may point to the theme of being a tribal caretaker. Or, it may
point to the need to retreat to be in your power. Etc.
Line values themselves communicate genetic continuity throughout the chart. For
instance, the 50thGate is the source of intelligence. It expresses its intelligence through
each line value (1 and 2 Tribal, 3 and 4 Individual, 5 and 6, Collective), which, through
genetic continuity transfers through all 64 Gates, which is why intelligence permeates the
whole body. Passion, need, and desire, all three emotional streams, are transferred in the
same way by the 6th Gate
Multiple lines in the same value also contribute to chart continuity. For instance, Ra’s ten
first lines do not make him tribal, but they do give his pure Individual design Circuitry a
tribal sensitivity. American Interviewer Larry King not only has a 5th Line profile (he is
famous for calling people out and getting them to reveal themselves on television in the
United States), but his chart has ten fifth lines total. Etc.

Figure 11.6 Ra Uru Hu.
The ten first lines in this chart give a tribal quality to what is a pure Individual chart in
its definition. Adding to this theme of continuity is the strongly defined Ego. This center
is individually defined, but its tribal nature is reinforced by the richness of first line
themes.
Class Exercise: Discussion, practice, and analysis of genetic continuity in example
charts in class. Class discussion question: does keynoting always reflect the genetic
continuity in the chart?
Enrichment Session: Marketing or the Business of being an Analyst by Strategy might
be appropriate here.
MP3 Assignment: Have students prepare a ten-minute MP3 assignment on their True
Self and a ten-minute assignment on their Not-Self.

Weekend/Month Twelve
Keynoting as the Basis of Professional Individual
Analysis
Keynoting as Genetic Differentiation
True Self Definition Moves and Changes
Fine Points on Self versus Not-Self including Session Dynamics
Life Purpose Reveals Itself/Readings by Type
The Mechanics of Surrender
Review MP3 Assignment: a reminder to congratulate your students and acknowledge
and recognize their unique styles as you review the final monthly class assignments
together.
Extra MP3 Assignment for Weekend/Month Twelve: Between Day One and Two on
the Monthly Schedule, or otherwise when you like, have students keynote the same
Example chart they all used as their baseline MP3 when entering the course. Tomorrow,
compare each student’s final assignment to this original MP3 to demonstrate the
difference.
Important note: Keep in mind that this class occurs at the beginning of Month 12;
therefore, consider giving your students more 10 minute Keynoting assignments over the
month to submit to you (or each other) oriented toward the Other, or to Types, like a
Senior Project, to consolidate and mature the technique under your supervision before the
class ends.

Keynoting Within the Professional Context
The True Self moves between its keynoting variations while the Not-Self
utilizes the same, predictable True Self variation. A being who is living as
the True Self will tend to move between all of its definitions as it
expresses its unique genetic differentiation.
The focus of this weekend is to shift keynoting skills to the potential client as opposed to
the student’s own chart. What students will primarily need to do is practice, specifically
with creating as many keynoting strings as possible, moving with information, and
balance Self and Not-Self keynoting within the analytic session in order to deliver the
most powerful and skilled reading possible. Use example and perhaps even “blind”
example charts (where identity is not revealed until the keynoting exercise is complete).
The chapter also includes some observations about reading for Type, which is a
perspective that does tend to evolve over time, so it may be wise to watch for continuing
professional education opportunities to keep up to date.
Reading Preparation per se is a skill developed further in the final pre-certification
program, Mentorship (Level VI). Please keep in touch with the IHDS and your National
Organization for final distinctions, which are not available at the time of publication. In
any case, you will introduce students to the concept of reading by Type as part of
completing their training and skill base in Keynoting at this level, so they can go out and
practice in the field with an awareness of the dynamics of each of the Four Types in
Readings, and how those dynamics relate to their own Type.
RAM versus Keynoting
RAM is the linguistic skill and memory base that is developed as the foundation for
Keynoting, which is the professional skill and chart reading method. Keynoting cannot
be successfully taught until students are prepared for it with RAM. Students will
certainly “read” charts at the level they have obtained in RAM before they learn
Keynoting, and you can begin to give them reading-style MP3 Assignments in Sequence
II (we counsel you to only give such assignments with great care in Sequence I,
monitoring the results very carefully. This is because RAM itself requires a certain
amount of focus and practice to learn, and that Sequence may already have a fairly steep
developmental arc as it is). Only the Sequence III student who has been admitted to the
Sequence by their instructor is eligible to learn the full Keynoting technique.

To an extent, this chapter consists of textual resources that you can draw upon to “finish”
your students according to what you can offer from your own gifts and Design. Also
please guide them in session dynamics and ethics (what any Analyst is qualified to read
for or not) as generally outlined below. And always remember that as Analysts:
Our goal is not to teach them anything. It is to wake them up.
This is a sophisticated weekend that may inspire lots of practice, questions, answers, and
reflections on what it is to be an Analyst, both in skill and responsibility. Professional
boundaries and responsibility may also be a question or topic that is well addressed here,
perhaps in an enrichment session.
By now, however, you may have a better understanding of your students and how to
complete their process better than any book would. This chapter contains resources for
keynoting for you to use and synthesize, as you will, according to your and your students
unique nature and the dynamic you have developed together over time. Please remember
to acknowledge them when the course is finished for all the good and hard work they
have done throughout the year.
The poetry of geometry is never having to be wrong.
Keynoting as a Sound Formula for Genetic Differentiation
Good keynoting provides exactly the right sound formula to express an
individual Design because it acoustically expresses the personal Formula of
each Individual through the contextualized keynoting base. It is an acoustic
formula of differentiation: what makes you different.
That Bodygraph can be read because it’s nothing but a collection of formulas.
So as long as you understand what those basic formulas are, you can begin to
learn how to read the code. In this sense, it’s not so much that this is the
poetry of the Geometry, as much as it is the chemistry of the Geometry; the
moment you start putting the formulas together, you begin to get a very, very
specific impression of what someone’s differentiation is. When you can read

Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
the code, you can see anyone’s unique difference by simply being able to see
the poetry that’s there.
You are not looking at the sum total of who someone is genetically when you
look at the Bodygraph, that’s the first thing to understand. The 64 hexagrams
that go around the wheel represent our genetic potential. They are like an
alphabet, if you will. The whole genetic potential is there in that wheel.
But when we look at somebody’s design, we see that certain aspects of the
genetic potential are activated, while others are not. Every single cell in my
body carries the complete DNA that makes me me. But if you take all those
cells in my body, they are not all making me; they are each doing a specific
job. So even though the blood cell has the whole genetic code, it only makes
blood cells; and even though the muscle cell has the whole genetic code, it
only makes muscle cells.
When you look at a Human Design Bodygraph, what you are looking at is
what’s been imprinted. In other words, how do you become a specific cell in
the body of the whole of totality? This is your unique cellular job.
You are not looking at sameness; you are looking at differentiation. If I take
his DNA, and her DNA, and my DNA, and put them together, you are going
to have a hard time getting to a place where each of us is actually different.
Most of it is just sameness, the human sameness of all of us. But it’s this
patina of difference, this little layer of unique imprinting that gives us our
lives and our difference; this is the map that measures who we are.
So, the first thing you are going to do is read the code of differentiation and
express it! That’s the magic of this knowledge, because you can express it and
it’s all there in the formulas.
Please understand, I don’t want to get you to a point where you read off
somebody’s differentiation code when they are sitting beside you and
they want an analysis. That’s not what this is about. It’s about you being
able to look at their chart, and read their differentiation code, and use it
as the framework upon which you do their reading.
It’s important to see what is really there, to know where you are going. It’s
about being able to look at a chart and immediately have an impression within
you.
The whole training is about giving you a frame on which you can hang your
story. The story of what somebody is. And you cannot tell a good story unless

you have a schema, a plan. This is the plan, the bedrock upon which you can
tell your story.
The science is in knowing the keys. The art is in the telling.
Professional Level (“Transpersonal”) Keynoting Skills
In the last weekend, students built their own keynoting base based on their own charts, a
process we can compare to the lower trigram process. This month or weekend, students
learn how to apply these same skills to the other, which can be compared to the upper
trigram or transpersonal process.
Use Multiple Themes
In their keynoting, Analysts tend to get stuck in just one theme of the definition. For
instance, using a 4/6 Generator with a primary 5/15 definition and an Open Heart and
Solar Plexus, they might start in one of these Centers and then keep returning to
opportunism:
You have to have the discipline to relate back to all aspects of the potential,
what is fixed, so you can present, at the very end, this difference between the
Not-Self and its pain on one side, and on the other side, this True Self; and
that they have been hearing the words all along. You can find your mythology
in your keynotes, but you can also find the beast.
By knowing key themes of being in any chart, you can always go back to
them, and base your story built on that, and show how they can bring
suffering to an end: by being a role model in the flow responding to and
externalizing acceptance of a transition to a new pattern.
So remember to use: respond, opportunism, mutation, and role model, i.e., all four
surface level keynotes and themes. String them in different directions. For instance: Do
you externalize in the flow or does the flow lead to externalization?
To an extent, this repeats a technique taught last month. However, the variation is the
heart of keynoting and requires as much practice and repetition as possible. Here is part
of why:
Human Design International Training Manuals. 265
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
True Self Definition is Not Fixed and Predictable; It Moves
Demonstrate all the possible patterns. You can go on and on, and that is the
magic of the chart. If you are correct, all the possibilities can then unfold.
It is not true that Not- Self beings never experience the True Self. Rather,
most Not -Self-driven designs alway impose the same predictable expression
structure on the True Self. True Self definition comes into these beings lives,
but in a kind of fixed way that is secondary to the Not-Self, which just takes
advantage of it. In contrast, experiencing the full richness and variety of one’s
definition is a True Self experience.
Just emphasizing responding doesn’t help the client to see their story. It only
helps them to understand their strategy. If there is an open Solar Plexus and
Ego Center, you also want to give your clients a taste of where their
experience will take them: in this case, into the right flow; into the embrace of
the right humans, give them the opportunity to express a role, and for self-
expression, to nourish the intelligence and potential spirit of others (i.e.,
hanging Gates 50 and 39). They will be a deep mutative force, and all of that
begins with the responding.
If the chart has an undefined Ego: born to be someone who has the role of a
leader, but a leader who breaks promises cannot be a leader, that won’t work.
You can’t afford to be somebody who is here to try to prove your worthiness,
so the only way you can live out your role is to respond. If you respond, then
you can take the opportunity to become that role model and help other people
accept transition to a new pattern and transform their lives.
State: the problem is here and the solution is here, over and over again.

Tips for Skillfully Laying Open The Not-Self
It is very hard to teach people how to hurt somebody without it being difficult.
However, there is a freedom that comes with being correct that allows you to
be very penetrating.
The Analyst has to have a quality that will allow them to open up wounds.
The client comes with a question. They are not coming in the door naked
asking you to break them or provoke them. They truly don’t have any idea of
the depth to which they will be exposed. However, one of most important
things an Analyst does is to immediately go to those places that are weak and
wounded. These are sores and you’ve got to rub salt into them.
The Emotional Analyst vs. the Unemotional Analyst
There is a big difference between an Emotional and Unemotional Analyst:
after 3.5 years, the Unemotional Analyst will have much less difficulty in
making the Other uncomfortable than the Emotional Analyst. Meanwhile, the
Analyst with an Emotional nature knows pain and knows and doesn’t like the
feeling of pain returning. So there is a different sensitivity to the being.
Our goal is to awaken old wounds. There is no point giving the client an
inoffensive reading that is easy to hear. You don’t know what is going to
happen within the framework of the neutrino ocean of that day; then you
interact together as auras. There are many things going on.
The Question of “The Question”
Whether you know your client, or resonate with them or not, your first
responsibility is not to answer their question. It is to confirm that you know
Human Design International Training Manuals. 267
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
that the question isn’t the point. And the way you do that is cut through that
surface layer of, “I am going to the soothsayer,” by going to where they suffer
instead.
You can say you are here to respond, but, in the next breath, stab your finger
at that open Emotional Center and say, “Look, there is where so many of your
dilemmas arise from. You are always avoiding confrontations, which has
taken you away from the truth in your life.”
You want to go to that thing inside of them that says, “How did she know that
I have that problem?” Not that they even consciously think that. There is
simply this breakdown of surface resistance and a recognition that the Analyst
is someone who will take you to a place you may not want to go first thing.
And this is the first thing you will notice in a Design reading if you do it
correctly. That the client suddenly discovers they are going to have their skin
peeled off.
The Not-Self is the person who came to the reading: to attract attention by
proving something. This person will avoid confrontation. Will go on and on,
there is their Not-Self.
Its’ such a joke: you reach people by them being convinced you know their
Not-Self - “You can’t imagine how funny that is, Louise, it was amazing how
he knew me.” Wow, what a joke.
You offer them a problem and the solution is them. We are not dogmatists.
We are not here to establish The Way, but to open up the potential of
individual authority. We stand them on their own two feet, but where they
walk is their business, and so it should be. The planet is overly
homogenized—where are these unique perceptions to guide us?
I tell this person here, well, you know, you are a mutative leader in the flow
and they look at you and say, “Gee that’s interesting. I don’t feel like I am a
mutative leader in the flow.”
But if you tell them you are always thinking about things that don’t matter,
and you should stop attracting attention all the time, and you are so afraid of
people anyway because you are actually running away from them, and the
ones you are holding on to are even worse for you, and you are doing the
whole thing to get people to like you, and think you are ok and nice, then,
they don’t say it is interesting any more.
One of the things to see about someone who is coming into a reading as the
Not-Self is that, yes, you are going to frame them with their Type because that

is the solution to their dilemma. But your first piece of work is to nail them to
the authenticity of what you are bringing with your description of the Not-
Self.
Dynamics of True and Not-Self in a Reading
It’s very powerful to show somebody what they have been living as a lie, it’s
very powerful to be able to show to somebody that what’s tormented them
and what they have suffered from, is not the point for them in this life. But
then you’ve got to take them somewhere, and you have to take them
coherently to that place of who they are, so that they can know who they are.
And only by them being able to juxtapose those two realities being described-
-what they are not and what they are--because only when they resonate to
what they are can they begin the journey. Only then will they not only see
what they have to leave behind, but also what they are here to live out. We are
here to live out who we are.
The Not-Self as Wisdom (When Operating According to Authority)
When operating according to inner authority, the Not-Self is wisdom: the
wisdom to avoid confrontation, the wisdom to attract attention. What is worth
having? Who knows? We can look at anyone’s Not-Self and see that without
it, they are an empty shell.
My own Not-Self is of enormous value to me. Without it, I couldn’t answer
all those questions that flow through my open Head. My wisdom is to point
out which of those things actually matter. My wisdom is to be open to every
kind of question, and then understand, and show how they can be dealt with.
I am here to have wisdom about the nature of life force with my totally
undefined Sacral. You cannot imagine how disturbed my life was before all
that happened, and I had to live with an open Sacral. I teach people when
enough is enough because I know.

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
The Not-Self is gorgeous. It’s these receptors to life. I don’t want to be alone,
and without being able to connect to this or that: it’s interesting, it’s magic,
it’s beautiful. But the very instrument of that beauty is clouded when you
come into the world, because we don’t know how to live with it. So the
reading is about balance.
The one thing that instantly transforms the Not-Self into the potential for
wisdom is the moment the mind stops being an authority.
You can’t accomplish that in your first reading with a client, but that’s not the
point. The point is to create some distance from the power of the Not-Self; to
be able to begin the experiment and to see that doing this is worthy. So as you
teach Analysts, don’t allow them to become so negative about the Not-Self,
and how it is presented, that they forget what and how beautiful it really is.
Life Purpose Can Only Reveal Itself
We can’t tell anyone what their purpose is because we don’t know. That’s
why Analysts have to see that they can’t stay with any one impression of it. It
is going to go where it goes based on the unique differentiated Authority of
that particular being, and out of that comes a tendency of that formula that
when you see them awake you say, “Uh huh, that’s them.” That’s their unique
variation of the thousands of versions of this Cross and this Design.
We want our clients to see that their mystery is not ours to solve. Living
according to their strategy is a generic path. I don’t know where it leads, or
what happens when they are on the wheel when they wake up to their
purpose, and live out their unique differentiated variety of this formula. I have
no right to know. The only thing I know about purpose is my own. Anybody
else’s: no idea, and I can’t even afford to think about it. So relax when
working with the True Self. You don’t have to know precisely what the life
purpose is, since there is no such thing generically. So you tell the client,
“You figure it out.”

Close-up Analysis and Breakdown of Keynoting a Definition Field:
Example Channel 43/23 Genius to Freak
Before we even talk about the Channel and Gate configuration, we have
certain things that we have to keep in mind as a background whenever we are
looking at any Channel:
Main Circuit Keynote and Circuit Keynotes
First look at the Circuitry: The main Circuit keynote gives you a way of
understanding what the real role of that Channel is within its larger
configuration. Individuality provides humanity with the potential to be
creative, to be mutative, and to bring the new.
Circuit Keynote: Empowerment
Individual Keynotes: Mutation, Melancholy/Muse, Indecisiveness,
Uncertainty
Knowing Circuit: They never know until they know.
Stream of Knowing: So many of the Channels operate in Streams.
Empowerment Channels that go through Awareness Centers are parts of
Streams, and this Channel is part of a mental, Individual Stream. Once you are
aware and have the benefit of this keynoting foundation you can begin to
explore what’s actually there and see how the formula works.

Channel Keynotes and Keynote Stringing
Channel: 43/23 Structuring; A Design of Individuality (Genius to Freak)
This Channel says, “My mind can empower you.” And that’s true, however
the primary keynote is much more important.
Every time you see an Individual Channel, no matter where it is in the
Bodygraph, that Channel empowers the differentiation to bring empowerment
to the being whose design it is. In other words, “I’m somebody that can be
empowered by my own mind. And in the moment I’m empowered, I can
empower you. So the moment you are looking at Individuality, you got to
look at this underlying theme, because it’s deeply, deeply selfish.”: “ I
empower myself first.”
And once I’m empowered, if it ever happens, because it’s mutation, and I’m
going to be sad as hell if it doesn’t happen, then I’m going to empower you.
The vast majority live out the Not-Self, so they don’t empower themselves
through what is uniquely them; they try to be like everybody else through
their open Centers and Gates and Channels, and are sucked into the seduction
and lose their power. And if they are not empowered, nobody else gets to be
empowered, either. Your mind has to work for you first. You have to be
empowered through your own knowing, not somebody else’s.
So here is a keynote formula and variations for the Channel of Structuring:
empowered insight and explanation leads to structuring. Insight explained
equals structuring. And because it’s unique, and because it’s individual, and
because it’s mutative, it’s freaky. A unique, freaky insight explained equals
structuring.
And whether the structuring is right or wrong, they are always going to say: “I
know.” But that’s in order to understand the code. Empowered insight and
empowered explanation bring Structuring, and through that structuring others
can be empowered. And until this individual, structuring, being can have an
insight that he or she explains, he or she is going to be powerless,
melancholic, sad, confused and uncertain. It’s just a formula.
And it’s a formula that only exists if you have the whole definition. If you’ve
just got a 43 in your chart, forget about what the differentiation of the whole
272 Human Design International Training Manuals.
Ra Uru Hu. All Rights Reserved 2006. Copyright Jovian Archive 2006.
P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D T W E L V E
Channel tells you. It’s not for you. Your insight is always going to be
conditioned. It’s never going to be correct (although it might be interesting).
This is the magic of a Channel. The Channel is a quantum field, and when you
understand this one’s components, then you can understand this mind:
unconsciously, I have insights that get explained and I end up structuring.
That’s it. The end. Over. And when only a few people were listening, I was
still a freak, now I’m the genius, how nice! It’s just a formula; I’m the
formula. And everything about this knowledge is simply a formula. You
simply have to understand the ingredients that are there.
As soon as you understand that the formula is inside of you, realize that every
single formula gives birth to a story. If it is unconscious, you have no access
to it, it’s always a surprise; your freak mind may scare you; you don’t know
why you say things like you do. And every time you liberate somebody from
the ignorance of their unconscious, you really liberate them; there’s great fear
attached to the unconscious, because we don’t identify with it.
So the unconscious gives you things to talk about. As a formula of
differentiation in this context empowerment means your mind is important to
you, you are waiting to be empowered, your insights are important to you,
they empower you, you need them, and if you don’t have any insights, you are
powerless. So you have to wait for them. They will come, you are a mutative
being, you have a mutative mind.
As a formula, Structuring means that the being has to see that they are a
conceptualizing being, that Structuring is the relationship between the Ajna
Center, where we conceptualize, and the Throat Center, where we express.
This is not the structuring of anything other than a concept, a unique,
individual, freaky concept.
Every single key in the formula gives you something to tell us a story, and
precisely what you have to touch base with: in this case you are mutative, you
are an Individual, your mind is mutative, you experience your chemistry in
two ways. First you will experience it as melancholy.
All Individuals are sad, but when you have melancholy in your mind, you are
really sad! We all live in a mind-trip. So here is somebody that’s going to
have mental sadness, and then you can give them a bit of teaching, you can
say: but it’s just a chemistry, when you wake up in the morning and your
mind is sad because there has been no breakthrough, there’s been no insight, it
doesn’t mean that there is something wrong with the world, or your lover, or
the dog, or your mother... it’s not about reasons, it’s just a chemistry!

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
And at the moment that insight comes and you are empowered, suddenly you
realize that chemistry is deeply creative: Aren’t I different? Don’t I have a
new concept? Didn’t I structure it well? Didn’t I explain it? Wow!
It’s all there in the framework. And once you have the frame, you can start
putting on the ornaments. These are ornaments on the formula. They give you
ways to be able to describe them, and then you get to the gate.
Keynoting at the Gate Level
You get to the Gate of Insight, and the Gate of Explanation, and you have
something to talk about. Your insight is not something you can control. It’s
not something that’s always there, it’s something that comes and goes, and
actually all you trying to do is find a more efficient way because this is the
way of efficiency.
And when you talk about explanation, you talk about the Throat: is that
Throat connected to a motor? If not, they are a verbal gunslinger. You talk
about the fact that their Throat doesn’t operate correctly unless they are
operating according to their Type. And at the moment that they are operating
correctly, their capacity to give an explanation of something that’s unique will
not be rejected, because that’s their great fear, that their unique explanation
will be rejected as being freaky instead of being seen or experienced as a
spark of genius, a spark of uniqueness, a new way of structuring a concept.
And all of that is there in the now. Individuality is existential, this is an
unconscious release in the now, mutation takes place in the now, not
yesterday, not tomorrow: now.
The Formula: Unconscious empowerment of structuring through mutative
insight and explanation in the now.
43rd Gate: the Gate of Breakthrough

Keynote: Insight
There’s only a breakthrough when there’s a breakthrough. When there’s not a
breakthrough, there’s not a breakthrough at all; there is nothing. It’s either
there, or it’s not. Somebody who has the 43rd Gate doesn’t have insight all the
time. Remember, this is mutative. Insights come and go.
So what’s the most important thing you can tell this person about insight?
That when you do have insights, they are very important for you. They
empower you. So wait for them to come. And they’ll come. But understand
something very basic here, that insights are empowering, not to you, but to
them, and insight must be something that is given respect. This is very
important for you. Insight for you is a key in your life. Insight transforms your
life. Insight empowers you. Insight opens up your creative potential.
And if there’s no 23, you can’t talk about the Channel. You can just say, well
there’s the 43rd Gate, and you know that insight is empowering you, but there
is no structuring. There’s no genius to freak! If you only have the 43 or the 23,
you are not Genius to Freak. You are not Structuring. So let go of that! All
you are doing is being suckered into the Not-Self. Oh, yes, I could be a genius
and freak if I get a 23 there...
23rd Gate, Splitting Apart, the Gate of Explanation, Keynote: Assimilation
It’s mutative, it’s either there or it’s not. You either can explain it, or you
can’t. The Gate of Explanation. It means that this being is empowered when
they can explain. It makes them feel good. It’s important for them. Explaining
is empowering for them.
Now, once again, if you can be empowered through explanation, but you
don’t have any insight, forget about the structuring. It’s not there.

Class Exercise: Collect Keynotes; Then String Them in Many Ways
Returning to last month’s example chart or choosing another of your choice, create a
keynoting palette and have students practice stringing them in as many combinations as
possible. This month, focus on the analysis session as a model, so don’t have students use
their own charts. Consider giving students anonymous charts and have them work a
keynoting base/palette from these charts, work with them, and reveal the identity of the
charts at the end of class.

DAY TWO
• More Keynoting and Session Practice
• Discussion of Reading Strategy
• Self and Not-Self Dynamics in a Reading
• Reading Structure and Strategy by Type
• The Mechanics of Surrender
Goal of Reading
All I ever wanted for a reading was that when the person went out the door,
for at least for 24 hours, there was this, feeling that,” Uh huh, this could be
something.” If you can hold your impact that long, it will stay with the client
for a long time, and can be just what Energy Types need to make for a quick,
quick process for them.
Keynoting the Not-Self
The Cross is given in the keynoting base. The Analyst needs to see the
mythology of the client in order to be able to teach through their Not-Self. But
the more analysis I did, the harder it became for me to see a client’s potential
mythology because they were so caught up in the density of the Not-Self, and
the Not-Self is not nice.
Most of the job of the Analyst is to carve through the Not-Self. The core
definition has to be seen as where you can go from the Not-Self to the True
Self as a balance. A reading is a counterpoint between the horror of the Not-
Self and stability, where it exists, which in most cases is in definition.
Wherever you travel in the Not-Self of a being with an open Solar Plexus, for
instance, you will find the open Solar Plexus where they avoid confrontation
and truth, and lie about life, and hide it from others. It is more important for
the Analyst to be able to point that out than it is to go into the detail of the

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
keynoting of the True Self. The only way you can properly do that is by
saying, “If you stop being conditioned to make decisions based on the
emotionally conditioned Not-Self and start to make decisions as a Sacral
being, you will see that you will get away from having to deal with the
emotional system through fear, and you will stop being afraid of holding onto
emotions that don’t belong to you.”
A totally undefined Center has a different dynamic. For instance, energy just
moves through my entirely unconditioned Sacral Center. Nothing is retained.
But emotional retention problems? All I have is just that one lousy
unconscious 49th Gate, but it would have been so much better if I had come
without it.
The Analyst has to go to the wounds and yet you also have to be uplifting. For
all of my shock tendencies as an Analyst, I did everything in my power to see
that everyone who walked out of a reading with me was empowered. You can
be this wonderful mythological creature: this Cross of Consciousness! What a
thing to live out this Cross of Consciousness in the Quarter of Civilization!
There’s a deep need to understand the form principle and how it is
concretized… We need these people and we won’t get them if they are stuck
in the Not-Self. We will not eliminate the Not-Self, but without it they have
no wisdom because the Open Centers are the place of wisdom in the life.
Part of this skill is technical—learning and practicing the full oral analytic technique.
And the rest lies in the skill of addressing the dynamics of the analytic session itself.
In either case:
Synthesize True and Not-Self
Begin with the True Self (Definition) so the student knows where to go to
touch the mythology and the mechanics as a reference point, although not
as a focus. The only thing that the Analyst can begin with as a concretized
defined focus is what they are given as Type, which leads to Strategy
because you can never avoid that. You always have their Type, Strategy
and Authority as a counter.

Readings By Type
Note: This source material refers to full readings; not 10 minute MP3s, however there is
no reason not to adapt this technique to ten minute assignments given during the course
of the day on the Weekend Schedule or elsewhere in the 12th month otherwise (i.e., in the
12 month schedule, there are still thirty days after this course is given to complete the
year; you can assign readings to your students during the month if you like and meet to
share, or simply evaluate yourself. Do not assign full readings to graduating PTL 1
students; they are not yet prepared for this. In any case, as above, remember you still
have thirty days to work with in student practice and articulation of the material.
The Generator Reading
When I read a Generator, I carry a hammer in one hand and a smile in the
other. Generators are the ultimate motor people: the crank doesn’t work; so
then you just kick them to get their motor going. As powerful as they are, they
all have a repressed motor that doesn’t work properly; therefore they don’t
have their real power at all.
Tell them to sit with someone they trust and have them ask questions, so they
can respond. Most people think you do that to find out great truths about
yourself, but it’s really about giving the sacral authority. It trains it. ”Uh, uh”
doesn’t work in our world because there is too much verbal diarrhea. Saying
“un,un” to a lover who wants to make love won’t be enough: “What do you
mean, “un,un”? “Unh, unh” to what and why are you saying it now?”
Generators used to drive me crazy. I thought about killing all of them because
they create this whole frustration buzz and this planet lives off of them.
Therefore, they are the most difficult people to convince that anything of any
value is going to show up on their doorstep on Wednesday morning. You
can’t tell them because they don’t believe it.
Everyone comes with questions because everyone is scared to death. If you
look at awareness of integration, the 57th gate, which is the backbone of the
Integration Channel, you find the fear of tomorrow, and the Generator Not-
Self thinks it can only handle tomorrow by being in control of their lives; but
that doesn’t work.
Recognize that Generators are not coming to you out of response. It’s more
like, “I think this is the thing. Human Design is the way.”

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
The Generator’s voice goes, mhmn, mhmn, huh, unh, unh. Response happens
during readings. The look on their face when I point this out is the look of a
frightened sheep: “What was I supposed to hear?” “It’s you, you did it. You’ll
hear it on the tape. The one who sounds like a cow is you.” The most
powerful creature on the planet has no connection with their power source and
no sense of their own force. They don’t just knock you out and leave you
alone like a Manifestor; they keep punching. There is nothing more frustrating
than dealing with Generators. So I tell them, “You are it. Just let it come to
you.”
You have to see they are deeply conditioned and not connected to their
source. You have to be able to show them their pain. Not everyone is good at
that. You can’t afford to tell them too many good things about themselves
because they think you are full of shit when you do. They don’t want the
burden of their mystical purpose. They want their question answered, and you
have to be able to show them they’re an idiot, and do it in a way that doesn’t
offend them.
No one can talk to you the way a Human Design Analyst can talk to you.
Human Design shows people the things that are bad about them actually
aren’t, because they like the things that are, like Terminal Disease or
Perversion. And all we can do is provide clarity and a little slice of the
roadmap, nothing more. The initial reading is a glorified overview, which is a
lot easier to work from an expanded overview than too much detail. The focus
must be on this surface because that’s where these people are. They are going
to give the experiment a chance. There is no other way.
Projectors don’t have the same advantage of operating their strategy, breath
by breath, whereas Generators have the quickest potential for instant
gratification. They have a zillion opportunities as soon as they walk out the
door. You just have to be able to get them to understand, at a very superficial
level, what you are doing with that Bodygraph.
The first thing you must do is point out what the Bodygraph is all about. The
most fundamental thing about a chart is that it’s colored and it’s not. My hand
is always taking their attention and bringing it to a graph, so they are not on
the outside anymore. Set the framework; lay out the information, and then go
to work.

Example Chart: Truman Capote
Figure 11.8 Truman Capote
I never start with what they can be but what they are living.
Here, I start with the open Ego, then the Throat and then the Ajna. I say,
humanity is addicted to the concept of free will because it has no consistent
will power. There aren’t that many people with defined Egos. So I am
describing how the Bodygraph works, open versus defined Centers, and then I
throw in the open Ego like a bad cookie.
I rattle it on as if I am talking about somebody else “You have low self worth,
don’t make enough money, make promises you can’t keep. Talk like you are
talking about somebody else, and you have cut him or her, and hooked him or
her. All Generators are obsessed with open Centers.

The open Throat plus Ego is a double problem. This is a person who has very
big problems in the way in which they deal with the outside world. They need
to attract attention and prove they are worthy. They tend to take on enormous
burdens in order to attract attention that says they are doing good work. All
they will meet is resistance. They are lucky if they can speak out of their
throat, have problems with digestion and stomach; and are thyroid, manic
people, who run around trying to prove they are terrific and then drop dead in
the street.
The Incarnation cross, quarter, color, etc is an advantage to you in terms of
your framing the reading, but not to them.
In the first reading, if you have given them essential truths, you have done a
great job. Here are the basics for you. You can get their attention, make a
crack in the Maya, but you can’t wake them up. I know how to open the door,
but he has his own limitations of personality etc. I can’t know that. You aren’t
holding a holy scepter and you aren’t awakening people. When we do a good
job, they want to go out and try it, and not ask so many questions.
All I ever want for professionals is that they do a good job opening the door.
And only a few will try it. This is a deep battle for Generators, due to mental
maia, to approach this knowledge.
The place that frightens most Generators is that place where they honestly do
not know what is going to happen any more. This is called surrender. And
surrender is Generator serenity. However, once you surrender, you still have
the same geometry--only the windows are cleaner. Stupid before
enlightenment and stupid after. But surrender is the great leap.
I long ago stopped seeing the reading as a path to enlightenment. It is an
unburdening, whether they wake up or not. If you think you have to turn
everyone into light you will suffer, cause you won’t and it’s too much work.
Profile
Use profile as a tool because it gives you some vision about this being.
Profile is not something you have to get across to them; it’s something you
need to frame your reading. I originally never thought I would release profile

P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D T W E L V E
to general public, only to professionals as an insight tool. It is God’s gift to a
good reading.
Use profile to immediately display your confidence. A first line personality
will need more information than second line that is uncomfortable even sitting
beside you. A 6th line profile needs a three-phase approach, which has
enormous amount of impact power. You can frame it in a way that resonates
deeply with them.
A reading is not an education; it is a guide through a maze to a door. They
need to be impressed about what you see and what you say. So don’t spend
time explaining investigative martyr themes, etc.
With a 3/5, the first thing I say is, “I don’t know if I can really help you.”
They love it; they are putty in my hands. Never tell them you have the answer.
They will only listen for a mistake just to prove you are full of shit. It’s a
great tool for an MD, who could tell the 1/3. “I don’t know if this is really
right for you, we’ll see.” And for the 1st line personality: “You know, why
don’t you do some investigating? I’ll recommend some things that will really
help you.” You have an ally for life because it’s natural. Profile shows you
how to open somebody up. And it eliminates resistance.
Tell the 2/4: Say, “Hey, don’t move that chair!” Then they think, “Hey, he is
just like me! He wants to be left alone!” Don’t suggest web research to a 2/4;
instead tell them, “I don’t want to take up too much of your time, just a couple
of simple things.” Just treat the client as their profile.
A 5th line person is suspicious. If you take that into consideration, it’s much
easier because you can lead them to where they are feeling. Our job is to
know how to treat the other based on our knowledge of design.
Begin the healing with the way you treat the client. With Generators, the first
thing I ask them is, “Are you ready?” And when they say “yes” I know they
are not, but I still start treating them like Generators.
The open Ego has twelve variations in context depending on profile. You can
describe anything in the frame of the profile. There is no success possible
without impact. You need it right away, or you lose their attention. And the
sooner you do it, the sooner they realize they are not getting what they
expected. They are not used to someone who is so able, point after point, to
accurately touch them.
Do this with the open Centers because that is where all the problems are in
life. Their problems are rooted in their openness. The Generator story is that

Generators always try to manifest out of their open Centers. So, say, “This is
where you want to be a Manifestor, and where you have always tried to
manifest. You don’t try to manifest what you generate; you just generate what
you generate. You try and manifest what you are not.”
Follow Your Strategy
Example Chart: Truman Capote (Continuation)
This is the chart of an Emotional Generator. For every point I illustrate, for
instance, an open Center, I find a way to take that point straight to their
strategy. You need to repeat - which as a Teacher can tedious. But the reading
has to be rooted in the essential repetition of your strategy, and you pay the
price if you don’t follow it.
In this case, “You can only establish your worthiness by honoring your
emotional system over time through response.” Whatever the question is, that
is the answer. I will go back to Type 25 to 30 times during a 40 min reading.
i.e., this is exhibit A of pain and the answer: follow your strategy. Exhibit B,
same answer.
As an analyst there is no greater gift than an open center. So you keep on
reinforcing it, so they know that’s what their reading is all about. In this case,
here is someone who is very moody and emotional, and has a deep need to
challenge authority. However definition might set up in a chart, it is only there
to reinforce the same message.
The Emotional Generator
Emotional Generators are 17 to 18 percent of the population and the
Emotional system is deeply complex. It is difficult both to respond, and yet to
wait to clarify that response. You have to spend your time on that. The
emotionally defined never have any truth in the now. The Unemotional being
can be certain, but the emotional can never be certain. Clarity is not an

awareness or an absolute; it is a range of potential. You can never be 100
percent clear.
However, the ability to be 51 percent clear is very quick. But to be 60 percent
sure will take at least 3-4 times as much time as it took to get to 51%. And
when you are 99 percent clear, you will go to your deathbed and die. Do not
stretch the clarity process beyond 51 percent. As soon as they get 51 percent,
they are ready to act, but what you want is for them to give it another few
days at this point, because emotional people get to midpoint and then go back
and forth. The emotional wave itself is very complex; so many things going
on, and it is under deep mutative forces from the 55th and 49th Gates. So it is
not only unstable, but in transformation. So one of the most important things
you can say to the emotional Generator is, “This is not an absolute.”
Emotional Hearing
The right ear hears in the now, while the left ear cannot. Yet most beings put
the phone to the left ear. The moment emotional people move away from you,
they lose their frequency connection to you. So three days later, when they go
down in their wave, they will know this is part of the experiment. You need to
prepare them for that part of the experiment, so they know when they lose
frequency connection, it is ok; they can still try the experiment.
Truman Capote bitches about everything. There always has to be something
wrong. With the 39/55, his answer to everything you say is ”I don’t know.”
The more individual they are, the less likely they know what you are talking
about, and the 39/55 is emotionally deaf.
You can hold an Individual by their ears and scream in their face and they still
don’t hear you. They really do not know. That is the point of being mutative.
You can’t know until you know, and Individuals don’t like being influenced.
The 18/58 says, “Oh, tell them” while the 39/55 says, “Leave me alone.”
If you talk to the conscious gates, the client is right there with you, but the
unconscious gates glaze over. So there is no point going into drama about the
39/55 because the client won’t know what you are talking about. You talk to
the conscious gates to get their attention because that’s what they think they
are. The moment you talk to the red in the chart, they only sort of get it. And

you don’t want to give them an easy way out, because that is what most
clients want halfway through any decent reading - out.
The easiest Generator reading is the pure, Unemotional Generator - about 18
percent of the population. This is the best chance you’ve got of turning a pure
Generator around because you don’t have to go through the extended
discipline of waiting out the wave. There is never any right away for the
emotional. They will go through hell before they can really live with their
emotional self, although they can have positive experiments in the process.
The authority in life is sophisticated, powerful and never really clear, and the
level of consciousness that can see the positive of that is difficult to achieve.
Unemotional Manifestors make life a real bitch. Their ability to grasp
something in the moment seems impressive. And this is the false example
established for the planet: knowing is like snapping your fingers, and if you
don’t, you are stupid and will never win. This is Manifestor propaganda. I
have a certain awe and wonder for Emotional beings. I don’t have the ability
to sample a decision: the past and future mutating flowing, shifting, and
zapping around, as opposed to just the now.
The Emotional system carries more potential for the deepest recognition of
the other than any other awareness system of humanity. What you think can
never measure up to what you feel, and the Emotional system is frightening
now because it is unaware, but it will be aware later.
Emotional people have to relax into their frequency. The finger-snapping-now
life is not your life; this is the conditioning you have taken in. No Generator is
here for that, and as an Emotional being you simply can’t live like that. This is
not a punishment, it’s a reward. Your greatest gift is your slow digestion. It’s
where your experiential depth of feeling lies. If I want to know about another
person, I would rather ask an Emotional person. An Unemotional person gives
a cold, lifeless response and gives you a black and white, on /off response. If
you ask an emotional system, you can feel the other person emerging from
their wave. They have the depth to have seen people in different ways and
with many different colors and spectrum of possibilities.
Generators have been kept slaves by being forced to deal with black and
white; and Emotional beings who are forced to deal in black and white are lost
because there is no such thing. For them, there are only endless possibilities of
colors and tones and shades and hues. More neurons fire in the Solar Plexus
than in the brain, and we are moving towards a time when this will be a way
to know.

So take care to explain the beauty of the Emotional process. That’s why I tell
them to wait, not because 51 percent will become 99 percent, but because that
is their frequency. It becomes easier and easier to find a level of clarity that is
rooted in depth. My black and white Splenic Center is only talking about
healthy or unhealthy, whereas the Emotional system thinks about eating, and
sex, and fun, and families, and desires, and tribes, and experience; a huge
cosmic playground, and what you get fed back is extraordinary if you honor
it.
You are waiting a little longer, not just to become clear, but because you need
time to digest your feelings. The more time you have to digest, the better. A
low feeling about something won’t stay the same. You need to digest it to
move on.
The Emotional system runs in new technology. It is highly advanced and very,
very different.
If you are an Emotional Generator and waiting for life to come to you, don’t
count the time. It’s not “now, now, now, now, now.” It’s “whenever,
whenever, whenever, whenever” and that’s perfect. Don’t be a Manifestor.
For the emotional, life will appear to have slower moments of peak decision-
making. All the open spaces are not punishment, but rather the glory of what
it means to be emotional. Don’t get stuck in it: just take the pleasure of
watching it.
I trust my Emotional allies for their long-term perspective. The Emotional
person has layers and it’s beautiful. Going through a roller coaster is grace. So
tell your clients, if you act in the now, you are stupid; if you wait over time
you’re wise.
“Oh, I missed it.” is the story of this person’s life. “While I am waiting,
everyone else is having all the fun.” This is what they are thinking. “ I can’t
wait. I gotta gotta gotta.” The moment you say to an Emotional person “Time
is your ally.” you help them; because they are otherwise convinced they are
missing out on something.
Convey how well you know them— so they can be more relaxed with you and
with your knowledge, and also so, at the same time, you can protect them as
best you can (and you cannot protect the Non-Energy type the same way).
You need to give them that protection. Your concern is not the horrors of up
and down. They do not understand the good part of that: “It’s beautiful, and if
you operate correctly, you will see how beautiful it really is.”

The Manifesting Generator
Manifesting Generators are very confused into being Manifestors, and run
things over--missing them in life. They need to learn to do things step by step,
to stay with them, and to experience that Generator magic. But Manifesting
Generators don’t want to do anything step by step. They say, “I can jump,”
and insist they know everything. Meanwhile, they have left out 100 steps in
between. This is the surgeon who leaves the scissors inside the patient and
won’t go back to get them.
But then you get caught. The Gods will nail you. Every Manifesting
Generator gets nailed by the step they missed. Manifesting Generators spend a
lot of time in jail: “Oh shit, I forgot to put on my mask, I just jumped to the
robbing part. All I wanted was the money from the till.” When you have an
MG with you, this is what it is all about, the thing they are trying to hide from
themselves. And because it is impossible for an MG to go back, they make a
jump, get caught, and it’s over. Here, there is competition between the Sacral
and the Throat on what is essential and what isn’t. Things get left out, and
there is no reason: “I have no choice, I am a Manifesting Generator trying to
be an Manifestor, so I will jump.”
For me, Manifesting Generators are the most difficult and uncontrollable
element on the planet. We cannot afford to skip essential steps. There is this
huge phalanx of people leapfrogging over everything with no depth, no
foundation, and just the illusion of busyness. They are the angriest people on
the planet because they want to be Manifestors but aren’t. The Manifestor’s
anger state lasts about three minutes and then it is gone. But the Manifesting
Generator’s anger feeds off their frustration and it’s a nasty anger.
So talk to them about what it means to suffer. Pure Generators are designed to
be frustrated at the end of a phase, not all the time. And the pure Generator
has the ability to stay through frustration, because the next stage does come.
But the MG never even allows itself to get to place where natural frustration
lies. It already has frustration when it gets somewhere, but the manifesting
element is always egging them on. They can really thrust themselves into a
stage, but entering into is not about finishing. It’s about being in it totally and
completely. MG’s can move through the stage faster without missing anything
because of its manifesting capacity.
This only makes a difference in the emotional being because they want to rush
through, and they can’t; whereas, this is a benefit for the pure Generator. The
deeper they are in any stage, the richer they are in movement forward.

The most important gift you can give them is what it means to respond, and
ultimately to manifest. The MG is here to manifest through response, and that
stage allows them to manage that process. This is a much better example in
terms of expression because ultimately a pure Generator can only express
through response. Expression is limited to the Sacral; in that sense anything
coming from throat is a translation. But the primary importance of the Throat
is the capacity to articulate, to speak, so the MG is here to be the
spokesperson for stages of processes. They can articulate the process in
language. It’s the sacral that governs the physical life, but the Throat that can
represent that life to others. All of us need to understand processes. The pure
Sacral being has a dilemma in trying to explain what they have been through.
For them, natural explanation through the throat is not natural. They can
respond to the value of the process. If you say something to the MG, it has to
be more than “unh, unh.” They bring in another level of explanation,
articulation, and communication that is the natural by-product of the defined
Throat.
Those who misunderstand think the Sacral and Throat are competing to do
same job, but that is the Not-Self version. In the Manifesting Generator, the
correct process is that the Sacral is what takes you in, and the Throat is what
expresses your process. If the Manifesting Generator understands this, they
will not be caught on the Throat, ruining their experience. That’s when they
meet resistance and are angry and frustrated.
The Sacral straight to the Throat is the only pure Manifesting Generator. So
with the 20/34 there is no way to divide the two processes. And in these
beings, the processes are confused. The 20/34 is a hamster on a wheel. The
only way to help 20/34 is find them a 43/23, because this is the only guidance
it will accept. This is an ancient relationship. And since they are both
oppositions on the wheel, there are lots of them. The 43/23 can explain but
has no capacity to do. The 20/ 34 can do, but its clueless. The 20/34 has no
conflict; it just doesn’t know what to do. They are gifted, so they need the
right guidance.

The Emotional Manifesting Generator
This is the most uncomfortable emotional configuration of all. The essential
conflict becomes emotionalized, and because they do not respect this, they
tend to jump into emotionally explosive situations. This is blinding
emotionally and results in anger about being stuck with everybody else.
Manifesting Generator stuckness is personal: “I’m stuck with them and I
want to move on.” The Emotional Manifesting Generator adds a short fuse to
the mix.
The only way to help anyone here is by pointing out the suffering they already
recognize as part of their process. And this is the only way to help the defined
Ego. It is practically impossible to make a defined Ego feel low, and a defined
Ego Manifesting Generator probably won’t come to see you unless someone
makes it the law. They don’t want to know they missed anything or hear
anything about it.
Generators are living concretization of Einstein’s theory of relativity. No
Generator is here to go back. They can’t. They are only here to move forward.
This is the dilemma of the Manifesting Generator. They are designed to skip
steps as Not-Self but can’t go back. They can only pay the price, and they hate
it: “I can’t believe I am back here stuck with these people.” They want to go
forward.
The awake Generator is a builder, not a slave. Stage upon stage is the magic.
Generators are holy vessels. Let’s create half the vessel with the easy
opportunity to be holy, and the other half with an easy opportunity to go to
hell. The Pure Generator has the opportunity to go through life without this
pressure. But not the MG, and unless there is a spokesperson, we have no
capacity to transform the world we live in.
MGs think being a Manifestor is better than being a Manifesting Generator,
but, if you are a Generator without response, you can never have life that is
correct. Manifesting Generators who experiment with response see they are
better equipped to express the experience than pure Generators. They are the
voice of the building process and express the dynamics of the process. The
gift is built into them. When the focus of the Throat is an articulation, not
action, you have done a remarkable job of healing them. The moment there is
competition between other motors and the Sacral, the Sacral loses, because it

doesn’t have the ability to express itself in a diversity of possibilities. MGs
want to be Manifestors due to the power of the Throat to articulate.
But this not a Manifestor; it is the potential of articulation as a Generator. It
ought to be called the Big Mouth Generator instead of the Manifesting
Generator so everyone could calm down.
As spokespeople of humanity, they have to go through the whole process,
which is an advantage, and not a restraint. Tell them, “Now you can
accumulate information. You don’t get it just the first time, you have to stay
with it and figure it out.” So you have something to say.
That way you separate but do not deny Manifesting Generators. Manifesting
Generators that go through processes and learn to articulate them feel terrific.
After that, the technique lies in delivering nuances, not just a huge splattering
of paint on the wall with all that information. Just give them what they need.
The Manifestor
The Manifestors who show up for a reading are the ones who know that their
time is over. They are there not so much to be confirmed as to be affirmed.
Manifestors are not a force any more. Their anger comes mostly from being
subject to repression and controls that are so opposite to their history. They
were always the great ones, the ones in control. But their time ended
hundreds of years ago.
Like the horse, they used to be Gods, and now little girls ride them.
They have no true strategy and they know it. You tell them you have to
inform, and they just look at you, because they hate it; not at all like the
Generator reading where they feel it vibrating inside of them.
So I show them the chain of disaster that results from not informing. They
will pay the price almost immediately, and over and over again, because they
are no longer top dog, and because they used to be top dog - now everyone
likes to kick them. You can only save Manifestors when they are young: “If
you ask, you won’t get into trouble.” And they are tired of getting into
trouble. “If you let us know, it will be easier for you.”

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
Do not say in readings, “Here’s your strategy.” You can’t bullshit them. Tell
them it is just a technique, and you are a minority and different. A technique
to make life easier.
No Manifestor wants to be told what to do. Manifestors aren’t waiting.
If the Manifestor takes this in, it really transforms them because it is such a
surprise: “I’m not giving up being a Manifestor, I am fooling you into
thinking I am like you, predictable, safe.”
If I walk up to a stranger, I can always feel their aura filling up to protect
themselves from me. The only way to bring Manifestors to their grace is by
teaching them a technique; not so they can have control over Generators, but
to allow them to do whatever they were going to do anyway without running
Generators over. As soon as they see it works, they will see it as strength not
weakness, and tool for making their life easier.
Energy Types vs. Non Energy Types
Energy Types can go out immediately and experiment with process. Non
Energy Types can’t. With Energy Types, the process is personal, immediate,
and powerful. So just equip them for their process and get them going on their
experiment; that is all they need. Generators just want a better life. Whereas
with the Projector, the reading is a small, small investment in the long process
with no possible direct concretized result.
So it’s more exciting to work with an Energy Type than a Non-Energy Type -
they are ready; right there, ok, let’s go. Whereas the Projector will say, “I’m
not ready, not ready, not ready.”
So Projectors need an academic process as guide and masters of systems.
When I read a Projector, I bring my library. Reflectors only need to learn one
thing: to understand the daily program. Get them to be in touch with the
program. That is the whole program. All they need is a computer program and
they are gone.

Projector Readings
Projectors initially had a negative experience of Design because they couldn’t
have an immediate experience of it, and therefore, they didn’t see it was an
awakeness vehicle as opposed to just a system. Generators can start
experimenting immediately. For them, Design is consciousness changing
because their mechanism can be easily changed. But a Projector cannot be
liberated overnight, because no Projector can let go of anything until he or she
can truly master it. Once they master something, they can exchange fuel for
guidance. Unlike Generators, Projectors are not designed to live a perfected
life with ease. They wake up by osmosis, slowly but surely, by observing
everything around them; and can finally be at ease, because they have
mastered the system. The Generator says, “Who am I?” but the Projector says,
“Who are you?”
Unlike all other Types, Projectors require seven years to master the system.
This is because the mastery of all systems occurs over a seven-year cycle, and
that is why Projectors are here, to master the system, and be able to translate
what they have mastered into teaching the Other. Design was designed for the
way they see, and the Projector’s natural gift of recognizing is at the core any
system.
So while we cannot offer them instant satori, we can offer them something
that is very, very interesting to study.
The Reading
For the first Projector reading, do a collective overview. Since they can only
awaken through the mirror of the Other, have Projectors bring the charts of
lots of other people in their lives and do a mini-reading. Then they will be
excited about experimenting with everyone else’s design, not their own, and
that is exciting.
Don’t avoid their design in the reading: show it in counterpoint to those
people around them. Demonstrate relationship with the Other through their
Human Design International Training Manuals. 293

I N T E R N A T I O N A L H U M A N D E S I G N S C H O O L S
openness and through what is fixed. For instance, an Unemotional Projector
with an emotional spouse will only learn about the open Solar Plexus through
the spouse. Make sure they bring several charts, not one, because, otherwise,
they tend to only bring the one they have a problem with. A collective
overview will bring Projectors in as a healthy way and with a unique process
which is just for them.
It’s not about expanding the reading. Just give them enough to cover the
surface of the Self and show them connections to others and how easy it is to
impact them in a very deep way. As you introduce each of the basic elements,
refer to each of the accompanying charts. The moment you refer to an open
Center in the Projectors, also refer to someone in their life who is defined
there.
You don’t have the same pressure on you to do a thorough reading. The
Projector gets ten minutes out of, let’s say 45, in a reading. Tease the
Projector. Describe them through the Other, have them walk out saying, “I
didn’t get enough.”
However, Projectors cannot leave without tools: references to courses,
materials, free stuff, websites etc. So create an information package for them.
Generators leave a reading with nothing but the experiment, but a Projector’s
experiment is to fill in the gaps.
And while Generators come in naked, innocent, and completely unprepared to
a reading, Projectors can come prepared. Give them sense you will share the
knowledge.
Manifestors and Generators share an intensity process which drives the
Projector crazy. So if you are an Energy Type yourself, consider meeting with
them virtually for their first reading or their LD.
No Energy to Invest
Generators and Manifestors are personally invested in everything they do.
Generators are the most serious people because they are so deeply invested in
their energy. But when the Projector does something, he or she is using your
energy. Projectors take no personal responsibility: “It’s Harry’s problem if I
fucked up at work.”

P T L 1 T E A C H E R M A N U A L W E E K E N D T W E L V E
This is where everything special about you resides. Because Projectors don’t
have energy to invest, they are deeply trustworthy—it’s like receiving
financial advice from someone you aren’t paying. They can guide vast
numbers of beings by pointing out their incorrectness, and that is their job,
and also why Projectors have been the abandoned child of type for millennia:
no one wants to empower that kind of scrutiny and analysis. They see a chart
in a different context and more deeply. They are looking to see what your
problem is: your weakness. Their vision is different.
Because of this, they are, in a sense, on permanent cosmic vacation. A
Generator who tries to stay in bed all day will eventually die. But you can put
a Projector in bed for 35 years, and if they have everything they need, they
will never get up; and meanwhile, they watch everything, because they make
no investment of energy, because they have none. The only Projector who
invests energy is a Not-Self Projector, who actually invests your own energy
back into the system. If you have a Sacral or Throat, you have no choice but
to vibrate or do. But Projectors are uniquely designed to be wise about
generating and manifesting, as opposed to doing it themselves; therefore, they
need to be objective and different from that.
The Projector also has a catalogue of auras in his or her energy field
cellularly. They are always matching: “Mary has this and George has that.”
They can even feel someone’s cross.
Profile and the Projector Reading
Profile is a support mechanism for doing a reading. Having it as a tool is more
important than introducing it to a client. Profile is even more important to a
Non Energy Type reading.
With a Projector, profile will tell you level and quality of their bitterness. So
you can offer them the sweet, by showing them who they can blame, in
deepest part of their bitterness. Don’t give them their design profile. An
Energy Type needs to grasp this because they are dealing with it and bumping
into it all the time. But for a Non energy type, personality is everything. They
need the personality profile because it is who they think they are. Their
unconscious is somebody else’s fault because someone generated or
manifested it out of them.

You are allowing them to displace their bitterness. “ It’s your fault I am so
damn emotional, not mine.” At the moment there is transference, the Projector
begins to grow. And it’s sweet for them to blame someone else and displace
their Bitterness.
Nodes
It is very important to look at their direction in their process.
The nodes represent the environment of your life, and there isn’t anything
more important. Energy types don’t really care, since it isn’t the most
powerful thing they have to deal with. They will make the best out of any
environment regardless. Being in a heavy neighborhood doesn’t mean
anything to a Generator, but a Projector becomes the neighborhood. An
energy type is not conditioned deeply by the neighborhood, while the nodal
environment deeply impacts the non energy type.
Therefore, the Energy type is guided down the road by a Projector who
becomes the neighborhood. And the Nodes become characteristic of their life
in very strong way.

Example Chart: Brad Pitt
Figure 11.9 Brad Pitt
Brad Pitt has 38/39 nodes, so he will always meet provocation and opposition.
But that doesn’t mean that he will necessarily become a fighter or
provocateur.
If you are a Projector, you are the neighborhood, so you can get through
without being knifed, and show other people around. They represent their
neighborhoods because they live them so deeply. This person can help you
with your passion, and moods, and struggle, because he lives it.
This is particularly true of the Personality Nodes. The neighborhood is an
artifice, so the Projector invests nothing in the profile of those going down the
streets. With eight or nine billion Projectors on the planet, we have a spy in
every window. They control all the neighborhoods and know everything about
them. The problem is that the environment doesn’t change because the

Projectors aren’t awake, and therefore, they aren’t guiding people properly
through their neighborhoods.
Energy Types are volatile because they change. Projectors, in contrast, are
fixed for life due to lack of movement. Therefore, they gain enormous depth
about their environment, and have a key to it because it doesn’t change. When
the Projector operates correctly, the environment operates correctly.
An awake Projector is sweet, not bitter. And life is only sweet when they are
masters of their environment. This is what gives them security.
The Reflector Reading
Reflectors are here to understand the weather, which is something on
everybody’s mind. The imprint of any given moment is the weather and the
Reflector is the only being here to embody the program.
Their relationship is with the Gods—not with people or things. Unlike the rest
of us, they don’t get conditioned by the Gods, because they have no
definition. They know who is stuck in the Program, and therefore, how that
conditioning came to them through others as secondary phenomena. They are
so sensitive to the environment that they know whether people are aligned by
the Program or being conditioned by the Program.
Therefore, do a Reflector reading as composite with the moment. Then ask
them to come back on a different day next month and do another reading.
Because the Reflector is here to be perfectly in tune with the Program, there is
no such thing as a consistent Reflector reading. Their job is to be the Program,
while the job of any other Type is to resist it.
The idea of the 28 day cycle reading is to introduce the idea that the Reflector
is only a transit field. There is no such thing as a Reflector Design; only
Profile and Nodes as conditioning force.
Focus the Reflector on transits. They should buy the ephemeris program.
The moment they see they cannot measure their design the way others are
measured, is the moment you liberate them. The Introductory reading puts a
handle on their process.

Stay with the surface of chart, but give them the Program as their key. Be
cognizant of it. This is where their development and purpose are fulfilled.
Give them tools to experience, not experiment.
The Question of Being Conditioned by the Other
Tell them, “Don’t listen to rules of other Types because they are not for you.
You are here to be what the program demands with awareness. You are
representative of what The Program is on the planet.” Say, in reference to the
conditioning field of any given moment, ‘I’m supposed to feel like this right
now, you aren’t.”
What the Reflector is not here to do is to be conditioned by the Other. The
most difficult chart condition for this can be a 4 in the Profile because
aloofness is of great value to the Reflector. Reflectors can be lonely people,
who know deep down they don’t need others, and the greatest gift you can
give them is to ask them how they feel at any given moment.
It takes a great deal of experience and experimenting with the Program to get
to the point. The Projector masters mechanics, but the Reflector is here to
identify with the program, and so many Reflectors are unaware of this, and
aware of mirroring other people instead. If possible, check the program every
morning. That is who you are supposed to be that day.
Uniqueness is a goal for major Types, yet they are homogenized. But the
Reflector is the embodiment of homogenization and the generalist. Only when
they can see their mirror, can they find their uniqueness. So we have to get
them to experiment with the Program, so they know how to do their job. If
you have an awake Reflector, just ask them who they are every day in order to
know the transits. They think they have been one person, but they are actually
a different person every day. The program gives them their life. Otherwise
they are a rock.

Profile and Nodes
Profile is very, very important to a Reflector. They must discover their
activation potential themselves because they are different, only planets
complete them. No other Type can understand that.
A Reflector is nothing but Profile and Nodes. There are very distinct
differences in them based on profile; almost twelve types.
The Reflector will make sure the neighborhood is filled up by the ones who
are correct for it because they are the only ones who know.
Not a Reading; a Conversation
Most of the mysteries are locked in the souls of Reflectors. Ultimately the
Reflector will have the gift of holding a baby in their arms and knowing its
evolution. It’s not a reading at all, it’s a conversation. There is no comparison
to how you might read another Type.
Class Exercise:
Using example charts, each other’s chart, or one’s own chart, practice going back and
forth between the Self and the Not-Self in keynoting to the point where it begins to
become very fluent (you can assign this also as an overnight exercise the night before and
continue practice and review of this technique in class.)

The Mechanics of Surrender
I don’t think you can be awake without knowing this knowledge, or
rightfully be a teacher of spirit, without knowing this knowledge.
Consciousness and form are at the very basis of what it is to awake, and it
is our responsibility to understand how this works, and to surrender to it.
And you can’t do that unless you understand how to get there. This is the
magic of this knowledge--that we actually understand how.
Course Closure
Please end your year of classes with whatever ceremony or acknowledgment is
appropriate for your students, so they get feedback appropriate to their level of
accomplishment. They have worked hard, and so have you!
Also, please orient them toward PTL II/Level 4 Transits and the Other and the
continuation of their professional education as appropriate.
And also congratulate and acknowledge yourself of course.

Appendix: Overview of IHDS General Level I (Rave ABC’s),
General Level II (Rave Cartography), and Professional Training
Level I (Analyst Skill Training)
Rave ABC’s Teacher Manual
This sequence of three manuals is your support vehicle to teach the Rave Analysis
Method (third generation Human Design System Teaching as first taught for certification
by Ra Uru Hu in October of 2004). This book, Rave ABC’s Teacher’s Manual Level 1,
provides concise support material to teach the 11 basic Human Design System keynotes,
which empower a student to describe any Human Design chart at the surface level. It is
designed to be taught in two weekends ideally scheduled with at least one month of
integration time in between them.
Rave Cartography Teacher Manual
The second volume, Rave Cartography, contains your support material for teaching this
second level of Human Design General Education. This level of General Human Design
education takes students deeper into the Four Views: The Nine Centers and the Not-Self,
Definition, Authority and Profile. Rave Cartography builds on the Rave ABC’s by taking
students deeper into their own process and the Not-Self while also giving them depth of
level of insight and experience into how the Bodygraph functions as they continue to
practice reading charts while adding the Four Views to their skill set. Rave Cartography
Level II also guides students to begin to practice the skill of chart synthesis.
Professional Level 1 and Rave Analysis Method (RAM)
Professional Level I is the year long course that prepares students with the technique and
knowledge they need to be Analysts. It delivers the detail level of the Human Design
System--the 64 gates and 384 lines of the Rave I Ching in Bodygraph format and through
Rave I Ching context. Its innovation is the Rave Analysis Method, a professional
application that empowers and supports Analysts to read charts in a concise, integrated
manner that synthesizes all facets of the Bodygraph into a simple, moving geometry that
naturally reveals a client’s uniqueness.

OVERVIEW: THIRD GENERATION IHDS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM L 1-3
It also offers supplementary enrichment units that train students in the non-analytic skills
essential to becoming an Analyst and requires regular oral homework assignments
delivered in MP3 format.
Throughout, the three-course curriculum presents Human Design through its visual
language in Bodygraph structure. Every chart element and activation is presented in
context of the complete Bodygraph or, in PTL 1/Level III, the Rave I Ching: never as a
single discrete byte of information but rather always motion and referring to and framing
every other aspect of a chart from the surface level to the Bodygraph’s depth. Each level
of Design information is revealed only in the context and frame of every other.
Teaching Lineage: First, Second, and Third Generations
The first generation of Human Design System Teachers, trained by Ra Uru Hu in the
earlier 1990’s in Germany, Austria, Spain, and, later on, in the United States, was given
the fine detail (line level) of the knowledge. There was no Type, Strategy, or Authority
and the point of reference was, first the Black Book and, later, the Rave I Ching.
As Ra Uru Hu has observed, it was necessary to teach the Human Design in this manner
to anchor its foundation. Students and teachers of the 1990’s recall being educated with
tiny, precise bits of line level information with very specific practical insight that
illuminated the accuracy, depth immediate practicality of the system while also enticing
them to want more.
This level of detail remains consistent in its application into the present. For example,
the Professional Training Level I Teacher’s Manual contains a table of with keywords
and associations for each of the 64 Gates created by J.R. Randy Richmond in 1999 in
Sedona after Ra Uru Hu taught him circuits in two days. The information it contains is
absolutely consistent with how Design is being taught today.
The second generation of teachers, trained in the early 2000’s, received an education hat
stressed the practical, simply powerful surface synthesis of Human Design. This is when
Type, Strategy, Authority, and Profile emerged as the centerpieces of analysis, and the
previously unintegrated line-level chart details became known as characteristics, which
would operate most effectively and uniquely when any being was operating correctly
through Type. This approach presented the clear binary to the first generation method. Its
core perspective was anchored into the new generation of teachers as the teaching of
Design continued to evolve.
This third generation teaching method synthesizes the binary of the first and second
generation methods. It presents these levels of knowledge through a technique that
methodically and logically builds skill in the Bodygraph and its interpretation while
synthesizing its surface and detail information. Third generation Human Design

Education also brings with it a very consistently high level of standard in training and
development in a range of professional skills at this level of education.
This training sequence has been developed with an evolving global perspective. It has
taken into account the methods and needs of a variety of national organizations to help
present a global standard that also allows for local expression and unique contributions. It
is hoped this will not only help reinforce a consistently high standard in global Human
Design education, but also foster international and virtual community based on this
shared universal language and wisdom body.
Resources and Structures for Instructors
These manuals were designed by American and European Human Design Instructors,
taking into account the feedback and needs of many more based on Ra Uru Hu’s October
2004 teaching. Technical resources range from charting of Bodygraph Mirror Symmetry
and 2006 profiling tables to instructions for calculating the one-on-one correspondence of
the 64 Hexagrams of the Rave I Ching and the name and category of the star that became
Supernova 1987A. We also include very detailed lesson plans, example exercises, and
repetition and summarization of the same information at different levels in the sequence
for skill-building. Of course, you are free to structure the course as you would like to and
this approach is encouraged, particularly for experienced educators.
The baseline in either case is that educational standards be met, sufficient time be taken
that students can both learn and verbally practice new skills, and that required course
elements including universal skills and assignments (i.e. Virtual Literacy) be fulfilled. In
addition, instructors are responsible for monitoring and screening the quality and
potential of the pre-professional student in PTL 1/Level III.
Sheet Music that Mutates
As per above, please consider these manuals “sheet music” for the courses you design:
the foundational resource and reference point for any effective teaching interpretation.
Again, the primary focus is always student empowerment and support for skill-building.
At every level, this is achieved by teaching the visual language and verbal of Human
Design and then following up with oral practice and play at the level appropriate for the
content and skill set in question. Also keep in mind that student learning styles will
reflect their own designs.
