DEDICATION
This bookis dedicated to RaUru Hu,
thefounder and messengerof
TheHumanDesignSystem,
to ourgrandchildren,
and to allfuture generations.
RA URU Hu
HUMAN DESIGN FOUNDER, MESSENGER & TEACHER
OF THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM
Ra Uru Hu, born Robert Allan Krakower, was the fourth child ofa
cultured, upper middle class family from Montreal, Canada. He was
surrounded by the arts and learned to express himselfthrough music
as acomposer and performer,an avocation he pursued until his death.
He completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree at Sir George Williams
University, but his career path led him into the business world as an
advertisingexecutive,magazine publisherand mediaproducer.
Onemorningin1983,hesimplywalkedawayfrom hisfamilyandfast-paced lifeasanentrepreneur
- from lifeas he knewit- and'disappeared.'Severalmonthslaterhefound himselfonthe beautiful
and temperate island ofIbiza,in the Mediterranean Seaoffthe eastern coastofSpain.This'Eden',
as heliked to callit,is where his'real'life as RaUru Hu had its beginnings.
On the evening ofJanuary 3, 1987,he encountered the 'Voice.'Itwas a terrifYing experience.The
Voice said,''Areyou readytowork?"Andfor eightdays and eightnights heworked,transcribingin
detailwhatis nowknown asThe HumanDesign System. Ra speaks ofthe encounteras awake-up
call,aneducationwhichshowedhimhowblindandignoranthisassumptionswereaboutthenature
ofbeing,the cosmos and thewaythingswork.
Raconsideredhimselfthe messengerofTheHumanDesign System,nowhislegacy,and dedicated
his life since the encounter to disseminating the Science ofDifferentiation around the world. He
lived andworked in Ibizawhere he enjoyed teaching,playing music,gardening and spending time
with hiswife,three children and his grandson.
As Ra has said many times, "Don't believe a thing I tell you, try it for yourself"There are now
thousandsofpeopleacrosstheworldwhohaveworkedwithTheHumanDesignSystem,andfound
thatitdoes indeed accuratelyreveal the mechanics ofthewaylifeworks.

private student as we corresponded almost daily about the details ofThe Human Design System
knowledge,and his vision for it.He taught me how importantitis to maintain the authenticityof
the knowledge he was given, and he confided to me his dreams,wishes, and overallvision forThe
HumanDesign System.In theprocess,he transformed mylifeand thewayIviewtheworldaround
me.And he instilled in me the tools I need to continue to bring this knowledge to allwho canuse

PREFACE
BY LYNDA BUNNELL
Imagine for a moment howdifferentyourlife might have beenforyou and your parents ifaUser's
Guide had accompanied your birth.Imaginewhat itwould have been like as a child to have been
encouragedtoconnectwiththepartdeepinsideyouthatalwaysknewwhatwascorrectornotcorrect
foryou; aplaceyou couldhave trusted to say"yes"or"no"towhateveryou metin this life.Imagine
for amoment howwonderfulitwould have been to knowhowincrediblyuniqueyouwere born to
be,how unlike any other person alive,and to celebrate that uniqueness bylovingyourselfwithout
comparison.Andimaginehowwonderfulitwouldbetodayto haveyouruniquenesscelebratedand
encouragedbyyourfamilyandfriends.Thisis thepossibilitythatTheHumanDesignSystemholds
foryou and future generations.
Though Human Designwasn't here when most ofus were born, it can touch and transform alife
at any age. My own personal experience with this remarkable system began when I was in my
early forties. As a successful and well-established businesswoman in Southern California in the
1990's,I thoughtI hadachievedeverythinganyone needed to behappy- yetI knewIwasn'thappy.
There was a disconnect between what my mind thought and my own inner truth. 0 amount of
exploration through other systems ofself-discovery had succeeded in making that connection or
filling thevoid I sensedwithin.
A new chapter ofmy journey began in 1998 while vacationing in southern Spain. My traveling
companion, a spiritual seeker like myself, had brought some cassette tapes with her describing a
whole new system for personal transformation.We listened as we roamed the hillsides in our car.
Little did I suspect that this man's amazingencounterwhile on a tiny island in the Mediterranean
- onlyafew miles awayfrom us at that time- would turn mylife upside down and inside out.The
man's namewas RaUru Hu and the systemwas HumanDesign.
Ittookabitofconvincingbymyfriend,butonceI receivedaHumanDesignreadingIwas hooked.
I discovered that Human Design was what I had been seeking. I left my career behind without a
backward glance and immersed myselfin reading and listening to everything I could find about
the knowledge.I participatedin private readings and tookextensive classeswith Ra in Europe and
America for days and weeks at a time. It was an incredible, life-reorienting experience ofstep by
step,decision bydecision,dismantlingmyfirmly held misconceptions about myselfand life.
AsIsurrenderedtomyinnerwisdom,lifetookmeinunexpecteddirectionstosatisfYingdestinationsI
couldnothavedreamedofformyselfThereweremomentsofdeepanddifficultinnertransformations
as well. Human Design had not only shown me why my early successes in life had left me feeling
empty, it set me on a unique path that has brought me to this moment, fulfilled, challenged and
satisfied bymywork- partofwhichiswriting this book.This scienceis precious to humankind.I've

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
First I have to thank Ra Uru Hu.We spent agreat deal oftime collaborating on various projects
overtheyears,andI thankmyluckystars that the fates and myown trajectoryputmeinalignment
with this rare, brilliant and unusual man. He broughtreal,lasting and meaningful mutation to my
lifeand thelives oftensofthousands.Ipredicthis legacywillcontinueonfarinto the distantfuture
and touch many generations.We had the love ofHuman Design in common and I am satisfied
that I expressed mygratitude to him time and time again over the years. He was a good man, he
neverwanted to be followed as a Guru, and his students knew how much he loved his family and
his life. It's a rare event indeed that a person comes into the world to be the clarion planting the
seed ofa bodyofknowledge such as this."It never hurts to be grateful,"he said to me during one
ofmy talkswith him- and gratefulI am.I am also deeplygrateful to Ra's family, hiswifeAmbuja,
daughter Sarah,son-in-lawMau,sons Loki and]iva,and grandson Kian,for providinghimwith a
lovingfamilyandsupportsystemwhichallowedhim todohiswork.HumanDesigncouldnothave
happenedwithout them.
This book has been a labor oflove and has taken a monumental effort to bring it into existence.
I have to pay a special tribute to Donna Garlinghouse as contributing editor and advisor on this
project.Donnaworkedwith mestep-by-stepfor the pastfewyearsas this booktookshape. Shehas
a'left-mind'and I have a'right-mind'which made for an excellent collaborative effort.Donnais a
force ofnature and agift to us all. She helped me to see things clearlyduring some difficult times.
She is an amazingwomanandwe are allblessed to have heras partofourcommunity.
A heartfelt thankyou goes to Bethi Black.Hercontributions as advisor,editor,and in bookdesign
and layout,were priceless. Although we have worked together on other projects, little did I know
that when I called her last summer (2010) to ask her to help me with the school that we would
end up working on thisproject together. Inlooking backI see howitwas so perfectlyand divinely
orchestrated.Bethiliterallymovedinto myhouse sowe could eat,breath,sleep,andworkthis book
into existence during the final home stretch. On manylevel ,itwould have beenimpossible to get
through this pastyearwithouther.
And thankyou to BeckyMarkley,contributingeditorfor the LivingYourDesignmanuals,foryour
sharp eye for detail and help with feedback and editing; Cathy Kinnaird and Carol Zimmerman,
foryourinspiration,loveandsupport;GenoaBliven,foryourtruehumanityand understandingthe
importance ofpreserving and honoring Ra's work and legacy; and both Mary Ann Winiger and
Randy Richmond, treasures in ourcommunity,for providingobjectiveguidanceforus all.
Sarah Krakower and Maurizio Cattaneo,with HumanDesign Concepts,provided abrilliantbook
coverand amazinggraphics. Ra used to say,"Human Design is avisual medium,avisual road map
to understanding our true nature,"and Mau clearlyknows and embraces this in his core as we see
withthebeautifulillustrationsinthisbook.SarahandMaumakeagreatteam,anditisveryapropos

right therebesideme thewholewaythrough thisprojectaskingeveryday,"Areyougoingtowork
on the booktoday?"I wonderwhat shewill ask me now that itis done!
Although there are too many to name, this bookowes its greatest debt to the students,analysts
and teachers ofThe Human Design System - these are the true heros and pioneers. As we
each live ourlives according to our true nature,we change the world for the better one person
at a time. Human Design could not have progressed to where it is today without all ofyou
doing your great work in the Human Design community. I know that I have been touched in
some way by all ofyou. We stand on the shoulders ofthose who have gone before us, and we
upliftand support those thatarejoiningus in this incredible movementofThe Human Design
System out into the world. Ra handed us the baton the dayhe passed from this earth, and now
it's up to us to continue what he started.
6 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
"THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM IS NOT A BELIEF SYSTEM. IT DOES NOT
REQUIRE THAT YOU BELIEVE IN ANYTHING. IT IS NEITHER STORIES
NOR PHILOSOPHY. IT IS A CONCRETE MAP TO THE NATURE OF BEING, A
MAPPING OF YOUR GENETIC CODE. THIS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DETAIL
THE MECHANICS OF OUR NATURE IN SUCH DEPTH IS OBVIOUSLY
PROFOUND BECAUSE IT REVEALS OUR COMPLETE NATURE IN ALL ITS
SUBTLETIES. HUMAN DESIGN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE POTENTIAL
OF SELF-LOVE, A LOVE OF LIFE AND THE LOVE OF OTHERS THROUGH
UNDERSTANDING." - RA URU Hu

we are genetically designed to engage with the world, and how our unique inner guidance system
operates. Neverbeforehavewe beenable to see allofthe parts ofourselves so clearly.Theconscious
and unconscious parts ofourselves, the aspects ofus that no one can take awayfrom us, as well as
the aspects thatwe have been taughtorconditioned to believe are us,butare not.
As Ra Dru Hu has often said, "What you can rely on you've never relied on in your life. What
you can't trust you've been trying to trust all your life.What you've been trusting has never been
you. What you've been ignoring has always been you.Try to trust what's really you and see what

touchwith those differences.We are here to live ourlives and express ourtruths in ourown unique
ways.Understanding this can liftagreatweightfrom ourshoulders.Howoften havewe compared
ourselves to someone else? How often as childrenwere we compared to someone else by a parent,
teacherorpeer? Comparingourselves to others createsan impressiondeep insideofus thatitis not
okayto bewho we are.Whenwe add that to the conditioningofour earlyyears,we find ourselves
trying to change or adapthowwe act to suitothers,whichfurther distances us from the personwe
were born to be.When we begin to understand and accept our own uniqueness, something inside
ofus opens up and relaxes.Thelayers andlayers ofconditioningslowlyfall away,and thepersonwe

WHO You ARE - THE FOUR HUMAN DESIGN TYPES
Yourchartgives youyourType,Strategy,and Authority (body-centered intelligence) tools to show
you thewayyou are designed to navigate through life and interactwith the world.While there are
millionsofvariationsofdesigns,therearejustfourTypesofhumanbeings.Eachofusisoneofthese
Types,andyourType stays the same throughoutyourentirelife.Here is averybriefexplanationof
the FourTypes.(TheTypes are covered in depth in SectionFour.)
GENERATORS, THE BuILDERS, representabout70percentofthepopulation.Their Strategyis to
engagewithlifebywaitingfor things to cometo themso thattheycanrespond.When theyinitiate
rather than wait to respond, they usually end up feeling frustrated. Generators are the life-force
ofthe planet and are designed to know themselves by observing what they respond to. Through
responding theyexperience satisfactionin theirlife andwork.Theirworkis theirgift to theworld.
PROJECTORS, THE GuIDES, are approximately 20 percent ofthe population.Their Strategy for
engagingwith life is to wait for their specific qualities to be recognized and invited into things.It
is through an invitation that they experience recognition and success in their lives. Ifthey initiate
rather than wait, they experience resistance and rejection and can end up becoming bitter. The
Projector's gift to theworld is to understand and beaguidefor others.
MANIFESTORS, THE INITIATORS, compose about 9 percent ofthe population. Their Strategy is
to inform others oftheir decision before they take action in order to eliminate resistance. When
Manifestors cannot manifest in peace, they experience anger. Manifestors are designed to have a
powerfulimpactandbeinitiatingmechanismsfortheotherTypes.Initiatingis theirgiftto theworld.
REFLECTORS, THE DISCERNERS, represent approximately 1 percent of the population. Their
Strategy is to wait through a full cycle of the Moon before making major decisions. Reflectors
delightinlife's surprises.When theyinitiate and don't use their Strategy,theyend up disappointed
withlife.Reflectorsaredesigned tobethejudgesofhumanity,toreflectbacktheinjusticeshumanity

THE EXPERIMENT OF LIVING YOUR STRATEGY AND AUTHORITY
TheheartandsoulofTheHumanDesign Systemliesin thepotentialawakening thatisavailable to
you through theactuallivingofyouruniquedesign.StrategyandAuthority,whichwillbeexplained
in detail laterin this book,are the doorways to living as yourself,affirmingwho you reallyare,and
understandingand lettinggo ofwhatyou are not.
Inthepastwenavigatedlifewithourmindsastheultimatedecisionmaker.Ourmindsarenotequipped
to do this for us any longer. The mind's real genius is for collecting information and experiences,
measuring this against that,and contemplatingunique perceptions and reflections thatcan be shared
with others.It can onlydo this,however,when it is not makingdecisions for us.The mind is nowat
itsbestas apassenger- here towatch the movieand toviewthe cenesoflifeasaninvolvedobserver.
INTRODUCTION: THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM 11
Whatactuallymovesus throughlifeonouruniquepathis thesuperiorconsciousnessorintelligence
ofour body, the form we inhabit.The Human Design System is the revelation ofhow our form
works,andhowitbecomes theguidingsourceofourpersonalAuthority.Weareeachdesignedwith
a unique way to make decisions with our body consciousness,and every decision is critical as each
one moves us along life on a particular trajectory. Onewrong decision can set our life on a course
salsa
thatcanhaveseriousconsequences.Mentaldecision-makingis rarelymore thana guess,and
the mind is notatrustworthypersonalguidance system.To survive on this planet,we each need to
know how to access our ownAuthority.Itis the decisions that come from deep within that either
put us backon or keep us on the correct path for ourlife, empowering us to live life authentically
from our personal truth.
TheHumanDesignSystem'stoolsforawakeningarelike noothers.Onceyouarefamiliarwithyour
unique design and learn how to use your Strategy and Authority effectively,you can immediately
begin to experimentwith and discover for yourselfhow they transform your life. Byliving as you
aredesigned tolive,asyourself,yourmind starts to playamuchdifferentand more appropriate role
as an objective observerand resource,freeingyou to experiencewhatitis to be an awake and aware
passenger.Yourmind participatesinyourprocess ofself-discoverybutdoes notinterferewithyour
day-to-day decisions. Human Design gives you the tools and points the way, but it's up to you to
use them.
"IF YOU LIVE BY YOUR PERSONAL STRATEGY AND AUTHORITY THERE IS NOTHING
TO DO - THE DOING HAPPENS AND 'YOU' ARE NOT INTERFERING." - RA URU Hu
THE AUTHENTIC SELF
Throughout the bookwe will compare the authentic (or true self) to the not-selfWhen we talk
about the authentic selfor true selfwe mean our pure and natural behavioral nature designed to
emerge without resistance into the world. Another term used for this is our purpose, our reason
for being here - being the person we were born to be.The not-selfis conditioned programming
maskingourauthenticself.Aswebecomeawareofournot-selfthroughourStrategyandAuthority,
we slowly become aware ofour authentic selfalways present, but concealed just behind it. Self
hatred also has its source in the not-self;we simplyhate ourfailure to fulfill thelayers and layers of
expectations thatwe have taken on orplaced on ourselves.Whenwe know and accept- and live
from acomfortableplace ofauthenticity,wewill naturallycome to love ourselves.
As you journey further into your personal experiment to know yourself, you will witness every
possible variation ofyour not-selfconditioning and the resistance it creates.The more clearlyyou
see that, the moreclearlyyouwillseeyour true selfKnowingyourselfis thepath to lovingyourself
TheHumanDesign System showsyou how.
HumanDesignfocuses onthehealth,stabilityanddirectionofourlifecontainedwithinourbodies.
Once theform (body) is functioning optimally,the light ofour psyche (Personality) or soul shines
through all we think, say and do with an empowering clarity and gentle ease.This is authenticity,
livingas wewere designed to live.
12 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
THE DECONDITIONING PROCESS
Deconditioning,as it is called inThe Human Design System,is aprocess oflettinggo ofwhatwe
are not.Itis aslowprocess becauseitis adeep process.Whenwe re-claim ourAuthority,changing
how we make decisions and navigate through life, we actually change the way our cells function
within our body. Life moves in seven-year cycles, as it takes approximately seven years for all the
cellsinourbodytoberenewed.Themomentwebeginto alignwithourownnature,themomentwe
allowourbodytoliveitslifewithoutresistance,webeginthisdeepprocessofdeconditioning.Seven
yearslaterwe emerge closer to the personwewere born to be.Itis noteasyto startas an adult,but
aswe have heard overand over- itis EVERtoo late to begin.
AsfarbackasancientChina,thinkers and philosophers espoused the ideaofnot-doingas awayof
doing.There is apleasant ease that comes from living yourlife surrendered to your innerguidance
system. Being awake and aware ofyourself,living authentically and in harmonywith your design,
is so much more interesting than living asleep and lost in the expectations ofthe conditioning of
the homogenized world. Learning to make decisions from deep within yourself, so that you and
others can fully benefit from you being you rather than a carbon copy ofsomeone else, is worth
the effort,the time and the patience that ittakes to get there.To knowyourselfIS to love yourself
Deconditioningwillbe discussed throughout this book.
SIGNPOSTS OF RESISTANCE
Oncewebeginlivingourlife authenticallythrough ourType,StrategyandAuthority,we canbegin
to pay attention to whether we experience ease or resistance along the way. When we have acted
from decisions made byourthinking minds,rather than our Strategyand Authority,we experience
resistance.Continuallymakingdecisionsfrom ourmindmeanswearelivingalifethatisn'tours;and
theaccumulatedstressfrom suchactionsjeopardizesourphysical,mentalandemotionalwell-being.
The not-self themes ofAnger (Manifestor), Frustration (Generator), Bitterness (Projector), and
Disappointment (Reflector) are signposts ofresistance that alert us thatwe have veered offcourse
byfailingtofollowourStrategyandignoringourAuthority.Inotherwords,itisournot-selfactions
and decisions thatareresisted,notourauthenticselves! Iftakenpersonally,weexperienceresistance
as rejectionorsuppressionofourtrueselfbyothers.On the otherhand,whenwebecomeconscious
andawareofwhatresistanceis tellingus through thesesignposts,itaffordsusanopportunityto take
a step backand reassess our approach/action/words.When we becomeill or dis-eased or accident
prone,we know thatcontinued outsideresistance has manifested on the inside.As ourauthenticity
is lived out, our purpose in life is freed to accomplish its essential mission and brings us our full
true-selfmeasure ofsatisfaction,success,peace or surprise. (This topic is explored more thoroughly
in SectionFour.)
THE BOTTOM LINE - AWAKENING
Human Design is a new kind ofawakening. It is a process ofcoming to awareness that aligns
our mind and body with their appropriate roles. It requires making an ally ofthe mind through
understanding the mechanics ofour design while simultaneouslyliving ourlives according to our
INTRODUCTION: THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM 13
Strategy and Authority. Once we understand the nature ofthe true selfand the not-self, and are
makinglife decisions from our personalAuthority,we can release our attachment to the mind and
itscontroloverourlives,andfree itsincrediblegifts tobeofservicetoothers.Indoingso,webecome
awareandawakepassengers,andourmindsbecomeobjectiveobserversofourlife.Eachindividual's
singularpathto awakeningbeginswithagrowingawarenessofoursophisticatedbody'sheightened
intelligence,andadeep trustinthisintelligencetobeourcompassthroughlife.Wecannot,darenot,
release our mind's hold untilwe knowwe can trust ourselves implicitly. Byfully trusting our own
abilityto navigatelife,we becomemore accepting ofourselves,and able to genuinelylove ourselves
- and others.This,in Human Design,is the point ofpersonal transformation- seeing through the
illusion,and moving through lifeawake and aware.

THE FOUNDATIONS OF
A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE
HUMAN DESIGN FROM THE BEGINNING
Two incidents occurred in the first months of 1987 while Ra Uru Hu was living on Ibiza, a
tiny Mediterranean island offthe coast ofSpain.The first was his encounter with the Voice. In
"Encounter,"avideo recording ofhis reflections on the event,he talks candidlyabout the shocking
experiencewhichbeganlatein the dayofJanuary3,1987.}oreightstraightdaysand nightsaVoice,
as hecalledit,penetratedhim;itrevealed scientificinformationregarding the origins andworkings
ofthe universe and gave him the formula forThe Human Design System. He emerged from this
mystical experiencewith anewname,adifferentperspective onlife,and adeeper understandingof
themechanicsoftheuniverse.Severalyearsofformulatingandexperimentingwith theinformation
followed theencounter.From 1987to 2011,Ra dedicated his life to movingthis empoweringbody
ofknowledge,inpracticalways,outinto theworld.
The second incidentwas an extraordinary cosmic event thatwas seenwith the naked eye from a
mountaintop observatoryin Chile. It was a supernova- the death ofa star, and avast explosion
ofincredible intensity. With its dying breath, that star bombarded our planet with subatomic
information, and for 14 minutes everybody on Earth received three times as many neutrinos as
normal.The impact orimprintofthat eventon human consciousness continues to unfold within
and around us to this day.
The HumanDesign System,the ScienceofDifferentiation,is anewsystem ofself-knowledge that
differsfundamentallyfrom anythingelsethatexistsin theworld becauseitis theonlyone designed
to directly address the transformation of9-centered human beings.According to the Voice, 1781
marked a major evolutionary shift which forever impacted humanity's direction, momentum and
innate capacity for self-awareness. It was the shift from the mind-directed and other-directed
7-centered human being to our more sophisticated, inner-directed 9-centered transitional forms.
Allofus alive todayinhabit9-centered forms.
The Human Design System synthesizes aspects oftwo types ofscience:The ancient observational
systems ofAstrology, the Chinese I'Ching, the Hindu-Brahmin Chakras and The Tree of Life
from the ZohariKabbalist tradition; and the contemporary disciplines of Qyantum Mechanics,
Astronomy,GeneticsandBiochemistry.Asalogical,empiricalandpracticalsystem,HumanDesign

PART ONE
THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM
SYNTHESIZES ANCIENT AND MODERN SCIENCE
Astrophysicistshaveestablishedthatouruniversebegan13.7billionyearsagofollowinganastronomical
eventtheycalledtheBigBang.Themostextraordinarythingtoponderaboutthiseventis thatbefore
the Big Bang everything that had mass existed in one single particle thatwas smaller than an atom.
Somethingignited this speckand the resulting'explosion'caused the universe to begin to expand.As
itexpanded,and continuesto expandatanever-increasingrate,everythingthatexisted separatedinto
two groups creatingabasicduality: quarksandleptons,orayinfamilyandayangfamily.
As the illustration shows, the yin family i fundamentally material (has mass) and is made up of
six quarks. Qyarks are the smallest known building blocks of matter, and are usually found in
combinations.Scientistsgave them the names"up,down,strange,charm,beautyand truth."Two of
these six quarks, namely up and down, gather together into two groups (up, up, down; and down,
down,up) andformwhatarecalledtheprotonand the neutronoftheatom.Protonscarryapositive
electric chargewhile neutrons areelectricallyneutral elementaryparticles. On the othersideofthe
dualityis theyangfamily,whichisconsideredtobepureenergyorlight.Thisfamilyiscalledleptons
(leptosisaGreekword meaningthin orsmall).There aresixleptonsaswell: threedifferenttypes of
electronsand threedifferenttypesofneutrinos.Electronsare negativelychargedparticles.Whenan
electron,aproton,and aneutroncome together theyform the atom.
20 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
Scientists say ifwe add everything together thatwe knowis atomic,which is to sayhas mass- the
stars,allthegalaxiesandsuperclusters,andeverythingelseincludingus- wewilldiscovertheirsum
represents less than one-tenth ofthe whole universe.The rest, or the space in between everything,
is made up ofsuch things as darkmatterand darkenergy.Thatbrings us to theenigmaticneutrino.
THE NEUTRINO - THE FIRST PREDICTION FULFILLED
During Ra's experience helearned that neutrinoswere capable ofleavingan imprint,which meant
that neutrinos were particles carrying mass. This had not been proven by science yet. At first
scientists thought these subatomicparticles (neutrinos) streaming through spacewere pure energy
like the photon, but since they travel 1 to 2 percent slower than the speed oflight, they could not
be pure energy.This first prediction was scientificallyproven 11 years later. By1998,scientists had
proventhatthelargestoftheseunusualand barelydetectableparticlesbearan infinitesimalamount
ofmass: about one-millionth the weight of one proton. Having mass allows neutrinos to carry
information,yet theyare smallenough to pass through anyatomic barrierwithoutresistance.
These tiny cosmic messengers are referred to as the breath ofstars, the exhaled energy ofstellar
fusion, and there are more ofthem than anythingelse in the universe.Three trillion neutrinos,and
the material information theycarry,pass through everysquare inch ofour planet- and us - every
second. Our Sun,which is the closeststar to Earth,produces about 70 percent ofall the neutrinos
that travel through our solar system.The remaining 30 percent are emitted by other stars in our
MilkyWayGalaxy,and asmallpercentage arefrom the planetJupiter.
Neutrinos could be regarded as the modern equivalent ofwhat the ancients called chi or prana.
These extraordinaryparticles are penetratingus with bits ofinformation all the time,which means
welive and move through avast,continuous and inescapable informationfield.
CRYSTALS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Theincrediblydetailedscientificinformationreceivedfrom theVoiceaboutthenatureofthecosmos
placed the BigBang,acknowledged byphysicists as the accepted beginningofthe expansionofthe
knownuniverse,intoalargercontext.TheVoicedescribed theBigBangasmerelythe conceptionof
our universe, not its birth.TI1at means our entire universe is one singleliving entity,afetus notyet
born,stillexpandingand moving toward its momentofbirth.
In the beginning, said the Voice, there was a yin egg, a cosmic egg containing all ofthe (atomic)
materialoftheuniverse.Thisegg'sstructureisbestdescribedascrystalline.While notacrystalperse,
theterm helps usvisualizeit.Therewasalsoayangseedthatcontainedanothercrystal-likestructure.
When the yin egg and theyang seed came together at the Big Bang,there was ashattering and an
infinitenumberofcrystallineaspects spread throughout theexpandinguniverse,eachaspectbearing
a"consciousness"ofitsoriginalyin/yangorientation.Everythingthatwecanimagineandallforms of
lifeonthis planet- eveninanimate objects- areendowedwith these CrystalsofConsciousness.We
willexplaininPartTwo ofthis Sectionhowthe Crystalsgetimbedded into the body.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 21
In a human being, the Personality Crystal ofConsciousness, an aspect ofthe original yang seed,
sits above your head Gust above the scalp) in the Head Center at the top ofthe BodyGraph.This
PersonalityCrystal manifestswhatyou identifYwith as your Self,orwho you thinkyou are,and is
called the Passenger or passenger consciousness.The Design Crystal ofConsciousness, an aspect
of the original yin egg, is seated in the Ajna Center (between the eyebrows) and manifests the
biogenetics ofyour body, or the physicality of the form. It is referred to as the vehicle or form
consciousness. The relationship between these two crystals is likened to a backseat passenger
(Personality)who rides in avehicle (Design) operated and navigated byathird party- the driver.
THE MAGNETIC MONOPOLE - THE SECOND PREDICTION FULFILLED
The driver ofthe vehicle, the Magnetic Monopole, is the third key component described by the
Voice. On September 4,2009, the Voices'second prediction was substantiated when the scientific
communityannouncedthatithadobservedtheexistenceofmagneticmonopoles.Briefly,monopoles
are particles thatcarryasingle magnetic attraction,eitheranorth orasouth pole.Theyhad eluded
detection since the searchfor them beganin the early1920's.
According to the Voice, our Magnetic Monopole is located in the sternum area known as the G
Center,and has two differentfunctions. First,it holds us (and everything) togetherin the"illusion"
ofour separateness.As amonopole or amagnet that onlyattracts,it holds the PersonalityCrystal

( THE VEHICLE)
Returningto the analogyofvehicle,passengerand driver,imagine alimousinewithadriverbehind
the wheel who knows exactly how to operate the vehicle, where to go and how to get there.The
vehicle represents the Design Crystal and the driver is the Magnetic Monopole.The Personality
Crystal-orwhowe thinkweare- is neitherthevehiclenorthe driver.The PersonalityCrystalhas
no idea where to go or how to get there; it is simply the passenger. A passenger is meant to be
quietand relaxed,and towatch the cenerygo byinsteadoffightingwith the driverfor controlof
the steeringwheel.The Human Design System's tools for living make the passenger comfortable
in the backseat ofthe vehicle so it can sit backand enjoy the ride.
SECTION ONE: THE FOUNDATIONS OF A REVOLUTIONARY NEW PERSPECTIVE 23
THE TRANSITION FROM 7-CENTERED TO 9-CENTERED BEINGS
With the discoveryofthe planetUranus byHerschelin 1781,we moved into the'Uranian Era'when
human beings with highly evolved 9-centered forms began replacing the 7-centered, mind-oriented
Homo sapiens. By the late 1800's the process was complete, making all ofus alive today 9-centered
beings,or"Homo SapienInTransitus,"aterm coined byRaUrn Hu to distinguish 9-centered beings
(aninterregnumspecies) from Homosapiensand the new,more highlyevolvedforms corningin2027.
HOMO SAPIEN
IN TRANSITUS
9-CENTERED
This historicallysignificantmomentinourevolutionmarked the movementawayfrom ourneed to
focus on survival through the mental awareness or mental intelligence ofthe strategic mind. Our
newer9-centeredforms,freed from addressingthosebasicfears forsurvival,areonceagainattuning
to the flow ofthe natural order. Subtle yet marked genetic changes are still taking place within
our physiology, which support complex neurological advances within the Solar Plexus Center, in
preparationfor its emergence as the centerofspiritawareness in2027. (The SolarPlexus Centeris
discussedfully in SectionTwo.)
Forthepurposesofthisbook,understandingHomosapiens'lengthyevolutionaryjourney,compared
to our barely230 year presence on this planet as Homo sapiens in transitus,gives us aperspective
on the pervasive impact that living in these transitory times as an interregnum species has on us.
It affects howwe make decisions, relate to one another,breakawayfrom the controlling modes of
the past,and attain ourfull potentialas conscious,awake and aware beings.Briefly,anthropologists
speculate that5-centered Neanderthal hominids,who relied on instinctive splenic intelligence and
theirkeensenses to survive,were animisticand deeplyconnected to and influenced bythe forces of
24 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
or'gods'ofnature.Theylived as small family groups in harmonywith the solar/lunar cycles ofthe
naturalorder,and appear to have beenpeacefuland non-aggressive.
As the Cro-Magnon mutation took place over thousands ofyears, the stage was set for the
evolution of modern man, for 7-centered Homo sapiens, our precursors. Their progress was
greatly enhanced beginning 85,000 years ago when the larynx mutated,increasing space in the
cranium for neurological advances in the neocortex and visual cortexwhich further delineated
the characteristic raised foreheads and binocular vision common to our species. Existential,
instinctual (or instantaneous) Splenic awareness was soon overshadowed by mental awareness
or intelligence thatwas given expression through the voice.
This metamorphosis continued to distinguish humans from the rest of the mammalian
kingdom. Being able to make and systematize a variety ofrepeatable sounds led to language.
Communication led to cooperation, and the unique ability to share intelligence, which then
led to specialization, and organization into villages and fiefdoms. All ofthese evolving traits
ensured newlevels ofpersonal and group mastery as part ofHomo sapiens'thriving existence.
With Cro-Magnon man, the emphasis shifted from survival ofthe form and living attuned to
the natural flow, to focusing on and revering the powers ofthe strategic mind that dominated
the natural flow. This is how Homo sapiens made it to the top ofthe food chain. Shrewd and
inventive strategic thinking replaced fears for survivalwith strategies formulated to control the
environment, and eventually the people in it. As a species, Homo sapiens were conditioned to
look to forces beyond themselves for authority, such as gods,priests and kings, to guide, rescue
and support them, as well as tojustify their often aggressive conquests.
By1781,theremarkable,strategicmind hadsucceededin taking the7-centeredform toitszenith
ofhumanpotential.Enter9-centered Homo SapiensInTransitus.The 7-centered Homo sapiens
had ashorterlifeexpectancymarked bythe Saturniancycle.Ournew9-centered forms orbodies
have an 84-year life expectancy marked by the Uranian cycle. We need to live longer in order
to process and integrate increasing amounts of information, and to develop technologies that
will be needed in the future. Driven by the genetic imperative to reproduce, 7-centered beings
found communion through sexuality.The 9-centered being is here to find communion through
awareness.The ways we communicate, and the shape our relating/relationships will take in the
future, are an intrinsicpartofthe transition to living completelyas 9-centered beings.
By 1987, as the entire planet was flooded with the potential for heightened awareness, the
stage was already set, and the tension elevated between our body's consciousness and our
mind's domination. The moment was ripe for The Human Design System and its effective
and practical way ofaddressing this dilemma.The bottom line is that our now highly evolved
9-centered forms, our vehicles, are designed to guide us through life decision by decision. We
no longer need to look to an outer authority through our mind for direction. This is a huge
blow to the strategic mind in its determination to retain its former control ofour decision
making process. Through Type, Strategy and Authority, The Human Design System bridges
the evolutionary progression from the mental outer authority ofthe 7-centered being to the
revolutionary, aurically connected,personal authority ofthe 9-centered form.

26 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
"HUMAN DESIGN IS A MIRROR OF OUR AGE OF GLOBALIZATION AND SYNTHESIS.
THERE LURKS REAL DANGER IN CLINGING TO RELATIVE ABSOLUTES AS THIS IS THE
FORCE THAT CONTINUES TO CONDITION US AWAY FROM ACCEPTING OUR ONENESS.
HUMAN DESIGN IS NOT ABOUT SEEING OR ACCEPTING THAT THERE IS ONE SPECIFIC
WAY. THE WAY IS ALL WAYS. SYNTHESIS EMBRACES ALL OFTHE COLLECTED WISDOM
OFTHESE CULTURES AND THEIR SYSTEMS AND IT DOES NOT DISMISS OR LESSEN THE
VALUEOFTHE KNOWLEDGE ANDWISDOM DERIVED FROM THESE EARLIER SYSTEMS. IT
BRINGS THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO THEIR GLOBAL BODY, INTO THEIR PROPER PLACE
WHERE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE PROPERLY RECOGNIZED AND HONORED.
EACH CULTURE IN ITS EVOLUTION HAS EXPLORED AND DISCOVERED ASPECTS OF
THE TRUTH. THE SYNTHESIS OF THESE DIVERSE ASPECTS CREATES A COMPLETE
BODY OF KNOWLEDGE AND, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE LAW OF MATHEMATICS, THE
WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS." - RA URU Hu
ASTROLOGY - THE INNER RING OF THE MANDALA
The inner ring of the Mandala represents Astrology's contribution to the synthesis. This
360-degree circle, with its 12 signs ofthe Western Zodiac (Aries,Taurus, Gemini, etc.), is the
wayearly human beings represented the universe,and tracked the movement ofheavenly bodies
in the nightsky.TheHumanDesign Systemuses theMandalato calculate andrecord twoprecise
moments in time and spacewithin the synthesis.The first, based on the exact time ofyour birth,
is recorded as the Personalitydata.Thesecond,
which is 88 degrees ofsolar arc or 3 months
prior to your birth, is recorded as the Design
data.The use oftwo calculations distinguishes
The Human Design System from traditional
astrology. (The calculation ofdata is discussed
in more detailin PartThree ofthis section.)
We are surrounded by an enormous star field
which generates the neutrino stream that
is constantly penetrating and informing
the objects it passes through. A kind of
communication occurs during the encounter
when the neutrino's infinitesimal mass inter
acts with or rubs against the object on its way
through. For example, when the neutrino
stream goes through Mars it communicates
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
with Mars and an exchange takes place.After !iH R n HE
being filtered by Mars, the stream passes
through humans and there is another exchange. It's as ifa black car and a white car bang into
each other, and there is now a little black paint on the white car and a little white paint on the
blackcar.Eachcarisalteredbytheencounterjustaswearealtered bythis neutrinointeraction.In
thisway,eachplanetcontributesitsessence to thewayweareimprintedwith the neutrinostream.
Even thoughweallexistinthesameneutrinoprogram,the uniquewaywe manifestthatprogram

represent the 64 hexagrams ofthe I'Ching. Each ofthese Hexagrams, pictured around the outside of

In the 1950's,Biologists Watson and Crick cracked the genetic code, observing at the same time
that D A codons and the hexagrams ofthe I'Chingshareidenticalbinarystructures. Ourgenetic
code consists offour chemical bases arranged in groups ofthrees,which is similar in organization
28 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
to the lower and upper trigrams ofthe hexagrams ofthe I'Ching. Each ofthe chemical groupings
relates to an amino acid and forms what is known as a codon.There are 64 codons in our genetic
code,just as there are 64 hexagrams in the I'Ching. The 64 hexagrams around the outer wheel,
translated into theBodyGraphas Gates,canbeused inHumanDesign to thematicallyunderstand
orinterpretourgeneticimprint,and provideveryspecificdetailabout the characteristics that make
up each and everyone ofus.
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
HEXAGRAMS (GATES) AND DEGREES
Generally speaking, the inner ring of the Mandala is used for calculation, and the outer for
interpretation.Thisillustrationshowsthateveryhexagram,withitscorrespondinggate,hasaspecific
placeandmeasurementofarcintheouterring.Inordertodetermineitsplace,weneedtounderstand
again that the 64 hexagrams (each
with six lines) have a total of384
lines,whileeachofthe12housesof
thezodiacencompasses 30 degrees,
for atotal360 degrees.
When the 384 line demarcations,
visible around the outer ring, are
measured by or aligned with the
360 degrees of the inner ring, we
can see that each hexagram covers a
space/time of5 degrees, 37 minutes
and 30 seconds ofarc.This arc is an
imprinting field, a place in space;
when a planet passes through it,
information is exchanged via the
neutrinostream.
When we are born,we are imprinted with the qualities ofa specific hexagram for each specific
planet(orNodeoftheMoon) in thechart.Theinformationcarriedbythe neutrinostream at that
precise moment imprints us in this specificway for the rest ofour life.The moment is captured
and instantaneouslyrecorded in our BodyGraph as our definition,our blueprint.
In the illustration above we have an example of the calculation used. When we know the
position of the planet's location in the inner astrological ring, we can see its correspondence
to the hexagram in the outer ring. The example above has the Sun positioned in the zodiacal
constellation ofAquarius,which aligns itwith a corresponding division in the I'Ching wheel in
the 13thhexagram.Thisinformationis then transferred into the BodyGraph.Wewillexplore the
BodyGraph in more detaillaterin this section.

THE HINDU BRAHMAN CHAKRA SYSTEM
THE NINE CENTERS
The Hindu Brahman Chakra System is the third component ofthe synthesis, bringing us to the
nine Centers. One major difference between the traditional chakra system and the nine centers
ofthe BodyGraph illustrated below is simply that there are seven chakras and nine centers.This
difference reflects the cosmic shift that occurred in 1781 signaling an evolutionary progression
withinourspecies from 7-centeredbeingto 9-centered being.

Single gates are the way energyenters and exits acenter; theyare open to meeting the energyat
the other end ofthe pathway. It takes definition in both gates at opposite ends ofthe pathway
to complete or define a channel. As individuals we can have both gates defined ourselves, and
thus define the channel,orwe canhave onlyone gate defined and meetotherswho complete the
channel for us.

the energyofthe 2 gates, 12lines and 2 centers it brings together. Defined or colored-in channels

THE HUMAN DESIGN BODVGRAPH
THE MAP TO NAVIGATE By
"WHAT MAKES HUMAN DESIGN SO EXTRAORDINARY IS THE BODYGRAPH. THE
BODYGRAPH HAS NEVER EXISTED BEFORE. YES, OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAVE BEEN
GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS OF BODIES AND SYSTEMS, BUT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THE BODYGRAPH IN THE CENTER OFTHE MANDALA. THE BODYGRAPH
IS UNIQUE. FIRST OF ALL, IT IS BASED ON AN ENTIRELY NEW NUMERICAL
CONFIGURATION. THIS IS NOT A 7-CENTER CHAKRA SYSTEM. THIS IS A 9-CENTERED
BEING. THE WAY IN WHICH THE INFORMATION IS DRAWN TOGETHER HAS DERIVATIVES
IN OTHER SYSTEMS. THE BODYGRAPH IS THE REAL SYNTHETIC FIELD." - RA URU Hu
Conception marks the moment
when a Design Crystal, along
with its embedded Magnetic
Monopole, enters the ovum
through the process offertilization.
As the Design Crystal begins
receiving the streaming neutrino
information, it separates from the
Magnetic Monopole and initiates
the building ofthe fetus. The fetus
will continue to develop until the
end of the second trimester of
pregnancy when the neocortex,
the special brain faculty unique to
humans, is fully formed. At this
point, the Magnetic Monopole
sends out a signalwhich brings the
Personality Crystal, also called the
soul or psyche, into the body. The
moment of birth, which occurs
approximately three months later,
marks the moment the Personality
Crystal receives its indelible imprint from the neutrino stream.The Birth time is the moment the
babyhas left the womb and is separate from its mother's body, outside the mother's body, and not
the timewhen the umbilicalcord is cut.HumanDesign illustrates ouruniqueness in precise detail,
and itis veryimportant, therefore, to begin analysis with accurate birth data,especiallybirth time.
Ifyou are unsure about your birth time, please checkwith the organization that records births in
your country/state ofbirth.Ifyou have no wayofacquiring an accurate birth time you can hire an

ThejuxtapositionofyourPersonalityandDesignoneithersideofaBodyGraph,asintheillustration
above, can be revealing. The Personality is who you think you are; the Design is how you are
genetically programmed to move through time in space.These two completely different aspects
merge into the BodyGraph and are held together by the Magnetic Monopole as an integrated
field, amystical union.Itcan also be likened to a forced marriage because the two aren't naturally
compatible.The Personality thinks it's in charge ofthe life while, in fact, it's the Design and the
MagneticMonopole that actuallyare.Mostofthe conflicts thatarise,and the resistanceyou meet
in life, stem from the Personality trying to manage your life rather than assuming it's proper role
whichis to sitin the backseat and enjoythe ride.
The Personalityis not aware ofthe Design's existence,which is whyconsciouslyknowing how to
access yourform's intelligence throughyour Strategyand Authorityis so important,and a major
focus ofthis book.When the Per onalitypassengeris surrendered to its Strategyand Authority,
the Personality and Design can live in harmony, in union, as they individually perform their
intended roles.This is when you find your path, and when the foundation for alllove emerges
theloveofself.Withoutself-loveinside,there is no loveforothers.Withself-loveinside,youwill
knowwho is right for you on the outside.
34 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
DEFINITION IN A BODyGRAPH
As the activatedgatesfrom both the Designand Personalitycolumns are added (coloredin) on the
BodyGraph,channels are formed and centers are defined. Specifically,when the two gates at both
ends ofa channel are activated by aplanet, they form a defined channel and are colored in on the
Bodygraph.When achannel is defined, the centers at either end are defined or colored in as well.
This is calleddefinitioninachart.Definition createswhatis called ourlife-force.
For example, definition is created in this chart when Gates 11 and 56 define the Channel of
Curiosity (11-56), which in turn defines the Ajna and Throat Centers.Your total definition (the
colored-in channels and centers ofyour chart) shows you what is
consistent throughout your life, what is reliably you. Definition is
always there, every second ofevery minute ofevery hour ofevery
dayofeveryweekofeveryyearuntiltheendofyourlife.Itestablishes
the characteristics of your life force in precise detail. Definition
establishesyourType, Strategyand Authorityand showsyouwhere

Definition is the core ofour being, apotential thatwe growinto as

theselfweknowdeepinside,and theunique(lifeforce) frequencywe

this,andTheHumanDesign System encourages us to live it.
Definitiontellsourstory.TheScienceofDifferentiation'scomplexand
revolutionaryperspectives required the creation ofanewlanguage to
communicate that story. Ra called it "Keynoting." Keynotes form a
living,symboliclanguage,the language ofHuman Design.Theyare a
meansbywhichagreatdealofinformationisreferencedorcompressed
into a singleword or phrase.Almosteveryaspect ofthe system has its own keynote associated with
it. Like a mantra, keynotes invoke or awaken or connect us with our body's chemistry,and our own
unique frequency. Learning and using the language ofkeynotes is like thinking within the body's
hormonal messagingsystem;itallows us to connectenergeticallywith others.
Bystringingthe keynotes ofone's definition and open centers together,professionalanalysts create
awordpictureorstorylineofaperson'scharacterandpurpose.Oncethekeynotesaredelivered,the
story penetrates the person beyond the level ofthe mind. As an example,in the illustration above,
the Ajna Center is connected to theThroat Centervia Channel 11-56.This definition tells us that
this person will want to speakhis mind and saywhat he is thinking. Channel 11-56 is called the
Channel ofCuriosity,adesign ofasearcheror aseeker.The 11th gateis the Gate ofIdeas, and the
56thgate is the Gate ofStimulation.Itis his ideas that he wants to share.With this definition,he

Although he has alot ofideas,and often says he plans to do somethingwith them,he rarely does.
His ideas do not materialize. Knowing this about himself, but not understanding it, is a source of
deep frustration for him.There is, however, a reason why he has this dilemma; his definition stops
at theThroat Center,the center ofcommunication.IftheThroat Centerwere connected to one of

NATURE AND NURTURE - OUR SENDERS AND OUR RECEIVERS
"WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ACTIVATIONS IN A CHART, YOU ARE
LOOKING AT THE UNIQUE IMPRINT OF A PERSON. WE HAVE RECEPTORS TO
EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING THAT IS WHITE IN THE DESIGN IS A RECEPTOR.
THE IMPRINT IS WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT; IT ISN'T WHAT MAKES YOU THE
SAME. WHAT MAKES US THE SAME IS THE WHOLE MAP IN ITS ENTIRETY; WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT IS OUR INDIVIDUAL IMPRINT. THIS IS THE SCIENCE OF

WHAT IT IS TO BE UNIQUELY OURSELVES WITHIN THE TOTALITY." - RA URU Hu

Our definition is like a transmitter, a message or defining frequency that is sent out into the world

THE SUN, MOON, NODES AND PLANETS IN THE BODyGRAPH
You might call the Sun, Moon, odes and planets the local programming agents ofour solar
system.The locations ofthese celestial bodies at the time ofour birth determines the way they
influence or'flavor'how we experience our definition. Over the eons, each has taken on specific
mythological and thematic characteristics.
Without the BodyGraph, there is no possible analysis.The database within the BodyGraph is
made up of a total of26 activations, 13 each from the Design and the Personality positions.
According to the "Voice"no other objects in the heavens,other than the ones listed,can activate
gates.This is not to saythat an object,such asTitan,the greatMoonofSaturn thati largerthan
Mercury, does not have an effect.It filters the neutrino stream, and like everything else adds its
quality,butit does not activate agate.
Kiron (Chiron),the cometfragment thatwas discovered in the late 1970's,also does not activate
or 'open a gate.'Ifthe thematic presumptions are correct, however, and this object is associated
with healing/wounding, then seeing where it is in the BodyGraph can provide an insight.The
sameis truefor theastrologicalascendant,midheaven,Arabianpoints,etc.,whichdo not activate
gates either.

If Mercury- CommunicationandThinking.Mercury,the archetype oftheeldestson,represents
the expansion ofhuman consciousness, as well as the need within us to communicate.Mercury is
closest to the Sun and thus metaphorically has its ear. Mercury programs the Personality Crystal
from the time it enters the body until birth.Where your PersonalityMercuryis defined gives you
insight into what you need to communicate in this life.Your Design Mercury also has something
to communicate, but we often do not know why we are telling something to someone when it

Type,Strategy,Authority,Profile,Definition,Gates,Lines,andCenters;anditisrecommended that
aHuman DesignAnalyst be consulted.1hefollowing provides general informationwhen looking
atrelationships through HumanDesign:
ELECTRO-MAGNETIC: Partners each define one gate (one half) ofa channel, thereby defining the
entire channel and creatinglife force energytogether; represents the basic dynamic ofarelationship,
attraction and repulsion.
DOMINANCE: One partner defines the entire channel while the other does not activate (define)
eitherofthe channel'sgates.The defined channel can onlybe accepted and surrendered to as away
to experience the other.
COMPROMISE: One partner defines thewhole channel and the other defines onlya singlegate in
the channel.The partner thatonlyhas onegate ofthe channelactivated is always compromised by
the partnerwith the complete channel.
COMPANIONSHIP: Both partners have the same channel orgate defined in their Bodygraph.This
is the potentialfor friendship, the shared experience.
The synthesis of many systems reflected in your Human Design chart provides you with an
extraordinary new view ofyour life, and an understanding of the genetic continuity that flows
between the seemingly separate aspects of your design. The combined interplay between your
definition (the true self) and your openness (the not-self) form the foundation for understanding
the ways you will live outyour design. Awarene s ofbothwho you are designed to be, and where
you are open to takingin the outsideworld,allows you to have the fullest experience oflife,and to
authenticallyliveoutyourunique purpose as apartofagreater totality.

DEFINED AND UNDEFINED CENTERS
You will notice in the BodyGraph that some ofthe centers are colored in, or defined, and some
are not colored in, or undefined.The centers that are defined are fixed and reliable in the way in
which theyfunction and operate.Thecenters thatare undefined (white) are theplacesinwhichyou
experience outside influences or conditioning.The undefined centers are not broken, they are not
empty, and they do not need to be fixed.They are places where we are vulnerable to conditioning,
andareas tolearn andgatherwisdom.Eachofus are made up ofamixbetweenwhatisdefinedand
what is undefned.This is not a question ofit beinggood or bad.The defined parts ofus represent
the student living the life, and what is undefined represents where we are going to school - the
school oflife.The process ofbecomingyourselfis aprocess ofrecognizingwhere we are taking in
conditioning in life, how it affects us, and how to put it in its proper context.The opportunityfor
wisdomliesin this recognition.
UNDEFINED CENTER CONDITIONING AND
THE NOT-SELF MIND
When we transitioned from 7-centered to 9-centeredness in 1781, the strategic (decision-making)
roleofthe mind shifted from directingourlives to becomingasourceofwisdomandouter authority
forothers.Themindstillinsistsondoingwhatithasdoneforthou andsofyears- itdoesnotgraspthe
factthatitsjobdescriptionhaschanged,whichcreatestensionbetweenourformandourmind,aswell
as between the true self and
the not-self Our incredible
mindsarenotcapableofbeing
the personalAuthority ofour
new9-centeredform.
The Personality Crystal (or
passenger consciousness) is
invited into the fetus during
the last three months of
pregnancy after our body is
fully formed. The passenger
gets acquainted with the
neocortex of its new vehicle,
but has nothing directly to do
with creating any part ofthe
form orbody.Withoutsomethingspecificto do,thepassengerdecides to takeonthejobofback-seat
driver,withoutalicense.FromitsloftypositionintheHeadCenter,itthinksitisbestequippedtorun

There are two significantdetails,however, that the passengermind isn'taware ofThe first is thatyou

itszenithinthe7-centeredbeing,havingguidedhumanityto anunprecedentedlevelofconsciousness
and scientificachievement.However,after 1781,ourforms tookan evolutionaryleap,and ourbodies
nowhave ninefunctioningcenterswithabuilt-inconnectiontoatrustworthy,individualizedcompass.
Weeachhaveourown GPS,and itis hard-wired to theuniverse.Ourmindcanno longercompete
successfullyindecision-makingwith this new9-centeredform orbodythatitisjoined to,butdoes
not understand. Undeterred by these facts, the mind continues doingwhat it has always done - it
triestodirectyourlife.Thisdoesnotmakeourmindanenemytobeovercome,repressed,orignored,
butrather acreative force that is here to be reckoned with and befriended. Our mind's designated
role, for which it is perfectly suited, is to think and to dream, to inspire and to formulate, and to
make sense out oflife.The mind is an amazinggiftwhenfreed from decision-making,and used in
service to humanity.The mindis meant to be a toolfor us,and apotential teacherfor others.What
stopsthatfrom happeningisourignoranceaboutthe mechanicsofhowwearedesigned to operate.
Bymakingour mind an ally,and liberatingitfrom the taskofdecision-makingso that itcan settle
comfortablyinto its role as a self-reflected conscious observer,we allowour mind to reveal its true
treasures and makeits rightful contribution.
Frombirth,we arecontinuouslyin the auricfields ofourmother,father, siblings,relatives and others.
Ourundefinedoropenchannels,gates,and centers areconstantlybeingdefinedorenergeticallyfilled
in bythe definition ofothers. Over time,we are subtlybutdeeplyinfluenced bytheir energyfields
as well as by their growing expectations ofus.This is whatThe Human Design System describes as
conditioning.Althoughweneverlosetouchwithwhowereallyare,bythetimewehavereachedseven
yearsofage,severallayersoffamilial and societalconditioninghavebeenpiledoverourtrueselves.
Conditioning cannot be circumvented or escaped, nor is it inherently a bad thing. It is simply
unavoidable. Planetary transits, people, and all life forms, including insects, birds, animals and
plants, connect to us and can influence our thought patterns, our behavior and our decisions,
especiallyifwe are not grounded in our design through our Strategy and Authority.Throughout
our life, the natural curiosity ofour open centers attracts us to people with definition in those
centers. Absorbing their frequencies, however, puts pressure on our openness and triggers our
mind into thinking about allwe are missing.
The open spaces in our chart are referred to as the source ofour not-selfsimply because they are
energeticallyinconsistentandunreliable.Itiswhenwebegintoconfusewhatweexperiencethrough
our openness (that which is not us) with our defined self or true self (that which is consistent
within us) that we run into problems.The Human Design System carefully scrutinizes where we
areopen to the impactofconditioningand distinguishesitfrom ourdefinition.Itshows us that,by
following our StrategyandAuthority,weare thoroughlyand uniquelyequipped toface and resolve
the dilemmas arisingfrom our not-selfconstructs.
Ourundefinedcenters areopento stimulation,and areliterallydesigned to drawusintolife.When
we use our mind to make decisions, however, our open centers become part ofwhat is called our
not-selfmind. Since that which is reliable and consistent about us is not really interesting to our
busy mind,what is open or undefined becomes a source ofdeep attraction.Itis what we long for,
whatwefeel drawn to experience,andwhatwe thinkwe have to have orwant to be.Unfortunately,
48 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
theseductionofthis attractioncanlead us awayfrom ourcorenature,whichiswhywedo notoften
live outourown unique potential.Theproblem is thatwhenwe tryto bewhatwe are notdesigned
to be,everythinggets distorted; we becomelost,caught up in chasing afterwhat constantlyeludes
us inourlife.Basingdecisionsonever-changingandillusivedesires- onwhatis notconsistentlyus
- islike trying to build ahouse onshiftingsand.Eventually,afalse assumption begins to growthat
this IS our life.The result is a sense offatigue and failure, along with frustration, bitterness, anger,
and disappointmentwithlife.
In the earlyyears ofyour life,your passenger-mind thought its decisions were protectingyou and
your vehicle from being overcome, or hurt, by the experiences coming through your open and
vulnerable places.Your mind got caughtup inyour body's innate fears for its physical, mental and
emotionalwell-being;its needfor security,loveandsupport.Thosefearswereamplified manytimes
in your open centers, so your mind developed a hyper-vigilance to your environment.It used how
others responded or reacted to you to keep you compromising your true self, always comparing
yourselfto other's expectations and needs ofyou. Itdrove you to conform in order to fit in,and to
make life comfortable for you and for those around you. And it worked - for awhile.There were
evenrewarding trade-offs,butin the endyou paid aprice.
Eachdecisionwe makeinlifeeitherkeeps us on ourpathortakes us onaconfusingandsometimes
painfuldetour; eithermoves us closer to orfurther awayfrom ourtrue nature and purpose. Correct
decisionsmadefrom ourpersonalAuthority,from thatwhichisdefinedinus thatwecantrust,align
uswithourdestiny,andplaceusinrelationships,locationsandjobsthatarecorrectforus.Decisions
madebyourmind,andbasedonconditioningfrom ourundefinedcenters,causeus toveerfrom our
course.When this happens wefind ourselves confronted bysituationswe are not equipped to deal
with,makingcommitments thatdrain ourenergyand inhibitthe use ofourtrue talents.
Societyplaces a huge emphasis on the mind,or mental awareness, and on making things happen.
The conditioning pressure on us isn't going to go away anytime soon. Since we usually have more
undefinedspacesthandefinitioninourchart,thevastcomplexityandamplificationofouropenness
by the not-selfmind easily exerts inordinate power over our lives. It is extremely difficult for our
definition to stand up to the pressure coming through such openness, especiallywhen halfofour
definitionlies belowourlevelofconsciousness.Fortunately,our Strategyand Authoritysimplyby
pass the illusorynetofthe mind's persuasions and allow the driver to drive.This is called surrender,
the state ofawarenesswe seek.

THE NOT-SELF KEYNOTED IN A BODYGRAPH
Precise analysisofourBodyGraphallows us toliterallymaphowwehavebeenconditioned to think
throughout ourlife,providingus with amazingdetails and insights into theworkings ofour mind.
What we discover is avery strong and powerful link between our mind, early painful experiences
and our undefined centers.The chart example to
the left has been keynoted to illustratewhere this
person has been most vulnerable to conditioning
throughoutherlife.Beginningwiththeundefined
Splenic Center, which is about security, she has
beenconditioned toholdontothingssuchasjobs,
relationships, places and attitudes in order to feel
safe. The undefined Spleen is concerned about
survival; its easily aroused fears can cause one
to stay in jobs and relationships long after they
haveceased beinghealthy.Through theundefined
Heart Center, she is conditioned to prove her
worth - that she is good enough, sexy enough,
loyal enough, pretty enough, smart enough and
so on. She is prone to making promises that she
does not have the willpower to keep, but tries
(and fails) to keep them to prove how valuable
she is, ultimately resulting in low self-worth.The
undefinedHeadCenterisamind thatis occupied
with thinking thoughts that don't matter. Her mind is busily engaged in trying to resolve people's
unanswered questions.With an undefined Root Center she feels pressure to hurry through things,
and toget things done so shecanmove on to the nextand getrid ofthepressure.
The keynotes ofher undefined centers create apicture ofwhat her mind has been focused on,and
basingher decisions on, most ofherlife.When we synthesize all this information into a sentence,
wehaveapersonafraidoflosingherrelationshiporjobsecuritysosheworksveryhard togetthings
done quickly, trying to resolve everyone's questions in orderto provehowvaluable she is.
Ifit is your path to move toward transformation and awareness, you will slowly but surely stop
giving authority to your mind and surrender to the Authorityofyour form. You will let go ofthe
mind's idea ofwhat you should and shouldn't do, and what you thinkyour life is supposed to be
like.Though surrender is not a natural state for the mind, the mind can learn to surrender to your
StrategyandAuthorityand assumeits trueposition as anaware passengerand observer,having the
ride ofitslifein avehicle that knows exactlywhere to take it.

THE WORLD
BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION
Biologically, the Throat Center is associated with the thyroid and the parathyroid glands. These
are endocrine glands which are respon ible for metamorphosis/transformation.The thyroid system
oversees metabolicprocesses: howwe assimilate ourfood,whetherwe digest itquicklyor not,how
we burn energy,whetherwe are fast or slow,whetherwe are big or small,skinnyorfat. Resistance
experienced from premature, unwelcome words and actions, or from speaking when we should
be silent, can manifest in our physiologyby compromising the health and well-being ofourvocal
chords and thyroid function.
MANIFESTATION AS COMMUNICATION AND/OR ACTION
Keyphysiologicalchangesinthelocationandstructureofthelarynx,withaconcurrentdevelopment

TheThroat Center'sprimaryjUnction is manifestation through communication, expressing who we

designed to be,however,is totallydependentonuncoveringourauthentic self- andliving it.
TheThroat Center's strategic position in the BodyGraph, and its metamorphic function in the
body, make it a natural place for directing and effecting transformative, mutative change at all
levels ofliving. The specific frequencies or gates activated in the Throat Center on our chart

THE DEFINED THROAT CENTER - 72% OF THE POPULATION
Although we assume when we speak that we are expressing the thoughts ofour mind, what we
communicateis actuallydetermined bythe 11 themes ofthegatesin theThroatCenter.TheThroat
is the energyhub for 'messages'comingfrom allparts ofthe BodyGraph; it transmutes and directs
howthatinformationmanifests in theworld as communication and action.
SECTION Two: THE NINEeENTE_RS---=,'---T_H_E_F_L_O_W_O_F_E_N_E_R_G_Y 5=5
Potentially,theThroat can express or act directlyfrom six different centers: the Ajna, SolarPlexus,
Heart,G,Sacraland Spleen.The healthyThroatCenterspeaksfrom itsreliable sourceofdefinition.
For example, aThroat connected to the Heart Center speaks from the 'I'as in "I want that, I have
that, I will do that."IftheThroat is connected to the Ajna, one speaks what the mind is thinking
and conceptualizing.IftheThroatis connectedto the SolarPlexus,one speaks oracts onemotions

Those with a Throat Center defined to a motor can always 'do' or manifest, but it does not
mean they always should! Having aThroat Center connected to a motor can fuel the urge to be
impulsive,to succumb to the tendencyto talktoo much ordo too much,and to give energyaway
to everyimpulse.When thayconfidentlyandcomfortablyrelyontheirStrategyandAuthority,and
knowwhere their voice comes from and when to use it, people with defined Throat Centers can
manifest their truthwithease,honestyand clarity.
THE UNDEFINED THROAT CENTER - 28% OF THE POPULATION
The not-selftheme ofthe undefined Throat Center is "Trying to attract attention."People with
undefined Throat Centers are afraid they won't be noticed, so their not-self mind jumps at the
chance to think up ways to attract attention.They can easily succumb to an amplified pressure to
talk, to act,to make an impression,to interruptor to be the life ofthe party.Theydon'trealize that
the openThroatnaturallyattracts attention,and iftheywait,invitations to speakwillcome to them.
Inthisway,theywillreceivetheproperattention,atthemostopportunetime,withnoneed towaste

Ifthe amplified pressure to speak that they experience in their undefinedThroat Center has been
conditioned by someone else's1hroatdefinition,what they saywill be unpredictable and probably
poorly received by others. Over time, they can become fearful ofopening their mouths. Feeling
out ofcontrol and unable to communicate effectively can be most disturbing in our highlyverbal
culture.1hisisremediedbythosewithopenThroatCentersgainingconfidenceintheirStrategyand

IfnotcomfortablyorientedbytheirStrategyand Authority,theycan becomepreoccupiedwith the
questions,"HowcanI attract attention?"or"Whatam I going to become in life?"Trying to figure
these out mentally onlyleads to poorly timed decisions and abortive actions, putting pressure on
their thyroid glands.
THE COMPLETELY OPEN THROAT CENTER
A completely openThroat is most rare as the Throat Center has 11 potential activations. People
with this openconfigurationhave no ideawhat to say,orwhataction to take.Forexample,children
with an undefined Throat Center may take longer to learn to talk, and should be encouraged to
speak at their own pace.When the not-selfin either children or adults dictates how and when
to attract attention, talk and act, they will find themselves speaking with a voice 'borrowed'or
conditioned by someone else.The result is saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, or being
ignored altogether.The resistance theymeetbuilds over time,affectingboth their self-confidence
and their thyroid function.
Once theyarecomfortablewith theflexibilityand unpredictabilityoftheirspeaking,and confident
in their Authority's guidance, the considerable wisdom potential ofthis center emerges. Among
otherthings, theywill knowwho articulateswell and who is speakingwith authenticityfrom their
ownJourney.
NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED THROAT CENTER
The not-selfmindis the spokespersonfor the undefined centers,and tells uswhatwe should sayor
do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples ofwhat the not-self
mental dialog could sound like with an undefinedThroat Center:Where should I go so that I can
get the attentionIwant? Is anyone noticing me?If! saythis then Iwillbe noticed.If! initiate this
conversation then I will get the attention I deserve. I better say something because this silence is
makingmeuncomfortable.WhatshouldI manifest?Ibettermanifestsomething.Whatorwhowill

HEAD CENTER
MENTAL PRESSURE
INSPIRATION
QUESTIONS, DOUBTS

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION
Biologically, the Head Center is associated with our pineal gland which regulates the flow of

AjnaCenters.Morethan90percentofmentalprocessestakeplacedeepwithin thegrayareasofthe

answers, or the need to know the'whys'oflife.It fuels or drives our thinking and conceptualizing,
and howweprocess the consciousnessfield.
MENTAL PRESSURE AND INSPIRATION
As above - so below. At the top ofthe BodyGraph is the Head Center with its mental pressure,
understoodasinspiration.AtthebottomistheRootCenterwithitsadrenalizedpressure,understood
as stress.TheHead Centerfunctions as the pressure to comprehend,to think,and to make senseof
things in theworld.It's pressure moves our thoughts toward conceptualizationin theAjna Center
by pushing our questions toward formulas and opinions, our pondering toward clarification and
insight,and our confusion toward realization and ideas - and then on to theThroat Centerwhere
theyare transformed into language. Human Design refers to this pressure as inspiration, the ways
we have oftakingininformationfrom the cosmicfield ofconsciousness.
The inspiration ofthe Head Center is not a motorized energy that leads to action, but rather a
pressure thatdrives ourmentalactivity.Itstimulatesourimagination,ourunique modeofthinking
(Head) and conceptualizing (Ajna), and initiates our everyday, mundane thoughts as well as our
mostloftyandprobingquestionsabout the mysteriesofexistence.~itesimply,this is the pressure
to askquestions,and expectanswers, thatwe experience throughoutourday.

Each decision that liberates our mind from running our life, releases and refocuses the mind's
tremendous creativityso itcan make its essential contribution to the understanding, the evolution,

confusion,drivingusfurther awayfrom ourselves.Ifthepressurebuildswithoutrelease,itcanresult
in severe headaches like migraines. Another consequence ofletting our not-selfdistract the Head

THE DEFINED HEAD CENTER - 30% OF THE POPULATION
Definition between the Head and Ajna Centers creates aconsistent mental pressure to askand to
answer the question,and to grasp and to understand things,includingconsciousness itselfDealing
with the persistent pressure ofinspiration is often difficult and can heighten mental anxiety, as
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENE_R_G_Y -----=5=-9
inspiration is always about what has not yet been grasped - it merely frames the question.Those
with defined Head Centers have a fixed wayofthinking.The themes oftheir particular gates and
channels become the subject or source ofinspiration available to others. When they are part of
a group, their auras put people with undefined Head Centers under pressure to think. Only 30
percent ofthe world's population has adefined Head Center,but they are capable ofinspiring (or
pressuring) the remaining 70percentwho do not.

to accept the mental pressurewithout trying to act on it or escape it. Confusion,doubt, and clarity
are natural processes that have their own inner timing and resolution. Under the guidance ofone's
Authority, theybecome qualities which stimulate thought-provoking questions,and awide arrayof
answers capableofuplifting,inspiringand empoweringothers.
THE UNDEFINED HEAD CENTER - 70% OF THE POPULATION
Those with an undefined Head Centerhave no consistentwayofdeliberating mentalinformation.
Ifnormal inspiration becomes an amplified pressure to think about things that don't matter, they
can get lost in their own mental monologue. Meaningless not-self thoughts and questions will
ultimately steer them away from correct decision-making processes. As anxiety increases, they
may seek to assuage it by looking for someone or something inspiring to focus on. Undefined
Head Centers tend to eitheravoid intellectualpursuits,orthrow themselves into one mysteryafter
another.They are easily caught up with trying to make decisions and solve problems that are not
even their own, becoming lost or overwhelmed by doubt and confusionwhich actuallybelongs to
someone else. Pressure to resolve other people's questions as soon as possible weighs them down,
makingitdifficult to emptyall the'stuff'outoftheirheads so theycanrelax,whichputsevenmore
pressureon theirminds to tryandfigure things out,to answer theirunendingquestions. Since they
can'tsolvetheirproblemswiththesamenot-selfmind thatcreatedthem,thekeyto emergingoutof
this swirlofconfusion and doubt is to bypass the mentallybusyundefined Head Centerbyrelying
on their Authority to guide them.The secret to maintaining mental health is to refuse to act out
ofmental pressure byremaining adetached observeroftheir thoughts, and letting theirAuthority
direct them to appropriateways ofusing theirminds.

compulsive need to resolve it because they know it will pass. Ultimately, they can be open to the
beauty and depth ofthe unknown, and enjoy both the question and the confusion while trusting
that thingswillbecome clear,or not;whicheveris correctfor them.
THE COMPLETELY OPEN HEAD CENTER
ThosewithoutgateactivationsintheHeadCenterhavenoinnatewayofrecognizingwhenonething
is more inspiring or interesting than any other.There is no consistent means ofconnecting mental
pressure to the rest oftheir design, or to naturally ease them into a familiar way ofthinking about
things or entering into dialogue with another person.They don't knowwhat to focus on,especially
inthis overwhelmingageofinformation.Theysimplydon'tknowwhat to thinkabout,whatmatters
or doesn't matter, or why, and often fear thinking about anything at all. Such anxiety can lead to
disconnectingfrom their intellect and avoiding conversations that are intellectuallystimulating. Or,
theycan become easilydistracted bythe pressure to thinkup answers,orgive away theirAuthority
byrelying on others to tell them what is interesting,inspiring orimportant. In order to enjoy their
healthyand boundless capacityforwisdom,and to understand thepressurebehind the questionand
discern what is inspiring, completelyopen Head Centers need to allow the often amplified mental
pressure they experience to pass through without identifYing with any part ofit. As they become
comfortable with themselves over time, they become sensitive to the nuances ofthe Head Center
and its true gifts,and cangauge who uses their minds effectively,and who does not.Theymayeven
be sensitive enoughto ascertainwhatothers are thinking.In thisway,deep explorations into all that

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED HEAD CENTER
The not-selfmind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say

the not-self mental monolog could sound like with an undefined Head Center: I need to find
somethinginspiring.Maybe ifI go there I'llfind somethinginspiring.I need to find an answer to
my questions.Where can I go to find the answers? Who has the answers? I've got to understand
this and/or make ense ofthis.Where canI go orwhom can I talk to in order to find the answers?

STRESS
BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION
Biologically, the Root Center is associated with the adrenal system and the production ofstress
hormones. Stress, as understood in the context ofthis center, is merely a fuel. It energizes certain
biochemicalprocesses deepwithin us thatare designed to help us master the situationswe meetin
life,and sustain our momentum to progress and evolve. Stress cannot be avoided, nor canwe fight
against this vital fuel without paying the consequences.Ifwe do not understand the mechanics of
this pressure on ourbody,we can easilypushourselves too hard.Ifwe turn this pressure inward,we
canbecome depressedand sufferdeeply.Oneby-productofmaintainingahealthybalancebetween
too much and toolittle stress is asense ofvitalitythat spills overasjoyforliving.
ADRENAL PRESSURE (FUEL) AND MOTOR ENERGY
Both the Head and Root Centers are sources ofpressure, or fuel, which drive energy towards the
Throat for communication or manifestation. This similarity gives these two centers a deep and
inherent connection to each other.While the Head Centerbrings mental pressure in the form of
doubt, confusion, and inspiration, the Root Centerbrings the pressure and fuel to evolve,to adapt
to theworld,and to getus through ourmostdifficultchallenges.Itprovides uswithourpurestand
mostpowerfulenergyand momentum to keep life movingforward.
Unlike the Head Center,however, the Root Center is unique in that it is both a pressure center
and amotor.Nine differentlife processes arefueled byenergythatoriginatesin the Root Center.

orstress ontoothers in the form ofunreasonable expectations.
Once they are comfortable with their own consistent internal pressure, they can be alert to times
when people with an undefined Root Center are allowing unhealthy levels of magnified Root
pressure to drive them.Aslongas theybegin somethingoutoftheir StrategyandAuthority,and a

64 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
Undefined Roots take in and amplifY the adrenalized Root Center stress in the world, but are not
equipped tosustainthatlevelofmomentumforlong.Overtime,thiskindofconditioningcanbecome
hyperactivity,uncontrollablerestlessnessandaninabilitytofocus.Childrenoftenpaythebiggestprice.
When the amplification ofenergy from others through their open Root Center is misunderstood
as misbehavior or uncooperativeness or mental deficiency, they are usually punished, humiliated, or
referred to therapists.ThinkaboutallthechildrenwithopenRootCenterswhohavebeengivendrugs
to calm them down. Understanding the overall mechanics ofa child's design makes it possible to
explorenewways ofworkingwith theseenergydynamics,withoutdamagingourchildren.
Mostpeople operatewithoutawareness and allowoutsidepressures to drive them.Whenadults or

Whenoperatingcorrectly,undefined RootCenterswaitfortheirAuthoritytoguidetheirdecisions.
They do not judge themselves to be lazy or incompetent if they fail to work quickly, or simply
refuse to.Theycan distinguish between healthyand unhealthyenvironmentalpressure and are not
addicted to either - they simply recognize them for what they are.They know when to use the
pressure correctly to increase their productivity, and when not to. They give themselves the time
needed to actuallyenjoycompletingataskonce it has been properlycommitted to.
The wisdom to be gained from the undefined Root Center comes when they no longer identify
with or are lost to the habits oftheir conditioning. At that point they are able to observe how
stress functions, and to discern how to use it properly. They know when it is healthy to take
advantage ofthe adrenalized pressure andwhen to avoid it.Thekeyis to recognizewhatpressure
belongs to them andwhat does not.

NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED ROOT CENTER
The not-selfmind is the spokespersonfor the undefined centers,and tells us whatwe should sayor

mylife better?Where is mypurpose? I have to achieve something in mylife.I betterhurryup and
get this done. I have to start something new now. How can I get past this limitation? What am I

BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION
Three biologicalfunctions are associatedwith theAjnaCenter: the neocortex,thevisualcortexand
thepituitaryglands.The tinyanteriorandposteriorpituitaryglands,locatedatthebaseofthebrain,
act as our body's maintenance headquarters.They send hormonal messages to the thyroid glands
withinstructions that keep us alive,on trackand functioning optimally.These masterglands ofthe
endocrine system are intimatelyconnected to all parts ofour body, and it is not surprising thatfor
eons we have lived a mind-dominated life.Although the pituitaries still oversee our entire system,
the body's overalllevelofconscious awareness has evolved,and the role ofthe mind has shifted.
MENTAL AWARENESS, THE MIND AND DECISION MAKING
OftheninecentersinourBodyGraph,threeareAwarenessCenters:theSpleen(BodyConsciousness),
withitsbodyandsurvivalintelligence,theAjna(Mind Consciousness),withitsmentalintelligence,
and the Solar Plexus (Spirit Consciousness), with its emotional intelligence and emerging spirit
awareness. It is through these awareness centers that we become conscious ofour experience of
being alive, and in relationship with others.The other six centers are purely mechanical,operating
belowourconsciouslevelofawareness.
The Head and Ajna Centers function together as the mind.The Ajna Center is a processing hub
for transforming pressure, that arrives as inspiration from the Head Center,into useful information
for review,research,and communication.The Ajna is merelyan interpreter; like the Head,it cannot
manifest.TheAjna,flanked bythe motor-less Head andThroatCenters,is the onlyawarenesscenter
intheBodyGraphlockedawayfromenergy.Theothertwoawarenesscentersdohaveaccesstomotors;
theycan act out oftheir awareness.The Splenic Center is next to the Sacral and Root Centers,and
the Solar Plexus, a motor itself, is next to the Root, Sacral, and Heart Centers. Mental awareness,
which was the second awareness to evolve (Splenic awareness was the first), dominates the waywe

perceive ourworldtoday.Ourperceptionsarederivedfrom two majorprocesses:oneisvisualand one
is acoustic.The visual, associated with development ofthe visual cortex, is concerned with what has
beenandwhatmightbe.Theacousticisassociatedwithpureinspirationandthepressuretoknownow.
The awareness frequency ofthe Ajna Center is different from that ofthe Splenic Center. Splenic
awareness is existential,spontaneous,in the moment.Thefrequency ofourmentalprocess operates
overalltime.A decisionmadementallyhasalongshelflifeandcanbemulledoveruntildeath!This

theseoptionsarecorrectforyou,and noneofthemwillwork,ever.Youhavesimplybecometrapped
in aweb ofineffectual suggestions and dead ends. Recognizing that the mind has no authorityin
yourlifeis the onlywayto extricateyourselffrom confusionand disappointment,andfrom making
incorrectmentaldecisions.
The mind measures or processes information in a dualistic'this or that'manner- avaluable asset
for simultaneouslyweighing two or more sides ofany concept.The Ajna can look at the positives
and the negatives ofa decision,and construct two arguments that are opposite to each other. One
argumentsaysthe optionisbad'because,'whiletheothersaysit'sgood'because.'Thisisall themind
can do, however; it argues back and forth. It can neitherjudge nor knowwhich is best. It simply
determines howmanysides ofanyissuethere are to consider.
Imaginethatyouhavehadamisunderstandingwithsomeoneandyouwanttostraightenitout.You
want to talkto the person aboutitand getitoffyourchest.You canuseyourmind's analyticalgifts
to come upwithlists on bothsidesofthe argument,butdon'tcallthepersonyet! Letyour Strategy
and Authorityguide you as to when you are to speak and what you are to say, otherwise,you will
replay that conversation over and over again."Did I do the right thing?What ifI had done it this
way or said it that way?" Pain and regret, rather than resolution, are the consequences ofpoorly
timed reactions, simplybecause the dualistic mind cannotletgo ofthe other side ofanyissue.We
cannot know our own truth from this place ofmental rationalization and comparison. Our truth
mustcomefrom ourpersonalAuthority.
Awareness is the end result of successfully dealing with fear, and each awareness center has its
own forms offear to confront. The fear experienced by the Ajna Center is expressed as mental
anxiety fed by the fear ofnot knowing something, or the fear ofbeing misunderstood. Both fears
arehealthywhentheydriveus tobetterunderstandourideasandcommunicatethemclearly.When
communication fails, however,the anxietycomes to the surface.Howwe dealwith the anxietywill
either lead to our mastery and awareness,or to a further heightening ofthe anxiety.Whether our

Open Head and Ajna centers can have an open and flexible mind. This is a sign ofthe mental

a person's mind is set free from conditioning, it is open to a full range ofintellectual stimulation
and creativity. Innate and learned wisdom about the intricate workings ofthe mind can come to

Imagine a child with an undefined Ajna Center being taught by someone with a defined Ajna
Center. A parent, for example, putting pressure on a child to think logically when the child is
designed to think abstractly.The child feels pressure to think in one particular way, and when he
or she cannot do this consistently, begins to feel inadequate. Such children will grow up feeling
something is wrong with them, and through conditioning will compensate by pretending to be
certain about things inorder to feel accepted and acceptable.

that theycannever reallybe certain aboutanything,theirmind becomes aplayground.Itreverts to

AWARENESS AS FEAR FOR OUR SURVIVAL
This amazing center, with its primal fears for our survival and well-being, is also a source ofour
light-heartedness and laughter, our spontaneityand daring. Its existential awareness,its awareness
72 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
in the nowmoment,keeps us movingsafelyforward,while deep insideit steadilycleanses built-up
toxins and the adverse effects ofnegative vibrations/memories from our system. (In review: ofthe
nine centers in the BodyGraph, only three are described as awareness centers - the Splenic,Ajna
and SolarPlexus.Awarenessiswhatallowsus to beconsciousofourexperienceoflife.Theothersix
centersfunction on apurelymechanicalbasis.)
Awareness has evolved over millions ofyears, and each ofthe three awareness centers represents
a different phase in that evolutionaryprocess.The Splenic Center is the oldest. Its survival-driven
primary awareness connects us with all life forms - plants, reptiles, birds, insects, and our closest
relatives,mammals(seedesignsbelow).Astheoldestawarenesscenter,andthecentermostcommon
to all life, its essential function has always been to keep the form alive - literally keeping it from
becomingsomeone's or something'slunch.
The workofthis centeris instantaneous,instinctual alertness for anything that threatens ourwell
being, including negative emotional vibrations. Fear is its mode ofoperating as fear for survival
generates alertness.Overtime, these primalfears evolvedinto aform ofintelligence,atype ofbody
awareness or body consciousness focused on what is needed to survive, adapt, and thrive in the
mundaneworld.This intelligence remains alertand onguardwithin us to this day.
Ofthe threeawarenesscenters,theAjna(unique to human beings) is twiceasstrongas the Splenic,
and theSolarPlexus (notyetfullyevolvedasanawarenesscenter) is twiceasstrongas theAjna.The
fact that the Splenic Center,with its responsibility for life-and-death, is the weakest ofthe three
indicates howfragile life is.The not-selfvoices ofboth the Ajna and the SolarPlexus Centers can
easilyoverride the quietlittle alerts comingfrom our Splenicawareness.

THE DEFINED SPLENIC CENTER - 55% OF THE POPULATION
The Splenic Center is responsible for our surviving and thriving with a sense ofwell-being in the
world.It manages our instinct, intuition and taste which are processes for discerningwhat is or isn't
healthyfor oursurvival.Its non-verbal recognition operates in the presentmoment,in the'now.'This
vital,spontaneous information is whatwe call intuition,gut instinct or ahunch; it allows us to make
74
trustworthy spontaneousjudgments/decisions.Moment-to-moment awareness, however, means that
theSpleenneverrepeatsitsfirstalarm.Ifwedonotpaycloseattentiontothoselittlealertsimmediately,
wewillmiss theirwarningwhichisalwaysrooted inwhatis neededforsurvivalrightnow.
Thosewith adefined Spleen Centeras theirAuthoritymustlisten to theirintuition,do whatit tells
them to do, and notlet their not-selfor anyone else's mind distract them from following their own
instincts,which are trustworthy and produce reliable results.They then remain alert and protected,
feel good, and can enjoy the benefits ofa strong immune system.They can project a state ofwell
being that is envied by those with undefined Splenic Centers who do not consistently feel good.

The mind is not an authority, even though its loud, reasoned thinking can easily overwhelm the
Spleen's subtle messagingsystem.When apersonreceives asuddenwarning,there is no time and
no way to figure outwhy the Splenic Center sent the message. Existential awareness cannot be
rationalized; it must simplybe trusted.Understanding thefuller perspective ofan experience can
only happen by looking back after the fact. And what is not correct for a person one moment,
may be correct 30 minutes or a daylater. For the Spleen, the present momentis all that matters,
all itis aware of.
Mteryears oflettingthe mind override the intuitiveknowingand awareness ofthe SplenicCenter,
people can end up completely out oftouch with their instincts, put their life at risk, and suffer
unnecessary ill-health and unhappiness. They 'think' they dare not follow their body's intuitive
intelligence,yetitcan be disastrous for them not to.
UNDEFINED SPLENIC CENTER - 45% OF THE POPULATION
Seven primal fears reside in the Splenic Center, and when the center is undefined, these fears are
easilymagnified.Thosewith undefined Spleensneed toface eachoftheirfears,onebyone,inorderto
becomefearless in ahealthyway.Thisis howtheydevelop awareness,and honorand learnfrom their
fear rather than suppress itor pretend it's not there. Confrontingand handling the fear makes them
stronger and less frightened each time the fear returns.The result is asense ofwell-being.Iftheyare
unable to do this,however,the conditionednot-selfmaybecomeoverwhelmedbythefears.
Those who are born with an undefined Splenic Center enter the world with a fundamental fear
that they are not equipped to survive here on Earth.They are also open and sensitive to the lack
ofwell-being in the world and interpret this personally.When people in their environment with
defined Spleens conditionthem,theyfeel betterand safer.Theygrowup unconsciouslyseekingand
clingingto peoplewithdefined Spleensfor the securityand senseofwell-beingitseems to provide

them to clingto thesecurityofthe parentevenmore,eventuallycreatinganunhealthydependency.
Because ofthis earlyconditioning,the not-selfminds ofthese childrenwill convince them to hold
on towhatis notgood for them as theymature.
At the adultlevel,thosewith an undefined Spleenwho are in a relationship with adefined Spleen
that is no longer healthyfor them,will say things like: "Itwill be better tomorrow"or"Maybe the
therapy will work"or "What about the children?"This is the dilemma for many battered women
whogobacktoabusivespouses.Thedeepfears ofsurvival,theattractiontobewithadefinedSpleen,
can blind them towho is good for them andwho isn't,orto when to hold on to arelationship and
when to letgo.
When anundefined Spleenis temporarilydefined byadefined Spleen orpassing transitconnection,
it can experience a deceptive sense ofsecurity.The mantra for someone with an undefined Splenic
Center is 'never make a spontaneous decision.'Being spontaneous, except in potentially harmful or
threateningsituations,poses ariskto the undefined Spleenbecauseitcannottrust theever-changing

the life ofthe person pressuringthem.Itis not theirlife,however,and itmaynot be safe for them.
Ifthey follow their Strategy and the guidance oftheir Authority, they avoid the temptation to be
impulsive.Impulsive decisions made in the momentfrom aconditioned undefined Splenic Center
may cause them to let go ofbeneficial things as well. "Oh, I don't need that (or them) anymore."

People with a healthy orientation to their undefined Spleen can discern the difference between
what is their own need to attend to, in terms ofsome aspect oftheir health, and what is a lack
ofwell-being coming from the environment.When they are with unhealthy or deeply unhappy
peopleandfind themselves feeling ill,theyunderstand thattheyare probablyabsorbing the other
person's ill health or unhealthy vibrations. They can sense when someone or something is not
good for them.They can be tuned into their instinctual and intuitive awareness,yet know this is
not the authority for their decisions. They pay close attention to their health and nurture their
body'sresilience.Theyunderstand howimportantitis toface theirfears,and howto dealwith the
fear ofsurvival.Theydevelop thewisdom to knowhowintuitionworks,who has itandwho does
not. Ultimately they can become highly intuitive themselves.Their undefined Spleen is never a
reliable resource for making decisions, however, because it is veryvulnerable to the conditioning
in their environment. By entering into new relationships through their Strategy and Authority,
theyget the correct Splenic conditioningin theirlives.
76 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
Thewisdom thatcomes over time through the undefined Splenic Centerallows manyprofessional
healers to bring great benefit to their patients. When they step into their client's aura, there is a
spontaneous recognition, a sense ofwhether the person is healthyor ill, and what might be out of
balance. Such intuitive empathy emerges as the undefined Spleen learns to distinguish between
whatitisfilteringthroughfromothers,andwhatenergiesarcitsown.Intuitiveawarenessorwisdom
about someone else is available to the undefined Spleen onlywhen it does not identifYwith what
the otherpersonis experiencing.
COMPLETELY OPEN SPLENIC CENTER
There is a healthy and natural level offear in all ofus.When children or adults with a completely
open Splenic Centerlose contactwith the fears thatkeep them alive and healthy, theycan become
insecure and fearful ofeverything.They do not know what to be afraid of, and can also become
fearless to the pointthat theydo foolish, riskyand unhealthy things.

The Solar Plexus Center is associated with the lungs, kidneys, pancreas, prostate gland, and the
nervous system. Its themes are feelings, emotions and sensitivity,and its function is to allow us to
gainasenseofemotionalclarityandwell-being.Whenaperson'semotionsrununconstrainedover

The Solar Plexus provides the potent energy driving the cyclic nature ofhuman experience; its
desire frequency is continually moving us toward encounters with pleasure and its opposite, pain.
It is the center ofrevolution, poetry, romance, compassion, spirituality and religion. We seek to
prolong its highs to stayconnected to spirit, and we do everything in our power to avoid its lows,
our unfilled expectations and sense ofseparation.With halfofhumanity acting impulsively from
these emotional ups and downs, and the other halfavoiding dealingwith emotions altogether,we
find ourselveslivingin anemotionallydistortedworld.
These distortions permeate every aspect oflife on this planet. 0 other center in our time has a

single entity.Suchconsciousnessresultswhen theemotionalwavesbetween two orlTlOre beings arc
in resonance. As a highly differentiated, interregnum species,we cannot even imagine how it will
feel to share such consciousness so deeplywith others.This developing awareness lies beneath the
surface ofourpresentemotionalsystem.
As 9-centered beings we are just beginning to explore, and to discover experientially, the breadth
and depth and comprehensive implications ofthis Solar Plexus mutation that we are all apart of
Whatwe do knowis thatwhenwebypass the mind's conditioning,andlive ourdifferentiation and

THE FREQUENCIES OF THE EMOTIONAL WAVE
Thedefined SolarPlexus Centerreleasesawavepatternthattakes usfrom oneendoftheemotional
spectrum to the other. It is a chemistry that we experience as feelings, needs and desires. Each
cyclical wave goes from hope to pain, expectation to disappointment, joy to despair - and back
again. To create emotional stability in our lives and throughout the world, we must understand,
accept,and eventuallytranscend this wave pattern,none ofwhich is achieved bymind control.The
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY _ 79
keyto transcending theemotionalsystem,and the potentialwaves itsendsinto theenvironment,is
'waiting.'Aswewaitthrough theups and downs,ourunderstandingisdeepened,thewavebegins to
levelout,and clarityeventuallyarrives.Understanding this continualwave movement,andwaiting
for clarity,canstoponewho isemotionallydefinedfrom sendingoutreactive,premature,chaoticor
harmfulemotions into the environment.
THE SOURCE OF ALL WAVE MECHANICS (Channel59-6) operates outofthe 6thGate as this is
where the emotionalwaveis created,and then reaches across to meet the fertile sacralpowerofthe
59th Gate.Itis here that need,passion and desire are created in order to breakdown barriers,and
penetrate and bond us togetherin the dance ofintimacy.This emotionalwave feels verystable and
takes anotherperson to bringitto the surface.
The three emotionalwaves are categorized by theirfrequency. A person may experience a singular
frequency, oracombination,dependingon the definition.
THE TRIBAL WAVE (Channels 19-49 and 37-40) operates through physical touch and sensitivity
to needs.This wave ratchets up until it explodes and then resets itselfto start the process all over
again. Let's take an example ofa man whosewife is doingsomethingthat bothers him. He doesn't
tell her how he feels about it so it continues for weeks. Each time she does it, his emotionalwave
ratchets up a notch until one dayit explodes.The wife had no warning,didn't see it coming and is
taken by surprise.The emotional outburst could be hard on her, but once he releases his built-up
emotions,he is back to normal; all is fine. When both partners understand the mechanics ofthis
Tribalwave - how to anticipate the explosion,how to sort out the real issues, and how differently
the outburstaffectseachofthem- theywillreach newlevels ofcomfortand understandingin their
relationship.Forinstance,agradualbuild-upofemotionaltension,mixedwithadesireforintimacy,
can be quietlyand effectivelyreleased bya sensitively-placed hand on the shoulder at the end ofa
long,hard day. 0 words are necessaryfor theTribe;its allin the touch.
THE INDIVIDUAL WAVE (Channels 39-55 and 22-12) operates through the expression of
moodiness, emotions, melancholy or passion (but onlywhen in the mood). It moves along on an
even keel most ofthe time,with smaller, shorter, up and down spikes. Knowing when to be alone
andwhen to be socialmakes all the difference,and thosewith thiswave mightfeel melancholicfor
ashorttime until theyare moved to anewplacealong theirwave and theirmood shifts.Emotional
tension in theirrelationships,when theyare down in theirwave,is eased byknowingwhen to take
time to be alonewith theircreative muse.
THE ABSTRACT WAVE (Channels 36-35 and 41-30) operates through desire and feeling, and
movesfrom peakstovalleys.Basedonexpectation,thiswavecrasheswhen the desireorexpectation
is not met.The trick to transcending this wave is to enter into somethingjust for the experience,
without placing any expectations on the outcome. For example, awoman imagines herselfin love
afterafewdates. Shefantasizes abouthowgreat the manis and howwonderful theirfuturewillbe,
onlyto discover he does not live up to her expectations or share her feelings. Repeated spikes and

Whatis mostimportantto understand about the emotionalwaveis thatitis simplyan inescapable
chemical process that keeps the wave constantly in motion. 0 explanations accompany its shifts
and swings. Unfortunately,without this awareness, those who are emotionally defined attempt to
rationalize their emotions, and to explain or make up a reason why they are up or down on their
wave. When they feel sad, their friends want to know why and what they can do to make them
happy.Itcanbecomemoreimportantto them to putthe blame somewhere,rather than to embrace
and accept the depth and beautyofthe chemistryitself Blamingsomething or someone for what
is pure emotional chemistrycan be asource ofgreat confusionwhen all they need to knowis that,
as thewave moves to another place theywill feel different.There is no need for areason for where
theyare nowon thewave,orwhere theywillbe tomorrow.Theyare simplyalways movingwithit.
Generally speaking, whether we are emotionally defined, or undefined and taking in the
conditioningwaves ofothers,we have to becarefulnot to identifYwith thewaveorits movement
as ifitwere us. Remain the objective observer;we are not the wave butwe are being taken to our
depths byit.Boththehighsandlowsofthewavecanbebeautifulwhenwedon'tleteitherofthem

and gifts oftheirwave.
AWARENESS AND NERVOUSNESS
The fears that accompany the Solar Plexus Center's present state of emerging awareness, are
experienced as nervousness based on emotional uncertainty. One never knows for certain how
to feel about something or someone,orwhat feeling to base adecision on.Because ofthe social!
relationalnatureofthe SolarPlexus,withitsbroadmovementfrom hopetopain,this nervousness
canbepowerfulandpervasive.Aspeopleare movedforward alongthewave,nervousnessiseither
amplified or disappears; is there or not there. Emotionaluncertaintycan distort the waywe view
things, making mountains outofmolehills.
The vague or haunting nervousness that arises from living with uncertainty is a form offear that
needs to be confronted in order to be overcome. When those with a defined Solar Plexus Center
go through their wave, accessing the depth oftheir truth and waiting for clarity, they are able to
eitherconfirm ordispel the uncertainties and suspicions underlying their nervousness.Byproperly
identifYing and effectively confronting their uncertainty, they can move beyond their emotional
fears (nervousness),andtranscends themovertime.Inthisway,fearsbecomeemotionalintelligence.
Each awareness center engenders a particular form offear. In the Solar Plexus, fear manifests
as nervousness about engaging others, as the constantly moving biochemical wave leaves it
emotionally uncertain. Each gate description on the opposite page reveals how fear as nervous
uncertaintyis experienced.

Forthosewithadefined SolarPlexusCenter,thisis theirplaceofpersonalAuthority,anditoperates

before making decisions. It is not easy for them to be patient.The Solar Plexus is an immature
emotional center driven by a motor, and it houses a lot ofenergy. Their task is to learn how to

emotionally impulsive rather than emotionally clear. Clarity is only available after waiting out the
emotionalwave.At aminimum, those with adefined Solar Plexus Center need to sleep on things
before makingan importantdecision.
When the Solar Plexus is defined, the feelings these people have about 'this' or 'that'become an
authoritative guide.These feelings are indicators ofwhat is correct for them or not. "Does it feel
good to do that? How do you feel about it?"These are important questions they need to be asked.
Itis essentialfor them to take time to fully experience theirrange offeelings withoutbeingrushed.
Emotional clarityis reachedwhen there is no longeran emotionalcharge attached to the decision.
Making decisions from stillwaters is easier said than done.When people are excited they tend to
jump,onlyto regretitaftertheyreachemotionalclarity.Patientlywaitingfor claritywillprotectthe
defined SolarPlexus Centerfrom makingspontaneous decisions that mayresult inpoorchoices.
As people move through theirwave, it helps to understand that the emotional cycle is a dynamic,
chemical process, and that hope and pain are not end points ofawareness. Awareness comes as
clarityat the end ofthe emotionalwave's cycle. Knowing what is correct takes time, and there are
no short cuts.In addition,emotionalclarityis notacertainty.The Splenic Centergives an absolute
answerinthemoment,whiletheconstantlymovingSolarPlexuswavesamplesthepresentmoment
as one ofmany points along theway. In the end, there is no guarantee that 100percent emotional
clarityis possiblebecausethewavekeeps moving.Therewillcomeatime,however,whenemotional
calmness is reached and adeeper truth is recognized about the decision to be made.
SolarPlexus energyisjuicy,seductive,and powerful,whichgives those with emotionalAuthorityan

Thereis acomplexinteractionbetween thosewho areemotionallydefined and thosewho areopen.
Thosewith definition are responsible for the emotionalenvironment as awhole because theycolor
it with their waves.They impact others merely by how they feel inside, by the pure mechanics of
theirchemistryand howitis transmitted through theiraura.When thosewithdefinitionfeelgood

with emotionaldefinition,being so familiarwith it,don't always notice their emotionality,whereas
thosewho are undefined are conditioned to think that theyare the moody,emotionalones instead.

Waiting through their wave allows emotionally healthy people to be in touch with how they are
feeling as they move along their wave. Without being impulsive or spontaneous, they take their
time and ride out their emotions until they feel a sense ofclarity before making a decision.They
understand how their emotions affect others and do not place pressure on them by being pushy.

THE UNDEFINED SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER - 47% OF THE POPULATION
The undefined SolarPlexus Center absorbs and amplifies the emotions presentin its environment.
This center carries an especially deep conditioning potential, and can be particularly vulnerable
to the needs, moods, and feelings ofother people. It is critical for the health and well-being of
the emotionally undefined to know when the emotions they are feeling and expressing are not
84
entirelytheirs,and thattheycanrelease them and protectthemselves bynotidentifYingwith them.
Otherwise, they bounce up and down on the emotionalwaves ofothers, knowing their emotions
are out ofcontrol but interpreting that as something wrong within themselves. They repeatedly
makeemotionaldecisionswhichleave them regretfulandplaguedbyshameorblame,aburdenthe
undefined SolarPlexusis notgeneticallydesigned to handle.
Open centers are like open windows. The Solar Plexus is designed to take in and sample the
emotionalfield,butonlyfor informationalpurposes.Itis nothealthytoidentifYwithorpersonalize
thatfield, oritbecomes theirs,and theydo nothave areliable built-inwayto dealwithit.Theylose
their transparency,theirability to merelyreflectanemotion backto its owner.
ThosewithanundefinedSolarPlexusmayfeel as thoughtheyhavebeenemotionallyoutofcontrol
all their lives. When emotionally confronted, they may experience sensations that include fear,
terror,shock,andanger.Theymaybouncefrom happinesstodepression,personalizingemotionsand
feelings as iftheywere theirownwhen,infact, theyare simplytakingin,amplifYing,and distorting
the emotions ofthose around them.They may suffer from being punished and rejected by others
who perceive them as emotionally unstable.They often feel something is wrong with them.They
are generallyso sensitive to the emotionalclimate that theyhave personalized emotionallycharged
events over theyears,hangingon to and taking the blameforwhatdoes notbelongto them.
Childrenwhoareopenemotionallytakeinandpersonalizetheirfamily's emotionalups and downs,
amplifYing and often 'acting out' their confusion. Thinking that they are personally responsible
for making the waves, they decide at an early age that it is better to lie about or hide the truth
ofthemselves deep inside rather than suffer a parent's emotional outburst.When the situation is
reversed,and the parentis open emotionallyand the child defined, the parentcanlose control and
become over-reactive while amplifYing the emotions ofthe child. Understanding these dynamics
can help us raise healthy,stable,independentchildren- and enjoyparenting.
Confrontation makes emotionallyundefined people nervous.As theymature,theydevelop not-self
strategies to avoidemotionalbacklashbysteeringclearofconfrontingothersforfear ofrocking the
boat or upsetting someone.They develop apersona that says,"Iwon't upsetyou ifyou won't upset
me."Theyattempt to sidestep anypotentialconfrontation that mightfollow iftheydare to express
their own truth or needs.Though those with open Solar Plexus Centers will never enjoy dealing
withemotionalconfrontation,theirStrategyandAuthoritywillguidethemtoconfrontationswhich
are correctfor them toface.
Itis oftenjust the thought ofconfrontation that keeps those with an open Solar Plexus frozen in
terror.The actual confrontation may be much easier than imagined when they stand in their own
Authority,and the results mayend up being the best thing thatcould happen because itis correct.
Ifconfrontations are always avoided, life is lived on a superficial level. It helps to remember that
on the other side ofpain is pleasure, and on the other side offear is the freedom to be ourselves.
Confrontationwhen handled correctly,when we simply speakour own truth rather than blaming
someoneelse,is acatalystfor healthytransformation.

Access to the full spectrum of this center's great pleasures, such as sexual energy, food, passion,
excitement,romanceandmusic,isavailabletothosewithdefinedorundefinedSolarPlexus Centers.
For emotions to be a beautiful experience for the undefined center, however, they cannot identifY
with them.Awareness ofthe emotionalwave allows them to letgo ofpatterns and emotions that
never belonged to them, which in itselfcan bring tremendous relief When they understand why
emotions have been so difficult, theycan begin to properlyrealign theirlives to theirown personal
Authority. They are able to discern who is or is not emotionally healthy for them, and when it
is appropriate to confront others with their truth or needs, or to walk away. They discern which
emotional fears are theirs to deal with and which are not, and do not make emotional decisions.
They realize the emotions they take in and feel in an amplified state are from others, and do not
attach to them.
A healthyundefined SolarPlexus Centeris abarometeroftheemotionalhealthofothers;itcan be
agood objective observerofthe emotionalclimate.Itswisdom takes theform ofdiscerningwho is
making progress toward emotionalhealth,stabilityand spiritawareness. On its own,it can remain
emotionallycool,andallows thosewithundefined SolarPlexus'torelyontheirStrategy.Whenthey
suddenlyfeel uncomfortable emotionally,theyknowtheycanleave the room,and the conditioning
auras ofothers, until the coolness returns. It is agood practice for them to enjoy some time alone
everydayin orderto release the emotionalconditioningtheyhave taken in.
COMPLETELY OPEN SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER
Although manycharacteristics ofthe undefined SolarPlexus Centeralso apply, the completelyopen
Solar Plexus differs in that it does not have anyway offiltering or connecting to incoming potent,
emotionalenergy.Thosewith acompletelyopen centercanbe confusedbywhattheyarefeeling,and
don'tknowhowto interpretit.Theydon'tknowwhatto desire,when to be sensitiveorpassionate,or
how to recognize and deal with people's needs or moods.They often feel something is wrong with
them emotionally.The potential wisdom is to know and understand the emotional waves in their
pureststatewithoutanythingcoloringorprejudicingthem.
NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED SOLAR PLEXUS CENTER
The not-selfmind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers, and tells us what we should say
or do. Noticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples ofwhat the not
selfmental monolog could sound like with an undefined Solar Plexus Center: I don't want to go
there because I don'twant to dealwith the confrontation. Let's go here because there won't be any
confrontationto dealwith.Let's notsaythatbecauseitmightupsetthatperson.Let'ssayitlikethis

been builtwithout theTribe's supportive, hierarchical structures held in place by the four gates of
the HeartCenter.
These gates determine the different ways members ofthe Tribe connect to one another in order
to successfully live out what is called the material way. These gates are about making our daily
bread, bonding and living in harmonywith others, bringing children into the world, and creating
infrastructures likesocieties,cultures and religions, to nurture and supportwhatwe create.
SECTION Two: THE NINE CENTERS, THE FLOW OF ENERGY 87
At the present time the Tribe is undergoing stressful, structural change that challenges its
entrepreneurial and communal foundation; changes which call into question the authority and
stabilityofourmostfundamental traditions and institutions.Thefear engenderedbythese changes
magnifies the pressure on those with open Heart Centers to prove theirworth in order to survive
the uncertainty.Issues ofself-esteem and self-worth surface and affect everylevel ofourlife,from
relationships, to ourwork,towhatwe believe,to giving ourselves permission to playand enjoythis
incrediblelifewe have beengiven.
Thebottomlineis thatselfesteemis aplacefrom whichwe move into theworldwithconfidence
as a valued and contributing member ofsociety - and receive material and personal support in
return.Withoutthis firm beliefand trustinourselves and ourownvalue,welose ourwill to meet
the challenges oflife. Unless the ego is affirmed in its healthy state, and reassured ofits value
by our selfor others, it shuts down and self-esteem becomes self-loathing. Self-hatred exacts a
terrible price from humanity.
In this context,it becomes clearwhyso manyheart and digestive problems are related to the ways
in which the not-selfcompensates for poor self-esteem.The tendency toward over-achievement,
making promises or bargains thatwe don't have the will powerto keep, and laboring beyondwhat
ourheart muscleis able to supportinorderto prove ourworth,are all symptoms oftrying to prove
ourworthiness.Understanding the mind's role in determining howwe ultimatelyvalue our self,or
not,can eliminate agreatdealofunnecessarypain and sufferingin ourlife.

88 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
It is healthy for those with a defined Heart Center to exercise their willpower, to make and keep
promises with regularity.With consistent access to their willpower, they have no problem making
and keepingtheirpromises orresolutions.Itis importantthat theydowhat theysaytheyaregoing
to do.Sincethisishowothersdevelopaleveloftrustin them,theyshouldonlymakepromisesthey
can andwillkeep.In thisway,theystrengthen their naturalsenseofself-esteem.
They enjoyworking, though they prefer to be in a position where they can be their own boss.
In this way they can follow their natural internal mechanism which tells them when to work
and when it is time to rest.They enjoy successfully delivering the goods, and beingwillful and
competitive comes naturally to them. When they listen carefully to their inner guidance, they
will know when their great ego strength can best be brought to bear on a situation, and still
maintain a balance betweenwork and rest.
Those with a defined Heart Center should not allow anyone to deny them an honest and clear
expressionoftheirego andwill power.Theirassertive'I,me,mine'statements strengthen the heart,
whereas suppressing their natural ego energy can be detrimental to their health.They are proving
themselvesallofthetime,whichisbothimportantandcorrectforthem,andtheywilldoitnaturally

for thefamily and the communitywhen itis rightfor them to do so.Even though theyenjoytheir

With adefined Heart Center,itis easyto get carried away and come across as too forceful.When
notguidedbytheirStrategyandpersonalAuthority,theycanplaceunrealisticexpectationsonthose
with an undefined Heart Center to be competitive and willful as well.They can attempt to pump
others up, or push them to perform beyond their capacity,which eventually leads to unnecessary
pain and misunderstanding.Eventually,these behaviorswill meetwith resistance,indicatingthat it
is time to stepbackand regain ahealthyinnerbalance ofpower.
THE UNDEFINED HEART CENTER - 63% OF THE POPULATION
People with undefined Heart Centers are not designed to be willful and competitive, yet they
often feel driven by a need to find the courage to exercise their will. "Why can't I getwhat they
have?"they ask. "Whycan't I be as fast or as good as they are? I should be able to competewith
them." While they want to exercise willpower, and to make and keep promises, they do not
understand that theyhave no consistentenergyto support either one.
We live in a world that sends a constant stream ofmessages that we should/could/can be better,
prettier, richer, faster, and more successful if only we would do this or that. This propaganda
puts tremendous pressure on us to make more, do more and be more. People with an undefined
Heart Centerget trapped in avicious cycle. Iftheyfail to live up to expectations,or to fulfill their
commitmentsandpromises,theymakefurtherpromisestomakeupfortheirsenseof elf-deficiency,
onlyto fail again. Each time theyfail, theyfeelworse and theirself-esteem spirals down further.

will attempt to accomplish more than anybody else in order to prove howvaluable they are.They
'will'themselves into impossible situations,trying to do somethingtheycan'tpossiblycomplete.
An undefined Heart Centeris susceptible to amplification byadefined Heart Center'swill power,
and can deceive itself into thinking it suddenly has the will to make and keep a commitment.
This'borrowed'willpower evaporates,however,as soon as the personwith Heart Centerdefinition
leaves.Thisisfrequently thecaseduringmotivationalworkshops,whereonesupposedlyleaveswith
enough direction and enthusiasm to follow through and accomplish the goal, only to watch the
goodintentions and thewillpowerfade awaywhen on one's own again.
The challenge for those with an undefined Heart Center is that they generally do not consider
themselves worthy and will accept less ofeverything,including love, money and happiness, because
they assume they do not deserve it. Ifthey rely on their minds, rather than Strategy and Authority,
theywill be provingthemselvesforever.Themore the mindgetsinto thegameoftryingtoprovevalue

Themantrafor anundefinedHeartCenteris: nevermakeapromise toyourselforothers.Theopen

THE COMPLETELY OPEN HEART CENTER
People with completely open Heart Centers do not naturally have a good, solid grasp ofwhat
worthiness is, how to measure it, or what one needs to do to achieve it. When not living within
their realmofpersonalAuthority,theyare prone towaveringbetweenfeeling an exaggerated sense

SACRAL CENTER
POWER OF FERTILITY
VITAL ENERGY,
RESPONDABILITY,
AVAILABILITY,
SEXUALITY
BIOLOGICAL CORRELATION
The Sacral Center corresponds to the ovaries in awoman and the testes in a man. All life on the
planet is fostered by the life-force energy generated in this center. It empowers our survival by
replicating life and by providing the impulse to nurture and care for our young. Sexuality, work,
fertility,vitality,movement,andpersistence are its major themes.
As the body's prime motor, the Sacral has enormous power that works in both agenerative and a
degenerativeway.Ifwedo notunderstandhowtoproperlyengageandsupportthemechanicsofthe
Sacral,itwillatrophyanddegenerateprematurely,leavingonefrustrated andunhealthy.Thismotor's
built-in work/rest cycle requires that it exhausts its supply ofavailable energy each day in order
to sleep well.While it rests, it recharges its batterie .Ifit is forced to do what it hasn't responded
to, its generative capacity quickly becomes degenerative and burnout results. The Sacral Center's
generatingcapacitypeaks around age 18in men,and between ages 33-34in women.
WORK, REPRODUCTION, SEXUALITY AND PERSEVERANCE
Anyone with a defined Sacral Center is a Generator byType.The Sacral generates the creative
life force, and has the power to guide and sustain life. Its receptive frequency is designed to
respond to what it meets in a protective, healthy, honest, creative and persevering manner.
This center distinguishes itselffrom the other centers in three significant ways: its complexity
(second only to the Throat Center); its capacity to generate the life force; and its ability to
communicate its moment-to-moment availability through its own responsive guttural sounds.
Those sacralsounds emerge outofa trustworthyinnerguidance system thatexistedlongbefore
the capacity for speech evolved. With almost 70 percent ofthe world's population capable of
being guided by defined Sacral Centers, there is a huge but as yet untapped potential among
humanityfor awakening and awareness.
92 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
The receptive Sacral Center is designed to respond to life, to what is being asked ofit, bymaking
expressive noises and sounds.These primal sounds,which do not originate in ourThroat Center,
butvibrate from our midsection (like adiaphragm openingor closing),let us know ifwe have the
energyfor something,ornot.These sounds tellus ifwelikewhatwe seeorhear,orareasked to do,
or not. Everyone who honors the nature oftheir Sacral,and the guidance ofits sounds,is in touch
with theirown power.
The sounds canvaryperson to person,culture to culture,buttheyare simple and easilyrecognized.
A 'yes'might be an open ended sound like ah-HUH (with the accent on the last syllable),while a
closedUH -un (emphasis onthefirst syllable) means'no'.Ifthe answer to aquestion is hmmmm
(orIdon'tknow),thenperhapsthe timingis notrightorthequestionneedstobere-phrased.People
withdefined Sacral'sdo not,andcannot,reallyknowwhatiscorrectfor them unless theyheartheir
Sacral's response. Reconnectingwith,and learning to trust in, their sounds once again are the first
steps toward living true to themselves, and establishing the potential for personal transformation.
Generatorchildrenmake thesesounds naturallyuntil theyareconditioned to answerwithwords;
they will make little ah-huh or uhn-un noises when asked yes or no questions. Parents who
encourage such responses when they ask questions, and who honor their child's inner guidance,
nurture self-confidence.
THE SACRAL DEFINED TO THE THROAT
The manifesting energy ofThroat-to-motor connections with the Heart, Solar Plexus, and
Root Centers pushes outward or moves toward something or someone, and is described as an
initiating energy.The specific, enveloping energy that the Sacral motor emits naturally draws
life and people into its embrace so it can respond to them, and is described as responsive.This
iswhyGenerators meetwith resistancewhen theytryto initiate.Theyare attempting to reverse
the Sacral's natural energyflow.
When the Sacral motor is defined to the Throat Center, however, through Channel 34-20 for
example,we have an anomalywhere the Sacral's generative poweris converted into apotentialfor
manifestation. The defined Sacral then has the potential to move immediately from response to
action. People with a Sacral-Throat connection, called Manifesting Generators, often experience
their responses as actual physical movement toward or away from something or someone, rather
than simplyas Sacralsounds.ManifestingGenerators are discussed in more detailin Section 3.
The nine gates ofthe Sacral Center describe the availability ofthe life force, and reveal the many
processes the Sacral Center supports, or not. The gates ofthe Sacral Center are described in the
table on the nextpage.

THE DEFINED SACRAL CENTER - 66% OF THE POPULATION
Thosewhoentertheworldwithadefined SacralCenterare the custodians ofanenormous source of
power. Every day their Sacral motor generates a certain amount ofenergy that feels like a constant
buzzhumming awaywithin them.This is agenuinevitalitywhich can beexperienced as restlessness,
an inabilityto sitstill,ora need to burn energybybeing active.Nothingis more importantfor them
than tofindpersonalexpressionand deepsatisfactionbyusingtheirdailysupplyofenergyforworkor
activities theyloveto do.
The Sacral is very powerful in response. When asked a yes or no question, its immediate response
revealswhether the energyrequested is currentlyavailable to itselfand others,or not.Ifaresponse is
affirmative,ormoves towardsomething,the Sacral'sfullpoweris behind the decision.Iftheresponse
is unenthusiastic, or the energyfeels like it is pulling back, the activity cannot be sustainedwithout
overextendingthe Sacral'sgenerativeenergy.
94
For example,when somebody asks,"Do you want to learn how to play tennis?"and you hear the
Sacral say"uhn un," that is the truth. And this truth must be honored because it is the only way
defined Sacralswill know ifthey have the energyfor what they are being asked to do. In practical
terms,what they heard was their Sacralvoice telling them that the energy is not available at this
time. Each negative Sacral response sets a clear and healthy boundary that protects then, [wm
potential harm,embarrassment or from merelyoverextending their energy.Theycannot stickwith
commitmentstheyhavenotenteredcorrectlythroughresponse.Sacralenergyissimplynotavailable
to support decisions madewithyour mind.This iswhyitis essentialto knowhow to respond,and
how to correctlyengage this energyin productive and fulfilling ways.IfGenerators allowamental
decision tousurp theirSacral'simmediateresponse,theywillmostlikelymeetresistance,experience
exhaustion,frustration and unhappiness,orquit.
ot completing what they have started has earned Generators a reputation for being the great
quitters of the world. Avoiding this scenario begins with understanding that the nature of the
Sacral's frequencyis to perseverein orderto masteraskillorachievecompetency.This energyis set
in motion and sustained by response, by correctly committing their energy to begin with. Unlike
manifestation, which occurs through the Throat Center, Sacral energy reaches plateaus and must
have the power to persist through those 'stuck' points until a sudden breakthrough (initiation)
propelsoneto thenextlevelofmastery.WithoutSacralenergy,theserecurringplateauscan become
insurmountable obstacles, sources offrustration, fatigue and the temptation to quit.The onlyway
that thosewithadefined Sacralcanmakesure that theirperseveringSacralenergyisfirmlybehind
themfrom the beginningis through an affirmative response.
The mantra and Strategy, therefore, for the defined Sacral Center is 'do not initiate.' ever take
the first step or move toward somethingwithout being asked so it can respond.The moment one
initiates,theconnectionto thesacralsourceofthepowertopersevereisbroken.Thesecretis towait,
andkeep theSacralavailablesothatitcanrespond toexactlywhatisrightforeachofusindividually.
Listeningto theprimalsoundsofthe Sacralresponses tellsoneifthereisenergyavailable.Knowing
that there is reliable energy to fulfill a commitment, and finding satisfaction in doing it, builds a
Generator's confidencein makingdecisions thatare correct,and builds trustin sacralsounds.
Others canfeel the powerfuland available resources ofadefined SacralCenter,and theywillwant
to take advantage ofthis energy. Letting the mind talk the Sacral into doing something that is
not right for it, will simply lead to frustration, and a society of'slaves'working with no energy
at something they do not love.We must honor the Sacral's limitations by honoring its guidance
through the sounds it makes.
PerhapsthehardestthingforpeoplewithSacraldefinitiontoacceptisthattheirtrustworthyresponse
is a mechanical process, and neither rational nor aware. Responses are not judgments ofright or
wrong,and theydo not comewith the rationalor articulated vocabularyto explain them. Response
is so pure thatitbypassesawarenessaltogether.Generatorsoftendescribe itaslife makingadecision
through them, and that's exactlywhat happens.It doesn't matterwhat they'think'their life should
look like, as the life force knows what is correct for them, and what they have energy for. This is
their truth.Theirpatientand expectantwaitingallows the universe to bringlife to them,while their
responses attune them to theebb and flowofthe unique pathandpuposetheyare here tolive.

THE UNDEFINED SACRAL CENTER - 34% OF THE POPULATION
Theundefined SacralCenterisalwaysvulnerable to theintenseconditioningfield (orbuzz) created
by the majority ofhuman beings on the planet with defined Sacrals. It is extremely sensitive to
the energy levels in people and places, and is capable ofmagnifYing those energies. Those with
undefined Sacral's are subject to elevated levels ofenergy pumping through bodies that are not
equippedtohandleit.Theyoftenrunonthis'borrowed'energy,andover-extendthemselves,leading
to breakdown and exhaustion. Not designed to live in response, they can never rely on their own
sounds to guide theirdecisions,orto tell themwhen enoughis enough.
Without a defined Sacral Center, the Manifestor, Projector, and Reflector types, are particularly
subjectto energyexcesses.Theyare notbornknowingwhen enoughis enough,orhow to establish
healthy boundaries for themselves. With their undefined Sacral filled to overflowing by other
people's energy,theyare always busywithworkandfamily and neverknowwhen to quit.Theytake
on too much and feel like slaves,but don't really knowwhat to do about it.When they recognize
they are tired, they override this and push on through,jeopardizing their health.They don't know
when (orunderstand how) to pullawayfrom the Sacralenergyaround them and realignwith their
ownpersonalAuthority.
It is difficult for them to knowwhen it is correct to enter a situation/relationship versus when to
wait,orhowlong tostayorwhen to getout.Theyareconstantlytakinginotherpeople's Sacralfuel,
so it is wise to make sure that the fuel is the right kind for their vehicle. Understanding how they
connecttothepeoplearoundthemisthekeytomaintainingtheirvitalityandahealthyopenSacral,
and this can onlybe achieved byexperimentingwith their StrategyandAuthority.
The Sacral Centeris about the availability,or not,ofpure,generative,life-force energy,particularly
sexual energy. The undefined Sacral has no consistent boundaries, and with a potential for deep
conditioning in this area, can be anywhere from mildly curious to obsessedwith sex. Each sexual
experience will be unique because the undefined Sacral is being conditioned either positively or
negativelybyits partner.This information is especiallyimportantfor teenagers as theymature.The
potential wisdom ofthis undefined center is to learn about healthy sex and safe boundaries, and
to be able to discern when enough is enough.This includes learning to rely on their Strategyand
Authorityto enterrelationships correctlyin thefirstplace.
Consistentlevelsofgenerativeandperseveringenergyare notavailable topeoplewithanundefined
Sacral; the energyis there and then it's not there.Iftheyunderstand andrespect this,theywill take
time to rest when rest is needed. They should not ignore their energy levels. Failure to properly
manage their energy can lead to serious sleep problems,resulting in insufficient, non-rejuvenating
rest.Just as they amplifY the defined Sacral's energy, theycan also magnifYits fatigue, erroneously
thinking it is their own.The healthy bedtime practice for undefined Sacral's is to go to bed early,
before theyare tired,to ease into sleep.Theyneed this quiet time alone to release the Sacralenergy
buzztheyhave taken induringthe day.
96 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
Mostpeoplewith undefined Sacrals,when trulyhonest,admit theydon'treallywant towork.They
wouldlove torelaxandletothersdo thehardwork.WhenweobservethosewithundefinedSacrals,
however, this usually is not what we experience because the Sacral is one ofthe most easily and
deeplyconditioned centers.The sheer numberofdefined Sacrals,and size ofthe overall Generator
field onthe planet,easilyoverwhelms undefined Sacrals.
When atpeacewith theirundefined Sacral,however,the three open-SacralTypes are relaxed,have
healthyboundaries,andthroughtheirAuthorityknowwhenenoughisenough.Theyworkinspurts,
taking plentyoftime for rest.They respect their inconsistentenergyflow.Theyenjoy takingin the
life-force energyofotherswithout responding to itor identifYingwith it.They balance theirwork
withrest,andbecomewiseabouttheways thecreative,powerfulandresponsiveenergyoftheSacral
operates,and can be bestutilized bythosewho aregeneratingit.
THE COMPLETELY OPEN SACRAL CENTER
The completely open Sacral does not know what to use its energy for. It finds its own energy
scattered all over the place, drawn to this thing or that thing. There is no longer a question of
knowing when enough is enough; it merelywaits for exhaustion from inappropriate and excessive
activityto overwhelmitso itcan stop.
Manyhavebeendrawn through this opennessintoafascinationwithwhoweareandwhyweexist.
Peoplewith completelyopen Sacral'slike Krishnamurti, Osho and Ra Uru Hu havegiven us deep
insights into the nature ofbeing.The wisdom available here is that one can truly measure the life
force- canbecomewiseaboutwhatenergyisreallyfor- andcanthenexpressordescribe themany
qualities this unique energymakes available to humanity..
NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED SACRAL CENTER
The not-selfmindis the spokespersonfor the undefined centers,and tells uswhatwe should sayor
do. oticing this talk is essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples ofwhat the not-self
mental monologcould sound likewith an undefined Sacral Center: Let's keep working.We really
need to get this done.We need to sayyes to thatotherwisewe might miss outon something.I can
keep going.Letmejustgetacup ofcoffee.We cando that too.Notaproblem.We're not tiredyet.

life-long search for love. And love,in one form or another, is what life is all about.This feeling of

THE DEFINED G CENTER - 57% OF THE POPULATION
Those with a defined G Center have a fixed and reliable self-identity, a sense ofbeing loved and
loveable. Secure in theirlove for themselves, theycanlove otherswithout becoming dependenton
them.Theyhaveasenseoftheirowncorrectdirectionormissioninlife,and are naturalsatpointing
out new directions - and possibly new loves - for others. With a deep sense ofconnectedness
to their center, they have the capacity to comfort people who are concerned about the direction
humanityis headingin,byhelping them understand the nature ofourevolution as aspecies.

The mantra for the undefined G Center is: ifyou are in the wrong place,you are with the wrong
people/person.The undefined G is specially equipped to sense when the environment they are in
isn't correct for them. Ifsomeone takes them to a restaurant, home,store or office that doesn't feel
right, theywill automaticallytransfer thatfeeling ofunease to the person who took them there, to
the people theymeet there,or to proposals orcommitments suggestedwhile there.
As an example,you might take a woman with an open/undefined G to a restaurant in order to
introduce her to a potential business partner,but ifthe restaurant is the wrong place for her, the
connection can't work. Try changing restaurants. When you find the one that is right for her,
then the viabilityofthe connection can be accuratelyassessed.This is how undefined G Centers
discoverothersontheirtrajectory.It'sallaboutplace.When thosewithanundefined G arein the

rightplace,the directionoftheirlifeis correct,and thepeople theymeetwillbe correct.Theywill
thrive as their undefined center amplifies and reflects the correct energy ofpeople around them,
as ifwhere they are is what theyare. In otherwords, the wrong house,job orrelationship can be
the cause ofgreat unhappiness.
The beautyofhavingthis centeropenis thatpeoplearound theOpenG oftenbecome theirwilling
allies,full ofsuggestions and eager to help. ew directions and new loves are brought to them all
the time.Friends showthemwhereeverythingis,andtake them to to the correctpeople,placesand

Even moving the studentto adifferentseatcan make adifference.
A powerful and cogent motivation underlying the thinking ofundefined G's is,"Which direction
will take me tolove?"Almosteverydecision the mind makes throughits dialoguewith the not-self
is filtered by this question,"Is this where I will find love?"The not-selfcan become obsessed with
where they are headed, and when they are going to find love.It prods them to search for identity
bytrying to understandwho theyare.Theycanbecomepreoccupiedwithearningtitles and adding
letters behind their name so theycan say,"I am a doctor or professor or lawyer."Theyinitiate over

theymiss bothlove and correctdirection. StrategyandAuthorityare always the solutionfor this.
When at peacewith themselves,undefined G's do not need to anticipate their nextmove, orwhen

do notbecomeattached to the peoplewho take them to thecorrectplaceorlove;theysimplythank
themand moveon.Thisfrees them to becomfortablewith alltypes ofpeople,and discerningabout
whoislivinglife authentically.
Instead of feeling lost, people with undefined G Centers can enjoy what is being shown to
them; theycan enjoy the people and places they encounter, and are free to take advantage ofthe
guidancegiven byothers.Theycan tell uswhatlove and direction are because they take in all the
possibilities oflove, and experience all the different directions.Though they can never see their
destination, theyknow each next stepwill berevealed iftheylive as themselves.Ultimately,there
are no betterguides in life than those with undefined G Centers. Byletting go oftheir need for
identity and love, they can step into anyone's shoes and offer loving, correct guidance.They are
here to becomewise about theways identityis expressed through aperson's behavior.Manygreat
actorsofstageandscreenhaveundefinedG'swith no strongfixed identityoftheirown.Bytaking
the role (identity) they are to act deeply into themselves, they can reflect it back as a convincing
and compellingportrayal ofthat character.
THE COMPLETELY OPEN G CENTER
A completelyopen G Centerleaves onewithoutclearidentifiablepersonalityparameters and an
inherentsense ofdirection.Ifnotgrounded in theirpersonalAuthority,completelyopen G's feel
afloat and unsure ofthemselves,turning to others to identifYand direct them,and to affirm their
10vability.This leaves them vulnerable to manipulation, and open to the conditioning dictates of
others.Once theygive theirauthorityoverto anotherperson,authorityfigure, orinstitution,they
can no longerlive out their true potential.
Over time,as theybecome comfortablewith the openness oftheir design, theydo discover their
way or direction, and a sense oftheir unique being. Like those with undefined G's, their broad
experience and comprehension ofthe nature ofbeing, selflove, and the waywe are designed to
move through life,is wisdom we can all benefitfrom.
NOT-SELF TALK OF THE UNDEFINED G CENTER
The not-selfmind is the spokesperson for the undefined centers,and tells us whatwe should say
ordo.Noticing this talkis essential to deconditioning. Here are some examples ofwhat the not
selfmental monolog could sound like with an undefined G Center:Who am I?Where should I
go to find outwho I am?Who can showme?Who am I goingto love?Whoisgoingto love me?
HowdoIfind them?WherecanIfind them?WhatamIgoingto dowithmylife?Whereshould

In SectionTwo ofthis book,you were introduced to the myriadways your strong and gifted mind

and honoringyourAuthority,and deepeningyourunderstandingofyourType's Strategy.Practiced
together, these tools free the mind to observe the life ofthe Form as arelaxed,reflective passenger
able to enjoyits ride and fill its role as an OuterAuthorityfor others.
The Human Design System teaches human beings how to live by their own authority; how to
make decisions that are individuallycorrect.Although we are all conditioned to seekapproval and
authorityoutsideourselves,andtomakedecisionsfrom themind,wedohaveatrustworthypersonal
Authoritythatwecanactuallyrelyonto makechoices.WhenweintentionallypracticeourStrategy
and Authority,we align with our unique geometry (path), and our genetic makeup,our reason for
incarnating and our uniqueness are all expressed through us as ourTrue SelfThingsjust naturally
fall into place,suchaswherewelive,ourjob and ourrelationships.
There are several centers in the BodyGraph that can bedefined as apersonalAuthority,and each
represents a different way or mode ofmaking decisions.The hierarchy ofmodes is listed below
andelaborateduponin thepagesfollowing. Oncethe mindhas beenfreed from decision-making,
it can take its rightful place in our life as a valued and valuable witness ofour life, and Outer
Authorityfor others.

YourpersonalAuthorityislistedonyourHumanDesignchart.Eachtype ofAuthorityisdescribed
in the summaries thatfollow.
SECTION THREE: AUTHORITY, OUR UNIQUE AUTHENTIC TRUTH 107
SOLAR PLEXUS AUTHORITY
When the Solar Plexus Center is defined, it takes precedence over all
other authority centers in a chart. In Section Two we discovered that
the Solar Plexus operates through an emotionalwave,and that waiting
for clarity is the key to living in harmony. Fifty percent ofthe people
on the planet have a defined Solar Plexus and are designed to wait out
.... ..- ..... their emotionalwave before making a decision.Their motto is 'there is
no truth in the now.'Truth reveals itselfin its fullness over time, and
.......
, emerges eventually as a sense ofclarity. Patience is the key component
inwaitingoutthe emotionalwave before makingadecision.As there is
no truth in the moment, spontaneous decisions are untrustworthy and
not-selfbased decisions.Time is the keywith this Authority; the more
time the better.Time puts distance between the moment adecisionis called for and the decision
itself.As you waityou will gain clarity,although total clarityor total certaintyis rare.The goal is
to become as clearas possible.
It's best to avoid making decisions from the emotionally charged high or low points along your
wave, as this sends chaos into the world and usually results in regret. Depth is not accessible to
you in the immediacyofthepresentmoment.Thoughit's difficult to contain the impulse to react
immediately, its best to wait for calm waters before you make your decision. Remember, your
truth (clarity) comes toyou overtime.Asyou surrenderto thedepths ofyouruncertaintyyoucan
move beyond the'fororagainst'reaction ofthe moment.You can use this built-inwaitingperiod
for discernment,and to avoid making spontaneous mistakes.The Solar Plexus is apotent motor
and asource ofwarm,seductive energythat others desire access to.Waitingfor claritycan often
be used toyouradvantage.Ifyou askothers towaitwhileyou take time to properlyconsidertheir
offer, they may find you or your abilities even more essential and attractive to them, assuming
what theyare offeringis correctfor both ofyou.Byexperimenting,youwilllearn and understand
this form ofdecision-making,and discoverfor yourselfjusthowpowerfulit can be to wait.
SACRAL AUTHORITY
When the Sacral Centeris definedwithout the SolarPlexus Center,we
have SacralAuthority, the domain ofthe Generator. Usually the Sacral
voice or familiar ah-huh (yes) or uhn-un (no) is immediately heard or
feltwhen Generators are asked to commit their energyto an activityor
relationship.Ifthereisanyhesitation,suchas hmmmm,theansweris,"I
.. don'tknowright now- ask me againlater or ask me in adifferentway."
.. '
Sacral Authority shows Generators, through response, what is correct
".. . '.'
'.
, for them,whattheirboundariesare,andwhattheycurrentlyhaveenergy
to support and engage with. As compared to the Solar Plexus Center
. . which shows its truth overtime,this is truth in presenttime.The Sacral
Center only functions in the present moment; it can't predict the future. Its responses tell you
whose energyorrequests are correct for you,and ifyourenergyis available to give to others or a
108 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
task.When you hearyour Sacralgive the go-ahead,you knowyouwill have the energyresources
to persevere until you bring the task or relationship to completion, or until you don't have the
energy for it any longer. Sacral response is a reliable, honest and trustworthy guide to reducing
resistance and maximizing satisfaction.
After many years ofconditioning, however, you may find that you need to re-connect with your
Sacralresponse.Onegoodwayis tofindpeoplewhocanaskyourSacral'yes'or'no'questions.When
you are asked,letyoursacralresponseflowimmediately.Itmay take alittle time to getcomfortable
with your Sacral answering, but the more you do it, the clearer your response will become.This
is awonderful way to reawaken and re-strengthen your response, and successfully re-engage this
always-ready-to-respondinnerguidance system.
SPLENIC AUTHORITY
When the defined Splenic Center stands alone without Sacral or Solar
Plexus definition, one has Splenic Authority. This can be felt as an
instantaneous resonance or recognition with something or someone,
and an inner knowing as to whether it is healthyfor you - or not. Our
highly evolved survival intelligence alerts us to which environments,
direction, opportunities and people are safe and advantageous for us to
engagewith,and which ones aren't.
This type ofauthority requires a deep level ofattention to many subtle
physiological sensations, and an ability to act if necessary and correct,
no matter what the consequences. The Splenic voice speaks softly and does not repeat itself.
Staying in the present and tuned into what your body is telling you is critical to your survival.
This is a purely existential authority designed to keep you safe. Do not allow your mind, or the
emotional needs, wants and pressures ofothers, to cause you to second guess or override your
Splenic Center's messages.
The SplenicCenteris constantlyand spontaneouslycommunicatingwithyou aboutyourmoment
to-momentwell-being,sothereisgreatwisdomavailableinlisteningtoitsalerts.ThosewithSplenic
Authority don't have time to go deep, and to ponder the broader ramifications oftheir decisions
overtime.Decisionsmustbemadein the moment.Wait,and the momentand informationisgone.
The Splenic Center is not aware ofthe future, and 10 minutes or an hour or adaylater,what was
correct for you may change, and your activity along with it. You will 'know' instinctively when
somethingis correctand safeforyou in the nowmoment,andwhenitis not.To reaquaintyourself
with and honor your Spleen's guidance requires experimentation, and a deep trust in the inherent
wisdom ofyourvehicle to takeyou safelywhere,howandwithwhomyou need to go.
SECTION THREE: AUTHORITY, OUR UNIQUE AUTHENTIC TRUTH 109
HEART CENTER (EGo) MANIFESTED AUTHORITY
Ego Manifested Authority is driven by the Heart Center's motor to
manifest. Manifested Authority is about articulation. Your Authority
'. is expressed through the Throat Center verbally, and it is important for
you to listen to what you 'say'in order to know your truth, rather than
what your mind is telling you. Your informing as aManifestor needs to
beverbalized in the moment, as it is not what you thinkyou should say,
. .. ..-... .".- but rather what you do say when you are not trying to control it. The
'0. not-selfis always trying to control what we say and, in effect,whatever
you blurt out in the moment (bypassing the mind) is your truth. Ifyou
try to scriptwhatyou sayin anymanneryou havelostyourconnectionto
yourAuthority.You are designed to have impact,and itis importantfor you to trustwhatyou say
without the mindoverridingit.Surrenderingto the truthofyourvoiceis keyforyou; thisiswhere
your impact comes from. With so many open centers competing for your attention, you cannot
trustyour not-selfmind to speakforyou.Yourvoice initiates and runs yourlife.Yourvoice leads
and you follow.Trustinyourvoice.
HEART CENTER (EGo) PROJECTED AUTHORITY
For those with Ego Projected Authority, the Heart connects to the G
Center through the Channel ofInitiation (Channel 25-51).This is arare
form ofProjector,and StrategyandAuthorityareessentialto thesebeings
as the only thing they can trust is waiting for the invitation.With avery

110 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
SELF-PROJECTED AUTHORITY
Self-Projected Authority originates out of the G Center and connects
to the Throat Center through one offour channels. The key with this
Authority is to listen to what you say.Whatever you need to know is in
whatyou say,and you have a G Center,averypowerfulvoice ofidentity,
that speaks for you in reaction to an invitation. Your truth is always
expressed through the core ofyour identity. Ifthere is no truth for you,
'.. ..' there is no success for you.When you are invited,listen to what you say.
..-" .. .
....... " Don'ttryandfigure outmentallywhatyou are going to say; simplylisten
to and trustyourownvoice at thatmoment.
There are no motors present in this type ofAuthority, and you can become totally lost in the
conditioning through your open centers. It can be easy for you to ignore your own voice in the
moment, and thus not fulfill what it is to be uniquelyyou.You are designed to be guided in your
decisions bywhat makes you feel like you, and brings 'you'enjoyment and pleasure. Ask yourself,
"Will this make me happy?Will this give me selfexpression? Am I headingin the right direction
for me?"Discussingyour impending decisions with others in order to hearyourself, to sensewhat
levelofself-satisfactionyourdecision mightbring,isveryhelpful.To avoid makingadecisionfrom
your mind, focus on listening to what you are saying without thinking about it. People with a
defined G Centeroften provide direction for others,butonlyhear theirown direction bylistening
towhat theythemselves are sayingin the moment.
ENVIRONMENT (MENTAL PROJECTORS)
A Mental Projector can have the Ajna Center connected to the Head
Center, or the Ajna Center connected to the Throat Center, or the
Head, Ajna and Throat Centers all connected to each other. To have
no center ofinner personal Authority is rare and unique. When there
are no centers defined below the Throat Center,we have a design that
receives guidance from sensory information about the environment
through its open centers. If the environment feels wrong, the people
you are with, or ideas exchanged and bargains made there, will not be
right either.The first question to ask is,"Is this environment correct for
me?"The caution here is to be aware ofthe strength ofyour mind and
its tendency to intervene in decision-making. When making a decision about what the correct
environmentis for you, itis healthyand beneficial to physicallyvisit the environments in question,
and notice and recognizewithinyourbodyhowthey'feel'toyou.
Though it is good for you to have agroup oftrusted advisers to turn to, its best notto discuss a
decisioninordertogetopinions oradvice.Your advisers are bestused as soundingboardsinorder
for you to hearyourown ruminations about the decision.

LUNAR AUTHORITY (REFLECTORS)
Whennocentersaredefined,wehaveaReflectorwhoseAuthorityisLunar,
and is determined bythe Moon's 28-daycycle through the Mandalaas it

are designed to wait through their personal and consistent monthly

' -" delighted byaReflector'slife.Iftheydo nothonortheirLunarcycle,they
.... ,*
may suffer disappointment and dis-ease. A key for Reflectors is to slow
down and notlet theworld rush them.
It is important for Reflectors to pay attention to the environment, as they mirror it. The core of
the Reflector is their undefined G Center, and being in the correct place with the correct people
is imperative to their well-being. Ifthe environment does not feel good to them, or is unhealthy,
theywon'tfeelwell,orwill be ill-at-ease. Conversely,ifthe environmentfeels good, theyfeel good.
Reflectors must also have trustworthy advisers or confidantes with whom to discuss any situation
and potential decision during this cycle. By hearing themselves talkover time, Reflectors will one
day simply arrive at an inner knowing, a deep inner sense ofwhich decision is correct for them.
Please see Reflectors in SectionFourfor moreinformation.
THE LIBERATED MIND AS AN OUTER AUTHORITY
Following our Strategy connects us to our own personal Authority. When we are operating as
our unique authentic self, our undefined centers become places of great wisdom. Rather than
conditioning us in a distorted way, these undefined centers inform us clearlyand accurately about
whatisgoingonintheworldaroundus.Onceweareontrackandalignedwithourcorrectgeometry,
the mind can begin revealing its own potential as an extraordinary Outer Authority for others.It
canexpressourintelligence,communewithothers toshareouruniqueexperiences andperceptions,
and inspire them with whatwe have learned.The mind is here to think, question, interpret, teach,
inspire,remember,organize,name and process data.These are ways we share the gifts ofour mind
with thosewho are here to receive them,and respond to them from theirownAuthority.
ThemorewepracticeourStrategyandAuthority,andliberatethe mindfrom makingdecisions,the
more valuable our Outer Authority becomes to others. Once aligned with our true nature,we are
in tunewithourownlifeforce energyand ourtruepurposeinlife. Somethingofuniquevalue then
naturally emerges from the mind, something others have been waiting to hear. And our liberated
mind regains the potentialto ultimatelyexpress ourunique reasonfor incarnating.

THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES
LIVING OUR DESIGN
MANIFESTOR GENERATOR
PROJECTOR REFLECTOR
The shiftthatheralded theappearanceofHomo SapiensinTransitus,in 1781,also precipitatedthe
division ofhumanity into four distinctTypes: Manifestors, Generators, Projectors and Reflectors.
Type embodies the essence ofThe Human Design System, and is the basis for its most practical,
empowering and transformative information - Strategy and Authority. In The Human Design
System,Type concerns the body,ourgenetics, and our aura; it has nothing to do with psychological
or personality typing. EachType defines a particular mode ofoperating energetically, and a prime
auric frequency that is as distinguishable as our blood type. Our practicaluse ofType is based on an
understandingofthesubtleand unconscious dynamicsofhumaninteractionthrough theaura.What
wecommunicatethroughourauraisdetermined byourbody'sgeneticmakeup,whichweseedefined
inourBodyGraph.DefinitiondeterminesType,andTypeisexpressed through ouraura.
ThefourTypesaregroupedaccordingto theirabilitytoconsistentlygenerateorinitiateenergy,ornot.
There are two 'energy'types (Manifestor and Generator) and two 'non-energy'types (Projector and
Reflector). Non-energy types do not have constant access to their own generating and manifesting
capacity, and their available energyand staminafor workis not reliablyavailable to them. Following
their Strategymaximizes theiravailableenergypotential.

OUR AURIC PRESENCE IN THE WORLD
"AURAS ARE A FULL EXPRESSION OF THE BEING, AND A CONTROLLING AGENT OF
THE WAY THE FORM IS GOING TO WORK. AURAS ARE THE WAY WE CONNECT TO AND
ARE EXPERIENCED BY THE OTHER." - RA URU Hu
There is an electromagnetic energy field surrounding and extending outward from every living
thing. In the case ofhuman beings, that field extends about two arm lengths in every direction
from the body. Auric connectivity is a powerful and non-verbal form of communication that
cannotbeignored.IfweunderstandandhonorthekeydifferencesbetweenTypesatthisauriclevel,

assessment. Each Type can relax into their strategy with confidence when they understand and
allowtheiraura to do theworkfor them.
In order to evolve and fulfill our purpose, as highly social beings we are here to commune with
others. Part ofwhat it means to know and love ourselves, to express our own uniqueness with
compassion,is to appreciate and respect the uniqueness ofothers.Mastering auric communication
betweenTypes beginswith Strategy.
STRATEGY REFLECTS EACH TYPE'S UNIQUE AURIC MODE
When we talk about an individual's Strategy byType in Human Design,we are referring to away
ofbeing in the world without resistance; a method that aligns us with our unique geometry in the
overallflow ofthe totality,and supports the process ofbecomingourauthentic self Strategyis not a
philosophy;itis basedon thewayourvehicleisgeneticallydesigned to operate on alllevels. Strategy
accessestheuniquewaysenergyisdesigned toflow througheachperson'sBodyGraph,andultimately
determines thewayourhealth,sexuality,relationships,andlifepurposeplayout.
All chart analysis begins at the level ofType. EachType has a simple,understandable Strategyfor
efficientlyand successfullyinteractingauricallywith the otherTypes.TheHumanDesignMandala
and BodyGraph provide the specific cosmic backdrop and blueprint, respectively, for determining
this Strategy. Once you begin living yourType's Strategy,you will experience its rewards as your
Type's signature: as peace (Manifestor), satisfaction (Generator), success (Projector), or as surprise
(Reflector).Youwill discover somethinginside ofyou thatwas hidden byoverlays ofconditioning.
You will get in touch with the part ofyou that always knew what was correct or not correct for
you; that place inside thatyou can trust to sayyes or no to whateveryou meetin this life. Strategy
breaks through the habit ofcomparing yourselfto others, and opens the way for you to discover
your uniqueness so you can simply enjoy being who you are. Strategy frees your inner essence to
thrive so your purpose can naturally unfold. Living life according to your Strategy launches your
individualexperiment.You can testyour Strategyyourselfandfind outifitworksforyou. Letyour
own Strategy and Authority begin to replace the blind faith that most ofus place in any and all
authorities outside ofourselves.

THE MANIFESTOR
CLOSED AND REPELLING AURA
NOT-SELF THEME: ANGER
STRATEGY: To INFORM
SIGNATURE: PEACE
THE MANIFESTOR TYPE
TwothingsinparticulardistinguishaManifestor'sdesignfromtheotherTypes.First,itconspicuously
lacks Sacral definition, which immediately places Manifestors in a global minority. Second, there
is either a direct or indirect connection between theThroat Center and one or more ofthe three
remaining motors in the BodyGraph: the Heart,SolarPlexus and Root Centers.
Manifestors are somewhatrare,comprisingless than 10percentoftheworld's population.
OVERVIEW
The saga ofhumankind unfolded as it did because Manifestors didn't have to wait for the 'gods'
or for forces outside themselves to move them into action. Manifestors' exceptional ability to
bring into being or make manifest what they envision, in combination with the protection of
theirclosed and repelling aura,often placed them in positions ofrulership such as awarrior king
or high priest. As the only pure doers among the Type, Manifestors conquered and defended
kingdoms, and secured and maintained their power and authority by establishing the laws. Our
remaining religious and secular hierarchies are a result of the Manifestor's attempt to retain
control and to avoid being challenged.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LiVING_O_U_R_D_E_S_IG_N -.:.117
The traditional ruler's role that Manifestors held for centuries ended around 1781,however,when
humans transitioned from the 7-centered to the 9-centered form. Today's Manifestors, still the
instruments of the yang/yang principle (primal force), are now living in a yin/yin (receptive)
Generator-dominated environment. Instead ofdreaming empires into being or determining the
courseofcivilizations,theyare nowlookingfor awayto integratetheirinherentindependence,and
unique essentialpower to impact,into asocietythat has stripped awaytheirfreedom to act.
In today's world the Manifestor's incredible gifts are their ability to act independently, to initiate
action,and to impactothers.When perceived as threateningorunpredictable,however, these same
qualitiescanmake the otherthreeTypes uncomfortable,and oftenlead to overtattempts to control
the Manifestor. Manifestors are at ease with solitude, and find a nourishing peace in manifesting
what they want for themselves.This is their natural way and they don't require outside assistance.
Theycan'tunderstand whyotherswould even care aboutwhat theydo, muchlesswant to resist or
control them, but try to control they do - from parents on up. An early and unpleasant history of
conditioning experiences, mixed with resistance, pushes the Manifestor toward its not-selftheme
ofanger.This anger will be expressed in one oftwo ways: as anger/rage and rebelliousness, or as
passivity and accommodation. Both expressions repress the power ofManifestors and keep them
from realizing theirworth,which is why Strategyis so important.Byinforming,and thus relaxing
the resistance metfrom others,Manifestorsfindwhat theyseekmostinlife- the peace to dowhat
theywant,when theywant to do it.
Manifestors are not particularlyinterested in themselves, nordo theyneed to relyon otherpeople
to askthem orinvite them in order to acton theirAuthority.Theyare self-contained,independent
agents. They tend to see others as rather alien, behind the times, and stuck or unable to move
themselves out ofpredicaments.With their ability to glimpse the future, Manifestors often feel as
iftheyarewaitingfor everyone else to catchup.
The questionsManifestors askare,"WillI be answered?Willsomeone be enlivenedbymyimpact,
or respond to my initiating question?"This underlying pressure to impact, to make things happen,
is key to fulfilling their purpose. Manifestors are most comfortable when left alone to do as they
please,yet the other threeTypes are waitingfor the Manifestor to initiate them,or a new process,
so each can contribute theiressentialpart.Manifestors oftenlookto the otherTypes toprovidethe
specificenergyneeded to completewhattheythemselvesdream.Inaperfectworld,Manifestorsget
things started;Projectorsguidetheprocess;Generatorsprovidetheenergytorealizeorcompleteit;
and Reflectors tell them howwellitisgoing.
MANIFESTOR STRATEGY: To INFORM
Manifestors have a long-standing reputation of posing a threat to order and stability. Their
independence and closed, repelling aura, which literally pushes their energy outward, is often
experienced (and misinterpreted) byothers as the Manifestor's need to take controlorbein charge
ofthe situation. People often feel ignored or run over by 'out ofcontrol'Manifestors and tend,
therefore,tofear them.Conversely,Manifestorsgrowupconditionedbythefearofbeingcontrolled,

TheManifestor'ssimplestrategy-toinform- breaksthroughthishighlychargedauricinteraction,
and effectively opens the way to clear, productive and peaceful communication. Informing is
the onlyway Manifestors find the freedom from resistance that they need in order to manifest.
Technically,Manifestors need to informaftertheyhave made adecisionbutbefore theyactonit,
oratleastas theyare actingonit.Additionally,when theydecide not to do somethinganylonger,
they mustinform about that too.

choosenot to askpermissi.on orinform,eitherbecauseitis too much bother,or because theythink
thatbykeepingwhat theyare going to do asecret theycan avoid beingrejected and controlled.
Informing becomes an acceptable,practicalpartofthe decision-makingprocesswhen Manifestors
understand and embrace the impact they have on others. Manifestors do not need people in the
same way the otherTypes do, and are generally not concerned about how others perceive them.
They are generally genuinely surprised to learn that they have an impact at all. Becoming aware
ofthe manyways their impending decision will affect others is the first step to bridging relations,
and releasing theirfull initiatingpower.As Manifestors learn to inform before theyact, to prepare
peoplefor howtheymightbeaffected bytheiractions,theywillbegin tofeel anewkind ofsupport
andreceptivityfrom others.Whenresistanceis nolongeranissue,angersubsidesandpeaceprevails.
And Manifestors also feel honored and respectedwhen others include and inform them.
To put informing and impact into perspective, let's say a Manifestor goes to work and mid
morning suddenly begins to see a way out ofwhat had begun to feel like a dead-end job. In a
flurry ofexcitement, and with her vision leading her, she packs up her office, places a briefletter
ofresignation in the boss's mail box, says goodbye,wishes everyone well and walks out. Everyone
else then experiences what feels like chaos because they were not properly informed or prepared
for the action ofthe Manifestor.The boss is left without help, the Manifestor's fellow employees
wonderwhattheydid to offend,and theManifestor'sfamilyisconcernedaboutthesecurityoftheir
future.TheimpactoftheManifestor'sunanticipatedactionwillmostlikelymeetwithsomeform of
resistancefrom thosewhoseliveswere affected byits abruptness.
The Manifestor had aplan ofaction, and did not need anyone else's advice or input to make it
happen. Remembering to inform all ofthosewho would be impacted bythe decision,however,
would not only have reduced resistance, but also may have garnered the support needed to
achieve the newvisionin peace.Informingpaves thewayfor manifesting; itis the onlysolution
for the Manifestor.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 119
This strategyseemsbothlogicaland simple,andyet,mostManifestors thinkofthemselves as alone
in the world, and informing is the last thing that naturally comes to mind. When they take the
time to write down the names ofall the people theirfuture decision might affect, theywill usually
see that they are not isolated and their decisions do have impact.When Manifestors are aware of
howtheyimpact,thelogicofinformingbecomesapparent,and thisknowledgealonecantransform

others feel disrespected and ignored,whereas,informing dispels fear and builds trustwhichin turn

THE IMPORTANCE OF AUTHORITY
In truth, as comparedwith the otherTypes forwhom Strategyis amechanicalpartoftheirdesign,
ManifestorshavetheirStrategyartificiallyimposedonthemasa meansofeliminatingoralleviating
resistance.HonoringtheirownAuthority,therefore,becomesevenmoresignificantintheirlives.To
attain the full expression oftheir cognitive potential,and to have the proper impact, theymust act
outoftheirinnertruth,and notfrom the mind.Iftheymakeup somethingto do using theirmind,
just to release the pressure to getthings moving, theywill meetwith resistance.
MANIFESTORS WITH EMOTIONAL AUTHORITY
As true initiators, the timing ofManifestor's actions are ofutmost importance to them, especially
Manifestors with a defined Solar Plexus Center. Neither their truth nor their moment ofclarity
can be accessed in an instant. Emotionallydefined Manifestorswho don'twaitouttheiremotional
wave are more reactive orimpulsive, consequently,they meetwith more resistance and tend to get
into trouble. Byhonoring and accepting the chemistryoftheir emotionalwave, theycan use their
waiting time beneficiallyto determine who will be impacted bytheir decision.Time brings clarity.
By the time they get to the end oftheirwave, and have reviewed the list ofthose most impacted,
they may decide to not even take action. Emotional authority requires that Manifestors nurture
patiencein themselves,which canresultin awin/winpositionfor everyone.
There is a big difference between actions directed by the mind, and manifesting coming from a
place ofinner clarity. IfManifestors feel an exaggerated urgency to act or implement their idea,
thatimpulseis usuallynotcomingfrom theirAuthority,butratherfrom theamplifiedconditioning
ofan open center expressing through their mind. Sometimes waiting can feel like an excruciating
punishment to emotionally defined Manifestors, but it keeps them from acting too quickly and
sufferingunwelcome and avoidable consequences.
IfManifestorswait through the movementoftheirwave,theywill notice one oftwo things.Either
the feeling ofwanting to act has subsided, meaning it was not meant to be, or they still feel they
want to make that decision or take that action,and theywillwhen the time feels right.There is no
longer a sense ofurgency or pressure connected to the decision. Everything can happen naturally
when they observe their wave, and inform as they prepare to act.This is the onlyway emotional
Manifestors canreach theirgoaloflivingas themselvesin peace.

MANIFESTORS WITH SPLENIC AUTHORITY
Unlike the emotionally defined Manifestor's need to be patient and wait for clarity, the action
and initiating of the Manifestor with Splenic authority flows out instinctively and naturally in
the moment. Such spontaneity, although freeing, creates the dilemma ofhaving to inform when
one has onlyan inkling ofthe impact that the immediate decision or action might have.It takes a
firm intention on the part ofthe Manifestor to live closely attuned to Splenic Authority, and still
effectivelyinform.Forexample,ifaManifestortakes thatfirststepintoarestaurantwithfriends and
hisbodystopshim,hehas nochoicebuttopayattention toit.Thoughitisobviouslynothealthyfor
him to enter,his Splenic alert did not comewith an explanation.All he can do is honestlyinform
hiscompanionsofwhatactioniscorrectforhimrightnow,andbeawareofhowhissuddendecision
impacts everyone's plans.
MANIFESTORS IN RELATIONSHIPS
Despite the fact that they are perfectly capable ofgreat love and devotion for their families, it's
not easy for an independent loners like Manifestors to be in relationship. Their closed auras do
not naturally embrace or take in others. either are they penetrable,which means others cannot
easilyget to know a Manifestorwell.This is particularly difficult for a mother or lover because it
can create confusing barriers to intimacy. Understanding how Strategy opens the way to clearer
auric interaction betweenTypes allows for genuine compassion, and helps to ameliorate any pain
associatedwith misunderstanding the differences.
Additionally, whether male or female, Manifestors have to do the initiating to be correct. For
example, ifa Manifestor likes somebody, it is proper for them to make the first move instead of
hoping they'llbenoticedand approached.Theyneed to take the initiative,topursuethepersonand
letthem knowwhat theyfeel, andwhattheywantorenvision.It's ariskybusiness and makes them
acutely vulnerable to rejection. Being a Manifestor, though, is about breaking free from the safe
routines oftradition.Thefears thisfreedom raisesin theManifestormustbefaced and overcomein
order to move forward.Just because theyare loners doesn't mean Manifestors don't truly desire,or
can'thave,warmth and companionship and long-term associations.
A peaceful relationship for the Manifestor is based on practicing politeness and informing.They
cannot walk out ofthe house without telling their partner where they are going as this will only
create resistance upon their return. "Where have you been?"the partner will ask. "What did you
do? Whydidn'tyou tell me?"To avoid the interrogation,all the Manifestor needs to do is inform.
"I'm going to the store and I'll be right back."The partner ofa Manifestor often perceives the
Manifestor'sindependenceasasilentbuteffective'donotdisturb'sign- whichisn'ttrue.Manifestors
feel respected when others also keep them informed. Reciprocal informing dissolves much ofthe
resistance, eliminates the anger, and enhances mutual respect between partners in a relationship.
You can't tellManifestorswhat to do,oraskthem likeyou would aGenerator,orinvite them like a
Projector.Ifyou inform them,however,"We are out ofcoffee,"their Authoritywill guide them to
actonit,ifitis appropriate and correctfor them to do so.

theyare polite and askpermission, theywill more often than not be allowed to do what theywant

Manifestorchildrenforces them to rebelorbecomepassive.
MANIFESTORS AND THE EFFECTS
OF LIVING FROM THE NOT-SELF
Manifestors living and making mental decisions or decisions from their not-self meet a lot of
resistance, and may see themselves as victims ofcontrol and punishment.They do not experience
their inherent power, but instead feel restricted and powerless. These are deep sources for most
Manifestors'anger,whichmaybecomedepressionordespairifturnedinwardonthemselves."Lifeis

What they forget is that they are still Manifestors, and for anything ofvalue to happen in a
Manifestor's life, it is the Manifestor who has to initiate it - including reconnecting to their own
life,to theirownAuthority.Theyare here to have an impact!
When Manifestors enter their experiment offollowing their Strategy to inform, and relying on
theirAuthorityfor decisions, theywillhave to confrontthefollowing fears inorderto succeed:
• Fearofupsettingsomeone
• Fearofinformingbecauseit mightcause confrontation
• Fearofinformingbecause someonewill tryto controlthem
• Fearofinformingbecause theymightmeetresistance orrejection
• Fearofone's own anger
HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS FOR MANIFESTORS
It is best for Manifestors, with their open Sacral Center, to go to bed before they feel totally
exhausted.Bylyingdown orrelaxingas muchas an hourbefore theywouldlike to be asleep,they
give their bodies a chance to unwind.Additionally, their auras have time to release energies that
do not belong to them, thus preparing them for apeaceful,refreshing night's rest.

NOT-SELF THEME: FRUSTRATION
STRATEGY: To RESPOND
SIGNATURE: SATISFACTION
THE GENERATOR TYPE
Unique to, and ofcentral importance for, Generators is their Sacral Center which both cradles
and generates the pattern oflife on the planet.When the Sacral Center is defined in a chart, the
person is either a pure Generator or a Manifesting Generator. What distinguishes them is that
a pure Generator has a defined Sacral Center without a motor connected directly to the Throat,
and a Manifesting Generator has a defined Sacral with a motor connected to the Throat. The
Manifesting Generatoris notaseparateType,butrather avariation ofthe GeneratorType,with a
subtle distinction that lies in its auric frequency. Manifesting Generators are Generators byType,
and are designed tofollow the Generator Strategy- to respond.
As approximately 70 percent ofall people are Sacrally defined, the Generator's creative life-force
energy dominates the global frequency ofthe planet. Pure Generators comprise approximately37
percentofhumanity,and ManifestingGenerators about33 percent.
OVERVIEW
Throughout human history, the creative energy and stamina ofGenerators made them a valuable
and desirable commodity.At the same time,ignorance oftheirown potential made them easyprey
for those who could take advantage of their gifts. Generators have always been deeply envious
124 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
ofthe ability ofManifestor's to manifest what they envision. Unable to mimic or compete with
Manifestorswithout meetingresistance andfailure, theygrudginglysurrendered to the Manifestor
who ultimately enslaved or controlled them to erect huge empires. Generators became forced
laborers,the greatbuilders ofourcivilizations.
They retain the role ofbuilder to this day, although they now have the tools at their disposal to
live this role awake and aware, free of oppression, and with full knowledge of their incredible
Sacralpotential.Theycanknow exactlywhat theyare here to do,and love doing it- in cooperative
and mutually beneficial ways with the other three Types. This new phase of understanding and
appreciating their place in the whole is slowly evolving. It will be a reality when Generators relax
into responding,when Manifestors initiate,when Projectors guide and when Reflectors reflect the
levelofsatisfaction and authenticityin theworld.

The otherthreeTypes arelookingoutward- the Manifestoris focused onimpacting,the Projector

own process. Generators find their life through their work, through how they respond to using
theirdailysupplyofenergy.Therightworkactuallytransforms theirlife andslowsthedegenerative
process oftheirbodies.
Generatorsaredesignedtorespondwith theirSacralCenterthroughsounds,asavibrationthatrises
to their throat from their midsection (pure Generators), or as actual movement toward engaging
in the activity (more common to Manifesting Generators). Responses are based on the availability
oftheir Sacral energy to do what they have been asked. Once pure Generators respond, and are

thesemomentsoftransition,theirSacralmustbecommittedto theprocessfrom thebeginning.The
giftofpure Generators is to demonstrate theirability to perfectormasterataskorproject orskill.
In contrast,Manifesting Generators have a motor connected to theThroat,which enables them
to move quicklyfrom response to manifestation.This allows them to seewhichsteps are essential
and which steps can be skipped, resulting in the gift ofefficiency.This same efficiency creates a
dilemma for them, however, which is a tendency to be so impatient and move through a task
so fast that they miss steps.They often have to go back and complete those steps which creates
frustration.This frustration can be avoided,and efficiencyincreased, byslowingdown enough to
pay more attention to their responses as the process unfolds. Manifesting Generator are more
prone to impatience and aggression than pure Generators. Because of the motor connection
to their Throat Center, they tend to bypass their sacral sounds. It often takes the Manifesting
Generator more practice and patience to re-establish aconnection to and trust in their Sacral.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LiVING OUR DESIGN 125
GENERATOR STRATEGY: To RESPOND
"LIKE THE PRIESTESSES OF DELPHI, YOU HAVE TO ASK GENERATORS;
OTHERWISE YOU GET NOTHING." - RA URU Hu
All Generators have embracing auras that transmit the creative/creating life force oftheir Sacral
Center,and establishanenergyfield of'availability'around them.Inorderto access theirenormous
wealth ofenergy and power, one must ask for it so the Generator's Sacral Center can respond.
Generators must wait until something comes toward them, so that their Sacral can either fully
embrace it or remain closed to it. A Sacral 'ah-huh'carries enough energy to complete the task or
honor the request,while an'uhn-uh'is a'no'andwarns againstcommittingto it.
This kind of clear, objective, honest, moment-to-moment mechanical response connects
Generators directly to their own truth, revealing who they are, and what they love and value.
Emanating through their aura, the persevering power oftheir creative life force draws others to
them like a magnet, while their Sacral response sets clear personal boundaries. For Generators,
lifeis renewedwith each response becauseeach decision moves them along theirpathtoward the
perfection oftheir unique potential.
Generators often misinterpret or equate 'waiting to respond'with 'doing nothing.'It is impossible
for them to do nothingbecause theyareconstantlybusygenerating.Iftheyaredoingtheworkthey
love, or ifthey retreat from a dog's growl, or smile when a bird sings, or hum along with a tune,
or enter a conversation when asked, they are living in response. Generators are designed to wait,
trusting thatlifewill come to them.Theysimplyrespond from the moment theygetout ofbed in
the morning until they fall back into bed at night. A revolution ofGenerators living completely
through response could change the frequency on the planetfrom frustration to satisfaction.This is
why the Generator's mysticalpath and contribution to humanityis to wake up their Sacral,and to
live surrendered to its subjective truth.
Itis helpfulfor the other threeTypes to understand thatonce aGeneratorhas committed to atask
or a direction, they cannot quickly change gears.To a Manifestor, the Generator feels slow and
ponderous,and a Projector offeringguidance mayfeel like the Generatoris notlistening. Onlyby
beingaskedagain,sotheycanrespond,areGeneratorsable todisconnectfromwhere theyareinthe
moment,and reconnect to somethingdifferent.When asked so theycanrespond,there is aclearer,
more straightforward, and productive exchange betweenTypes. Learning to ask Generators good
'yes or no'questions makes all the difference.
Halfofthebattlefor Generatorsis accepting thefact that theycannotmanifest theirideas for their
ownlife.Theyneed to give up anypictures that their minds have aboutwhat theirlife'shouldlook
like.'Desires andfantasies, usuallybased on comparisons coming through their open centers,push
them into actions intended to force those dreams into reality. Such initiating merely meets with
resistance,however,notsatisfaction.Frustrationis the guidepost thatreminds Generators to return
to theirownone-of-a-kindresponsive life.
126 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
The following narrative about a Generator and a Manifestor illustrates the difference between
responding and initiating.You will recognize their Strategy by the roles they play.The setting is a
dustywestern town, and sittinginfront ofhis office is the sheriff.The townspeople are in an uproar
because theyhave heard that agunslingeris on hiswayto town. Everyone tries to get the sheriffto
move,to do somethingtoprotectthem.Thesheriffjustsitsandwaits.Thegunslingerarrivesin town,
dismounts,walks into the middle ofthe street and informs the sheriffofhis intentions.The sheriff
responds andsteps awayfrom hisofficeand into the streettoface him.Thegunslingerdraws hisgun
and the sheriff, empowered bywaiting, shoots him dead.The moral ofthe storyis that Generators
whowaituntil theyare fully empowered and perfectlyclearin their response,willfind their actions
arewell-timed- and rightontarget.
GENERATORS WITH EMOTIONAL AUTHORITY
Emotional Authority adds another dimension to the waiting game for Generators. Their warm,
passionate energy has enormous value to others, which gives their waiting a subtle element of
seduction, and allows Generators to shape the outcome ofan offer on their own terms. No one
has the right to gainimmediate access to theirenergy.Theybecome theirownworstenemyifthey
succumb to impatience byhurrying the process,initiating,acceptingless than theyshould have,or
jumpingintoacommitmentprematurely.A fewhandyphrasesthatgive them time towaitouttheir

mighttake this as arejectionofthe proposal,butifitis correctfor bothparties,theirauraswillpull

Emotional definition need not be a frustrating detour to living. For Generators, following their

to uncover all the important things thatwould otherwise be missed.And sometimes the 'yes'ends

Stayingwith thewave as it cycles,and not rushing into decisions,adds depth to one's life.In order

GENERATOR CHILDREN
When Generator children answerwith their Sacralvoice ofah huh or uhn-uh, they are often told
this is not polite.They are forced to stop making sounds and to speakwith words and sentences
instead. When this happens, the doorway to their Sacral truth closes, and they are cut offfrom
developingself-esteemandself-love.Parents mustlearnto respectandencouragethe Sacralsounds
oftheir children. Generator children are designed to be busyand active until their Sacral energyis
used up,and theyfall into bed exhausted.Forcing them to take naps before theyare tiredwill meet
resistanceandfrustration onbothsides.Awareandunderstandingparentscandevelopsensitivityto
the energyand innerrhythms oftheir Generator child.
RECOGNIZING NOT-SELF GENERATOR BEHAVIORS
Generators living as Manifestors are easilyrecognized bytheirfrustrated,unfulfilled state ofbeing.
From childhood on, Generators have been told to "go out there and make it happen." When
Generators initiate, however, the energy gets stuck and can't move forward. To compensate, the
mind pushes themonahead orbecomes attached to the outcomes theythinktheywant.Instead of
finding satisfaction,theycan'tevenfinishwhattheystart.Theyend up exhaustingtheirenergywith
no satisfaction,theirworkhas no meaning,and their relationships don't measure up or bring them
pleasure - life doesn'tworkfor them.This scenario is also why they are great quitters, and yet, the
lastthing thatoccurs to them is towait to respond.
Many Generators have been conditioned since birth to suppress or deny their primal sounds, and
instead rely on the mind's open center not-self commentaries to guide them. Generators have
become comfortablelivingtheirunfulfilling not-selflives,which makes itdifficultfor them to now
revive orreconnect to their Sacralresponse.Theyare fearful ofthe possibilitythat theymay not be
able to hear their response, aswellas fearful ofthe change response mightbring.Theyhave no real
ideawhatlifelivedastheirtrueselfmaybelike.Mteryearsofpracticingvegetarianism,forinstance,
theymight hear their Sacralrespond ah huh to a steak!
Generators need to knowthat there is atimefor everythingiftheywait,and that theycanrespond
to anything as long as it is coming toward them. For example, their minds can't determine what
theywantto eat.Theyneed to be asked orto hearwhatis on the menu so theycanrespond.This is
especiallyimportantforbeginners.Askingthemselvesquestions,talkingto themselvesinthemirror
or responding to questions they have written down, is not the same as responding to something
coming toward them from the outside. These shortcuts will not bring Generators to their inner
truth.To beeffective,anotherpersonis needed to askthe clarifYingquestions.
The underlying question for a Generator is "Will I be Asked?" Or, "IfI wait to be asked, will
anything ever happen?" Understanding the beauty oftheir open and enveloping aura, which is
designed to drawthe questionfrom others,allows them towatchand wait- and relaxintoliving.

• Fearofthe unknown.

at thecomplexnature oftheir unique configuration.
Projectors have a general openness to life, combined with an aura that penetrates the energy of
others so they can absorb it, and energetically taste it.With their capacity to see the big picture,
recognize the talents and gifts ofothers,and bringpeople together, theymakeexceptionaladvisors,
administrators, networkers and natural mediators.Projectors can be gifted organizers, and masters
at understanding how to maximize energy and resources as they see things that others often miss.

Recognition is the Projector's key to understanding the way their Strategy connects them to
their Authority and the world. In some ways, recognition is to Projectors what responding is
to Generators.Their powers ofstrategic recognition provide them with their boundaries,which
they maintain by being selective when accepting invitations. Both the Projector's ability to
recognize what is available to them from others, and the need for their own unique gifts to be
properlyrecognized byothers,arepartofthespecificwaytheirauras aredesigned to connect.The
Projector aura is an I-am-open-to-an-invitation field that draws people in and out oftheir lives
byprovokinginvitations from them. Recognition,accompanied byaformal invitation,is theway
the otherTypes honor and empowerProjectors.
As with Generators, waiting is a quality of the Projector's Strategy, however the clarity of
their answer is not as immediately accessible as a Sacral response. To further analyze these
subtle differences, we have divided Projectors into three basic categories based on the chart
configurations illustrated on the following page.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 131
THE THREE CATEGORIES OF PROJECTORS
MENTAL PROJECTORS
Mental Projectors are defined by any combination ofdefined Head,Ajna, and
Throat Centers, but have no definition below theThroat Center.They have an
opendesign and adeep relianceon their mind.Theytap into theirenvironment
and read its transient energies through all oftheir undefined Centers. Mental
ProjectorsarethearchetypeofOuterAuthority,whichistosayonewhoprovides
valuedinformationand guidancefor others,and itis difficultfor them to accept
thefact thattheirstrongandagile mindscannotbetheirpersonalAuthority.For
Mental Projectors to reach clarity in decision-making, it is helpful to bounce
things offothers so they can hear it themselves.Their surroundings can have a definite influence on
their decision-making process, so it is also important that they get a sense ofhow the environment
is affecting them.With so much oftheir design open and vulnerable to conditioning,understanding
howothersimpactthemcanproveaninvaluabletool.Throughstudyingotherpeople'sdesigns,Mental
Projectors begin to understand the similarities and differences in their own process.As theybecome
awakeand aware,theirownstrategybegins toworkfor them.
ENERGY PROJECTORS
EnergyProjectorshaveoneormore motors,exceptthe SacralCenter,definedin
theirdesign.Theyneed to paycloseattention to theguidanceoftheirAuthority,
beingextravigilantfor invitations from peoplewho want access to their energy
just to fill a vacant position or get a job done. Even though these Projectors
are under pressure to discharge built-up energy from the motors defined, it is
essential theyexpend it eitherbydoingsomething theyenjoy,orbydoingwhat
theyhavebeenrecognizedforandproperlyinvitedtodo.Thisextraenergycreates
two temptations for Projectors.Thefirst isinitiatingan actionjust to release the
pressure.The second is unwittingly committing to an activitywhereby theybecome alaborer, rather
than the onewho canseehowto directaprocess towardsgreaterefficiencyandsuccess.

132
ALL PROJECTORS
ThedilemmaforallProjectorsiswaitingfortheinvitation.Theywanttobe,andmustbe,recognized
and invited in order to fulfill their purpose as administrators and guides. Personal success for
Projectors is dependent on having energetically healthy people aournd them who acknowledge
their Projectorskills,and offerthem theirenergyresources toworkwith.
When not-self Projectors, eager for recognition of any kind, try to meet the expectations of
others and thus are recognized instead for who they are 'not', they can get confused and attach
themselves to anyone, even someone who is detrimental to them. Healthy Projectors are those
who avoid this trap by recognizing themselves, and understanding their own limitations.When
they are no longer dependent on external sources for affirmation ofany kind, the true Projector
gift ofrecognition is returned to its rightful and properlyfunctioning place in their Strategy.
The most basicbutessentialfunction ofrecognitionfor Projectors relates to choosingpeople to be
in their inner circle,peoplewho will keep them aligned with their own path and purpose. Because
Projectors are designed to penetrate other's centers so deeply, and because theycannot fulfill their
purposewithoutaccess to theenergyand resourcesofotherpeople,Projectors need to knowwho is
rightfor them;who recognizes orsees themforwho theytrulyare.
This applies to the ways they connect to the wider community as well. For example, ifyou are
a skilled classical guitarist, you wouldn't book a concert to entertain a crowd expecting to dance
to rock n' roll, unless your personal gifts include converting the casual listener to classical guitar
musicand you have beeninvitedto dojustthat.Without the invitation,youwould bewastingyour
precious Projector gifts and leave the placewithout recognition, embittered by the experience. No
amountofmoneycould buyorreplacewhatyouwouldlose.
othing boosts the mood ofProjectors like being recognized, or drops them faster into a state of
bitternesswhen they are not.When Projectors try to get others to see them, they are perceived as
needy and demanding. OtherTypes feel this 'need'for recognition and resist it. By initiating and
inviting themselves, Projectors are giving their inherent power to the other person, which places
them at a huge disadvantage.This often happens in family relationships where theyhave not been
seenasthemselvesfromthebeginning.Takingtheirpowerbackisdifficultatfirst;itinvolvesshifting
theirfocus, standingsecurelygrounded in awareness oftheirowngifts,andwaitinguntil theirown
auric message is clearlyreceived.This allows the people around them to recognize and invite their
realgifts into the relationship,and changes the basisfor the relationship as awhole.

theyget to utilizeitspotentialto benefitothersfor aslongas thatinvitationlasts.
Waiting for the invitation has specific qualities to it that are subtly different from the waiting
Strategy ofGenerators, who wait for their life to be directed from moment to moment through
response. Projectors are waiting for what is best described as a more formal, long-term invitation.
Theyarewaitingfor 'investors'to recognize,request and empower their special skills - in exchange
for ample compensation! That invitation offers the Projector access to the investor's initiating and
generating energy resources. This is what the Projector lives for, how their genius is empowered,
and how theywill experience the success theyare here to achieve in theirlifetime.The relationship

Investorinvitationsgenerally,butnotexclusively,applyto thefourmajordecisionsonemakesinlife:
the invitation to love, to a career, to bondwith others, and to a place to live. Once an invitation is
receivedandaccepted,Projectors canuse alltheskills attheirdisposal,within theparameters setby

All invitations come with an expiration date. Ifthe invitation has lost its energy or excitement, it
is possible that the invitation has been withdrawn, or perhaps the job is complete but no one has
noticed. The Projector may feel that things just aren't working anymore, such as money, interest,
support,oradequate time are no longeravailable.At this point,itis helpful to discuss the situation

with the investor in order to clarifY the status ofthe invitation. Once aligned in their own power,
Projectors canlet theirauras do the talking.Theirsilentwaitingis the mosteffectiveway to elicit
correct invitations from others. Gradually, the people and invitations that were not based on
recognitionwill slowlyfall away.IfProjectors trust in the silent magicoftheirchemistry,there is
no need to do the inviting themselves; opportunitieswill come to them.
When Projectors understand the sanctity oftheir aura, theywill nurture and protect it.This begins

PROJECTORS WITH EMOTIONAL AUTHORITY
Projectors have beenwaitingsolongfor invitations thateven thosewith emotionaldefinition have
a tendency to jump at the first opportunity. Unfortunately, what appears to be a great invitation
when they are up in theirwave can turn into ahorrible commitmentwhen theyare down in their
wave. We are all conditioned to be polite and answer spontaneouslywhen someone invites us to
accept ajob,orattend an event.It's also easyfor emotionalProjectors to get hooked into someone
else's energyfield,which adds to the confusion.Theyneed towait,discuss it,wait,and discuss ityet
again.Bywaitingfor claritytheymay,infact,receiveanevenmore deliciousinvitation.The strategy
for emotional Projectors is simply to request a day or two to think it over.Ifthey're still not clear
by then, theyshould unashamedlyaskfor more time and/or clarification ofthe details. Part ofthe
experimentfor them is to observehowand iftheirauricfield draws the otherperson backagain to
renew the invitationwhile they themselves arewaitingfor clarity.
PROJECTORS IN RELATIONSHIPS
For a relationship to work, Projectors must be recognized, formally invited into it, and given an
essential role in its unfolding. Projectors who are neither appreciated nor recognized are stuck in
a dependent and weak position,which leaves them feeling bitter. Life and relationships lose their
sweetness.The best advice,aswith all types,is to enterrelationships correctlyfrom the beginning.
PROJECTOR CHILDREN

knowwhentheyarerecognizedbyothers,and torecognizewhatacorrectinvitationfeelslike,places
them on the trackto success.This is all theencouragement theyneed to practice their Strategyand
Authority,and appreciate theiruniqueness as aProjector.
SECTION FOUR: THE FOUR TYPES AND STRATEGIES, LIVING OUR DESIGN 135
Parents who invite and recognize their Projector children give them a chance to develop, express
and feel the power ofbeingwho they trulyare. Childrenwho are taught to recognize and waitfor
thecorrectreceptiveaudiencegrowup tobecorrectasadults,andwheninvitedto do so,canexpress
theirgiftswith clarityand authenticityin theworld.
EmotionalProjectorchildren must also be invited,butwithout anypressure being placed on them
to make a decision in the moment.This gives them a chance to get in touch with their emotional
wave.When they are in a community that recognizes them, theywill grow and thrive. Ifthey are
putunderpressure to acceptinvitations ormake decisions beforetheyhave achance to process and
knowwhatis rightfor them, theycaneasilyend up confused,bitterand unsuccessful.
PROJECTOR RECOGNITION AND THE NOT-SELF
WhenProjector'shearabouttheirType,thereisanimmediateresonancewiththekeyword'invitation.'
They suddenly realize that they have been the ones doing the inviting! In their restlessness and
insecurity, they treated others the way they themselves were meant to be treated, which naturally
met with resistance. Mter a lifetime of feeling unrecognized and uninvited, Projectors become
deeplypessimistic aboutpeople showingagenuine interestin them.
When Projectors feel starved for energy, theywill compromise and settle for an invitation to the
wrongenergyexchange.Accurate recognition and aproperinvitation is what sets a Projector'gifts
in motion and increases their value to others. For example,when someone says to an emotionally
defined Projector,"I love thewayyou processyourdecisions throughyourfeelings,"theyknow the
person sees them.Thisgives the Projectoraccess to clean energyand,potentially,areceptiveearfor
theirinsightfulguidance and advice.
Once a proper invitation is completed or withdrawn, the Projector'sjob is complete. Because the
energytheywerecommittedtomanagingis nolongeravailableto them,however,theirnot-selfmay
panicandinterferewiththeirlettinggoand movingon.Theirnot-selfhas noconfidencein Strategy
or their Projector auric invitation field,which can lead to them holding onto people, not knowing
when enough is enough,trying to prove themselves,acceptingawrong invitation to beginwith,or
beingfearful ofnot beinginvited again.
Itis through understanding others that Projectors arrive at aclear understanding ofthemselves.If
their agenda for reaching out to people comes with the expectation that theywill get attention or
recognition, however, theywill meetwith resistance. Like all types, they need to be aware oftheir
underlyingagendaand hidden expectations.
Projectors have avery strong intellect.Theylike to study and take in information. Because ofthis,
they tend to have a deeply conditioned mind that tries to control their lives and circumstances
through the not-selfstrategies oftheiropencenters.Theytend tofeel theywill notget thelifethey
reallywant,so theycompromise in their relationships andjobs bysettlingforwhat theythinkthey
canget. Settlingis ahuge problemfor the Projector,especiallywhen there are bills to pay.

HEALTHY SLEEP HABITS FOR PROJECTORS
ItisbestforProjectors,withtheiropenSacralCenter,togo tobedbeforetheyfeeltotallyexhausted.
Bylying down or relaxing as much as an hour before they would like to be asleep, theygive their

SIGNATURE GOAL: SUCCESS
Success dispels bitterness and maximizes the Projector's sense of well-being. Recognizing the
uniquenessandpotentialinothers,andguidingthembyaskingtherightquestionswithoutaper onal

and awakening someone to their own unique truth. Success also means getting to a place within
where being a non-energy type is no longer an issue. Waiting for a respectful, formal invitation,
accompanied bytheappropriaterewards andenergyresources,is the Projector's Strategyfor thebig

be authentic,aware and open to the Reflector's assessmentorjudgment.
Manifestors, Generators and Projectors are solar Types, meaning their purpose 'shines' through
them. As the onlylunarType, the Reflector is designed to operate as a lunar reflection oftlle sun's

The chemistryofReflectors'nine undefined centers can sample as well as magnify the frequencies
ofeverything and everyone in their environment,giving them the potential to taste or sensewhat
is really happening in a way no one else can.The unique potential oftheir openness is to reflect
everything around them with perfect equanimity, which makes their openness an exceptional
window to wisdom. Even with all nine centers open, however, Reflectors are not more vulnerable
to conditioning than the otherTypes. Reflectors are, in fact, the most resilient ofthe four Types,
protected by an aura that is described as resistant and sampling.This unusual aura allows them to

conform, their auras will protect them from identifying with anything that they take in through
their openness.Theycan become wise about the process, and simplyremain wide open to what is

PLACE Is KEY To THE REFLECTOR'S HAPPINESS
Unique to Reflectors is their need to find their place in the heartofthe community,or the center
ofthe group, so they can freely sample and reflect auric information from those around them.
It is their rightful place, and where they need to be to fulfill their purpose.They are here to be
acceptingofothers,to reflect the truth,and to teach the restofus that mostoftenwhatwejudge
as good or bad in the world isjusta revelation ofour diversity.To do this, Reflectors must move
freely in theirenvironmentoramongst the participants in agathering,and also must also be free
to leave when they realize that their reflections will not be solicited.They operate by a different
setofrules then the otherTypes.Reflectors trulymarch to adifferentdrummer,and to knowthat
is to honor and respect their place and purpose. Finding the right environmentwithin the right
community to call home, and how they go about that, is one ofthe most important decisions
Reflectors face. With their undefined G Center it's helpful for them to know that people with
defined G Centers are here to initiate them; to introduce them to new people and places. Once
Reflectors have beenintroduced,itis theirjob to be discerning.When someone introduces them
to a new place or person they then come to love, Reflectors should avoid a not-selftendency to
become dependentor attached to the personwho took them there.
IfReflectors remain in an unhealthy environment for any length oftime, they may take on that
energy and get sick themselves, or be drained oftheir vitality. It's essential for Reflectors to have
a dedicated, creative space oftheir own; a place where they can take time alone to shake offthe
conditioningtheyareexposed to onadailybasis.Iftheydon't,theycaneasilybecomedependenton
the energies ofthose around them,whichis agood reason to selectwith care the people theyallow

140 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
REFLECTOR STRATEGY: WAITING THROUGH
THE 28 DAY LUNAR CYCLE
Reflectors have no fixed definition in their chart and no dependable source ofpersonalAuthority.
Thereis noreliablesourceofyesornoinsidethem toguidetheminmakingmajordecisionsin their
life. The Reflector's Strategy is to connect to the Lunar cycle, the Moon's approximately 28-day
trip around the Mandala,which encompasses all 64 gates in the whee1.This reliable and repeating
pattern provides Reflectors with a sense ofconsistency comparable to, but not the same as, having
afixed definition.
Reflectors need to be initiated for the big decisions in life.Their Lunar Cycle (decision-making
process) beginswhenanimportantofferhasbeenmadeoraninvitationextendedto thembyothers.
They cannot initiate themselves. As they progress toward clarity through the Lunar cycle, their
Reflector perceptionswill change. During this time, theywillwant to talkwith others,not to seek
advice but to articulate their own thoughts and hear their own potential truth.The qualityoftheir
associations and the way their aura filters the world around them over time refines their decision.
Theyneed to be encouraged to take their time,and notallow themselves to be pressuredorrushed.
Theywillknowsuddenly,deep inside,ifthe offerwas rightfor them ornot.Iftheyhavecompleted
the Lunar cycle however, and they are still not clear, it is advisable to wait for clarity to arrive,
keepingin mind itmaytake more than onecycle.
Although this lunar basis for decision-making is unique to Reflectors, allTypes can benefit from
understanding the Moon's repeating but transitory influence on their lives. Following the way the
Lunarcycle connects to your own chartis afascinating process. (Examples ofmapping acomplete
Lunarcycle and atransitconnection chartare included atthe end ofthis section.)

When Reflectors are constantly rushed into decisions, or are not secure in their decision-making
process,theyrun the riskofbecoming dependent on thosewho have areliable personalAuthority.
They then allow their partners to make decisions for them, to determine their mode of sexual
expression, their eating and sleeping habits, their occupation,where to live and their place in the
family. Reflectors can be at the mercy ofthe people around them. Ifthey allow themselves to be
dominated by not-selforiented people, theywill amplifY that distortion in their energy field and
feel deeplydisappointed bytheirownexperienceoflife.Thereare no moment-to-momentrulesfor

a Reflector to follow, only the authority ofwaiting out the Lunar cycle so they can be clearwhen
making a decision. Such a process is foreign to the otherTypes, and when not understood it can
bring discord into the relationship and suffering to the Reflector. Reflectors that allow themselves
to berushed and pressured arelikelyto have health problems laterinlife.
For the Reflector, a relationship is of greatest value when it is fertile and productive. Most
Reflectorslovehavingchildrenaround them,as theybringaninnocentand consistentconnection
to the Reflector's design.Theyenjoyrelatingwith and'reflecting'peoplewho share their awe and
wonder for life.It is often difficult for Reflectors to cut the apron strings when it comes time to
lettheir childrengo.
REFLECTOR CHILDREN
When parents learn the Lunar pattern ofReflector children, they can encourage them to grow
according to their personal rhythm. It's very important not to rush a Reflector child, but rather
to allow them to develop at their own pace. Over time, the children will learn to be patient and
comfortable with waiting through their Lunar cycle before making any major decisions. It is
important that parents help these children find a supportive learning environment with teachers
who will let them develop naturally. Reflector children need to be actively involved in a learning
community, but not in the usual expectation-laden way. As free spirits who operate by a different
setofrules,theywillabsorb and processinformation differently. Rememberthat Reflectorchildren
take in and reflect back exactlywhat is going on in the family and the classroom. A thriving and
healthyReflectorchildorasickandsad Reflectorchildsaysalotaboutthestateoftheenvironment.
Reflector children,like Reflector adults, need their own space so they can withdraw and be alone
when they need to be away from others. With patient practice, parents can teach their child to
protectthemselves from takinginoractingon the painofothers,even though theywillfeel it.
THE REFLECTOR QUESTION AND
THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT-SELF BEHAVIORS
The Reflector's deepest fear is invisibility, ofnot being included in a participatoryway.To assuage
thatfear, even though conditioning does not'stick'to their aura,they maygive in to the typical not
selfbehaviors simply to gain attention.When Reflectors do not understand their auras, and natural
attunementto therhythms ofthe cosmos,theycan becomeconfusedand overcomebythemotorized

are dejected bythe resistance theymeetin tryingto initiate ormanifest.Insteadofbeingthe hub ofa

Thefears Reflectors dealwithwhen theybegin to live as themselves are:

not-selfinteractionsandrelationships.Reflectorsliveformomentswhentheycansampledifference,
and experience awe and wonder. By remaining unattached and unidentified with energies in a
wise way, their sampling auras are rewarded by surprises. Surprise for a Reflector can mean being
included as aparticipant and no longer merelyan observer.Reflectors are enlivened orempowered
wheninitiated,askedorinvitedto mirrorthedifferencetheysee,ortosharewhattheyseeis needed.
Since they notice who is operating correctly according to Type, they are here to be a signpost for
those ready to break the pattern ofthe illusion and become their unique, authentic SelfThis is a
Reflector's specialcontribution.To awaken someone to the possibilityand promiseofexperiencing
theirlife as themselves is agreatsource ofsurprise and delightfor the Reflector.

MAPPING A LUNAR CYCLE

REFLECTOR MANDALA AND BODyGRAPH
The Reflector BodyGraph in the Mandala above has manygate activations, or dormant, hanging
gates. Each one is a receptor seeking its harmonic gate at the other end ofthe channel. As the
Moonmovescounter-clockwisethrough the64gates oftheI'Ching(approximatelyevery28 days),
transiting planets will form harmonic connections to the Reflector's hanging gates, thus creating
temporarydefinitions.Althougheachdefinitioncreatedmaylastonlyhalfaday,overtimeitbecomes
partofaconsistentmonthlypatternthatprovides areliableframeworkfor the Reflector's decision
making process. (See the graph that follows.) This Lunar cycle's pattern is the Reflector's personal
way ofreflecting the Moon's frequency on Earth, and supports and defines the Reflector's innate
sense ofselfA Reflector's identityis not revealed on amoment-to-moment basis,butthrough the
rhythm and flow ofthefull Lunarcycle.
144
FOLLOWING A LUNAR CYCLE THROUGH THE GATES
As the Lunar cycle brings definition to the Reflector's chart on the previous page, he will sample
the energyfrequencies and definition ofaProjector,Manifestor and Generator, in addition to th~t
ofaReflector.Each time that the moon moves into anewgate,there is thepotentialfor definition.
Themoon takes approximately28 days togo aroundtheearth,however,ittakes about30days togo
from full moon to the nextfull moon.
Havingtemporarydefinitiondoesn'tmeanReflectorsbecomeGenerators,ManifestorsorProjectors,
but they can sample those particular energies. Each Reflector's Lunar cycle is unique, and will be
the same every28 days.

ENERGY DYNAMICS
As we continue to explore the differentways inwhichwe are subject to conditioning,we come to the
FiveDefinitions,which give us anotherconditioningelementthat is in competitionwith our true-self
Remember,whenwearesurrenderedtoourForm'sintelligencebyfollowingourStrategyandAuthority,
we bypass all conditioning elements except as sources ofinformation and potentialwisdom.The five
ways inwhich Definitionis expressedinaBodyGraph,and experiencedinourlife,are:
• NODEFINITION-aReflectorwithnocentersdefined(approximately2percentofthepopulation).
• SINGLE DEFINITION - alldefinedchannels and definedcentersinthe designareconnectedin
one continuous flow (approximately41 percentofthe population).
• S IMPLE-SPLIT DEFINITiON - two separate areas ofdefinition thatare notconnected to each
other (approximately46 percentofthe population).
• TRIPLE-SPLIT DEFINITION - threeseparateareasofdefinition thatare notconnected to each
other (approximately11 percentofthe population).
• QUADRUPLE-SPLIT DEFINITION - four separateareasofdefinition thatare notconnectedto
each other (approximately0.5 percentofthe population).
SPLITS AND How WE EXPERIENCE THEM
A splitinadesignmeansalldefinedchannelsandcentersarenotcontinuouslyconnectedwithinthe

SECTION FIVE: THE FIVE DEFINITIONS, ENERGY DYNAMICS 151
EXAMPLE OF DEFINITION
(51MPLE-5PLlT)
When we have a design with a simple-split,for instance, the single gate or gates that bridge the
splitbecome theprimaryconditioningforces in the life.In this illustration,the defined Ajnaand
Throat Centers are split offfrom the defined Splenic, G, Sacral, Root and Solar Plexus Centers
with Gate 16, 8 or 20 needed to
Personafity bridge the split. Let's concentrate
49.4 on Gate 16 for this example.This
23.6 • 4.4 person has Gate 48, but Gate 16
52.6 41240 59.6 at the other end of the channel
is missing. Throat Center Gate
30.5 49.6
GATE 16 16, therefore, becomes a bridge
29.5 4.6
or theme this person seeks. This
~ 9.1 41.4
means shewill naturallymeetlots
1.1 58.3
if' of people with Gate 16 because
57.3 .. 5.1
Gate 48 is always looking for its
1.6 ..34.5
'harmonic gate.' Every gate has a
2.6· 2.4 harmonic partner located at the
48.5 other end of the channel, and
34.3 the two gates coming together
literally spark each other to create
life force energy as a quantum of
the two gates.
Gate 48 is the Gate ofDepth; Gate 16 is the Gate ofSkills. For this person's depth to express
itselfthrough theThroatCenter,she needs Gate 16.Shemayneverfeel sheis skillfulenough,and
willgo out into the world looking for ways to develop her skills.In fact, she is designed to meet
peoplewith Gate 16who can skillfullyexpress herdepthwhile theyworkwith her.
Gate 8,TheGateofContribution,isalso abridge (missinggate),and this candriveher to thinkshe
has to make a contribution. In reality,it is her not-selfthat is trying to fill the mis-perceivedvoid.
Shewants to literallybecome that missingpiece, and ends up making mental decisions to attempt
to dojust that.With a SplitDefinition,onewill generallyfeel alackofwholeness until the splitis
bridged through arelationship with another person.Forgood or bad,this dynamic is the basis for
manyrelationships.
Inawidesplit,whichmeansittakesanentirechannelormultiplegates to bridgethe differentareas
ofdefinition, one will experience the split as being the other person's problem, or from a not-self
perspective,the otherpersonis the causeofthe problem.This can engenderblame and victimhood
thatare not true.On the otherhand,there is apotentialforwisdom in awide splitifone uses itas
an opportunityto become an unattached,objectiveobserverofothers,and does notgetlockedinto
the blamegame.Onceyou stop pursuingand identifyingwith the bridge inyoursplit,you begin to
realize how important the people are who actually do bridge it.There have been many successful
partnerships formed by two individuals bridging an important aspect in each other's design such
152 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
asJohn Lennon (Gate 48) and PaulMcCartney (Gate 16). Seeinghowsplits operate in ahealthy
way helps us to understand one ofthe ways we are designed to be together in relationship. In this
respect,saying"youcompleteme"isbothprofoundand true.Wewillonlyhavehealthyandeffective
relationships,however,when theyare entered into correctlythrough Strategyand Authority.
There is a hierachy to conditioning that depends on the type ofsplit definition.The conditioned
not-selfmind will focus on the open gates, channels or centers to formulate its decision-making
strategy,basedupon the specificdefinition. Fora Simple-SplitDefinition,the bridginggate(s) that
connect the two definitions is the most powerful conditioning elementinyour design,followed by
thecenters.IfyouareaTriple-Split,undefinedcentersare themostpowerfulconditioningelements
inyourdesign,and then the bridginggates/channels.ForaC2!.tadruple-Split,the bridginggates are
again the mostpowerfulconditioningelements,and then the undefinedcenter.
Initiatingwheninappropriate,lackofpatience,impulsive action or premature speech are the biggest
problemsfor splitswhen theydon'ttake time tofollowtheirStrategyandAuthority.Thosewith Split
Definitions require more time to fully take in, process and digest information, simplybecause the
separatepiecesoftheirdefinitionare notconnected.Untiltheseparatedefinitionsareconnected,all
Split Definitions mayfeel uncomfortable,orincomplete,and unable to make cleardecisions.They
must take their time, be patient, and wait for a sense ofwholeness to happen. Seekingwholeness
with aspecificpartnerbyinitiating,rather thanwaiting,is anot-selfactivity.Ifyou have asplit,you
are designed to have others naturallybridgeyoursplit(s) as you move throughyourlife daybyday.
Letyour Strategyand Authoritydo theworkforyou.
This digestion and assimilation process is aided by spending time in public places where you will
be provided with neutral bridging gates by others.The bestway to bridge a split,when making a
difficult or important decision, is to make use ofa public place where you can still be alone, such
as a bookstore, coffee shop or walking in a shopping mall.These public melting pots ofdesigns
will help provide neutral auras, and neutral conditioning, to assist you in the assimilation process.
The bridging available from a public place provides you with new perspectives as you ponder the
decision,whereas constantly beingwith friends or partners when making a decision limits you to
theways theirdesigns consistentlyconnect to and conditionyours.
Strategyand Authoritywill protectyou from the potential traps setup byyour splits,and you will
become more peaceful and less anxious about getting your splits resolved.Take your walk in the
world. Relax, surrender, and live from within your own personal integrity through Strategy and
Authority, and the bridgingwill take care ofitselfThe most important things to remember ifyou
have a split definition ofany kind are to give yourselftime to process information, and to trust in
yourdesign to bringyouwhatyou need.

individuals need several bridges

elements for them are their 14.4
undefined centers. In Timothy's 10.6
design, the undefined Heart and 64.1
SolarPlexus Centers are the main • 47.4
conditioning elements. The gates 55.2
that bridge the splits are also
conditioning elements, but are
not as powerful as the undefined
centers. Triple-Splits are subject
to impatience and often act
prematurely. They can be seen as
driven, ambitious and assertive. It is healthy for those who have Triple or Qyadruple-Splits to

CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES
THE CIRCUIT BOARD OF THE LIFE FORCE
Circuitryexplores thewayenergycirculates through the channelswithin the BodyGraph.When
thecircuitsarediagrammedasillustrated,theBodyGraphresemblesacircuitboard.Understanding
circuitry opens the door to understanding the flow ofthe life force, and reveals the way all life
forms aredifferentiatedyetdesigned to connectto each other.Circuits are composedofchannels.
A channelis composed oftwo gates and connects two centers.The gates in achart are entryand
exit points for the flow ofenergy to and from the centers. Centers are the hubs that transform
and transmute thefrequency.Thefloworcirculationofenergythrough achannelislikeasparkof
life that establishes communication between two centers.This
basic form ofcommunication is called a"life force" because it
carries the potentialforgrowth andevolutionwithin theform.
Thisresultinglifeforcedefinitionisprojectedandcommunicated
through our auras, and influences or conditions those close to
us.Definitioninourchartbothdefinesourgiftsanddetermines
ourlimitationsforthedurationofourlife.Eachperson'soreach
form's life force is unique and distinguishable from all others.
Definition represents our reason for incarnating, and it must
be expressed through us authentically without the not-self
distortion ofconditioning.There are 36 channels and 64 gates
within the Rave BodyGraph. Circuitryties them togetherand
gives the bodygraph a solid infrastructure.This infrastructure
is composed of the Integration Channel and three Circuit
Groups that map the distinctly different yet interconnecting
routes orways energyflows between centers. Circuitrycreates
ageneral frameworkfor interpreting the chartofacomplexhuman being.Each channel,with its
two gates,adds its theme to thatframework.
THE INTEGRATION CHANNEL AND THE THREE CIRCUIT GROUPS
In SectionTwo we learned that pressure from the Head and Root Centers moves energy through
the BodyGraph toward theThroat Center for expression.As energyflows along the BodyGraph's
pathways,channelsandtheirgatesarebundledtogetherformingsixbasiccircuits,plusfouradditional
channelsthatareknown togetheras theIntegrationChannel.Thesixbasiccircuitsform three main
circuitgroups,The Individual Circuit Group,The Collective Circuit Group and theTribal Circuit
Group.TheIntegrationChannelisadistinctand unifiedfield ofenergy.Whenviewed through the
context ofcircuitry, the definition in a chart shows the ways our fundamental nature,values and
principles connect to,interactwithand impactothers.Itis oftenhere,in the realm ofcircuits and

The Integration Channel stands on its own alongside the three main circuit groups in the
infrastructure ofthe BodyGraph; it is the most complex system ofall the channels.This group of
four channels,which forms abackbone-like structure in the BodyGraph,serves as the keydefense
mechanismoftheform.Integrationis the corecomponentofthe individuationprocess,theprocess
ofdistinguishingourselffrom others.Withoutit,wecouldnothavedifferentiatedfrom ourprimate
ancestors.The Integration Channel fuels the evolutionary process ofhumanity person by person,
and contains thefull,activeexpressionofthe lifeforce oftheform.
With a super keynote of'self-empowerment,'the Integration Channel is focused entirely on self
preservation and empowering the individual nature, expression, knowing, direction/identity and
behavioroftheself ThesurvivaloftheIndividual,and thedrive tobeunique,isessentialto ensuring
the survivaloftheTribeand the Collective through mutation.
Thenaturalprimalreflexes builtintoIntegrationassureus thatwecantrustthelifethatlieswithin
us when it is empowered by response (Gate 34), guided by intuition (Gate 57), directed by the
correctbehavior(Gate 10) and manifestedin the now(Gate20).Whenexpressed as aunit,using
Integration's keynotes bychannel,itsays,"Ilove myselfand I empowermyselfbylisteningto my
intuition in the now." Or, "Through response I am intuitively equipped with the right behavior
to survive any circumstance in the now."Those with definition in the Integration Channel are
concerned with self-empowerment, and express themselves with a notable self-sufficiency and
self-assuredness that neither looks to nor easily accepts direction from others. They should be
allowed and encouraged to be self-sufficient.

keepingus alert,attuned to ourbodies and constantlyonguardfor anything
that might constitute a threat in our immediate environment. Gate 34 has
great power to engage in and sustain activity. Gate 57 operates on an inner sound/vibration level,

awareness process began its flowering within humanity. Intuition is rooted in Splenic awareness,
and arises instantaneously,free ofthe timeconstraints ofmentalandemotionalawareness.Inother
words, it is never what we think is good for us that will protect us, but rather how we intuitively
respond to the diversevibrations ofplaces orthe people around us in the moment.
Personal: In order to react clearly and quickly, or make those split second decisions needed to
literally save your life such as jumping out ofthe way ofa speeding car,you must be consistently
grounded in and connected to your body consciousness.This often means being highly selective
regarding the verbalinput ofothers,and always listeningwithyour right ear to hearwhat theyare
reallysaying.FollowingyourGenerator Strategyfrees upyourblendofSplenicintuitionand Sacral

that dares to disturb their realm ofwell-being, and can become defensive, ifnecessary, in order to

appreciate the gifts ofourspecies'growingpowers ofawareness.

Personal:TheenergyofChannel34-20is partoftheIntegration (self-empowerment) process,and
because you have the power to maintain activity over long periods oftime, it is essential that you
apply your energy to something you deeply love doing. Other people may envyyour manifesting

Interpersonal: Most people with charisma appear generally unavailable to others. As Individuals
with the potential to act or manifest in the moment, they often find themselves doing just that.
Their dilemma is that they can be so busy being busy they don't always recognize where guidance
maybe needed. Propermanifestingis ofenormous benefit to society; chaoticmanifestingis deeply
destructive.IfsomeonewithChannel34-20doesnothaveaccesstoguidancefromwithintheirown

THE CHANNEL OF PERFECTED FORM: S7 - 10
A Design ofSurvival
Channel: Integration (Creative Channel) ChannelType: Projected
The Channel ofPerfected Form links the Splenic Center to the G Center
through the Gate ofIntuitive Insight (57) and the Gate ofthe Behavior
ofthe Self(10).This is Integration's creative channel - the art ofsurvival.

. ,. .... species'abilityto survive,oneperson atatime.
" "
....
"".
"......
""" Background: Splenicawarenessisfocused primarilyonphysicalwell-being.
Channel 57-10 supports Gate 10's focus on how to interact with others
in order to perfect or assure the Individual's survival. The self-oriented
and potentially mutative behaviors ofthe Individual must survive in order to effect evolutionary
change within humanity as awhole. Individual behaviors that are unique, and perfectly adapt our
physical forms to surviving, exemplifY for others what it means to live fully in the moment. Gate
57 carries an acute acoustic sensitivity to the quality ofsounds in one's immediate environment.
Paying more attention to someone's tone ofvoice, rather than to the words spoken, automatically
connects ChannelS7-10 to ouroldestform ofawareness,an innate,spontaneous,intuitivewisdom
thatexistsoutsideofthoughts andemotions.This channelgives apersonarareclarityand abilityto
actspontaneouslyand appropriately to anythingperceived to be outoforderin theirenvironment.
Personal: As you let your deeply intuitive impulses guide your behaviors moment by moment,
you automaticallyrelease unfounded fears for the future, fears that can keep you from fully loving
yourselfand embracingyourlife.Youembodythepotentialto move through theworldexistentially
and unencumbered.This ability to'''thinkonyourfeet"spontaneouslyperfectsyourform, perfectly
ensuringyour survival in the now.There is abeautyinherent in this process that makes you happy
and fills you with joy.The spontaneity and nature ofyour creativity are quite different from the
creative process ofself-reflection which the mind enjoys, or the depth and diversity ofemotional
sensitivitythatcomesovertimethroughtheSolarPlexus.Bysimplylivingtruetoyourself,youcreate
something healthy and beautiful with your life. Such uniqueness attracts attention and impacts
people aroundyou asyourexampleinvites allofus to find thevalue oflivinglife as ourselves.
Interpersonal: Peoplewith the Channel ofPerfected Form are here to create what theylove, and
lovewhattheycreate.Recognitionis nottheirmotivation.Theyhave thecapacitytolove themselves

aforce for change in theworld, to bring mutation to theTribe and the Collective.The challenge is
to do sowithoutbeingrejected byeithergroup.
The Individual Circuit Group is the most complex of the three groups, and encompasses the
frequencies of all nine centers. It is oriented to the present moment with attention focused on
listening to the beat of its own drum, and its determination to follow its own direction. The
Individual's drive for uniqueness becomes aliving example that inspires or empowers or awakens
alatent potential in others. Mutation and empowerment, the keynotes associated with Individual
Circuitry,are at the heartofTheHumanDesign System,andofevolutionitselfFortheIndividual,
these keynotes imply a passion for being true to one's self,for thinking about and being uniquely
attuned to the present moment, and for living independent ofthe norm. Individuals,when their
knowing becomes clear,stand ready to embodyinspiration or differentiation,which is theirwayof
leadingbyexample.Theirgiftis recognizingthe mutative potentialineverythingandeveryone,and
the intuitive sense ofthepossibilityfor empoweringit.
Individualknowing isn't based on eitherprovenfacts orexperientiallearning,butrather on intuition
and/or the inspiration in the moment, which is why Individuals do not fit easily into society. It is
imperative,aswellas advantageous,thatIndividualslearn how to explain themselves from childhood
on.Theyneed tobeable to communicatewhattheyhearas inspirationin the moment,andwhatthey
knowinside to be true.This ability to explain facilitates their effectiveness as agents for change, and
easestheirpersonalfeelings ofbeingdifferent.
Individualityattracts attention,butIndividuals usually need and like to be leftalone to explore their
creative and melancholicinnerworld.Theycan become so caughtup in the moment that theyoften
appeardeafto thevoices ofexperience and reason.This is because theyare here to be true towhatis

position in the scheme ofthings,and to be ready to connectwith others in that preciousyetillusive

The Individual Circuit Group is composed of one major circuit, the Knowing Circuit, and one
minorcircuit,the CenteringCircuit.

The role ofthosewith definitionin the Knowing Circuitis to be empowered to live as themselves.
They empower others by being an individual example ofuniqueness.Theirway ofre-orderinglife,
reflected in their lifestyle, requires an audience as this is how they bring mutation into the world.
Theyneed to beobserved and to berecognized for theiruniqueness.
As the name ofthe circuit implies, it is the inspired and intuitive knowing ofeach moment, in
combination with the passionate or melancholic moodiness ofthe emotionalwave, that forms or
shapes the mutative impact the Individual's thoughts and behavior have on the rest of us. This
combinationiswhatmakes theIndividual'sunpredictable,creativeandunique momentbymoment
knowing empowering. Individuality is not about perfecting, mastering or organizing something.
Thatis the Collective's contribution.Individualityis aboutbirthingsomethingtotallynewwith the
potential to transform both the Individualand theworld around him.
The nature ofIndividualknowing is that itcomes and goes; it's there and it's not there.Individuals
don't knowuntiltheyknow.This knowing mightbe the answer,the right direction,oritmight not.
For Individual mutation to take hold universally, its value and validity must be tested over time.
The power to mutate,which is common to all channels and gates in the Individual Group Circuit,
is dependent on the on/off timing of this sudden knowing. Mutation operates in a pulse that
cannotbecontrolledoranticipated.Thefixed timingofthe conservative Collective Circuit,and the
hierarchical nature oftheTribal Circuit, keeps those circuit groups from engaging the inspiration
or mutation ofthe moment on their own. Both groups are obliged to look to the Individual as a
guiding force for change and transformation, helping them to avoid stasis and promoting their
evolutionaryprogress.This energyofthe new, however,leads the Collective and theTribe to place
Individualknowingundercarefulscrutiny,andleavesitopento criticism,whichiswhyitisessential
for allIndividuals to beable to explain themselves.
Individuals are often admired for their difference and envied for the attention they receive.Their
path is avulnerable, trulypersonal, and sometimes lonely one however, and Individuals may never
knowthat theyhave empowered someone else.
The Channels and Gates ofthe Knowing Circuit are discussed on the following pages.

The Channel of Inspiration links the G Center to the Throat Center

from a place ofauthentic personal authority that is safe from casual, or conditioning, influences.
Also essential is the recognition that your potential to inspire or empower others is actually a co
creation between your dedication to living your Individuality, which naturally attracts attention,
and others'recognition ofyour Individuality. Channel 1-8 lacks a built-in social adeptness, and it
is incumbent on you to develop the skills needed to effectively communicatewhatyou are here to

Gate 43 is the gate ofthe inner ear and only listens to its own unique inner voice. It transforms
rational inner knowing into Individual insight through spontaneous breakthrough to a new
perspective. Your knowing is not backed up by facts, however, and it can take fortitude to stand
behind and explain insights that seem freakish and completely outside ofthe Collective orTribal
norms. You have the capacity,when the timing is right, to mentally mold a unique and mutative

ways of thinking. Here your unique voice can finally say, "I know."What you know, or don't
know,will always attract the attention ofothers, but can also keep you on the outside looking
in. Insights that are potentially different, and transformative, require that you communicate
their essence clearly. Ifyour unique perspective is truly to be ofvalue to others,you must wait
for the right timing to speak, and explain it in a simple and accessible way. Ifyou don't, you
will be dismissed as afreak. It is also important thatyou speakonlywhatyou truly know. Over

the Gate ofthe Fighter (38) and the Gate ofthe Game Player (28).This

thatwould take one awayfrom the true self.
.
~
Background: Channel 38-28 brings the realization that elevates Homo
sapiensabovetheirprimitiveancestors,namelythereismoretolifethanjuststayingalive.Powered
by adrenalized Root Center energy, it is designed and equipped to seek and find a purpose, and
chooses to engage whatever gives meaning to existence, no matter how difficult the struggle.
Knowing howto struggle,andwhich struggles to engage in,is vital to the individuation process.
Personal:You have the stubborn determination to goyour ownwayinlife againsteven the most
overwhelmingodds,and to discovermeaning and apurposein the strugglesyou meetalongyour
uniquepath.Thereis nothing more satisfYingorhealthyforyou,when correct,than to stubbornly
stand up against the odds, or risk losing your sense ofsecurity, to fight for a cause you feel is
worthwhile. This form of struggle gives your life meaning, and your unique struggles become
exampleswhichprod and empowerothers,encouragingthem to strugglewith the need to pursue
their own individuation process and deeper life purpose.This is not always comfortable for you
orwell received by others, so rather than letting your mind choose your battles,you need to be
initiated through your Strategy and Authority into struggles that have value for you. Internal
stress builds when you cannot adequately explain or correctly live out the struggles you have
engaged in, and creates an excess ofenergy in the body. Regular exercise releases that pressure
so that it can move throughyou.This is notonlyhealthyfor you physically,but keeps the critical
connectionwith your intuitive awareness clear.
Interpersonal: Channel 38-28 is the driving mutative force compelling individuation towards its
ultimate expression of uniqueness. By stubbornly listening to their awareness in the now, those
with this channel bring mutation in the form ofa change ofdirection to the status quo. It is a
struggle to convincepeoplethatevolutionisanon-goingprocess,and oneworthstrugglingfor.But
the Channel ofStruggle is also the channel ofstubbornness, rooted in adrenalized energy and a
determination to live the individuatedlife to itsfullest.

Openness in Channel 22-12 is dependent on the ebb and flow of the

"when I am in the mood"orientation (emotionalwave) thatis notfocused on being either social
orfriendly.Individuals aregenerallylessinterestedin mating(Tribal) orsharing(Collective) than
they are in creating a receptive environment for their potential to bring a transformative new
awareness to the Collective and theTribe.The keyfor peoplewith this manifesting channel is to
wait until they feel like interacting socially. Ifforced into social situations when on the low ebb
oftheirwave, theycan be misunderstood, become angryand abrupt,and fail to empowerothers.
Such social failures, repeated over time,canlead to anti-social behaviors and isolation.

when to use your warmth and social skills to get people's attention, as well as how to get close
enough to them for yourwords to be acatalystfor lovingchange in theirlives.You use the quality

CIRCUIT CIRCUIT
COLLECTIVE CIRCUIT GROUP
SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARDOFTHE LiFE FORCE 199
The Collective Circuit Group is composed oftwo major circuits: the Understanding/logic Circuit
and the Sensing/abstract Circuit. Sharingis apart ofeverychannel and gate in the circuit.For the
Collective, sharing is akin to a drive or social obligation or need to tell you what they think,what
theyhaveexperienced,orwhattheyhavejudgedtobeofvalueornot.TheCollectiveisquicktoshare
opinions, dilemmas, solutions, criticism, expectations,fantasies, inventions, medical breakthroughs
and more,but the sharingis notpersonal.The Collective'sinherentlysocialorientation is objective,
impersonal and not necessarily reciprocal, and it is best to avoid taking the Collective's sharing
personallyno matterhowpersonalitfeels.
When indiscriminate sharing is expressed unbidden, driven by the not awake and unaware not
selfmind,itcan be a real nuisance.Forexample, those in crisiswill catch themselves unwittingly
sharing their situation with the clerk, the postman, or the person next to them at the bus stop.
Learning to wait to be asked to tell their story, or to give their opinion, is part of becoming
sensitive to the receptivity of others, and the key to sharing that is satisfYing, effective and
transformative. The mutuality and social nature ofhumanity, along with its need for harmony
or uniformity, is embedded in the Collective.This circuit group drives consciousness forward by
sharingwhathasbeenlearned throughexperimentationandexperience.Withitsfocus onsociety,
the Collective establishes what is good for the majority, as opposed to what is good for anyone
specificIndividual.Theidea that"whatisgoodfor oneisgoodfor allso staywith the patternthat
works"comesfrom this circuitgroup.Itmightbe terribleforyou personally,butsince itis for the
greater good you put up with it. Citizens ofa country for instance all share the same rules, the
same monetarycurrencyand the samepublic institutions.
Without theCollective'scollegiality, majorityrule and obligationto share,today'slarger societies
could notstand; theywould stillbe aclusteroffiefdoms competingfor the same resources.With
the Collective at the helm in recent history, the educated and privileged classes have entered the
eraofthe globalvillage.We have nearlyreached the ultimate potential and goalofthe Collective
Circuit Group.The Collective is suspicious ofthe nonconforming, impetuous Individual, and it
has never trusted the primitive demand for loyalty and the bargaining oftheTribe.
oticehowthe Collective CircuitGroup,viewed in theillustration,forms akind ofoutershelland
inner core which appears to both bind and buttress the BodyGraph.There is an unusual balance
and beautyin the opposition that existswithin this symmetry.Itis like a dance between yesterday
(Sensing/abstract) and tomorrow (Understanding/logic), between cycles and patterns, between
experiencingand proving.Lifeis builtonlogic,butlivedoutthrough theabstractcycles oflife.The
Sensing(abstract)CircuittriestocodifYexperienceormakesenseofthepast,andtheUnderstanding
Circuit (logic) tries to anticipate the future.The Collective is not as focused on the now moment,
which is the Individual's contribution. Outofthis circuitgroup's internal opposition,its seesawing
backand forth between past and future, comes its reputation for conservatism or maintaining the
status quo. "Ifit isn't broken, don't fix or change it." A level ofstability also emerges from this
circuit group that says with some pride,"I understand. I have the facts. It is like this."Or,"I have
experiencedit.I've beenthere,done that.Allyou have to do islisten to me." Logicis experimental;

The Understanding Circuit's theme is logic, acool-headed but seductive intelligence rooted in the
recognitionofpatterns through concentration on the details.Itanalyzes processes orformulas, and
challengeswhatisn'tworking.Thislogic allows one topredict,with acertainreliability,whatcan be
expected in thefuture from this orthatcourse ofaction.
Understanding takes place over time. It requires financial support, disciplined repetition, and the
development oftechniques or skills in order to refine and concretize a pattern, or to master and
perfect an aptitude, a plan or a formula. Togetherwith resources often obtained from outside the
circuit,logicrequirespracticetoreachitspotentialandmakeitscontribution,partofwhichis tolead
humanity safely into the future. As long as logic is free from conditioning,it can be used to share
theUnderstandingCircuit'sformulized hypotheses,its perspectives andprojecteddoubts about the
future,indeeplyinfluentialways.
Unlike its mirror, the abstract and experiential Sensing Circuit, the Understanding Circuit's logic
has no connection to the warmth and passion ofthe Solar Plexus.The Understanding Circuit is
oftenreferred toas the coolside ofthe chart,althoughlogic's stabilitybrings adeep satisfactionnot
available to the experiential side.There is collectivejoywhen we can see that one plus one always
equals two,and that thepatternis reliable.Whenlogicworks,itisaspleasurable as puttingthatlast

The Channels and Gates ofthe Logic Circuit are discussed on the following pages.

THE CHANNEL OF CONCENTRATION: 52 - 9
A DesignofDetermination
Circuit:Understanding ChannelType: Generated
The Channel ofConcentration links the Root Center to the Sacral Center
through the Gate ofStillness (52) and the Gate ofFocus (9).The 9th gate
is determined to maintain its focus on details and facts, while the 52nd
gate provides a passive fuel that powers this focus by keeping one still and
withdrawn from other distractions. Channel 52-9 creates a potential that
can befulfilled throughfocused attentionwhen oneis stillenough to a ess

Background: In order to improve something, and be ofservice to theworld,
logic must be able to sustain its focus and handle all ofthe details within a
pattern.The ChannelofConcentrationis aformat energy* thatcarries the qualities ofallofthe other
channels in the Understanding Circuit. When guided by Sacral response, it influences one's entire
designwithits energyto concentrateonandchallenge,correctorperfectanypattern,form oractivity

Gate 52 is energy under pressure that is focused on assessment, the raw power to concentrate.
There is a passive tension in this connection from the Root Center that is looking toward Gate 9
for an outlet. Once the 52nd gatefinds somethingit deeplyidentifieswith, somethingworthwhile

The Channel ofRhythm links the Sacral Center to the G Center through
the Gate ofFixedPatterns (5) and the Gate ofExtremes (15). Gate5holds
to its fixed habits and rituals, while Gate 15, with its love for humanity's
extremes,levels the playingfield byincorporatingsociety's diversityinto the

alllifeforms togetherfrom the single cellto complexhuman beings.

Background: The Channel of Rhythm is the cornerstone of all bio-life
processes, intimately connecting us through each response of the Sacral
Center to the flow of the natural world. It is subject to neither the
arrogance ofmind nor the highs and lows ofthe emotionalwave.TheMagneticMonopole,with
its singular attraction that holds everything together in the illusion ofseparateness,is located in
the G Center.The Collective magnetism ofthe 15thgate is aprojection bythe Monopole ofthe
universal(notpersonal)loveofhumanityand humanity'spotential;in thiswayitpullsusforward.
Its frequency magnetically draws everyone into its rhythm, as awayofimpersonally sharing the
flow oflife. This rhythm oflife is naturally and fundamentally logical, based on repeatable yet
ever-evolvingpatterns,and is designed to direct everyliving thing toward the future.

Interpersonal: The auric magnetism ofthis channel is designed to draw people into a continuous
but flexible flow that keeps humanity moving toward a secure and viable future. The Collective's
social flow provides us with unlimited opportunities for bonding. Logic's ideal pattern is people
flowing together with the opportunity to bond with one another as equals, de-conditioned and
living authentically. Logic confirms that all natural and correct rhythms and patterns, regardless
ofhowfixed orhowextreme,expand the waylove is manifested in theworld. An electromagnetic
connection between Gates 5 and 15 can be challenging,as one personwillbefixed in theirpattern

RACofConsciousness-JCofHabits- LACofSeparation
For Gate 5, waiting isn't stopping; it is an active state, like being pregnant. Gate 5 is an energy
thatenjoys fixed rhythms and tempos.This is whatgives you the tenacity to stay true to your own
inner rhythms in order to stayvital, healthy and always in your flow. You find great satisfaction in
mundane rituals and routines that attune you to the vibrations ofall life. Being forced to deviate
from your natural rhythms can be physically, mentally and emotionally destabilizing for you, and
can manifest as insecurity, unhealthy behaviors or physical disorders. Don't question your natural
routines or rhythm,orletothers lureyou awayfrom them.Forexample,afriend with the extremes
ofGate 15 may not understand why you are so compulsive about your rituals and daily patterns.
Their rhythm automatically disrupts your healthy routines, and might even tempt you to abandon
them. Conversely,you mayfind yourselfwanting to influence their unpredictabilitywithyourfixed
ways. Keep in mind that their flexibility and adaptability, though it feels unpredictable to you, is
whatkeeps themhealthy.Understandingandappreciatingwhateachofyoubringsto theflowhelps

Gate 15 is the love ofhumanity. It has the capacity to accept and to find a place in societyfor the
full spectrum ofhuman behavior.Its lackofafixed pattern insures that each ofus is able to make
a contribution to the diverse ways love exists in the world. Love in Gate 15 is not about how we
connect with others, but rather how we project a transpersonallove for humanity's diversity out
into the world.This begins with loving the extremes ofyour own rhythms; for example, sleeping
ten hours one night, and two hours the next.You are capable ofaccepting other people's extremes
withoutjudgment,therebybringingdiversityintotheflowoflife.TheMagneticMonopoleamplifies

and accepting the diverse and opposite tempos that are apart ofhumanity,you fully embrace and
promote for all ofus what it means to be human.Without Gate 5's disciplined and fixed rhythm,
you may find that your own constantly changing rhythms cause you to lose the focus you need to

Circuit:Understanding ChannelType: Projected
The Channel ofJudgment links the Root Center to the Splenic Center
through the Gate ofVitality (58) and the Gate ofCorrection (18). Logic
needs to be able to prove ithas the best answers,and underlying the logical
process is an insatiable drive to challenge, correct and perfect any pattern.
Channel58-18 fuels the artofmastery.
...... Background: Gate 58 fuels ourlove ofand vitalityfor life,and pressures us
to want to perpetuate this energy.The insatiability ofChannel 58-18 is a
"
by-product offeeling sowonderful.Itis as though Gate 58 says,"more and
better,moreand better"as logic'simpulsetokeep us alive,whileGate 18,the
Gate ofCorrection,tempers this impulse byalertingus to whatisn't healthy,oris out ofbalance or
in need ofcorrecting.The Channel ofJudgement is like a sentrywhojudges ifwhatit perceives is
stoppinglife from beingjoyousfor the Collective. Suchjudgmentis based on testing patterns,and
comparingwhatisinherentlycorrectandworkablewithwhathasworkedornotworkedin thepast.
This senseofwhatneedscorrectingkeepssocietyontrackbecauseChannel58-18wantseverybody
to find satisfaction in the perfected pattern.The Channel ofJudgment's underlying purpose is the
purpose ofHuman Design; to reclaim or recover the joy and love that have been lost in living a
homogenized,conditionedlife.
Personal: Even for the true perfectionist,perfection can neverexist because patterns are subject to
continual change.Your ability tojudge,and your desire to correct,are expressedwhen you become

When a critical evaluation bursts forth unbidden or uninvited, however, it usually takes the form
ofan endless and incessant stream ofdata,aboutwhatis wrong,that no onewants to hear. On the
otherhand,what bringsyou realjoyis beingasked to share as in,"Is there somethingwronghere?"
Thosewho askyou are the peoplewho are prepared for and open to youranswer.
Interpersonal:Toavoidwastingpreciousenergy,andtouseyouressentialgiftswisely,youareadvised
to pickyour battles with care by first waiting to be asked to share your solution, and by devising
solutions applicable to the collective. In this way, you challenge only what others are most open

Personal:Youaredesigned to combineintuitivedepthwith repetitiveexperimentationand practice
as you strive to perfect an intrinsic skill.The key to successfully developing your talent is that you
must be completelyidentified with something that you love doing as it takes great dedication and
constantrepetitiontoachievemastery.Bybringingyourdepthto thetechnicalmasteryorperfecting

a long-term dedication to refining your talent, mastery of the pattern eventually transcends the
pattern itself,freeing you to express your own unique wavelength. At the cellularlevel,it takes the
bodysevenyears to transcend technique;it maytake alifetime to plumbyour depth.
Interpersonal: Those with Channel 48-16 have an innate need to be recognized by others, to be
asked to share their talent, and to be rewarded with resources in order to continue its process of
practicing and perfecting.They maylack direct access to energy resources (motor energy) oftheir
own.Ifa parent does not purchase the instruments or provide the music lessons their child needs,
forinstance,itis muchharderfor them todevelop theirbuddingtalentand thededication necessary
to perfect their skill. Or to pursue the exploration ofpatterns on behalfofhumanity; patterns that
might prove effective and efficient enough for us to face our future with relative security. Money
is a form ofrecognition, and talent flowers when it is energized by recognition and materially
rewarded. Developing social skills often helps the artist successfully compete for the monetary
resources necessary to continue perfecting their talent. Channel 48-16 also represents the master
and apprentice relationship.The master shares the expertise achieved through constantly refining
a skill by mentoring or teaching a younger but gifted student. During this phase, the focus is
usuallyon technique,for talentis oftenconsidered 1percentgift(inspiration) and 99percentwork
(perspiration).In this way, the pattern is passed on and the on-goingrefinement continues as each

Circuit:Understanding ChannelType: Projected
The Channel ofLogiclinks the Head Center to the Ajna Center through
the Gate ofDoubt (63) and the Gate of Formulization (4). This is the
doubting mind. Doubt is absolutely essential to logic because logic can

Background:The ChannelofLogic'sfcar takes theform ofdoubt,and pops
up somewhere between the question and the answer. Such skepticism must
be addressed by logical experimentation leading to proof.There is little room for unsubstantiated
belief. An answer is just an answer until a consistent and reliable, practical and 'provable'pattern
emerges from it.The Collective fears the mutative impact of the Individual because mutation is
a transformative process that breaks down the patterns. For example, someone with definition in
Channel63-4cannotlogicallyacceptthetruthofIheHumanDesignSystemwithoutexperimenting

Personal: You have an active logical mind that hones in on life with a healthy skepticism. "Is it
goingto rain nextweek?Well,based on typicalpatternsfor this timeofyear,the currentbarometric
pressure and cloud cover there is a strong possibility, but..."You are good at posing a question,
looking for recognizable patterns, factoring in current data, and making an educated prediction
about the future in order to serve the collective. Will this or that make us safe tomorrow? You
are always tempted to immediately share both the question and the answer, whether others are
interested andopen toyou ornot.Whenyourbusymind is unable to resolveaquestion,andrelease
mental pressure without meeting resistance, you can become anxious. It helps to remember that
because the ChannelofLogicis aCollectivechannel,the pressureto understand thepatternis best

The Understanding Circuit has constant access to Splenic survival awareness, and to Logic with
its process oftesting, proving and then sharing patterns that enhance our future. This is a process
commonly associated with the Sciences. The Sensing Circuit, however, is focused on the desire
for experiences (often with sexual overtones) that promote emotional/relational growth and
development.The experience doesn't have to make sense, but it does need to be substantive, and
something that can be sharedwith another person from beginning to end.The Abstract process is
associated with fields ofstudy such as anthropology or literature. From Logic's point ofview, the
Abstractexperientialwayis amessyand unnecessaryprocess.
TheSensingCircuitdoesnothavetheSpleentoprovidestabilityandsafetyfortheAbstractprocess.
Experience is based precariously on the emotional desire to do something new and excitingwith
another person. When things don't change, boredom and restlessness set in. Creating a crisis is
one way to get things moving again.This is what makes Abstract circuitry the most human ofall
processes. Reflecting upon experience is the Collective's most potent force for evolvinglife on the
planet.Withoutthisforce,wewould nothaveevolvedinto theconsciouslyaware,differentiatedand
complexhuman beingswe have become.
The Collective's reflections on past experience become the foundations ofour history. Peoplewith
definitionin the SensingCircuitcannotmake senseoflifewhileitis happening,butare genetically
programmed to become storehouses ofwisdom. It's our uniquely human capacity to select, to
remember and to bring forward historical perspectives. We choose what we deem to be ofvalue
from what has been. It is an art to be able to condense and articulate the past inways that can be
shared in the moment and illuminate the future. Each perspective,eachlessonlearned,adds aline
to the script from which life's drama continues to unfold.The retelling ofhuman history greatly
speeds up ourlearningprocess because no child has to beginfrom scratchwhenitenters theworld.

the Sacral's well ofstamina and perseverance that is accessed only through
a"yes"response.The 46th gate connects the vehicle to the direction ofthe
higherselfin order to be in the right place at the right time.

Personal: There is no "changing horses in the middle ofthe stream"for you, and no looking back,
so a clear commitment through Strategy and Authority is vital to the satisfaction you will derive
and the educationyou will be able to share from your discovery process.You must be able to lose

Interpersonal: People with the Channel ofDiscovery have a built-in availability, and a tendency
to say"yes"to almostanyrequest.Thosewith unconscious (red) definition are particularlyprone to
giving their energy away. Iftheir commitments are the result ofa mental decision, they will most
likely fail where others succeed, thus turning potential satisfaction into frustration. Unlike logic,
which theoretically postulates what might happen if a person does this or that, the past is the
only teacher for the experiential learners. It is not until they get to the end ofan experience that
they discover, through examination and analysis, what is worth repeating and what is not, which
is what they then share with the Collective. It is only through correctly saying "yes"that they can
persevere through extreme challenges without allowing others to deter them from the course of
theirexperience,and its potentialfor discovery.

Circuit: Sensing ChannelType: Projected
The Channel of the Prodigal links the G Center to the Throat Center
through the Gate ofthe Listener (Gate 13) and the Gate ofPrivacy (Gate

storesinformationandsecrets,harvestingmemoriesfromwhichlessonsmay

forwhatis beneath the surface to reveal itselfin theform ofadeeper truth.
..... Background: Peculiar to human beings is their desire to explore all there is
inlife,and theirdrive to experienceitfirst-hand. Channel 13-33 brings the
experiential cyclical process ofmaturation to an end, adding the capacity
to see and reflect on all sides ofan experience afterwards before sharing it. It's what gives us our

collective history lesson. Such remembering brings continuity and stability to the evolution of
civilizationfrom onegeneration to the next.
Personal: Asanaturallistenerand record keeper,you collectlifestories,secrets and memorabilia.
You then retreat to ponder and organizewhatyou have gathered in preparation for sharingyour
reflections in the lessons you have gleaned from them.Your challenge is timing. You don't want
to reveal your secrets before their time, or remain so private no one will ever hear them.You are
willingtobreakwith thepatternsoffamilyand societyso as to chooseexperiencesthatarecorrect

the cycle discover that the results did not match those expectations.Theylose patience and miss
the magic ofcompletionwith its precious lessons.You sharewith all ofus,from your experience,
that itis far more fulfilling to simplywitness the sequence ofunfolding events than to suffer the
frustration and disappointment ofunmet expectations.The wisdom gained over time from this
form ofpatientreflection reveals some ofthe greatest truths in our collective history. One ofthe
most valuable Ie sons you bearwitness to, and share with us, is how to comfortably surrender to
our own experientialprocess as apassenger consciousness.

codon in our D A.When the sun moves into Gate 41 inJanuary ofeach
year,we begin a new solar cycle (a newyear) and initiate aphysiological process in humanity that
keeps us evolving together.All ofthe possibilities ofhuman experience are stored within this gate,
and the entire experiential process is driven by its Root-fueled desire for new experiences and the
expectation ofbeing satiated in the end.This hungercan onlybe satisfied temporarily.The Abstract
(Sensing) process is focused on accomplishment, on the completion ofa cycle, and is driven by a
desire or expectation that 'doing' something will overcome boredom. This is the beginning ofthe
humanexperientialway.Ourculturalevolution,theprogressionfrom theignoranceandinnocenceof
inexperience to thewisdom oflessonslearnedfrom experience,culminateinChannel36-35.
Personal:You are apersonwithgreatimagination and an endlessyearning to take inlife andfeel
it deeply. Your dreams, fantasies or wishes, sometimes accompanied by sexual overtones, create
expectations that, when in the hands offate (Gate 30), mayor may not be fulfilled. Over time
you have learned that desire can bringgreatjoyor excitement as well as pain,and the fulfillment
ofany desire does not last long. Your restlessness for new experience is balanced by developing
the patience and selfcontrolneeded to follow your emotionalAuthority and take sufficient time
through yourwave to make cleardecisions.The secretforyou is to simplyenjoyyour dreams and
each experience in and ofitself,withoutgivingin to the pressure ofexpectation.In this wayyour
experiences will be more fulfilling, your reflections more poignant, and your sharing more likely
to stir the feelings ofothers.
Interpersonal: In the Channel of Recognition, the pressure to move is connected to an intense
feeling or emotion, providing the momentum to leap from inexperience into experience at a
moment's notice.Waiting through theiremotionalwavegives thosewith this channeltheessential

Gate41 initiates the uniquelyhuman experientialwayas ahunger to experienceemotion.Itbegins

desire builds in you, it may manifest as a vague expectation, a sexual fantasy or a restless need to
experience something new with someone. You are not sure what this new experience is or when
it will happen or with whom. Gate 41 drives you toward satisfYing your desire and fulfilling your

The Gate ofthe Fates teaches us that life is not what we expect it to be - it is what we allow it
to be.Your experiences are conceived from a desire that then meets life on the highs and lows of
your emotional wave. This desire can feel like an obsessive hunger that weaves the yearnings of
different lives together, influencing your every interaction until it is satisfied or fulfilled. The only
controlyouhaveisovertheclaritywithwhichyouenterintoeachexperience,notovertheoutcome.
Because desire can only be temporarily assuaged, life without clarity becomes a wild emotional
ride. Over time, you see that the freedom to fulfill your wildest dreams is merely an illusion, and
unreciprocated desire should notbe taken personally.Balanceinyourlife comes through surrender,
through acceptingwhat is. In doing so,you need not fear the fates orfeel pressured to chase after
the fantasies ofGate 41. By accepting your limitation, or place in the larger pattern oflife, your
reflections on feeling and desiring deeplywhile experiencingyour humanness become agift to be

, ..... 35 has atalentfor seeking adventures and involvingothers in them.Itfinds
expression through Gate 35's need to manifest change as in "been there,
done that, what's new?" The emotionally-charged 36th gate perceives its
inexperience as inadequacy, and so draws those with the Channel ofTransitoriness into seeking
experience, occasionally by engendering a crisis just to get things moving. Through this restless
desire to explore the depth and consequence ofour capacityto feel (emotion),our species matures
and evolves and our gene pool expands, ultimately resulting in progress for the Collective.This is
learning through experiencefor the sakeoffuture generations.

resulting crises. Deeply emotional experiences often have a sexual dimension, but because relating
here is focused on the feelings provoked by the experience rather than on the other person, both
parties can be left with disappointment when the experience is over. When two people connect

Background: The Channel of Abstraction is an experiential mental force
that dabbles in all kinds ofpossibilities, regardless ofrules, until something
mysteriously emerges and makes sense. This is a mind busy with the consequences ofbeing alive.
Mergingthe conceptualizationofthe neocortex(AjnaCenter)withthe deepgraymatterofthebrain
(Head Center),itgifts us with the true potential ofself-reflected consciousness.To be at peacewith
themselves however,thosewith this channel must remember that the mind can never be an internal
authorityfor theirownlife,anditwillneverbe 100percentsureofanything.

process,the gaps and spaces between the dots willat some pointconnectand apicturewillappear;

clarity to emerge over time, is the uncovering ofan inspiring tale to tell, or a new perspective to
share with others.You are utterly unequipped with this mental definition, however, to solve your
ownproblems,ormake sense ofyour ownlife.
Interpersonal: In order to relieve the pressure to make sense oflife, those with the Channel of
Abstraction have to find a way to share their minds with the outside world. Their casual, story
telling minds,while agift for historians, should never be relied upon for the facts.This is the part

DEFENSE CIRCUIT EGO CIRCUIT
TRIBAL CIRCUIT GROUP
When we enter the Tribal realm, we meet interdependence as support, as well as the not-selfin
the form of co-dependence. Interdependence is the mutuality and reciprocity upon which early
societies were structured and maintained.Thejob oftheTribe is to deal with the consequences of
beingalivebydevisingways forpeopletolive together thatincreaseproductivity,and maximize our
SECTION SIX: CIRCUITS, CHANNELS AND GATES, THE CIRCUIT BOARD OFTHE LIFE FORCE 233
abilityto protectourselves.TheTribe connectsus to life and eachotherthrough the senses,through
bloodlines (ancestry), and through loyalty to the blood bargain.The Tribal heart is a communal
heart, where everybody else's business is everybody else's business. This is in part what gives the
Tribe its reputation for being 'sticky' and possessive. For the Tribe, support is about having.The
Tribeissensitive topeople'sbasicneed forfood,shelter,clothing,and astructure to holdeverything
together.When theseareprovided,thereis peacein thekingdom.When theyarelacking,theTribe
isequippedtorevoltinorderto establishequilibriumbetweenthosewhohavemore than theyneed,
and thosewho do not haveenough.Revolution is aform ofTribaljustice.
Two circuits make up the Tribal Circuit Group: one major, the Ego Circuit, and one minor, the
Defense Circuit. The Ego Circuit has a double focus. Its initial focus is on the business of the
material world, such as family, or the creation and distribution ofmonetary resources. Its second
focus balanceshumanity's need tosurviveonthematerialplanewithourdeep needforGod (spirit).
The Ego Circuit creates the two forces ofcontinuing support that keep people in the Tribe.The
Defense circuit is concernedwith generating,caring for, nurturing and preserving human life (the
Tribe),and the laws andvalues ofTribalrelationships.
In our exploration ofthe BodyGraph as a circuit board, the core Integration Channel is resolutely
separate, the epitome of self-sufficiency. The Individual Circuit Group empowers the quality of
uniquenessinhumanitythatpavesthewayformutation,and theCollectiveCircuitGroupisstaunchly
communal,sociallyinteractiveand mutuallyrespectfulinitsorientation.TheTribe'sstrongcommunal
structure is founded on loyalty to ahierarchical chain ofcommand.TheTribal Circuit builds awall
around itself,andwould label allofthe othercircuits outsiders,while the Defense Circuit pulls even
the most strident outsider into the bonds ofcommunal living with its penetrating intimacy, and its
promiseto nurtureand provideresources.
The Spleen's instinctual survival awareness relays messages through the senses, particularly smell,
touch and taste. This awareness compliments and focuses the Tribe's extraordinary capacity for
personal loyalty and sexual intimacy. It is also what guides the ways communal expectations and
support are expressed. For example, the famous family recipe that is handed down as a form of
familyidentity,the handshakeorkiss thatseals adeal,and the blood bond betweenbestfriends.
The Tribe's most distinguishing characteristic is the bargain, or making deals that guarantee
support. "I'll scratch your back ifyou scratch mine. I'll clean the house and feed the children if
you go out and work to make moneyfor the family." The bargain,which permeates all channels
inTribal circuitry,imposes orpre-supposesloyaltyto alarger,hierarchicalsystem ofrulership and
values. "I will see that you are protected from invaders ifyou pay me homage and taxes."Tribal
bargainingensured our species'survival.Throughout history, theTribe has been the bedrockthat
held us together as afamily unit or a nation. It has determined for us how to raise our children,
chooseavocation,make thelaws and policeourstreets,andworshipourgods.Without theTribe,
wewould not have been able to lookafter ourselves within asociety.Itgave each ofus aplace in
its upport net,and as long as we stayed in our place and made our contribution,it kept us safe.

A DesignFocusedon Reproduction
Circuit: Defense (Creative Channel) ChannelType: Generated
The ChannelofMatinglinks the SacralCenterto the SolarPlexus Center
through the Gate ofSexuality (59) and the Gate ofFriction (6). Channel
59-6, the core of humanity's creative essence, is rooted in a powerful
quantum ofSacraland emotionalenergycalled'intimacy.'The sexualityof
Gate59,and thepleasure/painemotionalwaveofGate6,bringpeopleinto
relationships that are deeply personal,penetrating and potentiallyfertile.
Background: A defined Solar Plexus is always one's Authority, and the
emotional wave requires that one wait to find clarity over time. If the
Channel of Mating is conditioned by not-self spontaneity and ignores
its Sacral response, it can create confusion and greatly complicate social interactions.There can
also be long-term repercussions such as an unwanted child or a failed businessventure.The true
intimacy potential in this Tribal channel requires patience and nurturing over time. For that
reason itis healthiest to cultivate afriendship with business partners orlovers first, before diving
into the depths ofan intimate union with them.
Personal: Yours is the urge to merge,and when guided byresponse over time this can be healthy
and deeplysatisfYing on manylevels.Yourown availability to intimacyallows you to quickly and
easily penetrate the auras ofothers, facilitating a coziness that paves the way for fertility in any
creative endeavor.This is your natural state, and a true asset for establishing relationships ofany
kind. You can also be misunderstood, however, and your intensity misinterpreted by others who
mayfeel you are flirting or"coming on"to them when you don't mean to.Your emotional wave,
through Gate6, determines theactualtimingofanyintimateemotionalreleasebyeitherdrawing
you closer or pushing you away.Waiting out your wave's cycle allows you to discern or discover
overtimeifsomethinghas beenconceivedbetweenthe two ofyou- and ifithasn't,thewave may

Interpersonal:Althoughdesigned toexperienceapotentemotionalwave,thosewiththeChannel
ofMating can actually appear quite stable emotionally.Theirwave is activated or brought to the
pointofresponse bythe proximityor touch ofanotherperson.A well-timed hug,orhand on the
shoulder, atjust the right point on their wave helps them release pent up emotions that cannot
be expressed through words. This is a form of intimacy that can be expressed through tears, a
heart-felt sigh or by deeplyrelaxing into someone's understanding embrace.Doing so maintains
ahealthysense ofemotional balance between stronger (sexual) emotionalreleases. Channel 59-6
is bestexperienced as an electromagnetic connection between two people,when each partner has
one ofthe gates.

Gate 59 generates our genetic strategies for sexual bonding and creating new life. Also known
as the "aura breaker," it defines the ways we penetrate or break through barriers to intimacy in
order to create offspring, or enter into a creative venture with others.The lines ofGate 59 (listed
below) describe the ways humanity approaches bonding.They are genetic strategies, and each role
is singularlyfocused on selecting the best partner for producing the mostviable offspring.The 4th

Background: The Sacral energies of Channel 59-6, subject to the warm,
emotional intimacy of the Solar Plexus wave, are focused on creation and procreation. Once
the offspring are born, the Sacral's immediate response to their vulnerability arouses the strong
and spontaneous survival instincts of the Spleen with its cool realization that we must care for
what we have created. In this way, the warm experiential side ofthe BodyGraph is balanced by
existentialawareness,and the need to guard oraccept responsibilityfor thosewho cannottake care
ofthemselves.Thislevelofsupportis necessaryiftheTribe,andwhatitstandsfor, is to endure.
Personal:You are someonewhose aura automaticallyelicits trustfrom others,and people naturally
look to you for support and nurturing. Support through this channel can take many forms, from
establishing and defending the values and laws ofthe land and being a conscience for the Tribe,
to attending to the upbringing ofyoungsters or caring for the sick and elderly. You are capable
ofassuming a lot ofresponsibility, and are susceptible to taking on too much. Although you are
a natural nurturer, the onlyway that you will know ifyou are taking on the correct responsibility
is through your Strategy and Authority. With a wisdom rooted in ancient awareness informing
youraltruism and compassion,you innatelyunderstand that nurture beginswith thecorrectcare of
yourselffirst. Onlythe strong and healthycan nurture and guide others toward survival,improved
health or success.This is called 'enlightened selfishness,' and though it may be perceived as self
indulgence,itis quite different.Ifsomeonewants yourcare,theymustaskfor it.Itis onlythrough

The Ego Circuit protectively surrounds the Defense Circuit. Understanding the material and
communal forces of support with which the Ego Circuit sustains the fertile and nurturing
processes ofthe Defense Circuit, gives us a clearer sense ofthe nature and scope ofthe Tribe's
contribution to our evolution.
Onitsown,the Ego Circuithas no defined Sacralorlife-generatingcapacity,nordoes ithave any
connectionto mentalawareness (AjnaCenter).TheEgo Circuit'shub is the HeartorEgo Center.
The central focus ofthis circuit's five channels is the Ego's willpower, namely the will to go out
into the world and provide for its own in exchange for deserved rest.
Through the Ego Circuit,we can followthe developmentoftwo philosophicallydivergentpoints
ofviewthat begin in the Root and meetin theTribalheart (Ego Center).Eachviewdefines one
oftwoforces ofTribalsupport.Weexperience the spiritualdimension ofcommunallife,with the
core unitoftheTribe the inter-generationalfamily that is traditionallyahierarchical blood-bond
relationship, as well as the ambition and materialism ofthe entrepreneur.Itis in this circuit that
the mysteries ofthe mystical are cultivated alongside the essentially material and mundane.The
Ego Circuit is also where we find the pragmatism ofcapitalism, and the ideals ofsocialism and
communalism.
Together, these two views point to an underlying truth waiting to be discovered in the Ego
Circuit- spiritis hidden in the mundane. Livingfully as our authenticselves,in each momentof
our mundane lives, becomes a beautiful process that quietlyreveals our connection to spirit, and

THE CHANNEL OF TRANSFORMATION: 54 - 32
A DesignofBeingDriven
Circuit: Ego ChannelType: Projected
The ChannelofTransformationlinks the Root Centerto the Splenic Center
through the Gate ofDrive (54) and the Gate ofContinuity (32). Channel
54-32 represents ambition fueled by consistent effort, and motivated by the
"...." desire to be recognized in order to better one's position in life.The potential
awareness ofwhat can and cannot be transformed, sometimes distorted by a
" " fear offailure, is driven by the fuel for social interactions that can move one

Background:The Channel ofTransformation carries an energeticpotential
throughwhich peoplewith talent or abilitycan pull themselves up by their
bootstraps,andmoveoutofthesocialclasstheywereborninto.Gate32isalwaysonthelookoutfor
talent.Itisdrivenbythefears thatitsTribemaynotbe thebest,orwillbeunable tosurvivethe next

shapes Channel54-32's ambition;its desire to rise up and transform.Thereisalsoamystical thread,
the threadofspirit,wovenintoitthrough Gate54's4thline: EnlightenmentiEndarkenment,thefuel

Personal: Rooted in and grounded by the Tribe's dedication to service and self-sacrifice,
transformationisbestdefinedhereinitsTribalcontext.Tribalsupportbeginswhenyour talentsare
recognized,andyoureffortsareencouraged,throughwhatisreflectedbacktoyoubythoseyouhave
helped to fulfill their ambitions or attain enlightenment.Your reward for loyaltyand dedication to
theTribe comes through each promotion to the nextlevel.Youwillinglyworkharder than anyone
else to prove your worth or value, even to the point ofbecoming a workaholic. Your true goal is
to experience this drive for recognition as a healthy interdependence that is mutually beneficial.
Your instincts have the potential to bringyou to avocation through which you might fulfill your
potential,achieve your ambitions,and utilize your giftfor making money so thatyou can use your
unique abilities to assistothers in reaching their potential.
Interpersonal: The ambition that constitutes transformation in the material world is guided by
Splenicawareness.It's byinstinctthatonewiththis channelrecognizesiforwhenneeded supportis
availableforincreasingone'swealth,ortoensuresuccessthroughpersonaladvancement.Thepressure
to make more money continually transforms the world economy. In the end, only transformation
that endures over time has value, and creating such continuity requires the support of the Tribe.
Even in today's global society, supportive allies are crucial for a nation to realize its financial goals
and ambitions.Transformationis notsomethingthatwe do onourown,and movingup the ladder
is always dependent upon and accompanied bythe expectations ofthose above us.Ifapersonwith
Channel 54-32 is properlyrecognized and supported by theTribe, then theTribe expects quidpro
quo,areciprocalreturnforwhatithas provided.This is howtheTribalsystem endures.

Gate54provideshumanitywith thefuel and ambition to transform theTribe's materialdirection
and standing among other tribes. It supplies the energy for our most mundane ambitions, and
the highest spiritual aspirations that may be hidden within them. Onlywhen we have mastered
our instincts to thrive on the mundane plane, is transformation of a spiritual nature possible.
Youlive your spiritual ideals through the mundane plane,and ambition is the fulfillment ofyour
personal potential. Ifyou are noticed by someone higher up in the hierarchy, there is a good
chance thatyou can betteryour position in life.Yourinner drive to 'rise up'provides the impetus
for transformationfor thosearoundyouaswell;itlevels theplayingfield for othersto competeon

Awareness through Gate 32 is focused on constant evaluation as an instinctive recognition of
whatcan and cannot be transformed.An underlyingfear offailure can put the brakes on runaway
ambition. Gate 32's ability to adapt, and yet maintain its true nature, is the Spleen's contribution
to the material continuityoftheTribe.This is part ofyour contribution as well. A great deal rests
on what is recognized and valued, and thereby encouraged and retained by the Tribe. One of
your gifts is recognizingwho has the skills or education to move up in the world; and then, using
your influence, to bring them to the attention ofthose in positions ofauthority.This is the gate
ofprolonged indecision. You are apt to find yourselfagonizing over how to maintain a balance
betweenwhatisworkingsuccessfully(conservatism),and openingyourselforan organizationup to

THE CHANNEL OF SURRENDER: 44 - 26
A DesignofaTransmitter
Circuit: Ego (Creative Channel) ChannelType: Projected
The Channel of Surrender links the Splenic Center to the Heart Center
through the GateofAlertness (44) and the Gate ofthe Egoist (26).Herewe
find deepTribal memory, rooted in instinctual awareness/intelligence,joined
to ego strength. It is this combination that gives a transmitter the ability to
selectively and persuasively use historical memory, and guarantee that it will
....--
. be an improvement,in order to sell something to atargeted group ofpeople.
.. ...
". Channel44-26is the capitalistengaged in the creativeartofenterprise.
."
.....
Background: As the only direct link between the Heart Center and the
Splenic Center, Channel 44-26 forms one of the main health networks
in the body.The 26th gate correlates to the Thymus Gland where our immune system is formed
prenatally. Essentially,this channelis instinctuallyalertfor and willing to addresswhatever poses a
threat,orneedsimprovingorreplacinginorderto keep theTribeviable.Thosewith the Channelof
Surrender,usingtheirnoseorsenseforwhatpeoplemayneed,have thewill to manipulate the tribe
for itsowngood,even beforeitknows it needsit.
Personal: You have agift for instinctually assessing others, and for matching them with products,
jobs, and even ideologies. In exchange for this work, you will demand what you feel is fair for
yourself,and itmustinclude ahealthybalanceofrest andwork.Youare notonewho is designed to
workeighthours adayin an office,butwillaccomplish moreinacompressed amountoftime than

often works best when you wait until the market or your tribe recognizes your gifts, pledges its
support to you, and asks you to promote yourselforyour product on their behalf.This recognition
givesyou aplatform fromwhich to speak- especiallyifyou are apolitician.
Interpersonal: Transmitters intuit which form ofpersuasion will effectively relay their message,
and they can spontaneously adjust their advertising or sales pitch to meet changing markets and
situations.The creative gifts ofthis channel include a sense ofwhat will appeal to the Tribe, and
how to manipulate or massage the egos of others into wanting what they are selling. This can
be a valuable asset for the filmmaker, sales representative, graphic designer, advertising executive,
politician and diplomat.

THE CHANNEL OF SYNTHESIS: 19 - 49
A DesignofSensitivity
Circuit: Ego ChannelType: Projected
The ChannelofSynthesis links the Root Center to the SolarPlexus Center
through the Gate ofWanting (19) and the Gate ofPrinciples (49).Tribal
forms of mysticism evolved through the pressure of humanity's need for
food,shelter,protection,territory,somethingto believein,and somethingto
hold everythingtogether.The 19thgate pressures us to approach eachother
and manifest the interrelatedness oftheTribe,while the 49th gate prods us
.... torejectthatwhichisnotcompatiblewithourhighestideals,andsupportive
.-- ~.-
ofourconnection to each otherand spirit.
Background: Sensitivitytoneedisrootedin touch,suchassealingthebargain
with ahandshake,and is found on the emotional side ofthe Ego Circuit in the realm ofbelonging.
This sensitivity is the Tribe's foundation for marriage and bonding, and for divorce. The emotional
acceptance or rejection frequency ofChannel 19-49 is the glue that determines who belongs and is
deservingofthesupportoftheTribe;whogets to cometo thetableandwhodoesn't.Thereisnothing
logical(democratic)orabstract(experiential)inthisfrequency,anditcannotsimplybesuper-imposed

Inexchange,oneis promised theirbasicneedswillbe met. Loyalityis one key to theTribe's survival,
buthere thatloyaltyisgoverned byanemotionalwave.
Personal:Youareverysensitivetoyourownpositionin theschemeofthings.Wantingto beneeded
and togivesupport,and/orneedingtobewantedandbesupported,iscriticaltoyourhappiness.The
family, however it is defined, is your enterprise and you are willing to do the necessaryinnerwork
to make it a success. For example,taking time to explore the depth and impact ofyour emotional
wave on your potential partner through a long courtship, before committing to the intimacy and
responsibility ofcohabitation, or marriage and raising a family. The three most important needs
for you within your tribe are the protection ofresources, the sanctityofyour territory, and a clear
understandingofyour tribe's beliefsystem.Your potentialgiftis to be recognized as someonewho
canalways balancepracticalityand fairness.
Interpersonal: Channel 19-49 begins the evolution of social communion by establishing the
principles for the marriage relationship (whichislater cemented bythe marriage bond in Channel
37-40, the Channel ofCommunity.) As the archetype ofthe bride and groom, this channel has a
frequencythatholdsthefamilytogether;itistheoriginationpointfortheTribe'sunifYingtraditions,

through Gate 19 to connect to others in ways that bringjoy and happiness.When dominated by
the not-self, this channel is characterized byconstant and inappropriate rejection, both ofselfand
others. Channel 19-49 forms across-species connection between mammals and humans,enabling
us to domesticate and train them to work the land,be companions,and provide us withfood.This
connection is alsowherewefind the ritualsacrificeofanimals to appease the gods and gainfavor.

When there is want or need orgreat inequality in our tribe, communal support breaks down and

your family, community and eventually the global community. You bring others to an awareness
ofwhat resources are needed for everyone to survive, as well as thrive and achieve their personal

Circuit: Ego ChannelType: Projected
The Channel of Community links the Solar Plexus Center to the Heart
Center through the Gate of Friendship (37) and the Gate ofAloneness
(40). Community lies at the heart ofhumanity's successful evolution. The
organic nature ofcommunity, and the transition point it provides between
the struggle to survive and liberation from that struggle, is subject to the
push-pull ofthe emotionalwave. Gate 40 is willing to work to provide for
-.... those it loves, but it needs it rewards and its rest. Gate 37,with its gift of
oo·- .......
affection,is alwayslookingfor recognition and its placewithin thewhole.
Background:In the ChannelofCommunity,theTribalbargainis backedby
the energyoftwo powerful motors thatgive it depth through clarityovertime,and thewill power
to succeed. In community, the bargain must be entered into correctly.The bond ofcommunity or
family, and thewaythe bondwill manifestin thefuture,isguaranteed bythewillpowerbehind the
bargain.The alignment ofthe Ego and SolarPlexus Centers also means that no good bargain can
be struck spontaneously, and must be carefully considered and formulated over time to be equally
beneficialforbothparties.Channel37-40is anoppositionin theMandalaand soisquitecommon.
It has had tremendous evolutionary influence worldwide, during this present Earth Cycle (1610
2027),wherewe have allfelt itsimpact through the RightAngle Cross ofPlanning.
Personal: If defined by Channel 37-40, you are waiting to see who asks you to be part of their
organization or community,or not.You are also trying to discoverwhere you belong,or howyou fit

Gate 40 is one ofthree gates ofaloneness (12 and 33 are the other two), and carries a sense of
being alone even when in agroup ofpeople.This aloneness is the beginning ofthe individuation
process; you need to separate yourselffrom the Tribe. In essence, it is the desire within you for
wholeness, expressed and experienced byothers as your strong independence, or as stepping away
from their interdependence.This is an aspect ofthe ego's willpower that is essential to the survival
ofcommunity. Gate 40 is the love ofwork, and when you are involved in work that is correct for

Circuit: Ego ChannelType:Manifested
The Channel of the Money Line links the Heart Center to the Throat
Center through the Gate ofthe Hunter/Huntress (21) and the Gate ofthe
Gatherer (45).The heart oftheTribe, ofour life together on the planet, is
the Ego Centerwith its connection to the heart muscle.This is theTribe's

.. ," -..,- '" Background: Channel21-45 is the most driven ofall Manifestor channels
and says, "It's up to me to take charge, to be in control or not."The most
benevolent expression ofTribal leadership is to gather, protect and educate
thetribesothatitsurvives.Wheneveryonehasbeenprovidedenoughsupporttoenjoylifetogether,
thereispeacein the kingdom. Gate45,theTribe's onlyvoice,is thevoice ofauthorityand thefinal
voice ofwhat is or isn't manifested. Its keynote says itwell: "I have orI don't have."TheTribe has
always coveted access to resources (money),and areliable commitment (loyalty).In manifestingits
pursuitofthese desires,and mediated bythe bargain,theTribehas dominated theaffairs ofhuman
history.The two gates that make up Channel21-45 are noteasilyreconciled to eachother. Gate45
protectsbutwants thelastword,andGate21 servesbutneeds tobeincontrolinordertoguarantee
its heart can rest,and/or to guarantee thatothers get their rest. Historically,this need for abalance
betweenworkand restwas the impetus behindunions ensuringworkers'rights.

powerofyourwill.Yourchallengeis to exertyourwillinawaythatprotectsyourowninterests,while

Interpersonal: Materialists like putting money to work.To become masters ofthe material plane
and provide for the good oftheir tribe, they need their tribe's full support and cooperation. We
can see this in action as we follow the evolution ofour economic structures from simple trading
betweenvillagestothecomplexcorporatebusinessmodelsandstockmarketsoftoday.The Channel
ofMoneyis actually much more successful as an electromagnetic connection between two people.
The 45th gate owns the factory but doesn'twork there.The 21st gate is the presidentwith alarge,
active ego who says, "I must benefit myselfbut at the same time I must benefit the owner and
our constituents." Together they control or manage the organization so that everyone achieves a
measure offinancial success.Another example would be Gate 21 as the prime minister in charge
ofrunning the country and advocating for the people,with Gate 45 as the king who conveys his
authorityto the prime ministerand must be paid his due.

We now arrive at another basic component of Human Design. Profile is the beginning of
establishingastyleforlife,aroledescribedas thecostumeofourpurpose.Itis acostumewegrow
into,however, andcaneitherbeuncomfortable,ifdistortedbyournot-self,orfeellikeournatural
skin and the true role we are here to live out. Profile is also one ofthe aspects that differentiates
you as a unique being.You maybe an emotional Generator,for instance,sittingwith three other
emotional Generators, but ifyou have different profiles you are very different people.Together
with ourIncarnation Cross (see Section Eight), Profile allows us to live our purpose as our own
authentic characteron the stage ofourlife.
The basis ofprofileis the recognitionofthefundamental dualitythatexistswithineach ofus.We
are abinaryconsciousness,asynthesis ofaPersonalityconsciousness and aDesignconsciousness,
and within Profilewe are able to understand the quantum ofthe two.There are 12 basicprofiles,
eachofwhichisderivedfrom acombinationoftheLineleveldefinitionoftheconsciousPersonality
Sun (black) and"the unconscious Design Sun (red).This is illustrated in the graphic below. Our
specific interpretation of our Profile, the role our character plays, makes our life performance
unique from all others.And the drama, the movie,begins at birth.

PROFILE STRUCTURE
The basis ofProfile is the Hexagram.The 64 Hexagrams (Gates in the Bodygraph) each have six
Lines,givingus adeeperlevelofdifferentiation than the Gates (hexagrams) themselves.Thekeyto
understanding Profile,andwhy there is suchincredible differentiation in the wayinwhich human
beings live out their lives,is found in understanding the lines.The basic structure ofahexagram is
divided into two parts, the LowerTrigram (Lines 1,2,3) and the UpperTrigram (Lines 4,5,6).The
line structure flows from Line 1 at the bottom ofthe hexagram upwards (see illustration below).
1here are specific themes connected with each ofthe trigrams, and specificvalues associated with
eachofthe sixprimarylines,which are described morefully on the pages thatfollow.

THE SIX PRIMARY ROLES: HEXAGRAM STRUCTURE OF GATE 10
The Six PrimaryRoles are the basicprofile themes,and are rooted in the line divisions ofthe 10th
Hexagram, the Gate ofTreading (The Behavior ofthe Self). Profile is a combination oftwo of
theseprimaryroles.1he qualities ofthese two roles arelived orexperienced differentlythrough our

HEXAGRAM STRUCTURE/HoUSE METAPHOR
It is helpful to use the house as a metaphor for
understanding the sixlines and their qualities.The 1stline
is the foundation upon which the house is built.lbe 2nd
line is the living space on the first floor ofthe house,with
curtainswide open,that others on the streetlookinto.The
3rd line is the transitional space or spiral staircase moving
from the first to second floor. The 4th line is the second
story,orsecond floor foundation ofthe house.The 5thline
is the mysterious, curtained second story window with
expectant speculators outside.And the 6th line is the roof
ofthe house,withabird's eyeviewinto the nexthouse,the
restofthe neighborhood and beyond.
PRIMARY ROLES By LOWER TRIGRAM: LINES 1 - 3
Thelowertrigramisaveryself-absorbedprocess,verypersonal.Thesearerolesthatarenotrushingout
to externalize,anddon'tparticularlywantto have much to dowithothers.
LINE 1 - INVESTIGATOR: INTROSPECTION, CHAMELEON, EMPATHY
Line 1is the ground floor or base ofthe hexagram,and 1stlines are driven to investigate
the foundation ofthings, to discover how life works. Once they have firmly established
a secure foundation, they are able to relax.The more they know, the less theyfear, as 1st
lines feel "ifwe can be secure, everything is possible."Their insecurity drives them to
seek authorities, and become authorities themselves, and yet pursuit of their investigations is an
introspective process that usuallysays,"I am busystudying,doing myresearch,so don't bother me."
The secure foundations that the 1stline creates are then externalized or universalized by the lines
ofthe upper trigram.Thereis also adeeplyempathicnature to the 1stline,and its abilityto take in
information from the othercan bevery transformative.
1st lines study behavior.Theywatch how other people act, and they learn to see which behavior
works and which behavior doesn't work. When feeling insecure, like a chameleon they'll change
theircolorsto blendin.They'renotactuallychanginganything,butthey'reverygood atlettingyou
see what they thinkyou need to see.The keynote for Gate 10 - Line 1 is Modesty, or the ability
to know one's place and how to act despite circumstances. 1stlines are very sensitive in this way,
and nothingis moreimportantto them thanbeingable to see that theycannavigateonthis plane,
and that all is going to be okay. 1stline Designs have a need for a ecure physical foundation as
well.The most common not-selffeeling for the 1stline is a sense ofinferiority,generallybecause
they do not allow themselves the focused self-absorption that is necessary to fully investigate and
establish a foundation. Strategy and Authority will determine the correct investigations for 1st
lines, and allow them to focus on one thing at a time, which can also relieve agreat deal oftheir
not-selfanxiety."TheverynatureofaHexagram,theveryconstructitself,cannotsurvivewithout
asolidfoundation."- RaUruHu
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 257
LINE 2 - HERMIT: THE NATURAL, PROJECTION, DEMOCRAT
Line 2 is like a seed that sits in the drawer for years, waiting for just the right time
to be planted so it can awaken,grow, and produce its unique fruit. While the 1stline
investigates in order to build a foundation, 2nd lines are naturals who do not know
where their innate gifts originate from. 2nd lines are noticed for their natural talents
or genius, and are then 'called out'by others who want their gifts to be used in a particularway.
These are Hermits,however, thatwantonlyto beleftalone to do their own thing, their ownway.
While 1st lines need others to aid in their investigations, 2nd lines are self-contained and can
feel veryuncomfortable when others step into their aura and expect somethingfrom them.They
do not want to, and do not even know ifthey can, explain to you how they do what they do, or
evenworse,howyou should do it.Theybehaveverydemocratically because theydon'twant to be
bothered,or have to invest their energyin taking sides.
The natural talent that2ndlines possess does not respond well to interference ofanykind.In our
analogyofthe houseitis as iftheyare standing alone infront ofthe first floorwindow,lights on,
happily self-absorbed in their own play, and not realizing that they are being observed by those
outside on the street. In fact, 2nd line Personalities generally do not even want to go outside
into the world.They are waiting to receive the correct call, specific to their unique life purpose,
that will allow them to share their true genius with the world. It is only through Strategy and
Authority that the 2ndlinewill knowifacallis correct. Fulfillmentis veryimportant to the 2nd
line, and ifthey cannot live up to the projections placed on them, or ifthey allow themselves to
answer calls that are not correct and that they cannot fulfill, they can suffer greatly and isolate
evenmore than is naturalorhealthy."Justsitbytheriver;soonerorlatersomethingwillcomeby.
Thisisreadinessfor theunknowable,whateveritmaybe."- RaUruHu
LINE 3 - MARTYR: TRIAL AND ERROR, MUTATION, ADAPTION
The great gift of 3rd lines is discovering what does not work. As the transition point
between the first and second floors ofthe house (the personal and the transpersonal),life
bumps into them in everyway, or they bump into it, and discover through the trial and
error process how the material plane operates. 3rd lines are our key catalysts ofchange,
and even though theymayat times appearsociallyinept,andveryoftenfeel alone, theyare the most
interpersonally adaptable line ofthe lower trigram, with a natural resilience and tenacity that will
sustain them through their discovery process. A 3rd line is more likely to notice and recognize a
potentialnewmutationfaster thananybodyelse,simplybecausetheybumpintoit.Oftenassociated
with scientific exploration (but from the stand-point ofwhat is not working) and deeply material,
3rd lines do not take life at face value.Theywill kick the tires and look to see where the flaw, the
loophole, or trick is.The 3rd line models for us the transformation that is possible when we are
grounded in our bodies on the materialplane.
These beings,whose natural gift is challenging the falsehoods, are ultimately mutating the Maia.
They're also going to notice what doesn'tworkin a relationship faster than anybody else,which is
why their theme is 'bonds made and broken.'The keynote ofMartyr refers to the 3rd line's ability
to stand up and say"thisis not true,"and take the heatfor it.Whenoperatingcorrectlyas true self,
however, there is no such thing as failure for a 3rd line - only discovery. Bonds made and broken
can become a natural mechanism in their life, such as the parent who leaves the house to go to
258 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
workeach day and then returns.The 3rd line is also partofthe 6thline three-partlife process (see
Line6- the RoleModel),and its mutative qualitypermeates the Profileroles more than anyother
line."Whatevercomestheirway,thereisalwaysamessagewithimportantinformation.Theyarethe
weaversoftheMaia."-RaUruHu
PRIMARY ROLES By UPPER TRIGRAM: LINES 4 - 6
When we move upward into the upper trigram, the mechanics ofthe roles change entirely.The
upper trigram is atranspersonal,outer-directed process.These roles have an essential need to share
sociallywithothers; to share thepastand the possibilities ofthefuture.
LINE 4 - OPPORTUNIST: EXTERNALIZATION, FRIENDLINESS
In harmony with the 1st line, the 4th line represents the foundation of the second
floor ofthe house, and builds upon the security that the 1stline creates.There is also
a fragility to Line 4 in that it must also allow an opening for the transition into the
upper trigram. While Line 3 is deeply involved with material resources, Line 4 is the
foundation oftranspersonal relationships and concerned with human resources. The 4th line is
deeply influential, and waits for opportunities to embrace its community and externalize the
foundations, gifts or discoveries ofthe lower trigram.Aninnate friendliness, akin to brotherhood
or sisterhood, facilitates the 4th line's gift for networking. This friendliness creates the opening
neededbutalso makes4thlines susceptibleto surpriseand shock.Theirsphereofinfluence,therefore,
is typicallylimited topeoplewithwhom theyhave alreadyestablishedrelationships; strangers are not
generallycorrectfor them otherthan as casualcontacts.
C2lIalityoflifefor4thlinesisindirectproportiontothequalityoftheirnetworkoffriendsandassociates.
Establishingtheirenergiesincorrectrelationshipsallows them to enjoyagenuinecamaraderie.1here
is also an inflexibility,however,which creates atendency toward people burnoutfor the 4thline,and
theyneed timesofretreattonurtureandrejuvenatethemselves.Thepotentialopportunitiesthat their
networks offer must bring a return on the energy investment that they have put into it, or they
may abdicate and find a network that does. 4th lines who are living correctly do not create their
networks, however; their correct networks are already there and they meet them through Strategy
and Authority.The 4th line, having a fixed quality, must transition securely from one network or
relationshipto another,orloseitssecurityand trueopportunitiestoinfluence."The4thlineisabout
thehumanresourcesofthematerialplane;peoplearethebiggestdecisionsandinvestmentsthey
makeintheirlife."- RaUruHu
LINE 5 - HERETIC: UNIVERSALIZING, PROJECTION, THE GENERAL
The 5th line carries the responsibility of universalizing the message of the hexagram.
Those with a 5th line carry the most transpersonal karma, and are most effective as a
'stranger ofconsequence,'such as the general who steps in when the standard solutions
havefailed andoffersapracticalyet'outsidethebox'solution.Theaurasof5thlinesinvite
peoplein need orcrisis to projectonto them apotentialfor rescue. Heretics operatein aprojection
field thatseduces the otherinto recognizing the potentialpowerthatis there,but5thlinescan also
beverysuspicious as others see things in them thatare not there,orhaveexpectations ofthem they
SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR PURPOSE 259
cannot meet. The 5th line, peeking out through the curtains ofthe second story window ofthe
house,looks outat theworld andveryoftenhidesfrom itat the same time. StrategyandAuthority
provides a practical and trustworthy tool for determiningwhich situations are correct for the 5th
line to step into to provide asolution.
If unaware of the projection field, 5th lines may be flattered by and believe others' perceptions
ofthem as saviors. In order to not buy into the illusions that others may have about them, 5th
lines must be truly aware ofthemselves and what they are really capable ofsolving or saving.The
Heretic's reputation is totally dependent upon the success or failure oftheir solutions to meet the
other's expectations. If they have not provided something ofreal value they may be figuratively
burnedatthestake.Oncethecrisisispastand theHeretics'leadershipis nolongerneeded,however,
they are generally ignored. This is the 5th line's natural time to regroup, as Heretics are not on
duty constantly, but are expected to be standing by, ready and able, when the next crisis arrives.

LINE 6 - ROLE MODEL: ADMINISTRATOR, OPTIMIST, PEACEMAKER
The 6th line stands alone from the other five lines of the hexagram, and is best
described assittingontheroof.Thoughsometimesperceivedas disinterested,this aloof
perspectiveprovides the6thlinewithavantagepointfrom which tolookbackoverthe
otherfive lines,whilealsolookingahead toward Line 1ofthe nexthexagram.Whereas
Line5 is moving toward others,Line 6 eventuallymoves awayfrom them in order to go through

As the Sun and Earth progress through each gate and line around the Mandala, during the
course ofone year, three distinct geometries are created. Geometries set mechanical potentials
andlimitationsin motion thatframe thespecificway(s)we are to interactwith and impactothers
in order tofulfill ourlifepurpose.Each ofthe 12profiles falls into one ofthree geometries,Right
Angle,Fixed Fate orLeftAngle.
RIGHT ANGLE GEOMETRY, which comprises the first seven profiles, creates a self-absorbed,
PersonalDestiny. Comprising approximately 64% of the planet, these profiles are here to work
out their own life. Right Angle Geometry is focused on self-exploration and facing the personal
challenges we meet in life. They are not here to be absorbed into someone else's process. People
whose lives intersect with theirs may spark new experiences, but will not alter their movement
throughlife.RightAnglesare notparticularlyawareof,norunderstand,whytheyconnectto certain
people as these profiles enter an incarnationwith the veil drawn over the experiences oftheir past
lifetimes.Theyare here to do the research,explore,re-experience and gain newperspectives,and as

Background:The geometryofthe Personal Destinytrigram begins with the 1/3 profile- the first
ofthe 12roles,and thepersonificationandfoundation ofourhuman experience.The 1/3 is unique
in that it is the only profile with both lines in the lower trigram. At this foundational level, the
1stline represents the conscious Personality, the mind and howwe think.The 3rd line represents
the unconscious Design, the body, and our physical experience in the mundane world. We are a
species that is driven by fear for our survival to investigate until we understand or find security
through a solid foundation.This is not always possible in the ever-changingworld that we live in,
but the search for this security drives and mutates our species forward. Mutation is the continual
process offinding out what does not work so that we can survive.The 1/3 sets the theme for the
on-going 'human'journey ofbumping into, investigating what we bump into, and resolving and
understanding the unknown.
Investigator Martyrs, very insecure when not standing on a solid foundation, are driven to seek
authorities thatcan provide themwithsecuregroundingfor their trialand errorprocess.Theirself
absorbed Investigator Personalities are very creative, and are healthiest and most productivewhen
well prepared and well educated.Theyenjoy their long hours ofintrospection,and find strength in
eventuallyestablishingthemselvesasanauthoritysothattheirpersonaldestinyremainsintheirown
hands.TheirMartyrVehicles orbodies are designed to discoverhow to navigate the materialplane
by bumping into things, or being bumped into, literally and figuratively. Adaptable and resilient,
theyare able to pickthemselves up and announce to theworld the truth ofwhatdoes notwork.

SECTION SEVEN: PROFILES, THE COSTUME OF OUR P_U_R_P_O_S_E -=2=63
You are here to be in charge ofyour own life, as well as a voice and person ofauthority in your
field ofexpertise. Learning about relationships is a lifelong trial and errorjourneyfor you as you
travelalong,head down and absorbed inintrospection,andyetbumpinginto people along the way.
When something about a relationship isn't secure or harmonious, you can become uncomfortable
and break the bond.You will then renegotiate the bond, either strengthening the relationship or
bringingitto an end.This can happen repeatedly,and is the correctway thatyour relationships are
deepened and kepthealthy,orbroughtto completion soyou can move on to one thatworks.
In addition,yourMartyr side has a tendencyto lookat all oflife as apotentialuntruth,evenwhile
your Investigator side is seeking a solid truth to build its authority around.You cannot be lied to,
and even as achild you quicklyfound outwho was tellingyou the truth and whatyou could trust.
Ifyou can surrender,your Strategy and Authoritywill guide you correctly through life,as your 1st
line Personality augments the trial and error process with further investigation.It's also important
thatyou havecontroloveryourenvironmentasyouhave to befree toprogressorganicallyfrom one
discoveryto the next.You are empoweredwhen encouraged to investigate or speakthe truth about
whatdoes notwork.
Interpersonal: Martyrs are often blamed for mistakes thataren'teven theirs,which can undermine
their self-esteem and create an 'us against them' mentality, feelings of shame, or an inferiority
complex. Ifthey, and those around them, understand that life is simply a constant and necessary
process oftrial and error, ending in discoveries that can then support a solid foundation, they can
find strength in theirjourney.The focus must always be onwhatwas learned from the experience,
rather than the perception that they have made a mistake for which they are to be punished or
ridiculed.This is the positive reinforcement that is especially importantwhen raising a 1/3 child.
When properlyencouraged, the moment a1/3 child finds out that the foundation does notwork,
there is thepotentialforwonderfullyartfuland creativediscoveries to happen.
Even though they may seem stubborn or resistant to taking the advice ofothers, in truth, 1/3's
must do it for themselves through direct experience in order to discover and learn. Parents can be
their strongest allies,encouraging them to "try"it, and then fostering a"tell me what you learned"
attitude, rather than"lookwhatyou didwrong."1his allows 1/3's to learnthrough discovery,which
encourages them to continue this process throughout their life, and allows them to ultimately
contribute to humanity, and improve life for all ofus.The only true failure for a 3rd line is to not
learn from their trial and error process. Investigative Martyrs can become secure self-proViders on
the materialplanewhenencouraged to take chargeofthemselves.
The chain of12 profiles begins with a 1/3 and ends with a 6/3.The 3rd line themes ofmutation,
trial and error, discovery, bumping into things, and bonds made and broken, are important and
prominentin humanity.Theseare themes ofthe mundaneworld thatbind us all together and keep
our species evolving.All 6th lines live a3rd line process in the first 30years oftheir life, therefore,

Your natural friendliness is also an intimacy strategy that attracts listeners and eventuallypartners.
What you are looking for is a confidante, and lasting relationships begin by building friendships
first. When following your Strategy and Authorityyou are very clear in your introspective process
ofinvestigation,andwaitfor the correctopportunityto tellothers aboutwhatyou havelearned and
discovered.Youaren'tjustlearningforyourself,orforitsownsake,butwithaneyetowardattracting
those who might be interested in and benefit from the information. In fact, you do not have to
discoverorexperiencesomethingpersonallybeforeyou arewilling to shareitwith others.
Investinginand maintainingyournetworkisoneofthe mostimportantthings thatyou do inlife.
Your investmentin people brings future opportunities to expressyour knowledge base. Knowing
how to make decisions in terms ofwhich people to investiniscrucialtoyourwellbeing;investing
in the wrong networks and people is detrimental and leads to burnout and fatigue. All ofyour
new associations need to come to you through an introduction by your network; you are not
designed to influence strangers. Your 1st line Investigator is not concerned with the other, and
your friendly 4th line Opportunist is unconscious, therefore, the onlywayfor you to knowwho
is correct for you is through your Strategy and Authority. Your opportunities in life come from
networks and people you know, and it is important thatyou neverleave one thing,such as ajob,
lover,orhome untilyou have somethingelse to take its place.Ifyou do,you will have ahard time
finding a replacement.
Retreatingfrom your networkat times is also crucial in order to recover from the fatigue resulting
from your social networking. You can exhaust yourselflistening to others as it takes considerable
time and energyto cultivateyour networkasyouwaitforyour opportunityto tellyour truth.
Interpersonal: The 1/4 profile is the conscious authoritarian and the unconscious abdicator.
Investigator Opportunists don't handle resistance well from others, and when they meet someone
who rejects their influence they will abdicate without changing their position, and simply move
on to find someone else willing and open to listening to them. The quality ofa 4th line's life is
dependentonthe qualityofthe network.Theyare verypowerfulandinfluentialpeople,fixed likean
oak tree,who project an aura ofstrength and authority. Opportunists who are living authentically,
however,do notcreate their networks- theymeet them through StrategyandAuthority.
1/4'sare lookingfor support,and aredependantonothersuntil theycanget to apointinlifewhere
theybecome anauthorityprovidingfor themselves. Once on solidground, theyare then in control
of their own life, and get their opportunity to be generous and caring benefactors for others in
return. As children they will simply believe whatever they are told. It is important for parents of
l/4's to onlygive them truthful information that they themselves are sure ofItcan be devastating
for a 1/4 child to find outlater that theywere lied to. 4th lines can also express a mean sidewhen
provoked that can come back to haunt them.Though it seems impossible to change a 1/4's mind
about a deeply held understanding, this same fixedness combined with empathy toward others is
whatbrings transition and evolution to ourtribal and collective foundations.

Background: Within the hexagram, Lines 1 and 2 represent the first ofthree yin/yang binaries,
and although these two lines operate differently, each is concerned with insecurity.To deal with
this, the 1stline investigates and studies,and the 2nd line eventuallylearns to tmstits naturalgifts
that require no study.There is an innate tension between this Hermit Personality thatwants to be
left alone to do its own thing, and the Opportunist Design that wants to connect with others to
externalize something.The conscious 2nd line is inherently shy and unaware ofits gifts, and has
to be called out by others in order to share them.The unconscious yet naturally friendly 4th line
provides opportunitiesfor these gifts to be called out byattractingpeople to the 2ndline.
TheHermit,as muchas itwouldliketo beinvisible to the other,isactuallyverytransparent.Others
lookin and see what the Hermit cannot- its natural talents and genius.The Hermit can onlysee
itself,though,through theprojections andfeedbackofothers.Noteasilymotivated tostudylike the
1stline,Hermit Opportunists are happiestwhen completelyabsorbed in their secure environment
doingwhat theyenjoymost.Andwhile theyare happilydancing to theirown beat,theyattract the
attention ofotherswho callthemout to share theiressential nature.

Interpersonal: Hermit Opportunists bond through astrategyofshyness/boldness.TheirHermit
shyness calls out to the other to be bold enough to break down their barrier to intimacy and
establish friendship first. Hermits are only open to specific people, however, and this is how
they enter correctly into intimate and lasting relationships.The 2nd line does not pursue, as the
Hermit is unaware ofthe quality within that attracts the other, but rather waits for someone to
entertheircave and say,"you arefor me."This is also the correctwayfor Hermit Opportunists to
enter into business commitments or partnerships, as it is those in their networks who recognize
and mosteasilycall them out.
Even with their inherent and unlearned gifts, 2/4 children need a good education and should be
encouraged and supported to study.rThis preparation will be invaluable later in life when their call
comes.They need to be 'turned on'though to get them involved, and ifnot interested theywon't

The Hermit Heretic must also have the loyaltyofthose itis stepping in to 'save,'as well as loyalty
to its own natural passions and talents that are the core ofits innate genius. The 2/5 must also
knowwhen to letgo ofthe leadership role and step backinto its hermitage.This is important on a

The correct call transforms you. Ultimately, your reputation depends entirely on your ability to
provide a practical, universal solution. Neither your Hermit nor your Heretic is very comfortable
in the world, and you can appear reclusive, seeming to withhold or hoard your personal resources.
This serves an important purpose, however, as it gives your energy, natural talents and reputation
time to build up in readiness for that moment when you are projected upon to provide practical
solutionswhenothersreallyneed them. Knowingwhatis practical,andlivingbyitinyour ownlife,
isessential.Yourconsciousbondingstrategyis''I'mshy,youhavetobreakdownmybarriers toreach

Interpersonal: Hermit Heretics that act according to their true nature are going to have chances
in life,especiallyiftheyare well educated in something they naturallydo well,and can handle the
projection field.Theyhave the potential ofbeing both called,and callingothers,andwillenjoythe
fruits ofthe positive projections that result from their ability to bring a practical solution to the
collective.The2/5 can be deeplycreativein thewayinwhichitestablishesits personain theworld,
and itexcelsinits ownself-marketing.When the majorityis incrisis and the 2/5 receivesits call,it
can transform and begin to callothers to a newprinciple.
215's are naturallywithdrawn,avaluable strategyfor them, as this withdrawal always brings others
into their life to call them out. In this way, the 2/5 is also generally assured, initially at least, of
meeting a positive projection.They struggle to maintain their innocence in life as the projections
pile up, however,and they cannot self-motivate out ofdesire.Theyare Hereticswho bring change,
and challengewhatis alreadythere.Ifthe challengeis practicalthen theirheresywill triumph,and
continue to triumph untilitis no longer heresy.
Hermit Heretic children need respect for their boundaries, and they should not be forced to do

Background: Ifthe theateris onfire, and thefire departmenthas notshown up due to budgetcuts,
the person standing in the middle ofthe theater yelling"This is not right,"while at the same time
organizing a fire brigade and finding all the exits,is the Martyr Heretic.The 3/5 profile combines
two potentagentsfor change.Resilient,adaptableand mutative,theconscious3rdlinefocuses itself
primarilyondiscoveryin the materialworld,and lives averyphysical trialand errorprocess,which
allowsitto sustainitselfand otherswithitsdiscoveries.Martyrsareequippedto take theheatwhen
they stand up and tell the truth about what isn't working, but they are not equipped to meet the
othergracefully. Life bumps into them and theybump into it. Like the 1stand 2nd lines, theyare
not looking for anyone.They are, however,looking around at the world in order to be stimulated
and potentiallymutate,and end up bumpinginto all kinds offorces. Some ofthese forces maynot
becorrectforit,andsothe3rdlinecanbecomepessimistic.Learningto discernatanearlyagewhat
works for itornotisveryimportant.
On the other hand, the unconscious but seductive 5th line cannot escape from the other. It
continuallyattracts projections from those who see the Heretic as the Generalwho can ride in on
thewhite horse and pullthemoutofcrisis.This can be quite uncomfortablefor the3/5 asfrom the
timetheyareborn,peopleprojectontothem thattheycansavetheday,andthenthe3rdlineprocess
kicks in and the onewho is here to help can do nothingbutmake mistakes.
As itmatures throughlife,the 3rd line naturallyprovides awealth ofexperientialwisdom.The 5th
line, the General,will be asked into situations where the Martyrwill know and see what does not
work. It can then stand up as the Heretic, take charge, and deliver something new and practical
that does. The anarchistic Martyr will play right along, adapting and experimenting and refining
the process every step ofthe way. Referred to as the great 'fixers,'they provide us with innovative
solutions,help andguidance.The3/5profilealso needs to knowwhen to relinquish thereins andlet
others continue the process themselves.They are not networkers with continual influence like the
4thline,and theirgreatestpowerand effectiveness is as astrangerofconsequence.

Most importantly,you must enter into both your explorations and rescues correctly through your
Strategy and Authority, or you may end up feeling pessimistic about life, or possiblywatch your
reputation go up in smoke.When a commitment is made correctly,you can step in with the full
force ofyourresilience,adaptability,determination,generosityand selflessness,and be sustained by
life no matter how hard it bumps into you. And even ifyou get burned at the stake,you willjust
moveonto the nextone.
Youareheretostandupforaprinciple,and tochangetheworldaroundyou bybringinganewvalue

Interpersonal:MartyrHeretics are masters ofthe material plane.When things aren'tworkingout,
however, theywill breakthe bond and walkaway.Theirprojected attitude may bestbe expressed as
"never belong to an organization thatwould have you as a member."Theyare anarchists who must
be willing to break the bond with anything that does not work, in order to finally discover what
does.There is enormous value for everyone to have a 3rd line around who is consciouslydesigned
to discover what does not work. Ifparents, teachers and others can refrain from calling the 3/5
pessimistic or negative, or telling them that they have made a mistake, they will save themselves
considerable time and energybymakinguse ofthe3/5'sexperientialwisdom.
We need to offeraspecialkind ofgrace to a3rdline child.Parentsand teachers mustallowthem to
go through their process with positive reinforcement."What did you learn from it?"or,"Don't see
it as amistake,justaprocess."Iftheydo not, the psychologicaldamage to a3/5 child can begreat.
WhenMartyrHereticscan'tliveup to theexpectationsprojectedonto them,theywillflee andburn
their bridges behind them. Ifthey can navigate the projection field though, through Strategy and
Authority, then the fullpotencyoftheir truth,alongwith theirabilityto adapt,find apracticalway,

Background:When thepessimismoftheMartyr meets the optimism ofthe RoleModel,together
they attempt to sort outwhat they really can trust in life.The 3/6 profile expresses the possibility
that trialand errorcanlead towisdom.AJl6thlines have athree-stagelife process.Duringthefirst
30years theyoperate as a3rdline.TheMartyrRoleModel,therefore,starts outlife as adouble3rd
line,deeplyinvolved in experiencinglife through onediscoveryafteranother,makingand breaking
bonds along the way. In Stage 2 (30-50), the Role Model tries to climb up on the roofto take a
breakand observelife.The conscious 3rdline continues to re-engagewithlife,however,pullingthe
6thline downinto theworldagain.Neither the3/6 nor the 6/3 profileseverreallygetthe pureroof
time that the 4/6 or6/2 profiles do.
Potentially,the 3/6'sdiscoveries willbe expressed as balanced and maturewisdom in Stage3 (after
age 50), a time when the 3/6 climbs down offthe roofand re-engages completelyin life.With its
unique and aloofperspective, the Role Modeljudges life in terms ofwhat is perfect or not,while
the bumping along in the trenches Martyr discovers what does notwork.Together they can stand
upfor a truth,and modelin differentways the transitionpossiblefor humanityifwe transcendour
conditioning, embrace our stages ofmaturing, become our own Authority, and live as our unique,
aware,and authenticselves.
Personal:Trustisabigissueforyou,as is perfection,whichcanputstress onrelationships thatcan't

commititselfDoingsomething,however,is better than doing nothing.You are designed to gather
experiences,butonlytheexperiencesthatarecorrectforyou.Relieffrom theindecisioncomeswhen
you have anavigation toolsuch as StrategyandAuthority.
While your 6th line unconscious wants life to be perfect, your conscious 3rd line needs to learn
aboutperfection through the often-messytrialand errorprocess.When things don'tseem towork,
your 3rd line pessimism can cloud your outlook on life, while the unconscious 6th line wants to
maintain its optimistic nature. Seeing your 3rd line trial and error process as positive rather than
negative,will help you to maintain amore optimistic and objective attitude aboutlife.There are no
mistakes for a3rdline,onlydiscoveries,which are criticalto your developmentinto an experienced
and wise role model. You must be deeply engaged with life, in a hands-on way, in order to learn,
and develop your self-confidence and self-mastery.Thejourneyfor you is to recognize the wisdom
ofyour 3rd line discoveries, and then allow your natural and wise authority to express as a living
example ofwhatyou havelearned.You are sought outforyour advice and blessings,andwhenyou
giveyour stamp ofapproval,or not,yourword is respected.
Itis also importantthatyou have timealone.The themeofbonds madeand brokenis notpersonal.
Youarenotleavingtheotherperson,butsimplyreturningtoyourownself-absorbed3rdlineprocess

to re-establish thatbond on astronger,more authenticlevel.
Interpersonal: Relationships that do not work out, especially early on, can be very painful for the
3/6profile,andmaykeep themfrom formingintimatebondsformanyyears.Knowinghowtomake
correctdecisions earlyinlife,willhelp make them readyfor theworld.MartyrRoleModels have a
deep capacitytosustainthemselvesand notgiveup,eventuallyleadingthem toobjectivity.Theyfind
that the'bad'experiences are reallythe mostimportantones that theyhave had. Societyconditions
us to believe that 'mi takes' are wrong. If3rd lines are not encouraged and educated about their
process, the 'bad'mistakes pile up and they feel beaten down, develop an inferiority complex, and
carryagreatweightofpessimism and shame.Theymaygive up andwalkaway rather than use the
experienceas guidance.3rdlines are,afterall,theoneswith the greatestabilityto uncoverthe truth
bydiscoveringwhatdoes notwork.Someofthemostimportantdiscoveriesinourworldhavecome
through trialanderror.To be a3rdlineis to befully engagedin thewonderoflife.
Martyr Role Models are both anarchists, and administrators who can happilyrecommend a cause
even if they would rather not be personally involved. If 6th lines understand the tripartite life
process,and live it authenticallythrough their ownAuthority, apenetrating optimisticperspective
will emerge in later years in the form ofexperiential wisdom. They will step forward as a Role
Model,guided bytheir discoveries,and showus the perfectionpossible in the 9-centered lifewith
its flowering ofpotential and truths after the age of50.This is anewpattern ofmaturation that is

Background: The Opportunist Role Model has the potential to be an important and influential
representative ofwhat it means to live a 9-centered life. Completing the Personal Destinyprocess
begun bythe 1/3profile,4/6's externalizetheirfoundation,and model through self-awarenesswhat
it means to live uniquely as 'yourself'This is an unusual profile as both lines are transpersonal,
however, its role is still one ofpersonal destiny and remains self-absorbed in its life.The 4th line
consciously develops and employs its social gifts and personal networks to enhance its realm of
influence,but the unconscious 6thline rarelyallows itselfto become intimatelyinvolved as it must
remain separate and unencumbered inorderto lookatwhatlies ahead.
At the unconscious level, the 4/6 profile lives its life in three stages, and the first 30 years can
be a challenging time as the 6th line lives as a 3rd line and continually bumps into life in a very
subjective way. During this time, there is an internal discomfort because the conscious 4th line
wants stabilityand asolid foundation,while the unconscious 3rdline mustgo through its trialand
error, experimentation and discovery process. The unconscious 3rd line learns by exploring, in a

You are not,however,interested in beingchanged byothers.Whenyou feel resistancefrom others,

dependents tobenefactors;theyshould notberushed outintotheworld.4thlinescanbedependent
for alongtime,butonce theycomeinto theirown theymakean importantshift.Recognizinghow
importantitwas to have a benefactor themselves,with their characteristicloyalty, theywill in turn
take care ofthosewho tookcare ofthem.Many 4thlines will become philanthropists,benefactors
to societyas awhole,and createfoundations that open up opportunities for others.
Relationships are everything for 4th lines; the quality oftheir lives is in direct proportion to the
qualityoftheir networks. 4/6's operate as a3rdline,however,during thefirst stage oflife, and they
can be bumped into byrelationships and networks that do not work.The most valuable guidance
that a parent can offer during the first 30 years ofa 4/6's life concerns the relationships that they
enter into, as these can determine the success or failure ofthe flowering into a transcendent Role
Model thatwill take place after the age of50.
Attimes,4/6'scanbeafence-sitters as the4thlinewantsinvolvement,and the6thlinesimplywants

with us.The Opportunist Role Model has agenerous spirit that wants the best for everyone, and
theyare able to bringlove into the worldwith theirwarm hearts and wise heads.When their trust
is broken,however, their sensitive hearts can be easilywounded,and the warm heart can turn cold

Personal: You are designed to study, learn and establish a solid foundation in an area oflife that
fascinates you,and then to influenceotherswithyourknowledge base.Yourfoundation iswhatever
thing you love to immerseyourselfin,and want to sharewith others. Investigating and becoming
an expert on a given topic transforms your inherent insecurity into an authority. Once you are
established as an authority,you can then go out to your networkand become an influentialexpert
in your field. With your 4th line people skills, you have a natural ability to know how to best
communicateyour knowledge base to others.
Your role is to network and bring together the research and development ofthe Personal Destiny

For all 4th lines, the quality ofyour life is deeply dependent upon the quality ofyour network
(family,friends and co-workers).Your opportunities to externalize your foundation come through
the people in your network, through friendly associations as you are not designed to influence
strangers.To effectively externalizeyour knowledge base,apersonal connectionis necessary.Ifyou

and make as manyface-to-face connections with the audience as possible. Or have a'get to know

importantforyoutohaveasolidfoundationforyourlifeintheareasofhome,finances,relationships

Even though a 4/1 is fixed and solid like an oak tree, there is vulnerabilityinherent in this profile.
You are so fixed that you can be broken, and the pieces can be hard to put back together again.
Understanding howyou are designed,and whatyour purpose is,can help you to stayon trackand
dealwith the challenges oflife.In order to staysteadyonyour course and enjoythe ride,itis most
important that you be exactlywho you are, and not change for anyone else. Foryou to maintain a

Background: In the I'Ching, the exalted or ruling 5th line embodies the theme ofa hexagram.
Forthe HereticInvestigator,the unconscious 1stline, representing the authoritative foundation, is

right one for you, and you feel insecure and unsure that you can provide what the other person
needs and wants. It is important for you to know which projections are the correct ones to say
yes to. Ifyou say yes when it is not correct, you can get caught in the illusory web created by
the projections ofothers, and make commitments you cannot live up to resulting in a tarnished
reputation.Itis healthyfor you to be suspicious and a bit paranoid ofthe expectations ofothers.

Ra has said, "The hopes and dreams ofhumanity rest on the shoulders ofa 5th line."This is a
big responsibility to carry,and the bestway to operatewithin this expectantprojection field is to
stand on asolid,practical and authentic foundation.
One ofthe advantages ofbeing a 5th line is that the initial projection from others starts out as
positive. People are projecting onto you that you can deliver what they need, and ifyou deliver
something practical,your reputation will flourish. Ifa practical solution is not provided, ifwhat
you have given them is a'house ofcards',your reputation suffers and the 'heretic will be burned
at the stake.'Without a reputation that can be trusted, your conscious 5th line may have to
change direction and begin again somewhere else. You need to make sure that, before you get
involved,youarepreparedwithapracticalsolution thatworksfor everyone.You do thiswithyour
unconscious 1stline,the Investigator.Your 1stline is designed to get to the bottom ofthings, to
studyandestablishasecurefoundation ofknowledge.Onceyouhaveasolidfoundation,and have
becomeanauthority,you areprepared toimpactandmutatesociety,whenneeded.Followingyour
Strategy and Authority will guide you to the right circumstance and timing for universalizing
your practicalfoundation.
You are a keen observer ofthe world around you, and preparedness, as well as correct timing, is
essential to your success.When the two come together, you are the Heretic Investigatorwho can
breakthrough humanity's habitofseeing things in the same oldway,and make yourrevolutionary
heretical point ofviewworkwhen all else has failed. Unlike 4th lines,whose greatest influence is
withintheirnetworksandpersonalassociations,youaremostpowerfulasastrangerofconsequence.
You are designed to interface with new people who are ready to receive your heretical mutative

outofthe projection field, to build up strength and cultivateyourskills so thatyou can be ready to
meet the nextcrisiswhen the commitmentis correctfor you.Youfind refreshmenton manylevels
through cultivatingbeautyand creativity.
Interpersonal: Heretic Investigators aspire to make themselves personally attractive in order to
improve their chances of universalizing, as well as to seduce a partner into seducing them. They
havevulnerabilities and insecurities,and are reluctant to showtheir true selfFewpeople evertruly
know the 5th line as theyare shrouded in an elusive projection field.The 5th line hoards, or holds
back, and waits for the illusion ofpower (the projection field) to build, and the right moment to
universalize the foundation. Providing practical solutions in crisis situations requires disciplined
patience. Heretic Investigators thrive on this process, but need to remember to return to their
waiting once theyhave satisfied aprojection,in order to prepare for the next.Theymustbe able to

floor,lights on,curtains open,dancingaround,unaware thatpeople are lookingin and projecting
onto it as well.
This rare profile is referred to as the reluctant Heretic, as it is quite commonplace for Heretic
Hermits to remain detached and uninvolved due to the uncertaintyofwhether they can deliveron
the projection from others.Although theyare a transpersonal profile,unlike 5I1's that have karma

truths in the world in personallyrewardingways, and maintains harmonyfor itself,as 5/2's believe
that the root ofharmonyis that no one should be pressured. In relationships, the 5thline Heretic
reliesonitspowerofattractiontogettheother'sattention,while theHermit'sshynessautomatically
sets up aprotectivebarrier to realintimacy.When apursuerorperson ofinterestappears, however,
this profile can let down its barrier, thus permitting the pursuer's boldness to effectively complete
the seduction and open thewayto intimacy.
The 5/2 child's need to motivate itself can be frustrating and challenging for parents. There is
tremendous expectation placed on these children to show their talent or genius in the world, and
to help others.When they retreat into their room instead to seeminglyplay around, their families
can project on them that theyare underachievers.This can make 5/2 children very uncomfortable
with others as they always feel the pressure ofthose projected expectations.They can also be very
su picious ofwhat others see in them,as theyare insecure about their natural talents and not sure
ifthey can meet the projection. In working with 5/2 children it is best to present many different
things to them untilsomethingturns them on.Theyareveryselective,butonce turned on theywill
call themselves outand share their naturalabilities.

interested in things with depth and meaning; the trivial does not engage you. Others see you as an

and the correctcall.
Interpersonal: Role Model Hermits are idealists looking for the perfect life and perfect mate;
someonetheycanstandwith,relateto,andbeproudofThepotentialpartnermustbebold,however,
and break through the 6/2 barrier. During the first 30-year trial and error cycle they jump into

the 6/2 on asuperficiallevel.
It is very important to support the 6/2 child in discovering their true nature, and to not shame
them for any trial and error 'mistakes'that are made in the first 30 years.They can be insecure in
their gifts,and can be their ownworse critics,as theyare always looking for perfection.They need
encouragement to explore and try things.When something does notworkout, aparent can guide
the child to learnfrom the discoverybyasking"Whatdidyou learnfrom this experience?"
The 3-part 6th line developmental process is something all human beings go through, and is
modeled and accentuated by6thlines as theylead us through this transition to the new9-centered
form.Theyare here to show us the way to live as adifferentiated 9-centered being,able to operate
and make decisions from our own authority. Role Model Hermits are here to showus how to live

Background: The Role Model Martyr, the completion point of the 12 profiles, combines the

three stages are experienced differentlyas the first 30years are experienced as a3/3 profile,which is
a doubly intense and sometimes very difficult trial and error process.You are gathering subjective
experiences,andyou engage in and tryjustabouteverything,includingjumpinginto situations and
relationships that do not work. You can become disappointed, and ultimately conditioned, to feel
pessimisticallythat nothinginlife reallyworks.
It is not necessary that you go through a traumatic first stage, and how you experience this first
phaseisdependentupontheparentingand conditioningthatyoureceiveasachild.Ifyouareraised
as yourself, respected as an individual and given guidance on how to make decisions as yourself,
you will have a smoother first stage. Ifyou are your own Authority, you will gain wisdom from
these subjective experiences and discover what is correct for you to discover. 6/3 children need
to be encouraged and taught to see that a trial and error process is not about mistakes, but rather
opportunities for learning. Otherwise you can end up with both a martyr and inferiority complex,
alongwith achip onyourshoulderand adeep pessimism aboutlife.

OUR TRUE PURPOSE
Rawas hesitant to release the GlobalIncarnation Cross information beforeThe Human Design
System had sound footing in the world because he knew that people would have a tendency to
interprettheircrosseitheras somethingtheywereentitled to,oras somethingthatwasinevitable,
regardless ofhow theylived theirlives.This is simplynot the case.
Our Incarnation Cross isn't something that automatically emerges as we go through our de
conditioning process, nor does it provide instant gratification; it's much more than that. When
wefunction as ourdifferentiatedselfin theworld,ourcrossliterallybutquite naturallytakesover
our life. Fulfilling our purpose takes a lifetime ofpatient and disciplined attention to making
decisions that are correct for us, combined with a dedication to fine-tuning our own awareness.
We don't awaken to our cross, we awaken in it. Our cross embodies the full expression ofour
awareness potential and our process ofliving awake.

Cross by combining the themes ofthe Sun and Earth positions in both columns ofthe Human
Design Chart. In the Mandala on the opposite page is an example ofan Incarnation Cross with
the Personality Sun in Gate 1 and Personality Earth in Gate 2, and Design Sun in Gate 7 and
Design Earth in Gate 13. Each ofus carries our own cross in life and all crosses are essential to
the whole; no single cross is more important than anyother.
There are 192 basic Incarnation Crosses and 768 specific Incarnation Crosses used in analysis;
a very briefsummary of each of the 192 basic Incarnation Crosses, expressed in very general
terms to keynote the potential ofliving a life with awareness, follows this introduction. A full
Incarnation Cross reading is needed to understand a cross completely. (Full Incarnation Cross
Readings are availablefrom an IHDS Certified ProfessionalAnalyst.)
THE FOUR QUARTERS
"THE WITNESS RETURNS THROUGH THE WOMB, TO BUILDAND BOND, MAKE MORE,
MEASURE AND DIE." - RA URU Hu
The four gates ofthe Right Angle Cross ofthe Sphinx (on the next page) divide the Mandala
into four Quarters: Initiation (Gate 13),Civilization (Gate 2),Duality (Gate 7) and Mutation
(Gate 1). Understanding the distinctly different themes of the four Qyarters expands the
meaning of our cross. Combining the keynotes of the four Qyarters into one descriptive
sentencewe could saythatwe are here to Initiate (begin) Civilization (build) through Duality
(bonding) and Mutate (or evolve) until we die.

through Mind, through thinking, educating, conceptualizing, explaining and sharing what it
means to be alivein aForm.Itsetsin motion the fine tuningofourmindaswelearn to surrender
to the directives ofour form. Once our mind is comfortable in our form, we no longer yearn to

The Third Q1larter brings us to the most mundane and intimately human ofthe four, where we
cross the barrier ofour separateness and address our need for the other, and mystically the two
becomes the one. In this realm we penetrate to the core ofthe dual nature ofour existence; on
the one hand expanding the Maya (Measure for Measure) while on the other connecting to the
beautyand mysteries ofincarnating.Itmakes our ability to bond with others a constant source of
wonder. Purpose here is fulfilled through bonding; through the genetic imperative to reproduce
and replicate the species bychoosing the best mate, thus ensuring humanity's future.The Q1larter

In this Fourth Qyarter, the cycle ofan authentic and transformed life is brought to completion, to
a satisfYing, peaceful, successful or surprisingly delightful end. At the same time, preparations are
made for new beginnings anticipating future incarnations at the next level ofconsciousness.What
has beenlearned and manifested as afully-lived lifeis carefullyassessed,scrutinizedfor meaningand
pruned; what survives is carried forward and made ready to be passed on as truths,foundations for
the next generation. In the Qyarter ofMutation, purpose is fulfilled by attainingyour full potential
for transformation and awareness.The mystical theme, accepting death, is a matter ofsurrendering
to what life is with an understanding that,when you have accomplished your purpose it is time to

HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE
Certified Professional Analysts are trained to interpret a Human Design BodyGraph. The
combined perspectives ofthe true self, who you are designed to be, and the not-self, where you
are open to taking in conditioningfrom the outsideworld,form the foundation for understanding
your design. Ra Uru Hu was a master synthesizerwho created alanguage he termed Keynotes; a
living, symbolic language that allows analysts to express the genetic continuity contained within
The Science ofDifferentiation's complexandrevolutionaryperspectives.Keynotes compress agreat
deal ofinformation into a single word or phrase. Like a mantra, keynotes invoke or awaken or
connect us with our body's chemistry, with our own unique frequency. Learning and using the
language ofkeynotes is like thinking with the body's hormonal messaging system; it allows us to
connect energeticallywith others.Almost every aspect ofThe Human Design System has its own
keynote associatedwith it.Bystringing the keynotes ofone's definition and open centers together,
professional analysts create a word picture or story of a person's character and purpose. As the
keynotes are delivered, the storypenetrates the personon acellularlevelthatis beyond the mind.
Keynotes have beenused throughout this bookto explainTheHumanDesign System.A complete

"HUMAN DESIGN IS NOTHING BUT KEYNOTES. KEYNOTES ARE IN SOME WAYS LIKE HAIKU.
THEY ARE VERY, VERY SPECIFIC FORMULAS AND AS SUCH, IN SO MANY WAYS, THEy'RE
GENERALIZATIONS, SO ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO
CAN QUOTE THE INFORMATION, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT. WE ARE A HOLISTIC ILLUSION,
IF I CAN PUT IT THAT WAY. WE ARE THE SUM TOTAL OF OUR FORMULAS. AND WE HAVE
FORMULAS THAT INDICATE WHAT WE ARE, AND WE HAVE FORMULAS THAT INDICATE WHAT
THE NOT-SELF IS. WE HAVE KEYNOTES FOR EVERYTHING. BUTTO BEABLE TO USE KEYNOTES
IS NOT SCIENCE; IT'S ART. AND ITTAKES PRACTICE AND IT TAKES TIME, BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT
THE FREEDOM THATCOMES IN THE ANALYSIS OF A BODYGRAPH, THE FREEDOM THAT HAS TO
BE THERE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT IT AND EXPLORES IT.
THE KEYNOTES ARE A SYNTHESIS. EACH KEYNOTE IS A SYNTHESIS OF THE VALUE OF THAT
PARTICULARASPECT. WHEN YOU LAYTHEM OUTIN ANYKINDOFGEOMETRY, YOU TRULYOPEN
UP THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REALLY READ YOUR FORMULA, SEE YOUR FORMULA
AND TO EXPAND UPON IT. KEYNOTING IS AN ADVENTURE. WHAT I LIKE IS THE EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW UNTIL YOU START DOING IT. WHEN YOU START DOING
IT IT'S LIKE AN EMPTY CANVAS IN FRONT OF YOU AND WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO IS WRITE
YOUR CODE. THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, WHAT THAT ACTUALLY SAYS, WHAT
KIND OF A MOMENT THAT IS FOR YOU, AND WHAT KIND OF GRACE IT TAKES." - RA URU Hu

----
Your gift in the world is your ability to act independently, to initiate action and to impact others.
When perceived as threatening or unpredictable, however, these same qualities can make others
uncomfortable,oftenleadingthem to tryandcontrolyouorresistyouinsomeway.AsaManifestor,
you can be at ease with solitude. You don't really require outside assistance, and sometimes you
wonderwhyotherswould even careaboutwhatyou do,muchlesswant to resistorcontrolyou.Try
to control they do, though, from parents on up. An early and unpleasant history ofconditioning
experiences, mixed with resistance, pushes you toward the not-self theme of Anger which is
expressed inone oftwo ways: as anger/rage and rebelliousness,oras passivityand accommodation.
Either expression causesyou to repress yourpower,and keeps you from realizingyourworth.1his
is whyyour Strategyto Inform beforeyou actis so important.Itrelaxes the resistancefrom others,
andopensthewayforyou tohavewhatyouseekmostinlife,namelythepeaceto dowhatyouwant
to do when you want to do it.You are a self-contained person, and at times you can see others as
ratheralien.Withyourabilitytolookaheadand initiate,theycanfeel outofsyncwithyour timing.
The concern that you have is "Will I be answered? Will someone be enlivened by my impact, or
respond to myinitiating question?"This underlying pressure to impact, to make things happen, is
the key to fulfilling your purpose. Although you are most comfortablewhen left alone to do your
ownthing,theotherthreeTypes arewaitingforyou to sparkorinitiatethemsoeachcancontribute
theiressentialpart.Andyou oftenlookto theothertypes to provide thespecificenergies needed to
complete whatyou dream. In aperfectworld,Manifestors get things started, Projectors guide the
process, Generators provide the energy to bring it into form or complete it, and Reflectors tell us
howwell the process isgoing,ornot.
Your Strategy ofinforming may seem unnatural to you, and you probably resist informing others
becauseyoudon'twantthemtoputupbarriersorresistyou.Youarenotdesignedtoaskforpermission,
andsoyou keep quietanddowhatyouwantwithoutinforming,hopingthatyouwillnotmeetwith
resistance.1his not-selfstrategyusuallybackfires,however,andyou meet the resistanceanywayand
oftenevenmoreintensely,whichcreatesano-winviciouscircle.Whenyou doInform beforetaking
action on adecision,others feel included and respected.Theymay notlikewhatyou are doing,but
knowingaboutitinadvanceeasestheresistanceandpotentialbacklash.Inaddition,informinggives
you an opportunityto use the resistancefield as aguide to righttimingand action.Ifyouannounce
to anofficeof50people,forinstance,thatyou are nowshiftingto a4dayworkweek,and 47ofthe
people are unhappywith this decision,you have an opportunityto adjustorrefineyourdecision.
Whenyou are makingadecision,your SpleenisyourInnerAuthority,and itisveryimportant that
you listenwhen it speaks to you. SplenicAuthorityspeaks to you quietlyin the moment,and does
not repeat itselfIt's 'voice'willfeel more like an intuitive orinstinctualrecognition. Ifyou miss its
signal,orignoreit,itdoes notwarnyouagain.YourSpleenis here to keepyoualive,safeand healthy.
Itwillonlygiveyouwarnings aboutyour survivalin the moment,and as needed.
In fact, your Splenic Authority flows out ofyou naturally, moment by moment. Such spontaneity
maysound freeing, butitcreates adilemmawhereyou may have to inform whenyou have onlyan
inklingoftheimpactthatyourimmediatedecisionoractionmighthave. Ittakesintention,concerted
effort, and living closely attuned to your Splenic Authority to be effective in your informing. For
example,ifyou stepinto arestaurantwithfriends,andyourbodystopsyoubecausesomethingdoes

for you to enter, and yet your Splenicwarning does not comewith an explanation.Allyou can do
is honestlyinform your companions ofwhat action is correctfor you right now,with an awareness
ofhowyour sudden decision impacts them and their plans. Overall,informing brings you greater
peaceand this iswhatyoudesiremorethananything- tohave noresistance.Whenyouarepeaceful
itisasignpostthatyouhavealignedyourselftoyourAuthority,and itisfrom thisplacethatyouare
empowered to manifestand makeyourunique impactontheworld.
YourProfile,thecostumeyouwearin theworld,is the1/4,orInvestigatorOpportunist.Yourprofile
is the role you play in life so that your purpose can express itself, and you are here to investigate
things deeply. You are driven to establish secure foundations in your life, and consciouslyyou can
be very introspective and self-absorbed.Your intention is to establish a level ofauthority yourself
that can be shared with others. At the same time there is an unconscious part ofyou that is very
influential,andhas the abilityto relate to others atabrotherhood/sisterhoodlevel.Yourcommunity
is veryimportant to you as you are designed unconsciously to establishrelationships orfriendships
thatwill bringyou the opportunities you need to getyour knowledge out, and influence others.In
any type ofclose or intimate relationship,however,itis important for you to establish afriendship
first. Strangers are not comfortable for you. By following your Strategy ofinforming and listening
to your Spleen's Authority you will focus your energy on what is most important for you, as well
as connect to your correct networks. In this way you establish a personal and secure foundation,
establishyourrealmofinfluence,shareyourinvestigationswithothers,andmaintainyourhealthand
well-being.As an InvestigatorOpportunist,the studyofpeople can be quite afascination foryou.
You have asplitinyourchartwhich means there are two separate areas inyour design thatare not
connectedtoeachother.Thesetwopartscantake timetosyncup,andyoumayfeelveryconditioned
that there is something missing in you that you need to be complete. One aspect ofyour split is
the Root Center connected to the Splenic Center and theThroat Center through the Channel of
Judgment, A design ofInsatiability (58/18); the Channel ofStruggle, A design ofStubbornness
(38/28); and the Channel ofTheWavelength, A design ofTalent (48/16).The other part ofyour
splitis the Head Centerconnected to theAjnaCenterbytheChannelofAbstraction,A Designof
MentalActivityand Clarity(64-47).
The open gate that can bridge your Split Definition is Gate 62, the Gate ofDetail.This puts a
tremendousamountofconditioningonyoutofind thedetailthatsubstantiatestheopinion.Youcan
becomeobsessedwithdetails,causingyou tomakementaldecisionsaboutwhichdetailyou'think'is
the detailyou need.In truth,asyou go throughyour investigations,your Splenic awareness as your
Authoritywillguideyou to the correctdetail.When notlistening toyourAuthority,you can chase
down endless details,leadingto overwork,overwhelm and exhaustion.
You have four channel ,or types oflife force energy,defined inyour design.This is the energythat
isconsistentinyou thatyou putoutto others,and itforms thefoundation forwhatyoucan trustin
yourownlifeprocess.Let's takealookateachone:
ChannelofJudgment:A DesignofInsatiability(58/18).Thischannelcreatesthe insatiabledrive to
challenge,correct and perfectfor the betterment ofthe collective and society; and to find peace in
316 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
the perfectedpattern.Whenyou are operatingas true self,ifsomethingisn'tworkingin the greater
world around you, you have the logic to challenge it until it is corrected.When the perfecting or
critiquingprocessis madepersonal,however,and turned inward onyou orthoseclose toyou,itcan
result in constant fault finding, and a pervading dissatisfaction with life in general that can create
friction inrelationships.
Channel ofStruggle: A design ofStubbornness (38-28).There is nothing more satisfYing for you
than to be correctlyinvited to stand up for somethingyou feel isworthfighting for as this signifies
that your life has meaning.This is the fuel for your personal struggle to find apurpose that makes
livingworthwhile,andthroughyourexample,eachuniquesearchformeaningprods,encouragesand
empowers others in theirown struggle for meaning.You can becomeverydepressed,or depressing
for others,ifyou areunable tofind areasonforliving.Ittakes along time thoughforyou togive up
yoursearch as you are designedwith astubbornness thatallows you to persevere through struggles
thatmostotherscannot.YourSpleen'sAuthoritywillhelpyoubeawareofwhatstrugglesarecorrect
foryou to enterinto ornot.
The pressure that you feel from your Root Center, through both ofthese channels, can become
excessive at times, and push you to step out ofyour Authority and struggle when you do not
need to. In order to maintain your physical health, when you feel restless, exercise is important.
Sometimes all that is needed to calm down and refocus yourselfis agoodwalkaround the block
to burn offthe extra steam.
Channel ofThe Wavelength: A Design ofTalent (48-16). You are here to master a skill through
repetition, or practice, while striving for perfection. A skill can be anything from playing an
instrument, to figuring out a scientific formula, to making your way in the world. When your
achievements are shared and become a part ofthe collective wavelength, you often serve awider
purpose, or improve the lives of others in some way. Ifyou can be disciplined to stay with the
repetitive process long enough, you will eventually be liberated from the learning technique and
your talentwilljustnaturallyflowfrom you.
Channel ofAbstraction: A Design ofMentalActivityand Clarity. (64/47).You have averyactive,
experientialmind thatneverstopsplayingwithpossibilities,andyouprobablywonderifitwillnever
stop beingbusy.You can experience considerable mental confusion as aresultofthe constantswirl
ofimages always moving through it.This confusion,though,can markthe beginningofanewand
inspiring journeyfor you as you discover what really does make sense. Ifyou remain patientwith
your discoveryprocess, the pieces ofthe puzzlewill at some pointcome together and apicturewill
appear.Your reward for beingpatient,forwaiting for clarityto emerge overtime,is the uncovering
ofaninspiringtale to tell,oranewperspective to sharewithothers.Youractivemindisawonderful
outerauthorityforothers,however,is notausefulresourceforyouin termsoffiguringoutyourown
life.Mental recognition for youwill come over time,while your Authority through your Spleen is
here to guideyour decision makingin the moment.
TheUndefinedCentersthatareopeninyourdesignaretheG,Heart,Sacraland SolarPlexus.These
centers are places ofdeep conditioningand potentialwisdom.
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 317
YourUndefinedG Centerconditionsyournot-selfmindto obsessaboutidentity,loveanddirection;
whoamI,whereismyloveandwhatdirectionshouldIgonext?Whenyouletgoofworryingabout
these things and stop trying to find them,you discoverwho you are, love finds you, and your next
direction shows itself,all as anaturalprocess oflife.
Your Undefined Heart pushes you to try and prove your worth.This plays out in manyways.You
might try to prove yourselfby constantly trying to improve yourself, or by overcompensating and
makingpromises.Youare notdesigned to committo orpromiseanythingto anyone,andbreakinga
promise can breakyour heart.Yourlifeis not aboutwillingyourselfto do anything.You'do'inyour
life through your Strategy ofinforming and your Authority offollowing your instincts. Once you
letgo oftrying to proveyourself,you can becomewise about knowingwho has an overblown ego,
who reallycan commit to things,andwho reallyis ofvalue to the community.
Your Undefined Sacral leads you to over-do,work too hard ,and often can be obsessed with sex.
You are designed to initiate an enterprise, but not to do it all or complete it yourself. It is very
easyfor you to fall into the trap ofdoing too muchwhichwilllead to exhaustion and eventual ill
health.Thewisdom available through an opensacralis knowingwhenenoughis enough.Slowing
down, setting and keeping boundaries, and making decisions with your Authority are the key to
keeping you healthy.
Your Undefined Solar Plexus, when combined with the Undefined Sacral, can intensify any
obsessionwith sex and romance.The Solar Plexus Center carries feelings ofdesire, intimacy, and
passion,andwhenundefined thesesensationscanbeamplifiedandpowerful.Infact,thesometimes
overwhelmingmixoftheemotions thatyoutakeinfrom othersthroughyouropen SolarPlexuscan
also lead you to avoid the unpleasant sides ofemotionality, even when it is important to confront
them.AsaManifestorwithanot-selfthemeofAnger,thisemotioncanalsogetamplifiedincertain
circumstances.The potential wisdom ofyour undefined Solar Plexus is to learn to discern which
emotionallyuncomfortable situations actuallyneed to be dealtwith.
In summary,you are designed to serve others by being an initiating force in the world.When you
stay alert to your intuitive knowingyou sparkothers to thinkabout the values ofsociety,and their
ownindividualstruggle as itrelates to survival,values and purpose.You have asharp eyefor critical
detail.Throughthesynthesisofyourinvestigative interestinpeople,yourloveoflife,thelessonsyou
havelearnedfrom the past,and the networks ofallies thatyoucultivate,you canuseyourinsatiable
talentand highlypressurized drive to influence and ultimatelymutate the collective.Opportunities
for success on yourjourney through life are dependent upon the quality ofyour relationships and
networks. Informing before you act on your decisions can lessen or remove the resistance from
others.As long as you stayconnected to your intuitive awareness in each decision you will stayon
trackwithyouruniquelifeandpurpose,andfind thepeacethatyouyearnfor.Thesignposts thatyou

YouareaGenerator,andyouwere borntoworkand toloveyourwork.Yourgiftinlifeis to perfect
ormasteratask,projectorskill.Yourgiftto theplanetis thelifeforce energythatyougeneratefrom
yourSacralCenter.Whenyouareengagedinyourcorrectwork,youexperiencedeep satisfaction.In
orderfor you to find theworkthatwillbringsatisfaction,itis importantfor you to'know'yourself,
and the truest path to knowingyourselfis responding to life rather than initiating.
When you respond you engage your Sacral Center in everything you do. Your Sacral Center is
the key to your happiness and satisfaction.The onlyway to truly knowwhat is correct for you is
by allowing your Sacral Center to be your guide for making decisions.To fully surrender to your
Sacral'sbuiltin navigationsystem,you mustremain available to respond.Somethingorsomeonein
yourlife asksyouforyourenergy,andyour Sacralconnects itsenergytowhatis correctforyourlife
purpose.In orderforyou to followyour Sacral,however,you mustsurrendereverypictureyou have
inyourmindaboutwhatyourlife'should'looklike.Andyourmind inparticularisveryopento the
ideas and opinionsofothers.You have arhythm, however,and adirectioninlife thatisveryunique
toyou,andwhenyou staytrue to it,you can also influence and mutate the rhythm and directionof
those aroundyou aswell.
A Sacralresponse is anon-verbalsoundfrom the gut.Ayes is'ah-huh,'whichmeans youhave the
energy needed for the task, and a no is 'uhn-uh,'meaning you do not have the energyto commit.
Sometimesyouwill nothave aresponse atall,whichindicates eitheryou do nothave theenergy,or
perhaps you have not been asked the correct question. Onceyour Sacral responds ah-huh andyou
are engagedin an activity,you thengo through a step-by-step perfectingand buildingprocess.You
must cover all the steps in your process.You don't have a motor connected to yourThroat Center
though (whichis the gearshiftforyour design),and soyouwillhitplateaus along theway.Ateach
ofthese plateausyouwill need to be initiated again bya newinsight,or new input or questions to
respond to.Then,dependinguponyourresponse,you canengageinyourworkagain.
When you do notfollowyour Strategy and Authority- when you do not wait for life to come to
you to respond and then honor the truth ofthat response - you experience resistance in your life.
You experiencewhatyour mind thinks ofasyour'not-self,'which means itis askingyou to actlike
someoneelse.Frustrationis the not-selfthemeofaGenerator,and isanimportantsignpostforyou.
Frustration comes from eithermeetinginternalorexternalresistance,and noticingyourfrustration
lets you know when it's time to check in with yourselfand see ifyou are pushing, or initiating,
ratherthanresponding.Youcanquitprematurelyoutoffrustrationifyoudo notunderstandwhatis
happening.Trustingyour Sacralresponses insteadofmakingdecisionswithyour mind can be abit
frightening atfirst.Overtime thoughyouwillgettoknowyourbody'sintelligence.Oneofthegreat
fears Generators haveis"WillI be asked?"Youhave itbuiltintoyour design,into the mechanics of
yourform, thatyou will be asked so thatyou 'can'respond.Youraurais open and enveloping,and it
pulls to you everythingyou need inlife. Allyou need to do is sit backand watch whatyour Sacral
responds to,or not.
Your Profile,the costume you wearin the world, is the 5/1,or Heretic Investigator.Your profile is
the roleyouplayinlife so thatyourpurposecanexpressitself,andyou are here to investigatethings
deeply.Yourrole ontheplanetisverytrans-personal,andyouhave thepotentialto universalize new
andpracticalsolutionsfor others inaverypublicway.There is an unconscious partofyou thatfeels
320 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
insecure without a firm foundation though, and so you respond first to deeply investigating life,
and to discoveringwhat authorities you can rely on. Eventually all ofyour research and studywill
turnyou into anauthorityyourself,and thenyouwillfeel comfortableuniversalizingwhatyou have
learned to thepublic.
TheHereticpartofyourprofileisveryseductive,and drawspeopletoyouwhoprojectontoyouthat
you canhelp orsavethemwithyourout-of-the-boxpracticalsolutions.Youwillalsofeelyourselfat
timesprojectingonto others thatyou canindeed save them.Itis importantthatyou do notinitiate,
however, and that you wait to be asked and answer yes only ifyour Sacral responds ah-huh.Your
Sacralwillknowifthisis the correcttimeforyoutoofferyourheresy,andfor otherstofollowyouin
it.Yourpowerto help others is more as astranger ofconsequence.Youaredesigned to step inwhen
really needed and then step backout again. People expectyou to deliver the goods, so preparation
andasolidknowledgebaseiscrucialforyoursuccessandsatisfaction,otherwiseyourreputationwill
suffer.Youwant to leave themwanting more!
The consistent energy that people experience from you is made up ofthe three defined channels
in your design.The Channel ofMutation (60-3),which connects your Root Center to your Sacral
Center, is a very individual energy that fluctuates and initiates in an on/offpulse manner.This is
verycreative and mutative energy,butyouare not incontrolofthe timingofthe pulse,and youcan
spend alot oftime wondering when the next moment ofcreativitywill show itselfYou can even
experiencedepressionwhenitfeels like nothingnewand creativeis happeninginyourlife.Thisis a
adeep process ofsurrender,however,and melancholyand moodiness are also apartofit.Ifyou try
andgive areasonforyour moods,however,or to change them,youonlymakeitharderonyourself
There is no reason, it's just the mechanical pulse ofyour individual, creative and mutative process.
Your energyis also veryempowering to others,and can mutate them in a newdirection as well,so
itisimportantthatyouletyour Sacralresponseguideyou to those situationswhere people are truly
readyfor the mutation thatyou potentiallybring.
You are designed to sustain your own creative efforts, or materially provide for and encourage
peoplein their own creative endeavors.The Channelofthe Beat (14-2) is an unconscious energy
that connects your Sacral motor to your G Center.lhis is veryindividual energy that empowers
through example, and so your first task is to be true to yourselfWaitfor life to come to you and
showyou potentials that you cannot even imagine - remain open and responsive to life. Ifyou
attempt to chase after or create your destiny, you will end up feeling lost and frustrated. This
energyis also about being the Keeper ofKeys, the one who has the resources to turn the engine
on and move in a newdirection.Itis onlywhenyou are asked,however, thatyou will knowwhat
that key or direction is.
You also have a magnetic presence that pulls others into your aura, your timing and your flow.
Through your Channel ofRhythm, also connectingyour Sacral to your G Center (5-15),you are
constantlymoved along bythe river oflife,vitally and intimatelyconnected to its continuous flow.
You appear to others to have your own sense oftiming which is determined entirely byyour own
innerrhythm.Andifthepatternsorroutinesyou arelivingare naturalandcorrectforyou,thenyou
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 321
should allow nothing to interferewith them. Ifyou live out the distortions and incorrect timingof
the not-self, however, you will find yourselfdisrupting everyone's flow, beginningwith your own.
You are always in the right timingand flowwhenyoufollowyour Sacralresponse.
You have six Undefined Centers in your design, including the Head, Ajna,Throat, Heart, Spleen
and Solar Plexus.These are the areas within you that are open to the conditioning ofothers, and
you areverysensitive towhatisgoingoninyour environment.This openness can distractyoufrom
your own response and flow in life.What is going on outside ofyou can have you thinking about
questions thatdon'tmattertoyou (openHeadCenter),ortryingto answereveryoneelse'squestions
(open Ajna Center). In truth you have a very open mind that can become very wise about what
questionsandanswersreallyhavevalue toyoupersonally,and to otherswhenyouuniversalize them.
You can become very wise about what solutions have true practical value, and do the research to
supportyouranswers.Itis onlybywaiting to be asked and then responding,however, thatyouwill
knowwhatanswerhasvalue ornot.
ThroughyouropenThroatCenteryoucanfindyourselftalkingtoomuchinordertoattractattention,
orto proveyourworth (openHeartCenter).You mayfeelpressured to knowwhatyou aregoing to
do next,ortojumpin to tryand save peopleinordertoproveyourvalue to others.Once again,you
have tremendous resources available energeticallythatwillsupportyou personally,and allowyou to
support others as well, butyou will onlyhave access to these resources when the timing is correct.
And you will only know this ifyou respond from your Sacral, rather than react from your mind.
You have the potential to becomeverywise aboutwhat reallydoes havevalue to the public,and to
expressitin acreative and empoweringway.
You may also find your not-selfholding onto things that are not healthy for you (open Splenic
Center) and avoiding confrontation and truth (open Solar Plexus Center). Your personal Sacral
authority operates in the moment, and your truth is available to you immediately through your
response.Ifyou do notspeakyour truth in the moment however,becauseyou are afraid thatitwill
affectyour security,or upset someone else,you cannot stay true to your own rhythm and direction.
Although it mayfeel confrontational to speakyour truth, this is the greatest asset thatyou bringto
the collective.You are a true hereticwho will find newsolutions for the issues thatwe all face.You
aredesigned to understandwhatpeopleneed,and to attractattentioninorderto communicate and
universalize somethingnewto theworld.
Everything you do in life that is not a Sacral response is a distraction from what you are here to
do, from the unique life purpose that only you can live out in the world. This life purpose only
finds you thoughwhenyou do notinitiate,butratherwait to respond.Throughyourinvestigations,
and practical understanding ofother,you have the potential to succeed in life and to bring anew
revolutionary pattern and flow to society's creative process. You have the ability to organize and
empower others to develop their own skills, and to tap into their own creativity.You have aknack
and capacityfor expressingdetails which can bringdiscoveryand metamorphosis to the public.By
stayinginyourownflow,andrespondinghonestlytowhatlife bringstoyou,youwillexperience the
satisfaction thatis asignpost thatall is wellinyourworld.

knowwhatactionis correctforyou however,you mustbe abuddhafirst and situnder that treeand
waitfor life to come to you.Your Strategyin life is towait to be asked foryour energyso thatyou
can hear and feel your Sacral response.Your Sacral Center is designed to respond through sounds
that come from your gut as either an 'ah-huh'for yes or 'uhn-uh'for no. Or you may respond by
actuallymovingintoaction.Yourresponsesarebasedontheavailability,ornot,ofyourSacralenergy
to connect to and dowhatyou have been asked.
Your defined Sacral Center is here to workand, more importantly, to love the workyou do to the
point ofcompletely using up your energy every day. Doing work that you love brings you a deep
feeling ofsatisfaction. The correct work actually transforms your life and slows the degenerative
process.Itis veryimportantforyou to knowyourselfand understandyour own process for finding
the correct work, and you do this through responding. You can move directly from response to
manifestation,whichallowsyou toseethestepsthatareessential,and thesteps thatcanbeskipped.
This gift ofefficiency creates a dilemma for you, however, as you can have a tendency to be so
impatient, and move through a task so fast, that you miss steps.You sometimes have to go back
and complete those missed steps.Youcanavoid thisfrustration,however,and actuallyincreaseyour

reach acalmerplaceinyourwave,you are notultimatelysureifthe responses your Sacral is having
are yourfinal truth. In otherwords,your truth comes to you over time,when you have had time to
process and 'surf'your wave. Without waiting for emotional clarity,you can end up jumping into
and outofthings too quicklywhichcreatesregrets,crisisand conflictinyourlife.Onceyourespond
to something,it is veryimportant to wait and allowyourselftime to process yourfeelings.You are
designed to takeintheworldandyourexperiencesdeeply.Thisis notalifeto belivedatasuperficial

Often your first response is the ultimate one, but bywaiting you gain more information, and you

The costumeyouwearin theworld, the role thatyou are here to play,is thatofthe MartyrHeretic.
You are designed to learn about life through trial and error. Life bumps into you and you discover
whatdoes notwork.You consciouslyexperimentwith life so that otherswho followyou can learn
from your discoveries.Andwhenyou discoverapractical and generallyheretical solution thatdoes
work,youareabletostepinwithgreatpowerand convictionandspeakoutorstandupforwhatyou

324 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
As a Heretic you also have avery magnetic and trans-personal aura, and others project onto you
that you can somehowbe helpful or save them.You can also begin to feel like the invisible person
who is onlyvisiblewhen needed,and as soon asyou have saved the day,youare invisible again.This
cancauseyou to believe theprojectionfield, and initiate so thatyou canfeelvaluableand needed.It
is important to be aware ofthe projection and to bepracticalinyour ownlife.Ifthese expectlltions
are not met,your reputation can suffersowait to be asked foryourhelp.You are someonewho can
bringhelpfulsolutions to others,butonlyafteryou have had time to master theworld inyour own
waythrough discoveringwhatdoes notwork.Whenyouwait to respond,and giveyourselftime to
emotionallyprocessyour decisions,youwill bump into the rightsituations thatwillleadyou to the
discoveries thatcan be ofactual help to otherswhen theyreallydo needyou.
You have a Split definition in your design.This means thatyou have two parts ofyour energythat
can feel like they operate independently from each other. The channels that connect your Solar
Plexus,Throat and Ajna Center are one halfofthe Split. The channels that connect your Root,
Spleen,Sacral and G Centers are the other.
The open gates that can bridgeyour Split are importantfor you as you can be conditioned greatly
through them.When you are operating from your not-self, these gates putyou under pressure to
initiateleading(Gate7-TheRoleofSelf); pressureyoutoactinthenow(Gate20-Contemplation,
The Now); pressure you to initiate conflict (Gate 6 - Conflict, Friction); and pressure you to go
searchingfor the spiritinlife (Gate 55 - Abundance, Spirit).Ifyou initiate,rather than waiting to
respond over time, you create resistance in your life, you get involved in the wrong romantic and
intimate encounters thatlead to conflict,and you provoke thewrong spiritfrom life.Initiatingcan
also result in you getting involved in incorrectleadership roles, and in acting spontaneouslyin the
now,whichis contrarytoyourpersonalAuthorityofwaitingfor emotionalclarity.
WhenyoualignwithyourStrategyandAuthorityyourespondovertime,givingyourselfanopportunity
forclarity.Thenyoucangetinvolvedinthecorrectintimaterelationshipsandthecorrectconflicts.You
can discover the spirit in life that is correct for you,lead others correctlywhen it is appropriate, and
'contemplate'and observein the moment,rather than'act'in the momentspontaneously.
You have alot oflife force energy that you put out to others through the channels that are defined
in your design.The Channel ofMutation (60-3) that runs between the Root and Sacral Centers is
anenergythatfluctuates and initiates.You areverycreative and mutative,but this energyoperates in
an on/offpulse.There is always the possibilityfor some new creative impulse to come out ofyou, or
throughyou for others, butyou are not in control ofthe timing ofthis.You can spend alot oftime
wondering,andevendepressedabout,whenthe nextpulseofcreativitywillshowitselfItisimportant
for you to accept the limitation inherent in this process by simply surrendering and waiting for the
nextpulse ofcreativity.Melancholyand moodiness are also apart ofthis process.Whenyou try and
give areason toyourmoodsyouenterinto theworldofthe not-selfThereis no reasonfor the timing
ofmutation;it'ssimplythepulseofthe individualand creativeprocess.
The Channel of Struggle (38-28) runs between your Root and Splenic Centers. You have the
stubborn determination to go your ownwayinlife against even the mostoverwhelmingodds.You
are here to discovermeaningand apurposeinthestrugglesyoumeetalongyouruniquepath.There
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 325
is nothing more satisfying or healthyfor you than to stubbornlystand up against the odds,oreven
risklosing a sense ofsecurity,for some cause you feel is worth fighting for, when correct to do so.
This 'struggle'gives your life meaning. Your personal search for what makes your life worthwhile,
and your unique struggles, are examples that push and empower others. Your energy encourages
them to struggle with the need to pursue their own individuation process and search for deeper
life purpose.This proddingis not always comfortable for you though, orwell received byothers,so
don'tletyour mind chooseyourbattles.You need to respond to struggles in orderfor them to have
value foryou.There is internal stress thatcan build up inyou,whenyou cannot adequatelyexplain
orcorrectlylive out the strugglesyou have engaged in, that creates an excess ofenergyin the body.
Regularexercisereleases thatpressure so itcan move throughyou in ahealthyway.
You are also here to followyour own convictions no matter how unusual they are.The Channel of
Exploration(34-10),thatrunsbetweenyourSacraland G Centers onlyoperates correctlyifyouact
and behave asyourself,despite anyinterference andwithoutguilt.Theguidance and timingofyour
Sacral'sresponses arewhatmakeitpossibletofollowyourconvictionsinsatisfyingways.Whenyou
live authentically,you demonstrate to others the benefits ofperfecting theirown behavior through
response.Andyou empowerothers to getin touchwith theirown conviction to love themselves.
Your open and enveloping Generator aura combinedwith the Channel ofExploration can attract
agreatdealofattention.Whether ornot this attentionis positive is completelydependentonyour
willingness to patiently tune in to your correct timing and responses.When you do,you are living
the true potentialfor empowermentand mutation thatonlyIndividualitycan bringinto theworld.
The opposite not-selfexpression ofthis channel (notoperatingthrough response) isveryrigid,and
cansound selfishand self-centered:"I'mgoing to belikethiswhetheryou likeitor not.You can be
anywayyou please,justdon't interferewith me and myway."
You are driven to seek experiences which promise something new and better in life through the
Channel ofTransitoriness (36-35) which runs betweenyour SolarPlexus andThroat Centers.This
is your emotional wave, and you are designed to be a "Jack ofall trades"who is on an emotional
journey to gather wisdom experientially. You are pushed along through life by the constantly
changing perspectives ofyour unaware wave, and you can become volatile, or feel let down, ifa
newexperience fails to meetyourexpectations.The secretis to embrace and acceptyour emotional
swings, give yourselftime to make emotionally clear decisions, and surrender to fully living each
correctexperience in the moment,simplyfor its own sake,withoutexpectation.
Overtime,andwith maturity,yourexperienceswillculminate as emotionaldepth, asyour personal
truth.The core ofthis truth is accepting life for what it is. Ifyou find yourselfnervous or uneasy
about committing to aventure, take advantage ofwaiting outyourwave. It may be alifesaver.As
youlearn over time thatfeelings are transitory,your advice to otherswill be to "seize the moment,"
and to partake in each promising new experience that is correct,rather than live with asense that
nothing in life ever amounts to anything. Your great accomplishment in life is that you will have
tasted,touchedandfeltmanythingsfromwhichyou gleanedwisdomofgreatvalue.Thisiswisdom
thatyoumakeavailabletoothersintheformofstories.Youinspirepeoplewithtalesofyourexploits,
andyoursense offulfillment in the richness ofalifewelllived,to enjoytheirownexperiences.

or discourses on life. Even though theyflow from your personal experiences and discoveries,your
storiesare notas usefulaguideforyou,however,as theyarefor others.Yourstories are to beshared,
collected,and storedfor reflectionand interpretationbypresentand future generations.
You have two Undefined Centers inyour design, the Head and the Heart, thatcan be distractions
foryou.Your completelyopen Head Centerpressuresyou to searchfor the nextinspirationalidea,
and to think about questions that don't really matter to you. The wisdom that you can develop,
throughrespondingtolifeandwaitingforemotionalclarity,is todiscernwhichquestionsdomatter,
and to knowwho orwhat is inspirational.YourUndefined Heart causesyou to try and proveyour
worth bymaking promises you don't have the willpower to keep.You are under pressure to be the
first, and the best, and to try and control the circumstances ofwhatever you have committed to.
You have nothing to prove to yourselforanyone else,however,and over-committingto things,and
making promises you cannot keep, puts tremendous pressure on your heart.The best way for you
to getinvolved in things is throughyour Strategyofresponding and yourAuthorityofwaitingfor
emotionalclarity.
In summary, you are designed to be an influential, creative, mutative, determined, experiential
storyteller.Adventure,determinationandexplorationarewhatdriveyou.Youwillwantto do things
inyour ownway,discoveringsomething newas you go throughlife,and attracting the attention of
others along the way.You will operate byyour own rules orlaws,providingleadership by standing
up against the odds for whatyou believe in.Adversity motivates you and you are designed to have
and share manyexperiences in thislife.
Others will be inspired by your determined self-sufficiency and expression. Your creative bursts
come and go, and are a big part ofyour life as theyfuel everythingyou do.When you initiate, or
jumpinto situationstoo quickly,you end up involvedin thewrongintimacies and romances.When
you fall into the trap ofthinking you have to prove yourself, remember that there is tremendous
powerinyour aura,and it operates correctlythrough responding andwaitingfor emotional clarity.
Your aura pulls people to you.You don't have to 'do'anything. It is built into your design that you
will attract the correctrelationships,struggles and adventures which will be the grist for your later
storytelling.In the end,this iswhatbringsyou satisfaction.

328 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
As a Projectoryou are designed with an absolute drive within you to integratewith the other, not
out ofneediness, but rather an extraordinarycuriosity.This curiosityis apart ofthe wayyour aura
works becauseyou have the abilityto penetrate to the self,orto the identity,ofthe other. You have
akeen abilityto'read'theenergyofothers,and instinctivelyknowwhere and howbesttheirenergy
can beutilized.This is yourgreatgiftas aProjector,beingable to recognize others.
Your gift as an intuitive guide for others only works properly, however, when you too have been
recognized bythoseyouare here to guide;onlywhenyou have beeninvited to sharewhatyousense
and knOw.Itis very temptingfor you to initiate and offeryourguidance before it has been invited,
butwhen you do,you will generally experience resistance and feel bitter about the encounter.You
haveaverypenetratingandpowerfulaura,anditdraws people toyou.Bytrustingand surrendering
toyourdesign,youareallowinglifetoprovideyouwithwhatyou need.Thekeys foryouare toallow
your aura to naturally attract people to you who recognize you, and to move through life without
an agenda.The moment you carry an agenda (want a particular outcome) you set yourselfup for
bitterness.Justshowup andseewhat happens.
Invitations from others areveryimportantfor you.All ofthe significant things inlife come to you
through an invitation.It's notjustanyinvitation though.Itmustcontainrecognition.You mustfeel
recognized when invited.You must feel 'seen'bythe invitation.When people really getyou, or see
you for your natural gifts, then you will feel successful in your life.When you try to get invited or
recognized, you meet with resistance and feel bitter.This is a signpost that you can recognize for
yourselfwhenyouinitiaterather thanwait.Theinvitationcanalsocome through anotherperson,as
for example afriendwho calls oremails orinvitesyou to considersomethingtheythinkyou might
like to attend.
And yet, all invitations are not correct for you either. How do you decide which invitations are
delicious for you and which are not? Your aura as a Projector penetrates deeply into others, so
deeply it is almost as ifyou are consuming them. Ifthe invitation is not delicious, therefore, it is
notcorrect.Decisions areeverythinginlife; theyareournavigation system.Eachdecisionwe make
takesusinonedirectionoranother.Decisionsmadefromyourauthenticselfmean thatyouwilllive
an authentic life.When you make decisions based on 'shoulds'you are making decisions based on
conditioningbyothers.YourAuthorityis howyou make decisions as yourself
The part ofyour design that you can trust to make correct decisions as yourselfis your Splenic
Center.TheSpleenisan'in-the-now'typeofAuthority.The Spleenisaboutsurvival,anditsprimary
job is to keep you safe and alive.This is avery existential awareness, and when your Spleen speaks
or nudges you, it is critical that you listen in that moment.The informationyou will hear will not
be repeated, and it is spoken in the quiet little voice ofyour intuition, but is very important.As a
projector you naturally have a strong intellect, and your mind will try and override your Spleen.
The mindloves to come upwith reasons for this and that.The Spleen does notoperate as amental
reason-making center. It is simply instinctive awareness; itjust knows. Ifyou allow your mind to
overrideyourinstincts,youend upintheemergencyroomsaying"Iknewthatwasgoingtohappen."
Inorderforyourlifeto operatecorrectlyyoumusttrustyourSplenicCenterand its messages,in the
moment.Theyareyour truth.
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 329
One ofthe beautifulgifts thatyou bring to other people is your ability to probe and ask questions,
without wanting or desiring a particular answer.You are able tojust be present to the truth ofthe
other- to'their'truth,notwhatyou thinktheirtruth isorshould be.Thisisaverytransformational
and empowering experience for the person on the receiving end ofyour questions.The potential
transformationonlyhappens,however,whenyou can operatewithoutanagenda.
Your Profile, the costume you wear and the role you play in life, is that ofa Role Model Hermit.
Timeis requiredforyou to emerge as arole modelwholivesyourauthentic selfYou have aunique
three-stagelifeprocess.Thefirst30yearsorsoareaverysubjectivetimeoftrialanderrorexperiences
in life.The second stage from the age of30 to 50 is a time ofobjective observation.You climb up
on the roof, so to speak, and take a look around and review the first 30 years. You sense that you
are being observed evenwhile you are observing others; this is howyou become asounding board
for society's insatiable curiosity about humanity. And it gives you great trans-personal power, and
becomes an attractingforce inyourlife.
After the age of50 you flower into a role model for others. It's time for you to come back offthe
roofand intotheworldsoyou canliveamongthe restofus andshowushowit'sdone.Thisisavery
specialtimeforyou,notunlikearebirth,butwith allofthewisdomyou haveacquired,and nowit's
time to use thatwisdom to experiencelife in anewway.The rest ofus looktoyou as an exampleof
self-masteryand personalleadership in terms ofhow to live as a conscious and aware person who
has transcended both thesubjectiveand objective.TheHermitsideofyouisveryhappytosithome
andjustdoitsownthing.Youreallydo notunderstandhowyou dowhatyoudo inlife,butasaRole
Model,assomeonewholivesasyourauthenticself,yourprocessiscompletewhenyouarecalledout
to applywhatyou naturallydo well.
You have asplitinyourdesign,which means that there are two separate areas inyourdesign that
are not connected to each other. One area is the Splenic Center connected to theThroat by the
Channelofthe BrainWave,A DesignofPenetratingAwareness (57-20).Youhaveaspontaneous
voice thatiscombinedwithincrediblysharpintuition.You have theabilityto adaptand improvise
in the momentor'thinkonyourfeet.' To trulyutilize thisgift thereare two things to know.First,
you must overcomeyour fear ofthe unknown and learn how to trust your intuition. Second,you
need to be alertfor the invitation to speakthat expressesyour existential knowing as wisdom for
others.In thiswayyou canavoid beingmisunderstood orignored.Listen to,trust and actonyour
intuition in the moment.Itis so importantfor you to be tuned into the presentmoment and not
distracted by the dictates and reason-making ofthe mind. Ifignored, the momentwill pass and
you will sufferfor it.
The other part ofyour split is where the Heart is connected to the G Centervia the Channel of
Initiation,A Designof eedingtobeFirst(51-25).Itissimplythenatureofyourindividualitytobe
competitive,and you arouse orempower competitiveness in others.Wheninvited,competitiveness
orshockcanpushyou into the unknown to stretch,testand eventranscendyour normallimits and
endurance.This is a true 'leap into the void'because the outcome is never guaranteed.When you
triumph,however,you getanewsenseofpersonal,evenmysticalpowerwithinyourselfwhich,with
yourgutsyways ofachievingyourpersonalgoals,becomes an example ofcouragefor others.
330 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
You also express yourselfthrough creativity.When invited, initiation for you becomes art as your
nature is to recognize both the potential for mutation in others, and the need to empower others
toward it because mutation cannot remain isolated and still retain its viability. On the mystical
levelyou are the shaman, a speciallygifted innocentwho artfully initiates a quantum leap toward
individuation and self-awareness.
Becauseyou have a Split Definition inyour design, there can be afeeling inyou that somethingis
missing.Inorderto resolve this feeling,youtend to initiate,goingoutintolifelookingfor someone
or something to resolve the feeling.You end up makingdecisionswithyour mind rather thanyour
Splenic Center. Remember, your decisions guide your life and ifyou are navigating without your
Authority thenyou are heading in the wrong direction, meeting the wrong people,and ending up
in thewrongenvironments.And then this splitinyour designends up confusingyou.The keyis to
relax,trustand allowlife to bringyouwhatyou need; to stop seeking.
As a SplitDefinition,you are naturallydesigned to have partners inyourlife.Your naturalpartners
will bridge your split and give you ahealthy sense ofcompletion orwholeness.In orderfor you to
have the rightpeopleinyourlife,itis importantthatyou followyour StrategyandAuthoritywhen
entering into,when being invited into, relationships.You will have manyrelationships throughout
yourlife,and eventuallyyouwill be able to teach the rest ofus about relationships ingeneral.

however, pressuresyou to answerlife's questions,and to chase afteroneinspiring thing afteranother.
This is an endless and exhausting quest.The wisdom for you with an undefined Head Center is to
learntodiscernwhichquestionsareworthyofyourattention.YourundefinedAjnaCenterpushesyou

to want to be certain about things in life.You have afear thatyou will look stupid ifyou don't have

to allowconcepts to float throughyouwithoutgetting attached to anyofthem,and to be okwith the
statement"Idon'tknow."Eventuallyyouwillbecomeverywiseaboutwhichconceptshavevalueornot.
You can get so detached from your bodywith an undefined Head and Ajna Centers that you are
completely out oftouch with your SplenicAuthority.When you find yourselfgetting lost in your
thoughts, bringyourselfbackinto your body because this is where your true self-guidance resides.
YourStrategyandAuthorityareyournavigatorin this.
YourundefinedSacralCentercausesyou to over-do,over-commit,worktoo hardand topotentially
beobsessedwithsex.You mustrealize thatyou arenotdesigned as anenergytype.Youaredesigned
to guide otherswho have the energy,but not to 'do'it allyourselfItis veryeasyfor you to fall into
the trap ofdoing too much,whichleads to exhaustion and eventualillhealth.Thewisdom foryour
undefined SacralCenteris to knowwhenenough is enough.Listeningtoyourbody-consciousness
(Spleen) is the keyto keepingyou healthy.
YourundefinedSolarPlexusCentercausesyou to avoidconfrontationand truthbytryingtobenice,
andnotrocktheboatandmakewaves.Youareopenandvulnerable totheemotionalclimatearound
you,and your tendencyis to personalizewhat you are feeling.To avoid these feelings, you create a
'nicepersona'thatyou present to the world.This,ofcourse,is not the realyou.Thewisdomwith an
open Solar Plexus Center is to allow the feelings ofothers to pass through without personalizing
them.To beempathicwithoutpersonallytakingon theemotions,and to standupforyourselfwhen
itisimportantto do so. Speakingyour SplenicAuthority,your truth,in the momentisvitalforyou,
evenifitdoes feellikeyou areconfrontingthe otherperson.lhebestadviceis to stateyourtruth as
simplythat- your truth- and not makeitabout the otherperson.
Yourundefined RootCentertakes inall thepressureoftheworld,andyou areinaconstanthurry
to get things done so that you can relax.This pressure is constant, however, and every time you
get one thing done, another thing is right there putting you under pressure again. You can get
caughtup inavicious cycleofhurry,hurry,hurrywhichcanlead to adrenalburnout.Thewisdom
with an Undefined Root is to feel the pressure and not react to it. Learn to procrastinate. Bynot
reacting immediately, simply to relieve the pressure,you can then discern through your Strategy
and Authority which thing really does need your attention. This way the pressure and adrenal
speed can supportyou rather than burnyou out.
When you don't succumb to the distractions ofthe openness in your design,you can then allow
your body-consciousness (Spleen) to beyour personal guide in life.Itis totallycapable oftaking
care ofyou through everytwistand turnthatlife presents,always makingsureyou areintheright
place at the right time. And once you are navigating correctly,your Incarnation Cross can come
into its fullest expression.
Youwere born on the Incarnation Cross ofIndividualism.As a Role ModelHermitand Projector,
you are here to demonstrate to others how they can uniquely be themselves without worrying
aboutfitting into the status quo; thatitis okto be themselves and step out ofthe box ofcollective

homogenization.Firstthough,youhavetolearnto beabsolutelytruetoyourownuniqueness.Once
youhavemastered this,youwillthenhavethe trans-personalimpactonothersthatyou aredesigned
for. It's a special gift in life to demonstrate what it means to be yourself; to be uniquely you. You
have towalkyourlifefirst,sortouthowto doitforyourself,and thenyoucanbeanexampleorrole

In summary, after gaining life experience through trial and error, and then objective observation,
you become awise role model.You are here to live in the present moment, operating through life
intuitivelyin the now,andwheninvited,to initiate and empowerothers to be uniquelythemselves.
You aredesigned to be provocative,tofight for yourright to beyourself,and to provoke othersinto
finding their spirit and purpose in life.You are here to allowyour natural calling in life to emerge
spontaneously, and to make creative, unique, influential contributions through your stimulating
storytelling abilities. You are designed to overcome your fear ofintimacy,your fear that no one is

When you begin to use your Strategy and Authority to guide your life, and you live as yourself,
you will experience the parts ofyou that have been conditioned by the outside world dropping

As a Reflector, you were born with a special attunement to the cosmic environment, and to the
impact of the planetary transit field. Manifestors, Generators and Projectors are solar types,
meaning their purpose 'shines'through them. As the onlylunarType, you are designed to operate
as a lunar reflection ofthe sun's programming, and to reflect the neutrino imprinting processes.

You have the ability to sense who is living authentically, and who has been conditioned by the
transitfield orbecomeavictimofit.Whenpeopleallowtheirlives to beconditionedbythetransits,
or those around them, they move awayfrom fulfilling their unique potential.You can sense those
who are ready to become their own authority,andwhen acommunityororganization is operating
correctly. You can feel the physical, psychic or emotional health ofan environment or group. As

Your openness is an exceptional window to wisdom, ifyou just allow everything to flow through

auric presence, also makes you a particularly effective facilitator ofthe group process. All ofthis
remains onlyapotentialforyou,however,untilyou are able to operate asyourselfrather than as an

Unfortunately,most Reflectors live ahomogenized life,trying to be something theyare notsimply

theworldunreceptive,coldand disappointing,theygiveintoothers'expectationsinordertosurvive.
When you begin to appreciate your uniqueness and practice detachment from (or not identifYing
with) what you are mirroring, you will be less apt to become lost, confused and caught up in the
turmoil around you.You can then acceptyour place in the center,rather than feel invisible and on

In the Mandalaaboveyou cansee how the 64gateswrap aroundyourchart,and eachgate brings
the potential for a different type ofactivation. As the Moon travels through your chart,over the
course of28 days, it passes through each ofthe 64 gates.This pattern repeats itselfevery month,
336
however, each daywithin the month is different for you and you can find yourselfasking,"Who
am I today?"and "Will I be surprised, included or invisible?"The monthly pattern ofthe moon
through your chart is something that you can learn to know and rely on, providing you with a
unique sense ofconsistency.
Your decision-making Strategyin life is to simply sit back, enjoylife, and wait for something to be
presented toyou.You thenneed towaitthrough afull28-daycycleofthe moon(from thatmoment)
before you make a decision. As you wait through this cycle you can talk with others, not to seek
advice, but rather to hear your own potential truth reflected through you. Use others as a sounding
board.These others need to be confidantes thatyou can trust to simplylisten,or perhaps askafew
questions, to help you articulate your thoughts and feelings.Theyare not here to influence or make
the decisionforyou.Overtimeyouwillbeginto get the clarityyou need to makeyourowndecision.
Ifyou still do not have clarity after the full cycle ofthe moon, thenjust continue to wait. It is not
healthyforyou to berushed.As amatteroffact,mostReflectors havebeenrushed all theirlives,and
theirhealth begins to breakdownfrom pushingagainst the naturalflow oflife; the resistance has an
impacton theirbodies.Ifyoulive asyourself,however,and do notpersonalize theenergies thatshift

wonderofthe moment. Forfurther detailabout theMoon Cycle,see SectionFour,Reflector.

Your Profile or the Costume you wear in life is a 2/4, orwhat we call the Hermit Opportunist.
Often called the missionary profile, the 2/4 combines the natural aptitudes and genius ofyour
conscious Personality (Line2),with your unconscious Design (Line 4) that is transpersonal and
always ready to interactwith the world in order to externalize what your natural talents can do.
The push and pull between the conscious Hermit (antisocial) and the unconscious Opportunist
(social) brings an interesting dynamic to your life.There is a pressure within to share what you
know,as longas itdoes not requireyou to investigate or train to suitsomeone else's expectations.
Others are watching, butyou're uncertainwhat theysee.You are unaware ofyour owngifts until

getyour'calling'in life.
IfyoustaytheHermit,inthesenseofnotlettinganyoneelsecorruptyournaturalprocess,eventually
someone will call your true gifts out into the world. Answering 'the call'is a transformative, self
actualizing force, which comes forth naturally when you are making decisions as yourself You
are not a pursuer, however, and 'friendship first' best describes your healthy process ofeasing into
intimate and lastingrelationships,aswell as the wayproper business commitments orpartnerships
are entered into. Your social and business networks are very important because these are the
communitieswhereyour callingfinds you. Onceyou receive the correct call,you cango forth with

bringyourselfbackinto your body.Your open Head Center puts you under pressure to answer all
oflife's questions, and to chase endlesslyfrom one inspiring thing to another.You can feel lost in
the confusion,and this can be an endless and exhaustingquest.Thewisdom potentialis to learn to
discern which questions are worthy ofyour attention, and to use your Strategy and Authority as
yourguide.YouropenAjna Centerpushesyou to want to be mentallycertain aboutlife.There is a
fear thatyou willlookstupid ifyou don't have the answers,soyou try to find the answers thatyou

what is past.The wisdom potential is to learn to allow concepts to float through without getting
attached to anyofthem,and to be okwith the statement,"I don't know."
Your undefinedThroat can cause you to try to attract attention bydoing or talking too much. An

to go in, and whatyour role is in the community.111ere is something really special about having

an undefined G Center. Your environment is filled with 'signposts' to showyou the way.These
signpostscomeinanyform, suchas apersonorsomethingyou read orhear.You are anaturalrole
model who can act out the highest values and ideals for the community, and identifY the weak
points ofthe group.Your identity and the roles you play in life change constantly, however, and
it's important that you learn how to be fluid with these changes. Ifyou gct attached to one way
ofseeingyourselfor to one role,when it changes you can experience alot ofpain by attempting
to hold on to arole thatis no longeryours.Thewisdom potentialis to trust thatyouwill begiven
the next signpostfor the newdirection and role when the time is right.
Your undefined Heart Center can push you to try to prove yourworth, and this can play out in
manyways. You might try to prove yourselfby constantly trying to improve yourself, or by over
compensating and making promises. With an undefined Heart there is no consistent access to
will power, and you cannotwillyourselfinto being or doing better.Yourlife is not about willing
yourself to do anything. What you get involved with needs to come from your Strategy and
Authority, not your will. Your life motto is "I have nothing to prove to myselfor anyone else."
The wisdom with an undefined Heart is that you can objectively read the ego ofthe other, and
know who can keep their promises or not, and who has a healthy ego or not. As important as
communityis to you,if you are notwith the right people,youwould rather be alone.
Your Undefined Sacral causes you to over-do, over-commit, work too hard and potentially be
obsessedwith sex.You can feel an uncontrollable drive to sayyes to newexperiences,or to expand
beyond what you have the resources for or the energy to finish. And even though you have an
instinct to nurture and care for the other,you must realize thatyou are not designed as an energy
type.You are designed to be the observer andjudge,but not to do it all yourself. Itis very easyfor
you tofallintothetrapofdoingtoo much,whichwilllead toexhaustionandeventualillhealth.The
wisdom potentialis to knowwhen enough is enough. Slowing down and making decisions slowly
and carefullyis the key to keepingyourselfhealthy.

one relationship before the next one appears,so be sensitive to the timing ofanydecision thatyou
make. Followingyour Strategyand Authorityallows the universe to also arrange the much needed
replacementforwhateveritisyou arelettinggo ofYou cannotfind the replacementyourself.
Your undefined Solar Plexus Center causes you to avoid confrontation and truth by trying to be
nice,and avoidingmakingwaves orrocking the boat.Youareopen andvulnerable to theemotional
climate around you,and the tendencyis to personalizewhatyou arefeeling.To avoid thesefeelings
you create a'nicepersona'thatyou present to the world. Ofcourse,this is not the realyou.You are
verysensitive to the true spiritualneeds ofthose aroundyou,and canhelp to balance theawareness
SECTION NINE: SAMPLE CHART OVERVIEW READINGS, HUMAN DESIGN IN PRACTICE 339
and energy of the community. The wisdom potential is to allow these feelings to pass through
withoutpersonalizingthem; to beempathicwithout takingon the emotions andfeelings ofothers;
and to stand up foryourselfand the principles ofthe groupwhenitis importantto do so.
Your undefined Root Center takes in all ofthe pressures ofthe world, and you are in a constant
hurry to get things done so that you can rest. Even though you mayfeel cautious about howyou
useyourenergy,especiallyin terms ofotherpeople's desires for you, the pressure is constant.Every
time you get one thing done, another thing is right there putting you under pressure again. You
can get caught up in avicious cycle ofhurry, hurry, hurry,which can lead to adrenal burnout.The
wisdom potentialis to feel the pressure and not react to it. Bynot reacting to it,byprocrastinating
sotospeak,youcanthendiscern throughyourStrategyandAuthoritywhich thingreallydoes need
yourattention.In thisway,the pressurecanactuallysupportandfuelyou,rather than burnyou out.

the Incarnation Cross ofthe Unexpected. You are designed for the unexpected, for the surprises
thatyour Reflector typeflourisheswith,andfor the unexpectedandempowering'call'thatyour2/4
Profile is here to live out. All ofthese pieces fit nicely together.You are an influential and caring
person,who can sharewith all ofus avisionfor the future, and apurpose for being alive.And you
can demonstrate to people through your reflections how to be accepting ofwhatever 'is' in each
moment.The mostimportantthings foryou to rememberare to slowdown and take as much time
as possiblefor everydecision,ideallya month; to notallowoutside pressure to driveyou; and to let
go offixedness and welcome the fluidity ofsurprise into your life. For the Reflector who is living
according to Strategyand Authority, the magicis thatmorewillalways be revealed.

SECTION TEN
HEXAGRAM LINE DESCRIPTIONS
A DEEPER EXPLORATION
The Rave I'Ching,completed inDecember1989byRaUru Hu,is asynthesis ofthe descriptions
for each Hexagram (Gate), alist ofthe Incarnation Crosses associated with it, and a description
of the 6 lines associated with each Gate. There are 64 hexagrams and 384 lines in the Rave
I'Ching. Forthepurposes ofthis bookthis sectionlistsonlythe 384lines.Foracopyofthe Rave
I'Ching please visit one ofthe authorized Human Design National Organizations; alisting can
be found in Section Eleven.
375 ofthe Lines express a polarity ofpotential experiences,which is termed either an exaltation or a
detriment,and isindicatedbythe blacktriangle symbol ... (exaltation) orthewhite triangle symbol V
(detriment).Thesetermswhenusedinstandardastrologyindicategood(exaltation)andbad(detriment),
butTheHuman Design System does not make this moraldistinction.In HumanDesign,these terms
simplydenote the'this'and'that'polarity.
A person's design is the sum ofits parts,andwhenlookingataspecificcomponent such as aline,
we need to consideritinrelationship to theentire chart.Ifyou pulljustone detailoutto examine
it, without considering the whole of the rest of the design including type, strategy, authority,
profile, cross, centers, channels and gates, you take it out ofcontext.To truly understand a line,
always step back and see it in the context ofthe bigger picture; the holistic view.What you will
find as you begin to studycharts is that there is a"genetic continuity,"an unfolding pattern.The
pieces have a theme that relate back to the full design, and you begin to see a theme for the life.
You also begin to see the paradoxin the life,and allofits complexities.
It takes time to understand lines; they may seem abstract, or like riddles or poetry.Just as the
I'Ching (Chinese Book of Changes) can take a lifetime to understand, the lines take time to
digest in the context ofthe entire chart. It's best to start with your own chart and spend time
with, even meditate on, your own lines over time. Even the recognitions that you may have in
the moment about aline, or the way the description resonates in you,will evolve as youjourney
deeper and deeper into your own experimentwithlivingyour design.
You will find your lines next to your gates in the red (Design) and black (Personality) columns on
yourchart,e.g.,Gate50.1isGate50Line1.LookforyourlinesbyGateinthissection,andreadboth
descriptions (exaltationand detriment) togetasenseofthe meaningofthelinesinyourdesign.Pay
attentiontoboththenameofthelineandthedescription,aseachcontainvaluableinformationabout
the line. Additionally, the description for Line 1 in each Hexagram will give you the foundational
understandingofthatspecificGate.
SECTION TEN: HEXAGRAM LiNE DESCRIPTIONS, A DEEPER EXPLORATION 343
Some lines, not all, have a one-sentence introductory description in italics. When there is a
description in italics it means that this is a theme you have an opportunity to learn about and
potentially grow into. Ifthere is no description in italics, then this characteristic is a given; it's
hardwired into your design.
Within the exaltation and detrimentdescriptions,thefirst sentencein regular type is the original
meaning as received by Ra. The second sentence in bold is a subsequent description that Ra
synthesizedyears later to further clarifYthe meaning ofthe lines.You will also see that there are
planet glyphs associated with the lines - they are listed next to them. Certain planets can"fix"a
line in either exaltation or detriment. Ifyou look at your own chart, you will see that there are
exaltations and detriments displayed next to some ofthe Gates andlines.In some cases,you may
find achart that has no fixing - no exaltation or detriment.
When we speak ofexaltation and detriment in the context of"fixing"in a chart this is simply
anotherwayofsaying"this"and"that".Thereis nojudgmenthereofgood orbad.The detriments
inyourdesignarealsoperfectforyouinthe continuityofyouroveralldesign.Infact,itisgenerally
in the detriments thatwe have the greatest opportunityto learn. Composite charts (your design
combinedwith another) and transits (planets moving through ourdesigns over time) can also fix
our lines.There is also fixing that can take place through the harmonic gate at the other end of
achannel.These areas are complex and bestsuited for an advanced discussion at another time.
Start by looking up each ofyour Gates and Lines in this section. Then read the description
line in italics if there is one and contemplate the lesson that you are here to learn. Read the
line descriptions themselves and feel the flow ofenergy that moves from the exaltation to the
detriment. Seewhat recognitions you have.Ifyou have an exaltation in your chart then read the
exalted line knowing that this energywill be emphasized in your design. Ifyou have adetriment
then read the detrimentfor its emphasis inyourdesign. Ifyou have ajuxtaposition (a starshaped
symbolrepresenting both the exaltation and detriment), then both descriptions apply.

408 THE DEFINITIVE BOOK OF HUMAN DESIGN - THE SCIENCE OF DIFFERENTIATION
"EVERY TIMEl TEACH AT ANY LEVEL OF THIS KNOWLEDGE, I'M
ALWAYS STRUCK BY THE SAME THING. WITHOUT STRATEGY AND
AUTHORITY, THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS LIFE. THERE'S NOTHING BUT
HOMOGENIZATION, CONFUSION, AND DISTORTION. As LONG AS THE
MIND IS INVOLVED THERE'S NO WAY OUT. THERE ISN'T. AS LONG AS
THE MIND IS CONTROLLING YOUR LIFE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
YOU CAN DO. YOU'RE LOST. YOU'RE JUST LOST. AND YOU END UP
SUFFERING DEEPLY. IT'S SO SIMPLE.
THIS IS THE WHOLE THING. IT'S THE DECONDITIONING. IT'S THE
DECONDITIONING AWAY FROM HOMOGENIZATION TO DIFFERENTIATION.
IT'S ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT A POSSIBILITY, AND IT'S ONLY A
POSSIBILITY, IT'S NOT A PROBABILITY; A POSSIBILITY THAT ALONG
THIS WAY THERE ARE THOSE WITH WHOM YOU CAN COMMUNE WITH IN
AN EXTRAORDINARY WAY. IT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
I SO ENJOYED BEING ABLE TEACH AT A VERY HIGH INTELLECTUAL LEVEL,
TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TRUTHS ABOUT
THE NATURE OF BEING AND THE NATURE OF LIFE. IT'S A PRIVILEGE,
IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE. AND THAT IT'S MORE THAN JUST CHIT CHAT,
BECAUSE I AM A 5; IT IS PRACTICAL. BYE FOR NOW." - RA URU Hu

selves.When a couple understands themselves from the vantage point oftheir individual designs
as well as their combined design, there is the potential for a relationship based on authenticity,
compassion, acceptance and respect. In a Partnership reading you will learn how to communicate

RAVE PSYCHOLOGY
Rave Psychology holds the key to employing your mind as an ally.When you discover howyour
unique cognitionworks,you are able to create aworkingpartnership between mind and body.The
mind has strategies to cope with the openness in your chart.These strategies attempt to manage
the ever-changing energies that stream into, around and through you.These coping mechanisms
attempt to keep the mind in a dominant position in your life, thus reinforcing the contradiction
betweenbodyandmind.Recognitionofthe correctfunctioning ofyourownmindbeginsbyseeing
whatis natural toyou. Rave Psychologydelves into the deepestlevels ofthewayyour mind digests
the information it takes in from the world around you. Rave Psychology provides a complete
understandingofthewaythehumanmindworksinitsfundamentalduality,thehomogenizedmind
and the differentiated mind. Slowlybutsurely,this understandingpermeates thebeingandleads to
the awakeningofpassengerconsciousness.

THE DESIGN OF FORMS
In traditional astrology, an astrological chart would be the same for a chicken or a human. The
extraordinary potential ofThe Human Design System is that the design ofHumans is only one
aspectofthe revealed knowledgewhich included specific Designs for allforms oflife down to the
singlecell.Theinterconnectiveness ofallforms is illustratedin thefollowing designs.
DESIGN OF MAMMALS
Mammals,likehumans,areendowedwithtwoCrystalsofConsciousnessandaMagneticMonopole.
All forms ofLife, including humans, have a direct impact on each other and can be agents of
conditioning.Throughouttheworld,mammals have awidespread influence on the dayto daylives
ofhumans.The aura ofahouse catis as large as anyhumans.Itis clearfrom the potential oftheir
Designthatanimalscanconditionourrhythmand direction.Havingdogsinourlivesisevidenceof
that,as theygetus up in the morningso that theycan pullus alongon theirleash.
Mammals can also bring beneficial health conditioning through their Splenic Centers. Human
Designis notjustabout humans.Ifyou aregoing to bringan animalintoyourlife,itis agoodidea

Companionship:
Bothpartners have the same channelorgate defined in their BodyGraph.This is the potential
forfriendship, the shared experience.
Compromise:
Onepartnerdefines thewhole channeland the otherdefines onlyasinglegate in the channel.
The partner that only has one gate of the channel activated is always compromised by the
partnerwith the complete channel.
Composite:
The integration oftwo designs; the foundation for relationship is establishedwhere definition
exists in the composite. There are four kinds of defining connections. (see Companionship,
Compromise,Dominance,and Electro-Magnetic)
Conception:
The vast majorityofthe Crystals ofConsciousness are not incarnated inliving forms and never
will. Grouped in "Bundles," they maintain a continuous planetary consciousness field. In each
ofthese "bundles"there are specific Crystals, however, that are waiting to incarnate.When not
incarnated, Design Crystals, with their magnetic monopoles embedded within them, cluster
within the mantle ofthe Earth.PersonalityCrystals orbitwithin theAtmosphere.The initiation
ofthe conceptionsequence takes placewhen theMagneticMonopoleand itsDesignCrystalare
attracted from the"bundle"beneath the Earth's mantle bythe MagneticMonopole ofthe male.
The attractedDesign Crystalenters the male's SolarPlexuscenterandlodgesin the 6th gate.
Atthemomentoforgasm,theDesignCrystal,nowwithinthesinglespermand directed bythe
crystal'sMagneticMonopole,moves throughtheChannelofMatingand Reproduction (59-6)
from the male SolarPlexus into thefemale Sacralcenter,and into the Egg.This is the moment
ofConception, and the initiation ofan incarnation cycle. As the Neutrino stream penetrates
the mother,it also penetrates the cell and passes through the cell's Design Crystal,which then
begins theworkofbuilding the bodyofthe child.
Conditioning:
Pressure,expectations orinfluencesfrom outside sources that are used bythe mind to conform
to patterns that are notpart ofwhowe are (not-self); adaptive strategieswhich become habits
and take us awayfrom orrepress orconceal ourtrue selfandpurposefor incarnating.
Conscious:
All ofthe Personalitydata, in black on the BodyGraph, that we experience, are aware of, and
identifYwith.
CrystalsofConsciousness:
Everyliving thing is endowed with two Crystals ofConsciousness: the Design Crystal, an
aspectofthe originalYin,and the PersonalityCrystal,an aspectofthe originalYang.There
is no Personality Crystal in either the single cell or the inanimate. (see Design,Personality
Crystals)

aline.(see Lines)
SECTION ELEVEN: OTHER RESOURCES, GLOSSARY, KEYNOTES AND MO_R_E 4--"2=--7
Disappointment:
Not-selfthemeofReflector. (see Reflector)
Dissonance:
In HexagramTheory,anyline relationship thatdoes notcreateharmony(i.e. 1/4) orresonance
(i.e. 1/1) in relationship to another line, is considered in dissonance. There is a conflict or
incongruitybetween the two lines (i.e.2/3 or 1/6).(seeHarmonyand Resonance)
Dominance:
One partner defines the entire channel while the other does not activate (define) either of
the channel's gates.The defined channel can only be accepted and surrendered to as away to
experience the energyofthe other.
Dormantgate:
A gate (in an undefined center) thatis alone in achannel,and open to receiving the harmonic
gatevia an electromagneticconnection through the auraofanother,oratransit.
Driver:
Gate 2 is the seat ofthe Magnetic Monopole (the Driver),which knows the trajectory ofthe
vehicle,where the form is going and how to get it there; the Driver is not to be influenced by
the Passenger. (seeMagneticMonopole)
Duality:
The universeandeverythingitcontainsisdualisticin nature.Humans,through theirgenetic
structure (DNA/RNA), are also designed as dualistic bio-systems. In physics, the universe
began as a dualitywith its expansion through Qyarks and Leptons.This is our up - down,
in - out, right- wrong reality. In Human Design, the duality is reflected through the two
sets ofdata (Personality and Design) which determine the uniqueness ofan individual in
the BodyGraph.
Ego/HeartCenter:
(see Centers)
88degreesoftheSun:
The PersonalityCrystal,or Soul,is calledinto thefetus atthe momentthatthe basicstructureof
thebrain'sneocortexiscompleteand thevehicleisreadytobeginitsjourneyofself-consciousness
in form. The time ofentry is exactly 88 degrees (88 or 89 days) ofthe Sun's movement before
birth. Pre-mature births do notalter this formula, but are an indication that the fetus'neocortex
has developed more rapidlythanusual.Formostpregnancies,this eventtakes placeat theend of
thesecond trimester.Duringthefinal trimester,thePersonalityis able to adapt toits newvehicle.
The timeofbirthshows us thepotentialofthePersonalityafteritsperiodofadaptation.
Electro-Magnetic:

(Individual) and 52-9 (Collective/Logical).There is noformat channelfor theTribalCircuit.
Form/FormPrinciple:
Our physical forms; our 9-centered form was the focus ofthe Voice's revelation,and the basis
ofTheHumanDesign System.
Fractal:
Every human being through their Personality Crystal is linked through a fractal line to
other Personality Crystals. Fractal lines formed at the Big Bang when the prime Crystal of
Consciousness shattered. Information moves down our individual fractal lines. There are 66
fractal lines, 66 archetypal ways in which information moves, and each have nuances that are
fundamentally different from each other.These fractal lines are each associated with a star in
our universe (including our sun) as stars produce neutrinos. Everysingle star is adata bankof
consciousness,and throughits neutrinostreamestablishes specificlinesofmovinginformation.
Everyhumanbeingis connectedto oneofthesefractals,and to allofthe otherswho sharethat
fractal line.This creates asense offamiliarity between people the closer theyare to each other

"LOVE YOURSELF" - RA URU HU
439
I HOPE YOU HAVE ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT HAS BEEN A LABOR OF LOVE AND
IS AN ATTEMPT TO WRITE DOWN AND RECORD THE HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM
AS RA URU Hu WANTED. ITWAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHERE AND WHEN
TO STOP. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO INCLUDE ABOUT THIS KNOWLEDGE. IN
ORDER TO GET THIS OUT INTO THE WORLD WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE.
RA URU Hu HAD A WONDERFUL AND UNIQUE WAY ABOUT HIM, AND MANY OF
US WHO HAVE HAD THE GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED
WITH HIM LOVE TO QUOTE HIM. I HOPE THAT BY INCLUDING MANY OF HIS
QUOTES IN THIS BOOK, YOU ALSO HAVE A SENSE OF WHO HE WAS. THIS IS MY
ALL TIME FAVORITE, AND HAS SPECIAL MEANING FOR ME. - LYNDA BUNNELL
