This book is a transcript from The Channels Course taught by Ra Uru Hu in Taos, New
Mexico April 8-15, 1999. Each day he gave a full transit report, expanding on aspects of
certain planets, as well as how to interpret the conditioning of the transiting program,
particularly the line values for the day.
NNNNooootttteeee: Numeric separators – Channels are indicated with a hyphen, like 20-34. A gate and its
line are indicated with a period, like 34.2. Profiles are indicated with a slash, like 5/1.

Yeah, it’s Monday the 12th (April 12, 1999, Taos, NM) and the Sun/Earth is
in the 42-32. Always notice something about going through the ephemeris.
Please understand that there are three things that you’re dealing with.
One thing is you’re dealing with the impact of the program on yourself. The
second thing, you’re dealing with the fact that the program is affecting
everybody around you, so you are looking at the environment of the day. And
the final thing is to understand that there are babies being born and are carrying
the information of this day into the future for the next 70, 80, 90 years. So it’s
fascinating for you to pay attention to the fact that each day that you look at an
ephemeris, you’re looking at a generation coming into the world. It tells you
something about what’s ahead.
SSSSuuuunnnn----EEEEaaaarrrrtttthhhh iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeeessss 44442222----33332222,,,, SSSSeeeeccccoooonnnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy
So first of all, the 42 and the 32, whenever you are looking at the Sun/Earth on
any given day, please just pay
attention to the lines. The fact that
this is a second line means that you
really have to be called on this day,
because that’s what second lines are
all about.
And the reality is that with the Sun
in the 42nd gate, this is about
bringing things to their completion
in order to be able to start a new
beginning next week when you
have the Sun move into the third
gate, difficulty at the beginning.
This is a very important transition
point, and so things are called out
and brought to an end on a day like today.

The 32, remember that the 32 is about our conservative nature and it’s about
the value of things and so the value of things are very important today, whether
my teaching is worth your investment today, as an example.

The Nodes of the Moon are our seasons, and of course this is a very important
season we’ve been living in, because we’ve been living in the 4-49 season.
The 49th gate being the South Node, being
the theme that we’re coming from is trying
to find the right principles. And of course
that’s an essential ingredient for the health
of the community, trying to find the right
principles and the right principles to work
by.
And remember that in dealing with
principles, you’re dealing with the theme of
revolution and revolution can be violent.
We have a war of principles going on in
Europe right now. It’s all about principles.
The Serbs have their principle. That is their
historic land, that’s where they fought their great battle against the Turks. It’s
their privilege and right. And then NATO has its principles that say you can’t
chase people out of their homes just because you don’t like them. So, you have
a war of principles.
What happens is that the movement is you’re always moving from the 49 to the
4. In other words, you’re moving from trying to find out what the hell the
principle is and then moving from the principle to an answer. So this whole
season of the 49-4 is the season of re-establishing clearly what your principles
are in order to come up with the necessary formula.
Now that isn’t to say that the formula is guaranteed to work, obviously. The 4th
gate is simply part of a stream. That formula is going to have to be tested in
time. But the reality is that this is a very important time as a planetary
environment to be able to find the right principles and have those principles
become answers for them.

I’m going to be as emotional as hell today.
I’m not going to nurture you at all, I’m
going to piss you off. Starting early this
morning the Moon went into 55.
Think about what that means, by the way,
is that in your dream life everything was
deeply influenced, particularly what is
common which is the morning dreams
that people have. And there you have the
55th gate, and this is a morning where you
can really wake up on the wrong side of
the bed, because this is the nature of the
55th gate.
It is the gate that when you wake up and you look at the glass beside you, you
say it’s half-full or you say it’s half-empty, depending on how you relate to that
wave. So the fact of the matter is that we’re dealing with this until after lunch.
So after lunch we’re all going to be
very huggy, huggy because after lunch
the Moon goes into 37. Now think
about what that means when you
understand the nature of the program
and you go out. You have to realize
something, that if you have an
appointment this afternoon, it’s more
likely to be a friendly meeting because
that’s the conditioning element.
The conditioning element is that there
is the Moon in 37 making everybody
feel kind of huggy. Let me be your
friend. So it’s one of those things in
watching the program is that you pay attention to the environment. This is
creating an environment.
11112222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
Yeah, if you take a look at Friday just for a moment, Friday is the most
devastating day you can meet in any given year. Anybody that wants to commit
suicide on Friday, please do it publicly
here so we can see how the transits
work in effect. I do have a black
sense of humor, don’t I? The Earth
in the 32nd gate in the sixth line
which is about as depressing a line as
you’ll find. And at the same time
you’re going to have Mars in 28.6,
blaze of glory. So, that’s quite a day.
So look out, that’s going to be in the
environment.
Now that isn’t to say that we’re going
to have a lot of people committing
Hara Kiri, but the reality is that this
can be a day that is deeply depressing for people. It’s not a time where if
you’ve got good news, you’re going to get the kind of response that you
thought you would.
MMMMoooooooonnnn iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 66663333
Anyway, interesting when you go to sleep
at 10:30 this evening, the Moon’s going
into the 63rd gate and it means that
everybody’s going to have an evening of
being programmed with doubts. So if you
wake up in the morning and you really
don’t know what to do with your life, it’s
only the Moon and it’s all okay. And if you
wake up deeply suspicious about
everything, it’s okay. It’s just the Moon.
But, there’re a lot of people who are going
to wake up on Tuesday morning paranoid
as hell, because that’s what’s in the air. And if you don’t have anything in the
63rd gate and you don’t have the 4th gate, then all of a sudden your mind is
flooded with doubts. And if you have that experience while you’re
unconscious and asleep, when you wake up in the morning there’s all this
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 11113333
accumulated pressure. And all of a sudden things that you had taken for
granted, you’re suspicious about. And you end up spending a lot of energy
dealing with it when it was only a 12-hour transit. The one thing that you do
know is that even when you’re aware of that, the vast majority of the planet is
not, and they all wake up that way because that’s the environment of the day.
MMMMeeeerrrrccccuuuurrrryyyy iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 33336666....3333
It’s always interesting. Mercury is there to communicate the need for
experience. That’s what it’s doing in the
36. After all the 36th gate is the gate of
inexperience and it is the longing for the
desire for experience. So Mercury is here
to communicate desire. It doesn’t
necessarily mean desire gets manifested in
fact, but it’s here to communicate the
desire. So there’s a lot of people under the
influence of Mercury in 36 who are
dreaming of experiences, longing for
experiences and telling people about them,
which can bring their own crisis because
these aren’t necessarily experiences that
they’re going to have, should have. But they’re driven by Mercury to bring
them out.
VVVVeeeennnnuuuussss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22220000
It’s a wonderful place for Venus to be, the existential capacity filtered through
Venus’s moral eyes, to be able to see what is really working and what is not
working in the now. And Venus is very, very powerful. Never forget the
destructive capacity of Venus. We’re often totally taken into and enamored by
Venus’s relationship quality, the way it was exalted by Greco Roman
mythology. But in the Americas, in South America, Venus was the Goddess of
Execution and remains the Goddess of execution in the Islamic world in the
sense that Friday is the day in which people are executed which is Venus’s day.
So one of the things about Venus in the now is that Venus establishes our
mores, what are true values and is ready to destroy values that don’t work. So
being in the now, it’s very acute. When you are dealing with something like the
20th gate, you have to see that if you have the 10, or you have the 34, or you
11114444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
have the 57, that is, you have the other aspects of integration, this is going to
have a specific impact on you.
CCCCoooonnnnddddiiiittttiiiioooonnnniiiinnnngggg iiiissss nnnnooootttt tttthhhheeee EEEEnnnneeeemmmmyyyy
Remember something about the nature of conditioning: Conditioning is not
the enemy. Conditioning is not bad, conditioning is not to be eliminated,
conditioning is everything. It is what we call life. It’s absolutely gorgeous. It’s
just about not being identified with what is conditioning in your life, but it is
not about not experiencing it or taking advantage of it.
Think about the Generator that through the 20 transit suddenly becomes a
Manifestor. Now it doesn’t mean that they can act like a Manifestor, but it
does mean that when somebody asks them for their response, that when they
respond they can work like a Manifestor. In other words, they can really jump
in at the manifesting level and they can take advantage of that.
It’s not about eliminating conditioning, it’s about eliminating the ignorance of
the conditioning. You see, any center that is open in you is your opportunity
for wisdom. This is your opportunity through that filtering process that once
you stop identifying with what’s moving through you, you can take advantage
of what’s moving through you.
I only have one motor. Now, I have the will power to teach every day and to
work, but if I didn’t have access to all of your adrenaline, it wouldn’t be
possible. I don’t allow your adrenaline to condition me because I can feel it
moving through my body. I take advantage of it in order to be able to keep
myself from getting exhausted, I exhaust you instead. But because there’s so
many of you, I don’t overwhelm any individual with exhaustion. I just take
from the adrenaline aura. It’s not about saying, “No, no, no, no. I don’t want
to have anything to do with you conditioning my Root Center. I’m going to
back up 200 yards, sit in a glass booth, and speak to you through a
microphone.” Then I drop dead from exhaustion.
So it’s very important to see that because of the way we learn Human Design,
and it’s the way we have to learn the Human Design, at first the conditioning is
truly the enemy because this is what happens to us. We get this revelation of
“Oh my God, this is what has happened to me and they did that to me or it did
that to me.”
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 11115555
Like you, I went through the same process. I went through the process of my
great distaste for being controlled through those open centers of mine. And
that sense in me, given that I have three gate of aloneness, to say, “Well, the
hell with all of them, I’m just going to stay out of the aura.” But of course you
can’t; you can’t. Not only can you not because you cannot avoid the program,
but you can’t because it’s life. It’s no fun without all that stuff no matter how
you’re defined or undefined. It’s part of what we’re here for.
So don’t turn conditioning into an enemy and don’t think that because you are
being conditioned in one way or another that your Type has changed, for
example, that that’s something for you not to use and not to fall into. It’s not
true. If you’re entering in according to your Type, you can take advantage of
any transit. I mean that’s what it’s there for. I took advantage for seven years
of Pluto dominating my Sacral. Now, it was exhausting as hell but, I did not
resist that. What am I going to do against Pluto? I did not resist that.
MMMMaaaarrrrssss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 44444444
Interesting to have Mars in 44. The 44th gate, coming to meet, this gate of
alertness, this splenic root of tribal talent.
And of course Mars brings its immaturity
to that, the immaturity to be able to handle
people, but also the energy to want to be
able to do that at the same time, and a
Martian aggressiveness when it comes to
the nature of being alert.
Think about all the people who don’t have
the 44. All of a sudden today is the day, or
as long as Mars has been there, they smell
things they haven’t smelled before. All of a
sudden they realize that their clothes smell
funny. You got people all over the planet since this transit, if you called up any
of these manufacturers who make deodorants and disinfectants and sprays and
all of these things, you’ll see there’s been more lemon spray sold during Mars in
44 than in any other time in the year.
And if you’re interested in the stock market, you can see that perfumes, that all
kinds of different industries involved in aroma are going to have a boom during
Mars in 44. They just are because everything suddenly stinks. This is Mars.

I have a trip about this, you know. How ignorant human beings are of their
purpose and their power. I can give you a couple of tidbits about the program
coming in but there’s nothing written about the program going out. Neutrinos
do not park when they arrive. They keep on going, and they change going
through, and they keep on going back out.
Now think about what that actually means. I just turned 51; for 51 years the
neutrinos have been going through me and they’ve been going out into the
universe. And they’ve been going out into the universe at the speed of light
and I’m not talking about one or two or three of them. There are three trillion
neutrinos moving through every square inch. They’re moving through my
body, three trillion of them at a time, all of these spaces. So many of them that
it’s beyond our capacity to even be able to imagine the numbers, and it’s
pouring out into the universe in every possible direction.
YYYYoooouuuu PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm tttthhhheeee TTTToooottttaaaalllliiiittttyyyy
That means that the information of my existence, the way in which I process
consciousness, has touched stars as far away as fifty light years in every possible
direction. Think about that, that’s us. You see, we’re not simply an entity
being programmed, this is a feedback.
We are programmed, and we program unconsciously and unaware, so you can
imagine the chaos of that programming. Think about it this way. For four
billion years on this planet, we know there’s been life, and the neutrino stream
has been pouring through that life since that time. And that means four billion
light years in every direction. That means eight billion light years across.
That’s just about the size of our universe.
You see consciousness and the consciousness field that exists here in this solar
cell of ours is programming the body. We are, in that sense, the programming
field for the pituitary of the larger entity. This is what we do and we’re
programming it all the time. Every moment, every breath, it’s pouring out.
So think about what it means if everybody on this planet, everybody on this
planet, decides that Mars is the god of good health and wisdom. Think about
that; everybody. Everybody simply accepts that Mars is the planet of good
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 11117777
health and wisdom and we live that. And as the neutrino field goes through all
of us, it goes through Mars every second, every second, programming Mars.
You see, we program the totality. That’s our purpose. We don’t know that.
And we’re vain enough as it is that if we did know that, it would really be
disgusting. We’re not equipped in these vehicles to actually be able to exercise
that kind of control, but it is our geometry to get there and it is our necessity
now to understand that.
People are always whining about not having a purpose, without recognizing
that they’re programming the universe and it goes on forever and it never
stops. And every life you’ve ever had is a continuity in a stream of information
moving in time backwards. I mean this is what we are.
We all have a unique purpose. We are all unique aspects of the programming,
so it’s not about just saying “Oh we’re taking this in. We’re taking in the other
person and their conditioning; we’re taking in the planets and their
conditioning.” Yeah, yeah, it’s not a one-way street.
We’re putting it back out. We put our aura inside of the other person and we
put the consciousness field of our totality into the entire universe, traveling
faster than we can possibly imagine, and endowing all of that, our body, with
consciousness, awareness.
I once told people, I think in one of the gray courses, “I don’t know what value
I am to the gods, to the totality. But I do know one thing. I know what they’re
looking for. They’re not looking for smart. That doesn’t matter. What they’re
looking for is form that’s endowed with awareness. Maybe they keep my hands
because they’re aware, and my awareness flows through my fingers. I know it.
I feel it. I live it.”
You see, that’s what the totality is interested in. They’re interested in the
capacity to be able to bring awareness into form and that’s what we’re doing.
We are informing the totality and we inform it through the mechanism of the
neutrino ocean moving through us carrying all of us outward. Never forget
that. If you can keep that in mind, you can actually be a spiritual person. It’s
really nice.

The need to be in control but magnanimous control. After all, that’s the nature
of Jupiter. Whenever you see Zeus in the gate of power, you always have to
recognize that there are two sides. One
side is a sweetness, and of course that
sweetness can be very penetrating. Zeus
was the greatest rapist of his time. And on
the other side it can be incredibly
magnanimous. And of course the role of
the 21 is to serve, to serve the community.
In this we can have all kinds of people who
suddenly decide that they’re going to help
out in the community. This is volunteered
time. All of a sudden you get people who
volunteer to do service, people who have
never done such a thing and are now rushing over and providing food packages
for Kosovars, and they get very involved because they’re serving the
community and then the transit ends. And then of course, they don’t show up
anymore. And then they feel guilty and they wonder why, and they go through
all of this.
We fall deeply into the trap of identifying with transits, deeply. It’s why it’s so
important. I keep my ephemeris beside my toilet. It’s something I
recommend. It’s a wonderful place to keep an ephemeris. You got nothing
else to do there. It’s a wonderful time for meditation and concentration, and
it’s a very good place to look and see what’s going on in the world.

Saturn in 27 is interesting and obviously it’s the gate
of nourishment. We’re going to look at this in our
work. Wherever you see Saturn in the BodyGraph,
particularly in transits, you know that this is a place
where there is an environment of judgment taking
place. In other words, that the quality of
nourishment is something that is really going to be
looked at carefully. And that if nourishment is not
taking place properly, there is going to be a lot of
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 11119999
pain involved in that. That whole Saturn theme in 27 is coincidental to this
war.
UUUUrrrraaaannnnuuuussss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 11113333
Uranus in 13 is wonderful because it creates more problems in relationships
than anything you can imagine. Because the 13th gate is a gate of being
secretive and not saying things. And you’ve got all these people who are not
going to say what they really want to say. Normally they say those things. So,
you have a lover that you’re normally chatty-chatty with and all of a sudden
Uranus is in 13 and you don’t say anything
anymore, and they think you have a new
lover, or they think that something’s really
wrong and you’re hiding it from them.
On the other hand, if you have the rest of
that, I’m somebody who has the 33.
Whenever the 13 is present, I’m always on
guard. I’m always on guard because that’s a
time when I reveal things that I don’t
necessarily want to reveal. By only having
the 33 I can be secretive when I want to be.
It’s a Throat gate. So I can either reveal or
not reveal. But when the 13 is there, the pressure is there from the identity to
reveal things that haven’t been revealed before.
Often I’ve had situations in the early years when I didn’t really pay much
attention to how that worked, where I would have people sitting with me at a
break during the teaching and they would ask me some kind of bizarre mystical
question and I’d answer them. And then I’d feel terribly embarrassed of letting
any of that stuff out because I really don’t like all that fishy stuff. And they
were very good at getting the fishy stuff out of me. So I’ve learned to be very
careful around the 13 environment.
What we have is that the whole thing about being in the program is really to
understand that the uniqueness in us is that we each have our way of
integrating with the program thematically, but we don’t integrate with
everything in the program. So there are certain things that are truly thematic
for us and the rest of it is the environment that everybody else is dealing with.
22220000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
And it’s so important for you to see that, because if you see the environment as
it’s affecting everybody else, it gives you a lot of opportunities every day to be
clear about what you’re meeting. If you know it’s going to rain, take an
umbrella. It’s simply something to make sense. And of course this is what is
the motto of the boy scouts, be prepared? This is about being prepared. And
it’s a great thing, to get up in the morning and see what the vibe is going to be
in the world around you so that you know yourself what you have to deal with.
But specifically look at your own themes, you can take advantage of them.
I know that if I let myself go with Uranus in the 13, I could take you away from
being mechanical in teaching you this, into some kind of mystical story. I’m
aware of that. So I can either take advantage of that conditioning or not. I’m
not identified with it so I don’t have to get sucked into it. And if I hear myself
going down that track, I can actually not go there because I don’t have to
accept that conditioning. But at the same time, it may be just the right moment
to accept that conditioning. It may feel good to accept that conditioning and it
may be productive to accept that.
So this is the whole thing about following transits and understanding it’s not
about avoiding them, it’s not about trying to deny them if they’re changing you
and all that stuff. It’s not about you stating, “I’m purely this and I can’t be
anything else because that’s not the world.” You have to see that as long as
you’re listening to the nature of your own Type, you’re entering into things
correctly, then you can take advantage of those conditioned elements.
Otherwise, I’d never have sex. I mean you have to understand how that works.
If you’ve got an undefined Solar Plex Center and you don’t take advantage of
conditioning, you never have sex. So you really have to understand it’s not
about avoiding any of these things, it’s just about not being identified with
them so that you can be clear about what conditioning you accept.

Yeah this is, 41.3. I have my Design Moon there, and it’s a fascinating thing to
experience Neptune. I’ve had phenomenal Neptune experiences over the last
ten years watching Neptune affect activations that I have and how absolutely
and totally blinding it is. It’s totally blinding. The 41.3 is Neptune being there.
The 41st gate is an initiating codon. It starts experiences. Everybody on the
planet is in an environment of a new experience.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 22221111
And it’s not simply another flavor of the month. This is Neptune only coming
to the 41st gate once every 165 years. In other words, this is the beginning of a
Neptunian cycle. And it means that the old
Neptunian cycle of the previous 165 years
has come to an end, which is something else
to understand. So we’re beginning an
entirely new cycle and all of us are living
through the programming. But more than
that, because Neptune moves so slowly,
think of the tens of millions of children who
are going to carry
Neptune in the 41 means there’s going to be
a whole new spiritual, mystical process for
humanity that’s going to flower when these
children are in their maturity. That is, when they reach their midlife 40 years
down the road.
They’re the children, ultimately, that are going to have the children that have
the emotional mutation, so this is a whole new generation. Now it has very
little impact, in a sense, on us as individuals. We have our personal relationship
with the activation in a gate. So, for example, if you have the 30th gate, then
there is a deep, deep feeling that is being developed that is entirely masked.
There’s no way of knowing what that feeling actually is and for what it actually
is. And for most people who experience this Neptune transit in their life, it will
take 10 or 15 years to see the net result if they see it at all. So we have a very
mysterious period in our development, this period every 165 years that
Neptune will take us through a new cycle.
I’ve mentioned it before that if I was to create a calendar, that calendar would
always begin with the 41st gate which is in January, because the 41st gate literally
is that. It is the initiating codon. So that you can see that any of the planets as
they go through there, every time a planet goes through the 41st gate, it creates
a new cycle of how humanity experiences that planet, and it’s an ongoing cycle.
Pay attention to those movements of the planet through the 41st gate in terms
of just being able to watch the world, to be able to see that new experiences are
constantly being initiated. And when you’re dealing with Neptune, you’re
dealing with something that’s very profound. Somewhere in the not too distant
future, maybe fifty years from now, I don’t know exactly when, Pluto will be
22222222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
there, and then you’ll have a new plutonian cycle, and the old plutonian cycle
coming to an end, and a new 265-year cycle beginning.
Anyway, there is something going on. And the thing to understand about the
third line is that there’s something going on and it’s going to cost you more
than you think, because that’s what the third line is all about. If it wasn’t for
the 41.3, I really wouldn’t be useful, because it’s the part of me that’s generous
for the experience.
And the 41.3, my son Loki, he came into the world and he brought the exalted
to the 41.3. I have the detriment. And he instantaneously was in my pocket
and he’s been in my pocket ever since. So one of the things to recognize about
the 41.3 is that mysteriously, what this new process is that’s going on is costing
us much more than we thought.
So one of the things for you to recognize is that when you see resources being
depleted, then you can begin to look and see what may be happening to you
and remember that this is collective. It is a planetary process that’s taking
place.
PPPPlllluuuuttttoooo iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 9999
And finally of course we have Pluto in the 9. Pluto has such deep power and
it means that for us the only real truth in this time is the truth that comes from
deep focus. And so it is an impulse for us to focus deeply on the details and to
be clear about the facts. And it is Pluto that is really bringing us that and when
it moves from the 9 to the 5 out of the facts, it will establish new patterns for
us.
So it’s a very important transit, particularly when you recognize that logic has
very little access to energy. And because logic has little access to energy, having
Pluto sit in the gate for three years that is an energy gate, a format gate of the
logical process, is very, very important. In other words, it’s providing
tremendous amounts of energy; for example, scientific research. It’s providing
an enormous capacity to be able to be focused and concentrated in order to be
able to come up with the details.

The ephemeris for the day. It’s one of the things that I’ve been keeping time in
terms of the way in which cycles work. I keep that timing on the movement of
the Sun through a hexagram which takes approximately six days, and it’s
particularly, for those of you working in Design, the understanding of the
nature of a hexagram and how a hexagram truly operates.
You get to see the movement of the energy through the lines and if you pay
attention to the line of the day, then you can see around you, in the
environment around you, you can see that line playing out its theme.
So given the way in which the Sun is going to move from the first line through
to the sixth line, you get to see this natural progression from most of the
planets, other than when they’re going retrograde or other than the Nodes.
You’re going to see this consistent movement through the structure of the
hexagram.
TTTThhhheeee GGGGeeeennnneeeerrrraaaallll EEEEnnnnvvvviiiirrrroooonnnnmmmmeeeennnntttt ccccoooommmmeeeessss ffffrrrroooommmm tttthhhheeee SSSSuuuunnnn----EEEEaaaarrrrtttthhhh
Now the Sun-Earth really defines the essential theme of any given day. In
other words, this is 70% of what the program is. So when you’re looking at the
ephemeris and you’re looking at the energy for the day, looking at the Sun-
Earth is very important. In other words, yes, it’s interesting to see that you’re
going to have other planets in different positions, and of course that’s
important to you relative to your own Design.
But in terms of the general theme that everyone is working with, the general
environment, is going to be that kind of rain. Now, you may have pockets of
sunshine here and there, but the general environment is going to come from
the Sun-Earth.
FFFFiiiirrrrsssstttt LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy ———— RRRReeeesssseeeeaaaarrrrcccchhhhiiiinnnngggg CCCChhhhaaaammmmeeeelllleeeeoooonnnn DDDDaaaayyyy
So the Sun and Earth beginning their process in the first line, the first line of
any hexagram is going to tell you that not much is visible. This is the
22224444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
chameleon day. If this is a Rave week of six different line positions of the
Sun, then each of those days, in a sense, have a structural value to them, and of
course the first day is always the foundation of it.
Remember, if you think about the impact that any connection has to your
Design, it’s really important to see that the moment that first line is going to be
there and it’s going to be out there everywhere is that that’s always saying that
you’ve taken a shift. You’ve gone from the Sun being in two very different
hexagrams and all of a sudden there’s this shift and it makes a real difference.
It’s waking up to a new day. It’s waking up, in that sense, to a new Rave week.
So pay attention to that first day because if you’re trying to do things on the
first line day, you’re going to be less successful. That’s a day to find the
foundation. That’s a day to do your research. That’s a day to get comfortable
with the transition to the first line theme.
As a matter of fact, remember that if you’re dealing with a hexagram and you’re
dealing with its structure, we know that the lower trigram has no real
transpersonal gift. That the lower trigram is self-absorbed. It’s in its own
personal destiny. It’s involved within itself. And so what that means is that the
first line of any Rave week is really there not to go out into the world and meet
the other, but to be the chameleon. To be looking for a solid foundation,
because after all, the first line theme is to be an authority.
One cannot be authoritative unless one has a grasp of what the foundation is.
So if you step into the first line theme and you go running around like a mad
dog, what happens to you is that you don’t have the authority because you
haven’t given yourself the opportunity to get accustomized to that transit.
Now, obviously, that’s going to be very significant to anyone who’s going to
have the harmonic gates to any of those positions. If you’re somebody who
has the 54th gate, the harmonic gate to the 32, or you have the 53 as a harmonic
gate to the 42, then it means that it’s exceedingly important that you recognize
that that’s a first line theme and wait until you’re later into that transit, later into
that Rave week before you universalize. In other words, wait until it becomes
upper trigram.
In describing all of these things, I’m just describing natural mechanics, and
actually the natural mechanics of dealing with a transit will operate if you’re
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 22225555
living out your Type. It’s a lot easier for you to naturally be restrained on a first
line day if you’re living out your Type.
SSSSeeeeccccoooonnnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy ———— MMMMaaaayyyy GGGGeeeetttt CCCCaaaalllllllleeeedddd OOOOuuuutttt
So, then you get to the second line day and that’s the moment you become
visible in that transit. Think about that. Let’s say that you are a 54 and the
Earth is in 32, and there’s the channel of transformation. This is all about the
capacity to be able to rise up in the material hierarchy through recognition of
value.
So the first day you have this transit, if you’re a 54, this is not a day to go
looking for improvement in your income, or in your job position. It’s the day
for you to really just settle into that energy because the moment that you get to
the line two day, that’s the moment that the opportunity for you may exist. In
other words, the second line is all about being called.
So, if you do your homework and you find the authority, you find your natural,
you let yourself get into the transit, by the time you get into the second line,
that’s the point at which somebody’s going to notice you. They’re going to
notice the impact of that transit and they’re going to call you out.
Now, it doesn’t mean that everybody is going to have that second line
experience. You may not get called out. And if you don’t get called out, you
get to the third line day. The third line day,—remember, because none of the
first three lines are going to be transpersonal, there isn’t anything they can do
about it. In other words, there really is no way to properly get that conditioned
opportunity out. They have to wait for the outside to come to them.

So what we have today (April 13, 1999) is a third line day, the Sun in 42.3 and
the Earth in 32.3. Now a third line day is the most dangerous day of the Rave
week, and it’s the most dangerous day of the Rave week because this is when
things bump into each other. Now bumping into each other can be very
pleasant, and bumping into each other can be very painful. But the fact of the
22226666 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
matter is that the principle of trial and error is that something bumps into you
and you see what happens out of that.
One of the things to recognize, as well, as that, the first, second, and third line
days, particularly second and third line days, are much more of an advantage to
Generators and Projectors. It tends to
bring out opportunities of responding
either being called to respond or bumping
into something and being forced to
respond. It’s much easier for Manifestors
or Manifesting Generators, for that matter,
when the week gets into its transpersonal
phase, when it reaches the 4th, 5th, or 6th
lines.
So the energy for us in our process here
today is to recognize that this is a day
where things bump into you. It’s a day
when you can be shocked. It’s a day when
you can be hurt. I was sitting in Los Angeles while I was on tour and I don’t
know what it was, I think it was the 36.3. I looked at that and I said to my
hostess who was going someplace, “You really shouldn’t go driving today. This
is a day for car accidents. This is a day where crisis just bangs into you.”
And of course that morning or evening, this train crash took place where, I
don’t know, 20 or 25 people died. The third line brings impact. So it’s one of
those things that the moment you see a third line theme, that’s the day of the
Rave week you pay attention. It’s important because there are things that are
going to bump into you and it’s very important for you to recognize that those
are the opportunities of the day when things bump into you.
If you’re dealing with the 42.3 as a solar theme, what do you think that means?
What you’re dealing with is completion bumps into you. In other words,
you’re not looking for completion. You’re not looking to complete something,
but all of a sudden it’s in your face and it brings completion. It bumps into
you. That may happen to some, may not happen to others.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 22227777

Remember, the nature of a transit is that if this is going to bring about a
definition in your Design, it’s obviously going to have that impact. But it
doesn’t necessarily mean that everybody is going to have that happen to them.
That’s the whole thing about being unique aspects within a general program,
that the general program establishes all the possible conditions of the
programming. However, each and every one of us, in our uniqueness, filters
the program specifically, which means some things do not affect us while other
things do.
This is one of the reasons why the transit work in astrology is so disastrously
inaccurate. Because if you have the historical perspective of astrology, to be
able to see that nature of aspects—which is one of the things that astrology is
brilliant at—and you know that somebody has their Sun and they have
Neptune going over their Sun, now, of course the astrologer’s going to have a
specific description for that based on the aspect.
But once you understand the nature of Design, you can see that that Sun may
be in an undefined center. That Sun may not be active at all unless it’s being
conditioned by somebody turning on that center. And that aspect of Neptune
over the Sun, though it will carry that value when the center is defined, will not
be there when it’s not.
If you’re looking at inner planet transits to try to be a soothsayer, you have to
see that if you do not understand the mechanics of Design, most of the time
you’re going to be inaccurate. You’re going to have the right information, but
you’re not going to be able to bring it out accurately. This is why people in
Europe, particularly in homeopathy, were so interested in Human Design.
You see, you can give a homeopathic medicine to somebody but if the Design
is not right, if the timing isn’t right, it isn’t going to be effective. And if you
give homeopathic medicine to certain people, it has no impact whatsoever. In
other words, you have to be able to see the Design itself. The net result of that
is the ability for those who are negative in perspective to debunk these things
because they’re not consistently accurate.
So, one of the things to recognize about following transit in Design is that
when I talk about 42 bringing something bumping into you for completion,
22228888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
that’s a generalized program theme. You have to be able to see whether that’s
specific to you. It does mean generally you’re going to see that as a theme
going around.
And think about these babies that are being born today, the tens of thousands
of babies that are coming in with the Sun in 42.3. They’re going to be banging
things into completion for years. That’s going to be their whole thing, finishing
things by suddenly being confronted with them and only realizing that things
come to an end in confrontation.
So think about relationships out there today, and think about those people that
can be affected by this kind of aspect. In other words, out of nowhere you can
bang into something—a problem, whatever the case may be—and that can lead
to bringing something to completion. Now, by the way, bringing something to
completion is neither negative nor positive. It’s simply the end of a cycle. It
can be the beginning of a new cycle or it can truly be the end of that cycle.
FFFFoooouuuurrrrtttthhhh LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy ———— PPPPooootttteeeennnnttttiiiiaaaallll IIIInnnntttteeeerrrraaaaccccttttiiiioooonnnn
Before I go on with today, recognize what happens the moment you move
from a 3rd line to a 4th line day. The moment you step into the upper trigram,
you step into the transpersonal potential. The most powerful day of the Rave
week is the 4th line day. It’s the day of externalization. It’s the day in which
you can externalize your completion. It’s the day that you can ground yourself
and really go after grounding yourself in the value of things.
I guarantee you that tomorrow there are going to be employees all over the
world who are going to be asking for more money, and where their bosses are
going to think they should be fired. Now fortunately, it’s not going to last long.
But that’s typical of the 4th line externalization.
The other thing about it is that the 4th line brings a theme of friendliness.
Again, this is a real transition from the lower trigram days, and because this
brings a theme of friendliness, there is much more interaction possible on a 4th
line day. It’s easier to do business on such a day and it’s easier to feel the
strength in being fixed in the way you present yourself on that day because it is
4th line.

Now remember, there are going to be 64 different combinations of themes as
you go around. So you have to see that the 4th line gives you certain
advantages, but you cannot forget what the 70% of that theme is, which in this
case are these two hexagrams.

The 32nd gate is all about the capacity of being a financial manager, and the
capacity to the financial manager is to recognize the value both of products and
of workers. It is a gift of the 32 through its instinct to be able to smell out
those potential employees or those
potential people coming in wanting to be
employees who can truly be of value to the
organization.
All 54s are looking for a mentor, just as all
19s are looking for a husband or a wife.
And the 54 is looking for mentor. That’s
why we fuck our mentors a lot because we
confuse it with husband and wife. That’s
why we have so many problems
occupationally in business with sexuality.
But the 54 is looking to be recognized.
This is an opportunity for those 54s to get recognition, or to recognize what
recognition can bring them.
It also means, given that the 32 is looking at the value of things, on a 32.3 day,
you’ll bump into something. You’ll go shopping or something and you’ll bump
into something and you’ll suddenly feel like you’re being ripped off. A product
that you wouldn’t care about in terms of the fact that it’s 10 cents more or 12
cents more, there’ll be something about it today that will really bother you
because the 32 hates being ripped off. It’s their job to know the value of things
and nothing is more annoying to a 32 than to buy something and then the next
day to see that they could have gotten the same thing cheaper. It infuriates
them.
So this is a theme in which you see that through this Rave week. You’re going
to have all kinds of people looking at the evaluation of things—whether things
are worth their value. And at the same time, this is a time when it’s possible for
33330000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
people who have been unrecognized—the 54s who have been unrecognized—
to truly get recognized.
Imagine what it’s like to be a 54 in a company where there’s no 32. There’s no
one there to see your value, and there’s no one there for you to link
electromagnetically with so that transformation can take place. The mentor
gains much by the success of those that it pulls along the ladder. So if you’re a
54 in a company this week and there’s no 32 there, everybody’s going to have
it. Your direct boss is going to have it and in that lies an opportunity for you to
be able to say, “See, don’t you see my value?” But don’t tell the boss on the
first three days unless they bump into you or actually call it out on day two or
day three. Wait until the fourth day. Go right at ‘em because they’ll see the
value and you can take advantage of the conditioning.

To understand not simply the program and not simply what a gate is, but these
are all thematics. We are all caught in this program. You see, this is the meat
of great black magicians. And it’s intended to be the knowledge of all so that
we have a proper dynamic and rhythm. Remember, the importance of the 15-5
and what that brings into our lives to have the right pattern and the right
rhythm. To be able to share the same understanding of the program. You
have harmony out of that. You get success out of that. So the 4th line day is a
very important day.
Remember something about the 4th line. The 4th line always has this great
missionary capacity. And so the friendliness that underlines the 4th line, along
with this missionary capacity, they’re really good. They go right out there and
they get their stuff across, so that’s a very important day.

If you did statistical analysis of shopping, you will find that shopping is always
at its peak on 4th and 5th line days. Always. If you’re a merchant and
everybody was in the program, only 4th and 5th line days would be shopping
days because they would really be the days where everybody naturally should
shop.

Third line days are okay. You’re walking down the street and you look in a
window and you see something gorgeous. It banged into you, you got to have
it. That’s okay. That’s third line shopping.
Second line day, somebody calls you up and says, “Do you want to go
shopping with me?” They call you out.
First line shopping is that you read the prices and statistics and you don’t do
anything. You don’t buy a damn thing.
And 6th line shopping is that you’re so aloof that you wouldn’t buy it any way
and you think everybody’s a fool who’s shopping.
You see, if you understand yourself, you get the joke. It’s a joke. And you can
see that by not understanding mechanically how things operate, what we do.
We do everything on the wrong days at the wrong time. We try to be what
we’re not all the time, and that is the chaos. It’s the real chaos.
When you get to a 5th line day, 5th line and 4th line days, as I mentioned, these
are shopping days, buying days. But the 4th line is the true buying day. That is,
you can buy anything on a 4th line day, anything. But a 5th line day is very
different because the whole nature of universalization is that universalization
is not successful unless it is absolutely practical. So the 5th line day is practical
shopping. Go shopping for knick-knacks on Thursday and go shopping for
dinner on Friday. Wait for your fifth line day to do your practical shopping
because that’s perfect.
The other thing about a 5th line day is that it is full of projection. So this is a
day where everybody is speculating about everybody else. It’s a very good day
to keep things practical, and other than practicality, stay out of sight.
On 5th line days is when people lose their reputations because if they’re not
out there being practical, the world explodes on them. And people project on
them that they are this or that or whatever the case may be. To do something
frivolous on a 5th line day is to lose your reputation. And when I say lose your
reputation, it means that your reputation gets scarred. There’s suddenly
somebody who sees you as being less able, less willing, less capable, whatever
the case may be.

And yet the moment that you can be practical on the 5th line day, offer a
practical service, offer a practical solution, or do your practical work, your
practical shopping, then everything is fine. Except the moment that it’s over,
go back to your house and disappear.
On a 6th line day, you rest. You rest. And the way that you rest is that you get
the best perspective that you can. Now that depends on the Type that you are.
You either climb a mountain and sit on a hill, or you lie down in front of the
TV, depending on what kind of view you want to have. But a 6th line day is just
a day where you just sort of look around. It’s a day to be aloof. It’s a day to sit
on the fence. It’s a day to just look and see what’s happened to you through
the last five days of this transit.

So, the moment you grasp the step-by-step mechanics,—I teach people the
mechanics of a hexagram and its lines and it stops there like some kind of
abstract concept. And it isn’t. That is why nothing has touched me deeper in
my intellectual life than the I Ching because it’s not just a concept. It is a
mathematical reality. It is the structure of our genetic code. It is a living
process.
One of the most astonishing things in my own work is that in working in the
Global Incarnation Index to come, to see how each and every line has a built-in
changing mechanism in it. The ancient I Ching, thousands of thousands of
years ago, that the changing capacity inherent in the genetic material was
already revealed to them. So, it’s not about seeing that this structure of the
hexagram and the structure of the lines are some kind of intellectual concept; it
isn’t. It is a living reality and has a living reality. We go through these lines
every single day of our lives and it’s conditioning us at a deep level.

The moment you recognize that it is a physical environment, it’s an indication
of what you can do with that. Remember that with the kind of knowledge you
have, this isn’t for clients. This is for your own joy, to be able to see, for
example, that if you have, in this case, let’s say that you have the 53.6 in your
Design and the transit is now the 42.3, you have a harmony in that.

For those people who have a harmony in that moment, the possibilities are
even greater than if there is not a harmony there. By going through and
looking clearly at the way in which we interact to the mechanics, we are
interacting to the general music that’s being played. I mean, this is how it
works for us.
That’s why you have to be careful about understanding that this is a
generalized program in which we’re just filtering aspects of it, each of us. So
you get your moments to play in the orchestra. And you get your moments
where the flow of the music, in a sense, doesn’t really touch you. It’s not your
time to come in.

It’s so important to see that the first and second and third line themes of any
Rave week, that this is the preparation to be able to play your song. And that if
you’re brought out prematurely from that, it can only be from the outside
calling you or bumping into you. This is something that Ego people know.
Ego people know that the amount of effort actually necessary to look after
one’s self, one’s family, one’s loved ones, whatever it may be, is an awful lot
less than the way in which civilization and society have evolved it to be.
It’s like education. If you give me five 15 year olds, I can give them a university
education that will stay with them all their life and it’ll take me one year. That’s
all. But our institutions are also babysitting institutions. They’re also ways for
us to get our children off our hands and keep them off the street and out of the
need for employment.
If you’re in a third world country like Algeria where over half the people are
under 25 and they don’t have jobs, I tell you, if they don’t have wealth then you
have revolution all the time. So wealthy countries develop very powerful
institutions and keep people locked into those institutions for a very long time.
You hear the sirens today. Yes, well it’s very nicely done. To be able to see
that we flow in and out of the music and that’s what we are. And the moment
you pay attention to the way that the music is generally written,—the larger
piece. And the larger piece is those two hexagrams going through the 6th line
theme. That’s the larger piece. And the moment you see that you have a role
in that, and if you honor the way that structure works, you’ll see it’s really
productive.

FFFFoooouuuurrrrtttthhhh aaaannnndddd FFFFiiiifffftttthhhh LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyyssss ———— AAAAccccttttiiiivvvviiiittttyyyy
So these children that I could teach in one year, all of that stuff that the
institutions expand, please understand that only 4th and 5th line days are for
activity.
With the technology we have, one day in the future that’s all that will be
necessary, because I guarantee you that the more and more efficient we are at
being able to create those things that we need by mechanisms and technologies,
the less and less we’re going to have of actual responsible “work.”
If you look at a vast spectrum of American economics today, which is
businesses that are run out of the home, you’ll see that very few of them are
actually involved in traditional outside work other than a few days of the week,
because that’s what’s natural. What is natural is that we are active on 4th and 5th
line days. In other words, active in the sense of going out beyond our own
process, going out to meet the world, going out to do transitions, going out to
take care of business, all of those things. That’s when it’s perfect.
Now, of course, because the society and civilization that we live in does not
play by those rules, it doesn’t mean that if you’re playing by these rules that
you’re automatically going to get success in that. But you are always going to
get advantage, to remember that those things that are important for you to do
with others. If you wait for 4th and 5th line days, you’ll see that it’s much more
successful.
Try the experiment. If you have the kind of life where you’re scheduling
meetings for specific times during the week, try to get them into 4th and 5th line
days. And the really practical meetings, get them into the 5th line day. You’ll
see that the general environment is more conducive for you even if you’re
dealing with somebody who’s ignorant, because of course they are in the
aspect. They are being conditioned generally by the environment and you can
take advantage of that so that the best for you comes out in that situation.

Finally, the 6th line day. And when I say that the 6th line day is about rest and
about not doing anything, it is about evaluation. The great judges that we
have are 6th line personalities. These are the greatest judges. In other words,
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 33335555
somebody who has the personality Sun-Earth in the 6th line. These are people
that are here to judge, and not in the sense of the 18-58 which is about the
challenging to imperfection to go after perfection. This is a judgment of the
hexagram process or ultimately the life process.
All sixth lines are judging what they see within their own hexagram because
they’re actually trying to find something that that they can enter into.
Something that will bring them off of the fence and back into the process.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrr 33330000,,,, OOOOvvvveeeerrrr 33330000:::: 6666tttthhhh LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy TTTThhhheeeemmmmeeeessss
The thing to recognize about 6th lines days is that if you’re under 30, the 6th line
day is when you have one night stands. The 6th line day is when you have
crises. The 6th line day is when you really get messed up. The 6th line day is
when you jump in and do all kinds of outrageous things. If you’re over 30, the
6th line day is, “I’m too tired, leave me alone.”
One of those things to recognize is that there is a very different theme in the 6th
line day, really relative to your Saturn cycle. Up until the Saturn cycle, a 59.6 is
going to be very promiscuous. In other words, the one night stand is literally
their sexual strategy genetically and they’re going to jump into those things.
And by the time they reach their Saturn return, that’s over. They may never
have sex again. It’s one of the myths about 6th lines wherever you find them.
Now of course what happens then is that 59.6 will spend the rest of its life
looking at everybody else’s intimacy. They watch everybody else’s intimacy and
they’re the judge. “They have a nice relationship. They don’t.” They’re the
judge of that. Now, the whole thing for them is that you cannot stay aloof.
This is the mystical completion of the 6th line that leads into the next hexagram.
If you remain aloof and you sit on the fence, there’s no growth. You don’t get
to the first line of the next hexagram. You don’t continue the evolutionary
process through the wheel. You get stuck at a certain point. What happens to
us genetically when we get stuck and we start repeating at a certain point or
going back in a certain point, is that we end up with problems physically.
In the larger sense, all sixth lines have to go through the trial of suffering in
their first Saturn cycle, being disappointed in their first Saturn cycle, being
disillusioned in their first Saturn cycle. Then to go through a phase of their life,
usually until their Kiron return, until they’re approximately 51 years old, in
33336666 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
which they remain aloof. And then at that point, the opportunity for them to
be able to enter into things again, to be able to enter into their own intimacy
again instead of being the judge of other people’s intimacies, and to find at that
point in their life an intimacy that truly is of value to them.
So the moment the 6th line being, at that point in their life, the moment they
can finally enter into intimacy,—and often what happens is that they take the
lover of their best friend. It’s true.
See, that’s what happens with the 6th line theme. They become aloof and they
watch everybody else’s intimacy and then they fall in love with somebody
whose evident intimacy is exactly what they would like. And it’s usually the
partner of somebody they know because that’s what they’ve been watching all
the time, and so they end up falling in love with them. It’s a very common
occurrence.
The moment that the 6th line theme can then enter into intimacy again, that’s
the moment that progress takes place. That’s the moment that we can naturally
go to the next Rave week, to the next hexagram, and we can step into the next
first line theme and start the process.
BBBBeeeewwwwaaaarrrreeee ooooffff 6666tttthhhh LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss oooonnnn WWWWeeeeeeeekkkkeeeennnnddddssss
So keep in mind, particularly with children, that 6th line themes can be very
risky because while the adult around them wants to do nothing but rest, the
child wants to burn the house down. So, 6th line days, when they fall on
weekends, beware. If they fall during the week, it’s not so bad. But if they fall
on weekends, beware.
This is one of the things about the difference between what we call a week and
seven days, and this approximate six-day cycle of the Rave week. In other
words, it’s not consistently first lines on Monday, which would make things
very convenient, but however that’s not the way it is.
So, it is very important for you in your own work with your connection to the
program to be very clear about how these line themes work. And in the first
three line days, always watch people around you. It’s fascinating to see them in
those days and then watch what happens on the fourth and fifth day. Use all
those people around you in your life as uninformed guinea pigs of your
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 33337777
experimentation in how to deal with the environment, because this is you
becoming good weather forecasters. You can really see the weather at work.
At the moment you see the nature of a hexagram and you see the line of the
day, you know what’s going to happen with it. I mean, you know it’s either
going to pop out or be called or bumped into. There are those who are going
to try to externalize on a given day or universalize. It has to be practical, all of
those things. Watch that movie and then take advantage of it yourself. Take
advantage of the mechanics. See how easy it makes life to let the mechanics
rule, and remember how deep the program is.

Everybody’s got this 3rd line theme today. Everybody, everybody, everybody.
So, this is a day to wear your armor. This is a day to really be careful. Look
twice before you cross the street. This
is a day to wake up with no
expectations because you have no idea
what’s going to bang into you, none.
The moment you have that
consciousness, if you wake up on a
day like today and just say, “I’m going
to do this, this, and this,” and the first
thing you try to do is the first ‘this.’
And on your way to the first ‘this,’
you slip, you park in the parking lot
and somebody bangs into your car.
And all the other ‘this, this and this’
that you were going to do is all gone.
You’re really upset. You have to tell people that you can’t make it. They think
you’re a screw up. You think you’ve made a mistake. It’s a third line day.
The beauty of that is—I’m playing with you now—if I only give you the dark
side of a 3rd line day, you get real nervous, you stay in bed. The 3rd line day has
its beauties. I have a 3rd line mind. If things don’t bang into me like the voice,
I’m not going to find out anything. So the reality is that 3rd lines are really of
value in that way. In other words, that surprise, that moment of ‘I didn’t
expect that’ always can lead to something that may be of value.
It can also lead to something that isn’t of value. It is a generalized theme. The
moment you’re dealing with it, specifically to the hexagram, then you’re really
going to be able to see clearly whether that is going to affect you or not
directly. Otherwise, you’re just looking at it as the environment around.

In staying with these themes, the Nodes of the Moon for me are Rave months.
They’re our seasons. We have about four nodal seasons a year, sometimes five,
but usually four a year. So the nodal seasons can be very long, they can be
short. They do change. It’s not this consistency that we can give.
These are really the seasons that the Rave weeks operate on because these are
the general themes of our movement
in space. You can see that now we’re
in the 4-49. That is, the 49 is the
South Node revolution and the 4
youthful folly is the North Node.
Now the theme now is second line.
So, for example, if you take a nodal
season and you divide it into its six
lines, what you basically have is sort of
like months. Three-week periods
approximately.
So we’re in a nodal month, if you will,
and the theme is 2nd line. So you
know right away this is not the time to be externalizing anything having to do
with your principles or your answers. The real mystery lies in the nature of
how the Nodes work, because they go backwards. They always start with
aloofness and move to the 1st line foundation—always.
So one of the things to recognize about the way in which the Nodes operate is
that the Nodes force us to go from the 6th line to the 5th line. In other words,
to go from judgment to practicality, forcing the 6th line to come off of the fence
right away. And it’s very similar to beginning with the first line in the sense
that the first line has to find the foundation and the 6th line has to do the
recognition and judgment of the process. So by the time you go backwards—
the way the Nodes work—and you get to where we are now with the 2nd line
theme, you have already said and released your principles at the 4th line.

Since the 3rd line, you’ve always only been waiting to have that possibility. If
somebody bangs into you in the 3rd line, then you can release again your answer
from the principles you’ve derived.
If it’s the 2nd line as it is now, those principles, those answers have to be called
out. It’s not a time, generally speaking, to be out there saying to people, “Here
are my principles,” and whatever. The 2nd line person is always very happy to
be left alone. It’s a major 2nd line theme, “Don’t bother me, I don’t want to
learn anything new.” So the principles and the answer, in a sense, are already
established inside as a theme and only comes out when it’s called.
MMMMeeeerrrrccccuuuurrrryyyy iiiinnnn tttthhhheeee 33336666....4444
Mercury in the 36 in the 4th line. Today is a day to externalize the
communication of crisis. It’s a good day
to get it out. All that means is that this is
the need for experience. The 36th gate is
the gate of inexperience. It yearns for,
longs for the ability to get the experience
so it can release the desire pressure within
it.
So this is an opportunity today, the 4th line
are opportunistic days to be able to
externalize that need for the completion of
one’s desire. So, if you’ve got desire on
your mind, today is the day you can
externalize it. The hookers are doing well.
Well, it’s true. I mean if they knew that, they’d only have to work one day a
week. Generalized shopping.
VVVVeeeennnnuuuussss iiiinnnn tttthhhheeee 22220000....2222
Venus is in the 2nd line of 20. A very powerful place for Venus to be in the 20.
But the 2nd line is that to be existential has to be called out because the 2nd line
is dogmatic. The 2nd line says, “I’m only here in the now for what I’m here in
the now for and I don’t see anything else.” In other words, being in the now
but no peripheral vision.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 44441111
If you see very clearly that you can be here in the now and you have no
peripheral vision and it’s a 3rd line theme day, then you may not see what’s
going to hit you. So being dogmatic today is dangerous. In other words, this is
a day where in the generalized program, those people being dogmatic are going
to run into problems because they don’t have clear vision. They don’t have
peripheral vision and because of that, they’re not going to see what’s coming at
them. It’s a dangerous day. You don’t see clearly in the now. You’re only
seeing the direction that you want to go in, so you don’t necessarily see what’s
coming up behind you or from the side or whatever.
As a general theme, that doesn’t necessarily mean anything. But the
ambulances will run all day because there are going to be those people who are
going to integrate exactly into that mechanic who are not living out their Type
and are therefore living the conditioned not-self. And could end up in
situations where today is the day they can truly get hurt.
I’m not setting that up to be sort of like it’s a boogey man day. It’s not about
that, but it’s about seeing that it is part of the way the program works, that it
can be your karma to be absolutely destroyed by ignorance. That’s just the way
that works.

Mars in 44.1 is going retrograde. So think about what that means, particularly
for the inner planets in their retrograde motions. Mars goes roaring through
the 44. Goes through the 1, and the 2, and
the 3, starts manipulating people on the 4th
line. Tries to be practical in its exuberance
in the 5th line. Then goes roaring
backwards to the 1st line saying, “Did I get
that right? I mean, did I get that right?”
So Mars in the 44.1 is in exuberance for
trying to get it right now. Let’s get it right.
Okay, how do we actually manipulate
people? This is the natural theme of the
44 that goes from the 1st line that says,
“How do I manipulate people?” to the 2nd
line that says, “Ah, if I’m called, I can
manipulate people.” Because there’s a tremendous capacity in the 44 to be able

to impact on people as a transmitter and therefore that concept of
manipulation is not a negative. It’s about a way of focusing the attention of the
tribe.

Now Jupiter in 21.5 says, “You cannot exercise control unless it is practical.”
That’s very simple, but it’s very important to understand. If you are somebody
who’s in power, today is the day where you can only exercise control if it is
practical. It has to be practical.
And if it’s not practical, it’s simply not going to work. If it’s not practical, then
the 21.5 loses its reputation. In other words, the projection then on the 21.5
then is that they do not know how to be in control and they’re frivolous and
they’re just power hungry. The moment that the 21.5 exercises practical
control, everything is fine. So this is a day for practical controls.

The externalization of caring. I mean, that’s Saturn in the 27.4. So there is an
opportunity today for people to be nurtured by yang, male forces. Now they
can be women, but yang or male forces. And as long as Saturn is there in the
27.4, it’s a time for that kind of nurturing to
come out. Now yang nurturing is different
than yin nurturing.
And the thing to recognize is that wherever
you see Saturn in the continuity of any
given day, Saturn is the place that if you
don’t live out the day’s program, if you
resist the day’s program through not being
yourself, where Saturn is is where you get
punished.
So where everybody can get punished today
is in nourishment. If you don’t live out this
day properly and you’re so dogmatic and you think that that’s the thing that
you want to eat and that’s the place where you want to eat, you may get a meal
that makes you ill. You’re going to have a nice lunch today?
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 44443333

The externalization of nourishment and
caring, so this is a time when caring can
be exercised. We will see later, because
we will look at this channel of
preservation, this design of custodianship,
we’re going to look at how complex the
27 and the 50 really are. As a matter of
fact, we’re going to look at the whole
defense circuit and we’re going to see the
complexity that is really there.
So we’ll save Saturn and the 27.4 until we
get there and you’ll see the significance of
what that really is. And how profound it
is whenever you have major planets, outer
planets, basically Jupiter, Saturn, and outward when they’re going to be in any
of the four gates of the defense circuit. In other words, the 50, the 27, the 59,
and the 6.
Defense Circuit
These gates have enormous influence on
us. They are half of the gates that
determine the nature of profile and they
are essential to life on the planet. And
they carry within them fundamental aspects that all of us derive our intelligence
and our way of life from, particularly the 6th gate and the 50.
So Saturn being there in the 27.4, as you’ll see, is very important. Not so much
for us; it’s a transit for us and Saturn is in a fast phase like Jupiter. So really it’s
about the generation that’s coming into the world who are going to carry this.
We have a Saturnian, nurturing generation that comes around once every 30
years. So we have a new generation that’s coming in with this configuration.
The other thing to recognize is that the nurturing that can be derived from
Saturn can only be derived on a day like today if it bumps into you. So if it
bumps into you, then the opportunity for nurturing can be there.
44444444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
UUUUrrrraaaannnnuuuussss iiiinnnn tttthhhheeee 11113333....4444
If you have the 13.1 and the 13.2 and the 13.3, you don’t let your secrets out.
The 13.1 collects secrets in a vast library. Nobody ever gets the key to the
door. The 13.2 has the library, but if somebody knocks on the door and calls
for it, they’ll let it out. The 13.3 has the library, doesn’t pay attention to it and
won’t unless somebody bangs into them. But the 13.4 externalizes secrets.
That’s what it does, when it can, when it
can go through the 33.
So one of the things to recognize is that
there are a lot of secrets that can come out
with Uranus in 13.4, particularly unusual
secrets that can come out. I have been on
guard since the day Uranus entered into
13. With my 33 it’s like “no, you don’t.” I
don’t have to trust it. It is not an authority
for me. It is not who I am. It is Uranus,
after all. I can go along with the
conditioning if it suits me. In other words,
there are certain secrets that I might
externalize under certain situations, particularly since it’s a potential in me that’s
just sitting there. But I also know that it’s a conditioned element. And, when I
start telling you about all my past lives, I know I’m in trouble.
So this is a day when secrets come out. This is a day when she comes home
and she says to him, “Dear, I have a lover.” This is the day that the secrets can
really come out. And because it’s a transit and because of this day,—remember
the 70% theme of any day is going to be the line theme of the Sun-Earth, so it
means that you can’t externalize that secret unless somebody bumps into you.
Now by bumping into you, it can mean that somebody comes up to you and
says to you, “Listen, what really happened yesterday?” and all of a sudden (uck
noise made), all of it comes out. Horrifying for a 33 like me. I mean the idea
that all of that would come pouring out. So, look at the theme of the day and
then recognize how those things work.
When you get to the 13.5, only practical secrets will come out, not any old
secret. This is a terrible day for gossip making. And not just today because it’s
Uranus and it’s in the 13.4 for quite a while, and you’ve got this vast realm of
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 44445555
gossip racing around. If you look at recent American political history, you can
see what kind of gossip was floating around from all of that.
NNNNeeeeppppttttuuuunnnneeee iiiinnnn tttthhhheeee 44441111....3333
Neptune in this initiating codon and 3rd line, so it’s really in resonance to the
day. And in resonating to the day, it means that the direction of your new
experience can be altered by having
something bang into you. Remember that
there’s something very, very beautiful about
the 3rd line in bringing the unexpected. It
can bring deep transition.
In the line sense, the 3rd and 4th lines are
very mutative. That’s where transition and
mutation can take place. As you will see,
3rd and 4th lines are deeply connected to
what is individual in us. First and 2nd lines
are always fundamentally tribal. And 5th
and 6th lines are always collective in their
nature. So it’s important to see that the 3rd
and 4th line of any day, of any gate, of anybody’s chart, that you’re looking at
something that resonates to the mutative impulse.
So a 3rd line theme, though it can bring a lot of problems, because it does, you
don’t know what to expect. The 3rd line is not transpersonal. It just has a
mutative capacity. It means it can be impacted by the outside and transformed
in that impact. One of our main themes right now in this Rave week is the
potential for transformation. That transformation is something that can impact
on us and out of that impact comes this mutative process.
PPPPlllluuuuttttoooo iiiinnnn tttthhhheeee 9999....5555
Finally, Pluto in Gate 9, in the 5th line. Don’t use your energy or focus your
energy on anything but what is practical. That’s what Pluto is saying. This is a
time to use practical energy, and this is a time to see that using your energy
practically is to really bring the proper quality of focus and concentration to any
task that you’re involved in.
44446666 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
For anyone who carries the 52nd gate, Pluto in the 9 anyway is so important. It
is bringing about the initiation possible through a format being present. So
everybody who’s carrying the 9-52 are these great opportunities for us in any
field, whether it’s science or the arts, to really have a deeply fueled and focused
energy for detail work. And of course the 9.5 now is a classic opportunity. We
went through nearly 3½ months of Pluto in 9.3 which meant all kinds of
missed things, all kinds of wrong directions in focusing.
Now we have the advantage of Pluto in 9.5 saying, “Look, if you have
something practical in front of you, then you can really focus. But if you’re
trying to figure out the name of God, you’re going to go to hell with this and
you’re going to lose your reputation because they’re going to say you’re nuts
and they’re going to put you in a cell and that’s the end of it.”
Remember that wherever Pluto is present, we have the inherent truth as the
theme for anything. In other words, the basic truth of this day is to use energy
practically. It’s the basic truth. And if you honor that basic truth, everything
else is going to work. That’s what Pluto is doing for us. It’s pointing out to us
at this stage in our evolution and our process what is the truth for us. The
truth is to use the energy of being focused and concentrated to make sure that
our logic is up-to-date because it’s the last time Pluto is going to do that for 265
years. It’s the last time we’re going to have a chance to nail down the truth for
the next Plutonian cycle. So we’re nailing down that truth now.
We won’t really know the results until we have Pluto going into the 9.6 because
out of the 9.6 we will be able to see, at some level, whether or not the practical
application of energy to detail has led to valued results.
One of the most interesting things is that from the time Pluto went into the 9,
the worldwide program to write the human genome has been almost 200%
faster than it was originally expected to be. There’s Pluto saying, “All right,
let’s get the detailed truth of the logic of what it is to be a human being, and the
whole genome is about to be published and it will certainly come out within the
next year.” That’s an incredible thing.
So we really are taking advantage, at some levels of this, this Plutonian gift and
it’s going to be there for a while. We’re going to still have years of dealing with
Pluto in the 9th gate. To recognize that the Pluto transit in the Sacral now is
one of the most important transits that Pluto has. It’s as important in its
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 44447777
impact as Pluto going from the 47 to the 64 in Virgo where it has this deep
impact on our dreams and memories.
Here what we have is that Pluto is moving from the 9 to the 5. In other words,
not only the energy to focus on what is the truth logically, but then to redesign
us cellularly. When I see Pluto go into the 5, I don’t think about individuals, in
that sense. Here is a mutative force at work.
When Pluto comes into the 5, it’s affecting every single cell in every living
thing. It’s affecting every one of the billions and billions of cells in your body
directly. Think about the significance of how powerful that theme is. And of
course what that means is to establish a new habit or ritual. So we’re going to
have the establishment of a new understanding of our pattern and it’s going to
come through that process.
It will be the same thing for Human Design, which will explode in the next
several years in the same way, following this pattern and taking advantage of
this Plutonian energy to be able to establish the legitimacy of a detail and a fact
and bring it into the general flow, bring it into the underlying Design.

We’re going to deal with projection for the next four days, and all of these
projecting channels, I think there are 19 of them, there are a lot of them. I’d
like to invite you to stay.
SSSSuuuunnnn----EEEEaaaarrrrtttthhhh iiiinnnn tttthhhheeee 44442222----33332222
Today is the 15th, and it’s a fifth line day. We’re still in 42-32, and it’s a fifth
line day so it’s a real good day for practical things. So if you’ve got practical
business to take care of, take care of your
practical business. And the whole thing
about a fifth line day is not to waste your
energy. It’s a day of projection, and this is
the day where people make up their minds
about things one way or another about
other people or certain situations or
whatever—it’s a real projection day.
It’s the kind of day where you think that
you’ve said something really nice to
somebody, only to discover weeks later that
they thought you had said something
terrible to them. It’s a projection day, and it’s also a great day for seduction, so
if you’re horny, it’s a fifth line day. You can do something about it maybe, if
you can find a willing seducee, everything’s going to be fine for you.
Remember, it’s a fifth line day with the Earth in 32, so make sure that your
seduction has value, that you’re not overcharged, that it doesn’t cost you too
much psychically. Because the 32 will get deeply depressed and tomorrow
you’ll jump out the window. Because tomorrow we’re going to have the 32.6,
so we’re going to have an interesting vibration on the planet. So remember the
nature of dealing with the days and dealing with them as lines is that you can
really get a sense of what’s going on out there.
Now you recognize, at least through this kind of teaching, that the nature of a
fifth line is about using energy practically. That does not mean that that’s
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 44449999
what’s going on out there. What’s going on out there is a lot of projection and
transpersonal attempts at universalization. In other words, there are all kinds
of people pushing their agenda today, and not necessarily pushing a practical
agenda, which leads to a lot of problems.
The fifth line also represents the completion of the true hexagram process. In
other words, it’s the sixth line that’s going to be the judge of all of that, but it’s
the fifth line that closes out the basic progression from the foundation at the
first line to its potential universalization at the fifth line. So when you’re
looking at a Rave week, you can always see that the fifth line day of a Rave
week is always really the expression of that week or the peak of that week’s
energy. This is what you’ve been doing for the last five days, very Venusian in
that sense.
Whenever you come across five as a concept, as a number, it’s important to
recognize that this has to do with our mores, and it has to do with the way in
which our moral system is structured. That is the way in which we deal with
each other, the inherent nature of our relationships, the moral basis of our
communities—they’re all structured on a five. We have small little
progressions that take place, and it’s one of those things to see that when
you’re coming into a Rave week, those first five lines are the developmental
process. You’re actually going through stages.
So today is a day where people are really trying to express the 42 and the 32,
trying to universalize it. This is a day when people are closing doors. It’s a day
of completion. So you’ve got a lot of fifth line completion business going on,
the end of things.
On the way here I stopped at the post office in Taos for the last time. It’s a
day of completing things, it’s a 42 process. And of course that 42 process is
going to operate in many different levels; in other words, it’s going to be deeply
mundane, tiny little things like ending a mailbox, and it can be very profound.
For many people in the world today, it can be a day in which relationships
come to an end, partnerships come to an end, alliances come to an end,
agreements come to an end. It can also be positive in the sense that today is a
day that it can clearly be seen that a cycle has come to an end and a new cycle is
about to begin, and the excitement generated by that. “Aha, I’m through with
this, I can start this now.”
55550000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
So, when you get to a day like today—and you only have two of them a year
that are Sun-Earth—you really have to see that in the calendar these are
important completion points. The transit of the Sun through the 42, the transit
of the Earth through the 42, you’re going to have this twice a year. And it
means if you look at that carefully, you’ll
see that if you’re really living in the
mechanics, and ideally if the whole planet
were living in the mechanics, these would
always be our natural completion points,
and it would be the natural place for us to
then begin new processes. Now of
course it’s not like that, and very few of
us live out our Type.
So, it’s one of those things for you to see
that in living out your Type you will get
these 42 experiences, and on a 42.5 day
you’ll get that opportunity to express
transpersonally the completion of something. It’ll just come out and it’ll come
out naturally as part of your daily process. It also means that in terms of the
32nd gate, that today is a day when a lot of people are going to ask for raises.
You know the 32 is about whether things are properly valued or not. The 32
gift is to recognize if the 54 can do the job and if that 54 can eventually be a
valuable asset. The 32 as the financial manager has to be concerned not only
for the valued productivity of those that work, but also the recognition of the
value of products themselves.
Now if you don’t have the 32, and you’ve got the 32.5 today, throughout this
week, you have been splenically mulling over the fact that you’re being ripped
off. I mean, particularly if you’re a Sacral person. The vast majority of Sacral
people on this planet right now today feel really ripped off. They’re frustrated,
they don’t really want to be in their jobs because they didn’t enter into it
correctly, and for the last four days the 32nd gate has been programming them
to evaluate themselves, their work, what they’re getting for it. And because
they’re unhappy, there’s no amount of money that is going to make them feel
valued.
And it’s a day in which people will suggest, ask, demand, scream for, cry, plead,
for greater value, to be recognized and given greater value, greater valuation.
So a lot of people asking for job raises. On the other hand, a lot of people
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 55551111
asking for discounts. Discounting day. “That’s too much, and I know it’s too
much, so I want to pay less.” All of these things at the mundane level;
remember, I’m keeping that very mundane. You have to see that the moment
you have a hexagram and you get to its fifth line day, it’s going to get really
expressed out there; not only that, but it’s going to create a whole projection
field around it.
So the moment that something comes to an end, somebody watching you as
that comes to an end has all kinds of projections about that. I mean, my not
going to the mailbox anymore can create a projection field around people who
know me, and that projection field can be this or that. In other words, the fifth
line does that. So, you go up to the boss and you say to the boss that you want
a raise, there is a whole projection field created in that moment.
One of the tricks of fifth line days is to recognize that it requires seduction, and
that nothing gets greased on a fifth line day without seduction. In order to get
through the projection field, you’ve got to be a good seducer. Of course, not
everybody is going to resonate or harmonize with the fifth line theme, because
not everybody is going to be able on a fifth line day to universalize.
If you’re a 3/6, the fifth line day is not going to be your day, no matter how
much everybody around you is trying to universalize. It’s not your thing to do,
there’s no resonance, there’s no harmony. So on a fifth line day, if you have a 2
in your profile, if you have a 5 in your profile, it’s perfect for you.
Not only that, but the thing to recognize about that is that on a fifth line day, if
you’re a 3/6, look for the fifth lines—bless you—in your Design. Because each
and every one of those fifth lines or second lines, which are the harmonies
within you, are going to be able to operate on that fifth line day successfully.
LLLLeeeetttt YYYYoooouuuurrrr BBBBooooddddyyyy DDDDoooo tttthhhheeee BBBBaaaannnnaaaannnnaaaa WWWWoooorrrrkkkk
The whole business about seeing the detailed mechanics of how things operate.
If you watched everything, it would take you a month for every day. You
would be there, it would be hard to catch up. See, the fact is that Human
Design is so detailed and goes so deep, and so much deeper than the levels that
we work at, that I tell you these things so you recognize that they work.
Resonances, harmonies. Don’t drive yourself bananas with all of that. Because
55552222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
all you have to do is live out your Type and let the rest of your body do the
banana work, not your mind.
This is simply so that you understand that these mechanisms are there, and
they’re really operating and that’s why we have all these various nuances in the
way we experience things. But as a general field, to be clear, a fifth line day, in
the way in which it programs everybody on the planet, we’re going to have this
attempt at universalization, the attempt at seducing others with the nature of
the hexagram, and fulfilling the process of the hexagram at the same time; in
other words, bringing things really to completion.
FFFFoooouuuurrrrtttthhhh LLLLiiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy
In the fourth line day, you can only bring things to completion with your
friends. You can’t do it any other way. So I had friends with me yesterday
completing the packing of my house—perfect fourth line day. You can do
completion work, but you have to do it through the environment of the fourth
line, which is about friendliness and friendship.
WWWWaaaattttcccchhhh tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiitttt LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
So watching those lines tells you the way things are going to work in terms of
the hexagram. I know so many people who watch transits and say “Yeah but it
didn’t happen that way,” or “That didn’t happen” or “This didn’t happen.”
You have to watch that program. In other words, you have to see that when
you enter into a hexagram in the program that you have to recognize that your
connection to that transit goes through stages, and there are only certain points
in which those stages really come out, particularly that fourth or fifth line
experience of any transit. It’s not just the Sun-Earth.
PPPPlllluuuuttttoooo iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 9999....5555
Think about what that means when you have long-term transits. We’re going
to have Pluto, eventually, for example, going into the 9.5, and it may stay in the
9.5 for, let’s say three, four, five, six months. It means that the universalization
of truth is possible. It means that that will be a consistent theme that’s sitting
there. So watching the lines and recognizing that it’s part of a mechanism will
allow you to be much more comfortable with recognizing the energy that’s
going on in any given day.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 55553333
MMMMeeeerrrrccccuuuurrrryyyy iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 33336666....6666
We have Mercury transiting the 36th hexagram, and it’s in the sixth line. It’s on
the cusp of the 25. The moment Mercury is in any gate, to begin with, you
know that this is about what needs to be communicated, or what’s being
conditioned to be communicated
in the world as a whole. So what’s
being communicated in the world
as a whole right now is crisis. This
is Mercury, telling us all about it.
At the same time, it’s the sixth line.
Justice just ‘is.’ There is this
ultimate, eventual reward for the
inexperienced. It is their right to
move from inexperience to
experience. You know the 36.6,
after having more profound and
complicated experiences than
anybody else when they’re young,
their aloofness in the period
between the Saturn return and the Kiron return, gives them an incredible depth
in being able to look at the nature of human experience.
Ultimately though for them, they need to enter into the experience again,
ultimately as a teacher or a sharer of experience. That’s the moment that the
36.6 can become the 25.1. That’s the moment that it can become shaman,
priest, priestess. It’s the moment that out of its experience, it can teach
universal love. It can show that all ways are one way. It’s the great potential at
the end of the darkening of the light to open up the beauty of universal love.
So it’s a very interesting point, this transit point of Mercury.
VVVVeeeennnnuuuussss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22220000....4444
Venus is in the 20th hexagram. It’s moving quickly. It will move from the
fourth line to the sixth line between today and tomorrow, and having Venus in
the 20th hexagram is always an advantage, particularly when you think of the
serendipity of all of us being together now at this time. After all, the gift of
Venus in the 20th gate is to be aware in the now of our relationships with others

and our interrelationship with others, so it’s an existential opportunity to be
able to look around and to see the other more clearly.
It’s also, by the way, fourth-lined today, so
you know this is a day where beauty and
ugliness are equally present in the world.
And if you’re living in the now, and you’re
dealing in the now in relationships, you’ll
see that everybody that you’re dealing with,
all of us here, today is a day where we can
both see the dark side and the light side of
each other. Today is a day where we can
see the grace and at the same time the
disgrace in each other, because that’s
always the possibility of the 20 in the
fourth line.
MMMMaaaarrrrssss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22228888....6666
Tomorrow is something that is going to be fascinating, not for us so much,
other than as an information base, but in terms of what happens when you get
a confluence of strange lines coming together at the same time. That begins
today with Mars entering into the 28th hexagram into the sixth line.
If you’re somebody who’s part of the Neptunian generation that has Neptune
in 38—and there are a lot of young people with Neptune in 38—this is a
generation born around the early 90s. So if you
have this Neptunian generation, today’s a day
that’s very heavy for them. After all, the
detriment of the 28.6 is the Neptune in
detriment, and of course we’re dealing with a line
of blaze of glory. Remember the nature of the
28th gate. The 28th gate is the alarm system for
the individual mutative process. It’s the alarm
system in the sense that only the 28th gate is
concerned with life being truly of value.
In some ways it’s the conscience of the knowing circuit. It’s as if life must be
of value, that knowing cannot be idle, that it’s madness, that it must be of
value, that searching for knowing without any possible ability to be able to
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 55555555
resolve it is madness. That knowing must have purpose and value. The 28th
gate is the fear of death. And it’s not the fear of death in the physical,
mechanical sense of the fear of death. It is the fear that life itself is
purposeless, and that death will prove that.
TTTThhhheeee GGGGrrrreeeeaaaatttt DDDDiiiilllleeeemmmmmmmmaaaa tttthhhhaaaatttt LLLLiiiieeeessss iiiinnnn aaaannnnyyyy 22228888
So the great dilemma that lies in any 28—this is why it is the awareness of the
channel of struggle—is to know what to struggle for in order to find true value
and purpose in the life. So the moment you have the 28.6, what you have is a
purposeless life. All 28.6s are purposeless in their life until after their Kiron
return. Now that’s a generalization, please understand.
There will be circumstances where that can be quite different, particularly when
it comes to children coming into the world and being educated to their Design.
It really will operate very differently. Because you see, the 28.6 represents blaze
of glory, that absolutely nothing is worthwhile, so anything is worth trying.
Anything—any damn risk, it’s the gate of risk-taking. Anything.
And though risks are basic throughout the 28 process, because it’s the signpost
to the individual, it says, “If I’m in a situation where I’m ready to take a risk,
then I know that up until now, my life, and what I’ve been doing isn’t of value
to me, and there’s no real purpose in it.” That’s what that is always saying.
And when you get to the 28.6, what you get is that in the Saturn part of their
life, they either die or not. The first Saturn cycle, they either die or not. They
either go blazing out,—these are kids that crash in cars, these are young kids
that OD, these are young kids who are caught up in, most often, deep violence.
TTTThhhheeee 22228888----33338888,,,, SSSSiiiixxxxtttthhhh LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss aaaannnndddd GGGGaaaannnnggggssss
I would love to do gang studies. You can’t imagine how much of the 28-38
and how many sixth lines are involved in that. It’s extraordinary. In other
words, this reaction to the purposelessness of life. Be born in the ghetto at the
end of the 20th century, and think about whether life can have any value or
purpose. And what you get is the negative response to that.
55556666 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
So Mars being in the 28.6, Mars with its immaturity, its immature energy, its
enthusiasm, that all across this planet today, there are going to be all kinds of
people who are going to be driven by Mars to go just a little bit faster, to eat a
little bit too much, to get a little too close
to the edge.
It’s not that they want to die. This is not
suicidal, even though it can lead to self-
destruction. But it’s not suicide. It doesn’t
say suicide. It’s self-destruction, it’s self-
destructive behavior in order to be able to
see two things: One, that if you survive it,
the thrill that you’re alive, and all of a
sudden the individual with their romantic
attractions, it’s like “Wow!” Bungee
jumpers. “Wow, I’m alive. I didn’t get
crushed.” And you see this incredible thrill of survival, and so built into all of
that, compensates for the sense of purposelessness in life.
But not everybody’s equipped to survive the risk. So all of these children that
have the 38, these 10-year-olds, 9-year-olds, today’s a day where they’re going
to take risks. They’re going to go down on a hill too steep for their skateboard
and their ability, because they’re unhappy about something. And the 28,
because of its individual nature is going to bring out an associated melancholy
as a potential, and Mars fueling that. Yeah, yeah, it’s just a program after all.
JJJJuuuuppppiiiitttteeeerrrr iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22221111....6666
Jupiter is in the sixth line of the 21. This nature of being in control, everybody
today all over the planet—this has been going on all month—everybody’s
trying to control their own trip. Everybody’s trying to control what they eat
and what they wear and where they live and everybody is trying to control
everything. So there’s this enormous butting of heads going on all over the
place. Because everybody’s trying to be in control.
Everybody is trying to be the boss. Think about the person who’s trying to be
the boss, who gets the 28.6 today, along with the 21.6, and it’s a completion day
and they feel undervalued. It’s just a general theme.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 55557777
It’s a time of the year to see whether or not you’re going to be able to make
enough to be able to get through the year. If you follow the neutrino forecast,
you’ll see that in the progression of the
program we really go through material
seasons, times when we get ready, times
when we actually do our work, times when
we take care of our resources, times when
we use them again. There is a cyclical
program for us at work.
So here we have a situation in which
everybody in the program is being
conditioned by Jupiter to be in control.
And everybody wants to be the boss. So
there’s a lot of mudslinging going on and
slapping at hierarchies and all kinds of stuff
associated with Jupiter in 21. When the transit ends, the real 21s will take care
again and they’ll reassert their control. It’s just a program.
So there goes that employee rushing in there saying, “I’m undervalued and if
you don’t give me more money and if I don’t get my own seat in the cafeteria, I
quit.” They’re going to be very, very unhappy when they're out on the street
looking for another job.

Saturn's in 27 and in 27.4. Today's the day
that you can care for your friends, but that's
it and only as an opportunity. It's a 4th line
day. The externalization of caring. But you
can only nurture those that you're already
friendly with.
This is not about nurturing those you don't
know. And by externalizing your nurturing
with those that you do know, it has an
impact on the rest and it has an impact on
those who are witnesses of it. It has an
impact on others.
55558888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
UUUUrrrraaaannnnuuuussss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 11113333....4444
Uranus in the 13th gate in the 4th line—this is interesting. Uranus is there from
the 9th of the month through the rest of the month, so throughout this whole
process. And one of the most interesting things about the 13.4 is the
possibility of secrets being externalized between friends. So this is a time in
which people who are intimate with each other will share things that they didn't
think they were going to share. Will tell stories that they didn't think that they
were going to tell. Will retell experiences that they didn't know they were going
to tell. So a lot of information is actually coming out during this transit.
UUUUrrrraaaannnnuuuussss iiiissss UUUUnnnnuuuussssuuuuaaaallll IIIInnnnffffoooorrrrmmmmaaaattttiiiioooonnnn ttttoooo PPPPaaaayyyy AAAAtttttttteeeennnnttttiiiioooonnnn TTTToooo
Because it is Uranus, it is unusual information. The information that we get
from Uranus has as much to do with being a human being as any information
you receive. It is the only planet that really mirrors our cycle and it's the one
whose information is really essential for us to pay attention to. As Uranus
moves through the 64 gates in its process around the wheel, each of the gates
represents essential stages in life because this is the guide of our human life
cycle.
So when you see Uranus in the 13th gate, not only is it a time in which secrets
can be revealed, but it also says that this is a very important stage in the
Uranian process. In other words, that it is essential that these secrets come out.
And yet, it's also a major theme, and if you think about it, depending on when
you come into the world, you all get the Uranian cycle in different ways. In
other words, you have different starting points.
Some of us have a theme of having to release our secrets when we're very
young. Some of us only release our secrets when we are very old. The children
that are not yet born now, after this transit of Uranus in the 13, they won't tell
you their secrets until they're in their 80s because they're going to have wait the
whole cycle to get Uranus back into the 13th gate. So for all of us, wherever we
are in our life movement, this is an essential time because we're never going to
get it again. We're never going to get these unusual secrets and we're never
going to get access to them again in our life cycle.
Pay attention to Uranus, because if you see that, you can watch very carefully.
These are steps. It’s what the Ancient Egyptians called "sequencing." And
sequencing was a knowledge revealed to them that they understood, that we
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 55559999
went through, literally a structured pattern program, which ultimately became
known as things like the "Tarot" though they don't have any really direct
relationship to it.
But the fact is that sequencing itself, you can see the sequencing of the life
steps through Uranus. After all, Human Design is a Uranian system and that
the nine-centered Rave is something that’s coincidental to the discovery of
Uranus. So the modern human life, we have a great deal to do with Uranus
and its impact on us. So watch these steps that Uranus takes and see these
steps unfolding in your own process. It's fascinating to watch the movement
of Uranus and think of it in those terms.
Also, of course, recognizing that these are long-term transits. It's not like these
are short opportunities. They're all going to be around a year and a half so you
really have an opportunity to see what that step really means for you and what
it can bring for you. And you only get it once.

I've lived long enough now to understand the cycles of the planets inside of
Jupiter. To be able to see 15-year or 30-year cycles in Saturn. To be able to see
the 12-year cycles in Jupiter. The more cycles you live through, the more you
understand how you operate. One of the keys to Human Design knowledge is
your own research into your own cycles. It's something that is always
fascinating and it is limited by the nature of your memory.
But one of those things for you to recognize is that whenever you're looking at
your chart, first of all, if you're a simple split and one gate will bridge your split
together, or if you're a triple split and at least there's a simple split that will
connect one part of your split together, you have to see that that gate, when it's
activated by an outer planet like Jupiter, means that Jupiter's going to bring you
a 12-year cycle to that connection.
Now if you have a good memory and you keep on going back each time Jupiter
did that for you, you'll begin to see what those Jupiter cycles are all about.
You'll begin to see what they really mean for you. What happened to you the
last time Jupiter brought that definition? It brings it every 12 years. You can
see this in all the cycles, whether they are Martian cycles or Venusian cycles.
66660000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
One of the things to recognize if you look at those points in your Design where
there's the most pressure on you, then you'll see that these transits, particularly
the transits of Jupiter and Saturn, bring incredible information. Because if you
look back in those cycles, you then can begin to see what they're going to bring
in the future.
I've had extraordinary satories in looking at my cycles. I'm very Jupiterian in
astrology; I have Jupiter on the ascendant in Sagittarius. You can't be more
Jupiterian than that. And Jupiter has a deep impact in my Design. And when I
watch the Jupiter cycles in my life—and I've been around long enough now so
I've seen enough of them—I've been able to watch exactly and have been able
to see the pattern beforehand and then got to see the pattern filled out. The
most fascinating thing about us is that we are moving through cycles. And the
cycle, like a spiral staircase, we're further along in a process.
So though the thematic structure is always the same, the coding and the
coloring is different, but yet at the same time I have cycles where on the peak
of that cycle I would release creative material. And then the next time that
cycle would come around I'd have exactly the same situation: a benefactor, the
release of creative material. It wouldn't necessarily be in the same stuff.
Totally different circumstances, but always coming out in the cycle at the same
time.
So pay attention to the outer planets and its relationship to your personal
Design. You see, if Uranus is stepping into the 13th gate and that means
something to you, like it does to me—I have the 33—then it means that this is
a very important definition in my life, but I'm never really going to be able to
have any comparison. I'm only going to get it once.
It's not the same as dealing with Jupiter or dealing with any of the inner planets
or dealing with the Nodes of the Moon, which again is very important. Both
the Node cycle which is 18.6 years, and the half cycle the 9.3 years. Nodal
cycles are fascinating to watch. And if you take a look at any of these
processes, you'll see that if you go back in time you're going to be able to
understand much deeper where you are in your program right now. Where you
are in your cycle, your natural cycle right now.

WWWWoooorrrrkkkk wwwwiiiitttthhhh tttthhhheeee EEEEpppphhhheeeemmmmeeeerrrriiiissss
It's also an important investigation, ultimately, for any student that comes to
Human Design, because it is essential to be able to work with the ephemeris.
And in working with the ephemeris, you begin the very basic, mundane
understanding of how we're impacted by the program.
But the longer you stay with the program, the more you realize that the
program has its own theme. That it has its own genetic continuity and that we
live through cycles, according to the cycles conditioned by the program in our
own unique Design. At the moment you start looking into your personal
cycles, bells go off.

I've had a Jupiterian cycle where every time I get to that place in the Jupiter
cycle, which is Jupiter in the 22nd gate, and I have both Uranus’ in the 12.1.
And the detriment of the 12.1 is Simon the Stylite, absurd withdrawal. Every 12
years Jupiter comes along to the 22nd gate. It defines the channel of a social
being for me, makes me emotional and at the same time, emotionalizes that by
bringing out the detriment in my 12th gate first line. Every time that happens to
me, the Jupiter step just before, I release creative material, and then I step into
Simon the Stylite and I get divorced.
I watched my cycles, I watched that. I go back and I look at the movie and I
can see the cycle, one after the other. I mean not just simply divorced from
partners, two of the occasions were partners; the other occasion was a divorce
from people or associations or from the world or whatever. I don't want to go
into all the details of it. But nonetheless, fascinating to be able to watch that
and then to be able to see it predictably. I mean literally to be able to see that
happen. And basically what happened is that this time I divorced all of my
students in Europe.
TTTThhhheeee CCCCaaaallllmmmm IIIInnnnssssiiiiddddeeee
I've brought out creative material at the time, something unique, and then after
that was over, I divorced them and then I went into absurd withdrawal. Here I
am. We follow our patterns. And the sooner you grasp that, the more relaxed
66662222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
you become. You see, that's what I like about Human Design, it makes you
very calm inside. You don't have to be calm outside. We all have our Designs.
We all have our personalities. We all have our trips. It's about the calm that's
inside. You see, I know the patterns are there. I know that I can't do anything
about that. You know, what to do. They're there. And I am not only caught
in them, I am them. I'm of it. I'm an aspect of the pattern itself. I'm a pattern
within a pattern. There's nothing to be done. And of course in that, it's very
relaxing.
I know that the wheel is turning and I know I'm going through all of these
various stages. They're just programs. And if you can only cleanse yourself of
your vanity and see that you're not the captain of the ship. Most of us are just
stowaways. Hiding in the backseat.

Neptune in 41.3. Don't give away your shirt without paying attention. And on
a day of seduction, be careful of giving away your shirt. What the 41.3 does is
that it fantasizes about being generous. It's
one of the great jokes of the 41.3. If you
hit it with the 30, then all of a sudden that
fantasy has to be lived out as an
experience.
So what that means is that there is a desire
to be generous, which is one of the basic
human experiences. I think that's rather
nice, but it's trial and error. This means
that the experience of being generous is
not about the experience. How many of
us have thought about being generous to
somebody in our life? The fantasy of being generous, but the fantasy of being
generous doesn't necessarily bring the expectation.
EEEExxxxppppeeeeccccttttaaaattttiiiioooonnnnssss &&&& FFFFaaaannnnttttaaaassssiiiieeeessss
This is all about expectation, the expectation that the generosity will bring. The
fact that somebody's going to be grateful, for example. It doesn't mean that
somebody's going to be grateful that you're generous. And you may have the
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 66663333
expectation in your fantasies that being generous is something that everybody's
going to be grateful for. That they're really going to appreciate you. That
they're really going to think you're wonderful. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And
the 41.3 doesn’t know anything about all of that. That's just a pressure. And
one of the pressures in human experience is the pressure to be generous. To
give the shirt off your back as an experience. It's not personal. It's
interesting to understand that.
So with Neptune in 41.3, you may not even know that you're fantasizing about
being generous. Not only that, you may be surprised when you’re
spontaneously, experientially generous when you never even thought that was
something you were processing at all, there’s all this generosity.
IIIInnnn TTTThhhheeee SSSSooooaaaapppp OOOOppppeeeerrrraaaa YYYYoooouuuu SSSSeeeeeeee ‘‘‘‘TTTThhhheeee PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm’’’’
It's interesting to note, by the way, while Neptune’s in 41.3, the Second World
War began with Neptune in the sixth gate. A war of gas and all kinds of things.
The smog unveils of Neptune. And here we have Neptune in 41.3 and last
night I was watching CNN and all over the planet relief agencies are begging
people not to send clothes items for these Kosovar refugees in Albania. And
like out of the woodwork, they're showing you all these warehouses filled with
clothes that nobody gets. What they need is money to buy blah, blah, blah and
pay for the delivery systems, whatever. They're showing all these clothes in
warehouses.
Now remember that we've got a 21.6 at work, the whole 21 movement. So a
21 is about to decide, controlling what the tribe wears. And along with that,
you've got the 41.3 in which you give the shirt off your back as an act of
experiencing feelings. So here are all these people giving the shirts off their
backs to experience the feelings without that being practical, just simply the act
of generosity without any awareness behind it. That's why I love the news.
There are so many people of my generation who hate newspapers, because they
don't like bad news all the time. And of course I like newspapers because they
are the ongoing human soap opera. I've been following stories that haven't
changed in 30 years, 40 years. It's an incredible soap opera and in the soap
opera you see the program. Not only that, if you read the newspaper, which is
full of quotations, the words that come out of people's mouths are full of
66664444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
keynotes. It's fascinating to watch the program at work and watch the way in
which the program comes out of the world's mouth, because it does.
So be careful, be clear about this. Remember that conditioning is not
something you have to accept. You can take advantage of conditioning, but
you don't have to take advantage of it. The fact that Neptune is there in the
41.3 means that that's veiled, so you have to pay intellectual attention to that.
You have no real access to the fact that there is this building pressure inside of
you to be generous as an experience. As an experience. And of course you
don't have access to it.
So if you’re living out your Type, all of that’s okay. But if you're not, then
you're going to have to pay very close attention to what that Neptunian
pressure is doing to you. Be careful that you don't get caught in giving the shirt
off your back when it's not for you to do and it's not an experience that's
correct for you. Because then what you're going to discover is that your
resources have disappeared twice as fast and suddenly you're depleted, and
that's not a very nice feeling when the transit ends.
Neptune will eventually leave the third line, eventually, on the 20th of June
(1999). And that's in a retrograde; it’ll come back to it. Don't give the shirt off
your back.

Oh, Pluto. Pluto in the 9.5. Great time to universalize energy for detail. It’s a
great time for transpersonal work. So we have a nice example of Plutonian
work here, transpersonal work, the
externalization of that, the energy for detail,
the energy for concentration. After all, you
sit there for hours.
What that takes in terms of just the ability
to be able to process all of that and keep
your bodies from going bananas. So it’s
helpful to have Pluto in the 9th gate. It
makes it a lot easier for students
everywhere or for anybody who’s involved
in any kind of learning pressure, to have
Pluto in such a position. And not be, as it

was for so long, in the 3rd line. To really have a chance to really get a detail out.

The program for the day (sigh). This is a terrible day. Sarah and I got up early
this morning to pack. You know what it’s like to have dust in your nose at 7
o’clock in the morning? It’s really grotesque. I mean the last thing on earth
you want at 7 in the morning is dust, so it’s already a bad day. Let’s start with
that.
The Sun and Earth are in the sixth line of the 42 and the 32. In discussing daily
programs each morning, we’ve been talking about the progression of the
themes of days as they move through
the lines. It’s one of the things to
recognize about the sixth line day is
that it’s a day of rest. You can all go
home.
The nature of the sixth line day is that
this is the day that you reflect on, and
look at, what’s taken place through the
Sun-Earth programming for the week.
The previous five days can now be
seen in perspective. In essence, sixth
line days are not days in which one
should be involved in activity.
Ideally, a sixth line day is a day to rest. The concept we have that we need
these rest days in the week, or the time structures that we have, is that it is, in
fact, something that is necessary for us. In order to be able to understand the
nature of the program we’ve just been through and its effect, we need to have
the opportunity, with the same imprinting, to be able to look at the process.
So, for example, today is a 42.6 day. Today is not the day to really complete
things unless it’s big time, because the one thing we know about sixth lines is
that most of the time, they’re in the business of judging. But in order for them,
finally, to be complete, they must enter into things as well. So, it is possible to
end things today, but those are things that are going to carry much more
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 66667777
weight, in that sense. Generally speaking, this sixth line day of the 42 is a day
to look back over this week and see what came to an end.
Any of you have an experience of things coming to an end in the previous five
days? That’s a question. Anybody?
Student: Taxes.
Ra: Taxes. Yeah, well that came to an end for everybody. And, of course,
that’s also interesting because that is the traditional pattern; that the Sun is
always going to be in the 42nd gate at tax time. So, it is always bringing a
financial season to a close. There’s no question about that.
I have my own process where today I moved out of the house that I lived in
here in Taos, something coming to an end. So, it’s one of those things to keep
in mind, that if you reflect on this today, when you have your opportunities, all
of you have gone through some kind of completion at some level. Now, not
everybody is tuned to that.
Remember, that’s the whole thing about being in a program, and having your
own specific aspects that tailor, in that sense, the way the program operates
through you. But at some level or another, that’s something you’re going to be
able to see around you in what you’ve experienced over the last five days.
Now, that’s true as the Sun moves through every hexagram. It’s not just a
matter of seeing that you’re being given the program. You’re also being given
the opportunity, within the program, to see the impact of the program on you
which is, I think, very nice of the program to do, to give us our sixth line
opportunities to be able to reflect on things.
Now, what happens to most of us is that on sixth line days, if we’re lucky
enough, they go late into the evening. Remember that a line and a day are
similar but they’re not the same. So, you can have a line. The sixth line may
begin, for example, at eight o’clock in the morning, or it may begin at 11
o’clock at night. But the fact of the matter is, because most people are
working, generally, on sixth line days—they don’t always fall on a Sunday, or
whatever the case may be—that you end up with being pressured by that sixth
line to reflect, and that’s a day where you really feel exhausted.
66668888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
This is a day where there’s a lot of pressure on you, not to be busy, but to be
reflective. And so what happens to most of us is that we work through these
sixth line days. We get into the evening, we’re rather testy with those people
around us, because all we’re really looking for is that opportunity to climb up
onto the fence and onto the roof of the house, and look around at things, and
reflect on what’s gone on.
So, remember this pressure on you on sixth line days. Give yourself time on
sixth line days to have some reflection, to be able to look back and pay
attention to what you’re looking back at. You’re looking back at a specific
theme. In this case, you’re looking back at the 42-32 theme. To get to the 32.6
we’re in a situation where on this particular day, heavy, heavy energy is floating
around.
MMMMaaaarrrrssss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22228888....6666
We have Mars in 28.6, which we have already seen blaze of glory, the
consequences of what that can be if one is unaware. At the same time we have
the 32.6, and the 32.6 is just as depressing,
if I can use that kind of language for it. In
other words, the 32.6 is all about the
breakdown of continuity, and the
breakdown of continuity leads to
depression, the breakdown of the value
system.
It’s like what happens in a time of
enormous inflation where suddenly
people’s resources are just eliminated. This
is a 32.6 phenomenon. You had $10,000 in
the bank, and all of a sudden you can’t buy
a loaf of bread with it. This is a 32.6 phenomenon. In other words, that the
value system, that the continuity of the value system breaks down.
From the point of perspective of a sixth line, what we’re looking at is that over
the last five days in this process, we have all been assessing value. Value in
what we’re doing, value in what we’re involved in, value in others. And what
we’re looking for is whether or not we’re getting the possibility of
transformation, whether or not this is furthering our material ambitions. So,
the sixth line of the 32 is about looking over your shoulder and seeing whether
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 66669999
you used your resources well in terms of getting value for your efforts. The
other thing is that the 32, because it’s in the splenic system, is going to bring
with it the theme of fear of failure.
Now, this is a day where a lot of people feel like they’re failures. And this is a
day, because they feel like they’re failures, that given the 28.6 and the amount
of energy that’s in that, there is the possibility of taking a risk, taking a
dangerous risk, in order to try to avoid what feels like a failure. Now,
considering that it’s a theme that only is going to come from the Sun-Earth
twice a year, these are important moments in the year. They’re important
moments to reflect upon whether or not what you’re doing is a failure or a
success.
This is your opportunity, every six months, to review your movement up the
ladder, and whether or not life is truly valued for you, in the sense that you’re
getting the resources that you think that you deserve, that you’re not being
ripped off, and you see that there is some possibility for you to turn that into
something that is successful, rather than seeing that what you’ve done over the
last six months has brought you nothing but the sense that, if you keep on
going in that direction, you’re going to fail. So today is a crunch day for a lot of
people.
If you’re a 54, and you don’t have the 32, and you’ve got the 32.6 (transit)
sitting there, your whole dream of transformation, your dream of becoming the
empress, that whole dream can suddenly be shattered in the recognition that
nobody has really seen you for what you’re worth. And you won’t get your
chance to climb the ladder, and in that sense, you become inflationary; you’re
worth a lot less. You thought you were going to be worth a lot more, and
suddenly you realize you’re worth a lot less, and, of course, this can be very
depressing.
It’s also very important that the 54 is looking for the continuity to be able to
move through the whole material chain, and with the 32.6 standing there saying
“Well, this is all very depressing. We’re not going to be able to transform,
we’re not going to get that raise, we’re not going to...” whatever the case may
be.
You have to see the magic of polarities, the 42-32, their deep relationship to
each other. What you have here with the 32.6 is that all kinds of companies
right now, who have just paid their taxes, are looking to see whether or not
77770000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
they are going to succeed or fail in the coming year, and this is a depressing
day. And it’s also a terrible day for the ad agency. They’ll blaze of glory you
today, you’ll end up taking a risk with your product. I mean, yeah.
I had so much fun last night. Sarah and I were watching some bad movie, and
there were delightful commercials, and one of these commercials is somebody
who goes into a bar, and orders some kind of non-alcoholic, clear drink with a
funny name that I’ve never seen before, Zema or Bema or something like that.
And a waitress opens the door, and a dog comes in and bites this man’s ass
while he’s drinking, and he’s turned to ice and falls on the ground. Now, this is
a blaze of glory ad. It’s suicidal, but it’s there, the risk that you take, to go out
on the limb.
So this is a day where you look at your failure and you say, “Oh, my God things
are terrible. I’m going to take that risk now.” This is a day where people sign
contracts they should never sign. I mean, never sign. You never sign anything
on a 32.6 day. You've got to be bananas. This is a day in which there is no true
continuity. There’s only the attempt to see if there is any continuity.

There are a lot of things happening today. The Nodes change their line,
moving retrograde from the second, now into the first line today, so, we’re
dealing with foundation principles today. You can see how that all nicely
comes together. It’s what I love most of all about working with the program or
what I do in recording the neutrino forecast.
I get into such a space, because I have so
much experience seeing the genetic
continuity in a chart, and to see the genetic
continuity in the daily program is spooky.
There is a continuity in all of those planets,
in all of their positions, in their relationship
to each other. It’s always giving us a story.
It’s always a program. So, at the same
moment we’re coming to this point of
looking and seeing at what has been
completed—and remember, that’s a six
month completion process. So, you’re looking at what has been completed
over that six months, and at the personal level, whether or not that force of
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 77771111
completion has been activated in the previous five days, and at the same time
through the 32, seeing whether or not any of that was of any financial, material
value.
If it was helpful to you in your career, in your social life, and at the same time,
you have the Nodes of the Moon moving into the first line themes, the
foundation, the 49.1. What is the foundation of revolution? What are the basic
principles? In other words, you’re starting fresh with this. You have a moment
of completion now.
Remember, that the next step tomorrow is the Sun in the third gate, difficulty
at the beginning. It’s a new process. So, you’re completing something and
then you’re going to step into what’s new. So, what you’re stepping into is the
foundation of, number one, what is the basic principle? And, number two,
what is the fundamental answer? In other words, what’s the basic formula?
They become major themes for us that are going to last until the 27th of the
month.
NNNNooooddddeeeessss RRRReeeepppprrrreeeesssseeeennnntttt OOOOuuuurrrr AAAAnnnngggglllleeee ooooffff SSSStttteeeellllllllaaaarrrr RRRReeeecccceeeeppppttttiiiioooonnnn
Then we’re going to have this transition of the Nodes into the Sphinx. We
won’t have a chance to talk about that in this kind of environment. I would
like to remind you about the fact that the moment that the Sphinx is present in
the Nodes, as a theme, then you know that you have very powerful direction
themes at work. After all, everybody’s Nodes represent their movement in
space. It represents their movement from the past into the future.
The moment you connect those Nodes to the Sphinx itself, which is about
direction in life, you can see that these are major points in which, instead of
having traffic going in many directions, all of a sudden barriers are put up, and
all the traffic is focused through certain lanes.
What we have is a general directional movement, a general directional guide
that will come out of this relationship of the Nodes to the Sphinx. And in this
case, it’s going to be through the 7 and the 13. The future and the past, these
roles, this direction of future and past, these are going to be dominant themes.
The presence of the first line in the Node, remember that the Nodes are going
backwards. It’s interesting to look at the fact that the way we get programmed
within the solar cell is almost exclusively moving direct with built-in retrogrades
77772222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
as we have in Mercury and Venus and all the other planets, these built-in
retrograde sequences.
But, basically speaking, everything is moving counterclockwise. And the
moment that we come to the Nodes, we come to trans-cellular information.
In other words, we come to the stellar field of information that’s beyond the
programming of the 70% of the neutrinos we get from our sun.
The rest of that neutrino feed, and of course, the Nodes of the Moon represent
our angle of stellar reception, because that’s actually the best way to express
that. The Nodes represent our angle of stellar reception. In that, you can see
that the stellar program operates differently. In other words, we have two
working at the same time.
It’s the same way in which Human Design uses traditional western astrology,
which is basically a direct system; and Vedic, or eastern astrology, which is
basically a retrograde system. The Nodes of the Moon in western astrology
were borrowed from the Brahman’s anyway. This is Rahu and Ketu. The
Nodes are an ancient part of Vedic astrology. And you can see that the
retrograde of the procession of the equinox, and the nature of the Nodes are
the other side of the binary wheel.
In other words, we have a wheel that’s working in two directions, and if you
read any kind of mystical crap from the 19th century, they’re always going to tell
you about stuff like that. They’re going to tell you, “There’s a mysterious
second wheel that operates retrograde going around.” They give you one of
these stories. So instead of Aries going to Pisces, your Pisces is going to Aries,
and then they make up a million things about all of that, but the concept’s
right. In other words, we have these two ways in which the program works, so
pay a different kind of attention to the Nodes as teachers.
First of all, they’re good teachers because they stay in gates a long time. And
the fact of the matter is, that all of us get to live, most of us anyway, get to live
through consecutive nodal cycles which are 18.6 years or they go into the same
gates the other way around every 9.3 years. We have these nodal cycles
basically every 9 years plus three or four months, and if you look carefully at
your own history of your nodal cycles, you’ll see how important they are for
you. After all, nodal cycles are your stellar cycle.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 77773333
We do not reach the godhead through the solar program of the Sun. The sun
is the head of our local godhead, the local stuff, the Zeus’ and Mercury's and
things like that. But in order for us to reach into cosmic godhead, to reach out
into the totality, we do that through the Nodes. It’s the only way. The greater
information of the body comes to us backwards. It comes to us backwards. It
comes to us from the 6 going back to the 1.
So, one of the things to be clear about is that when you’re looking at the first
line theme that we’re in now, this is not a first line getting ready to go to the
second line. This is a first line getting ready to go to the sixth line, the way our
evolution works. All of us here on Earth are in a global first line theme, all of
us. And that first line theme is going to become a sixth line theme in 2027.
We’re going to have this transition from the 1 to the 6.
Any of you that have either the 63 or the 19, this is the time for you to have an
interesting experience. That foundation is being established for you to be able
to sit on the fence and look at the next set of hexagrams. Instead of being at
the sixth line and you’re looking back at your process, you’re at the first line
setting the foundation to be able to see correctly the next set of hexagrams that
are coming. To be able to establish the proper principles is going to lead to a
greater opportunity for connection with humanity and understanding of
humanity.
The 13.6, the fellowship of man. Now, the 13.6 at the six level is there to be
able to look at the nature of our openness, and to look at the nature of secrets,
human collective secrets, and to be able to see which one of them, or which of
any of them, are of value. Now the fact is that the way the 13.6 takes in all of
that information is conditioned by what they get from the 49.1. In other
words, do they have the proper principles as a foundation? This is the
movement in the wheel. It’s the program in the wheel.
Many of you took the lines course with me. We went around the wheel the
western way. We went around the direct way, going counter-clockwise. If I
ever had the energy—and I don’t—and if there were ever students that were
willing—they would be, but they’re crazy—I would do the whole thing
backwards, like a bad Beatles album. There was never such a thing, but
nonetheless—going backwards, because the fact of the matter is that the story
is different when you go backwards.
77774444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
Think about our evolutionary transition that’s about to take place. If you look
at the wheel, right now, the
precession of the equinox,
we’re in the 37th hexagram in
the first line, and on the other
side, we’re in the 40th
hexagram in the first line
(indicated in purple).
Now, we’re going to go
backwards, we’re going to go
clockwise. The next step,
which comes in 2027—we’re
in the last part of a closing
cycle, the next step—we go
into the sixth line of the 55,
and the other side of that is
going to be the sixth line of
the 59 (indicated in teal).
Now, that 37-40 is part of the Cross of Planning and the other side of that is
the 9 and the 16. When we shift it’s going to be the 34 and the 20. So, what
we’re going to have is the 55-59 and the 20-34 as our theme beginning in 2027.
You’re going to have the 20-34, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy. So we’re all going
to be busy, and you’re going to have the 59, which is going to be a theme, and
as you will see, that theme of the 59 will bring infertility into the world. And
then we’re going to have the 55. And they’re all going to be sixth lines.
If you want to see what 2027 is really going to look like as the beginning of a
new era, all you have to do is look at the 20.6 line, wisdom; the 34 and its sixth
line; the 59 and its sixth line, the one night stand; and the 55 in its sixth line.
Now, the 55 in its sixth line, which is the line of selfishness, this is the place
where the genetic mutation is going to take place. The genetic mutation that’s
going to open up the Solar Plex system to Solar Plex awareness.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 77775555
So when looking at the Nodes, and watching the way in which they operate,—
and by the way, the reason that I say sterility with the 59.6, the thing to
recognize about the 59.6 is that, remember, it’s fertile and promiscuous early.
And then it stops for most of its life and sits on the fence and is no longer
fertile, because by the time it gets off the fence, its fertility is, generally
speaking, over. So, the 59.6 coming in as a theme is going to be something
that’s going to be rather surprising in the impact that it brings, because it’s
going to bring a great deal of non-reproductive energy.
So the Nodes, like the precession of the equinox that is so important to us, in
terms of our global movement, you can see that these retrograde movements
have a deep connection to the outer stellar field of information. It’s through
the Nodes that people talk to the Pleiades and all of this stuff. Now, it’s not
that there are aliens out there, and they all have wonderful tits and they live in
huge villages, I don’t know. I mean all of that is just our mythology.
77776666 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
This is crystals and it is neutrino fields of information, and it’s nice that we
anthropomorphize all these things, and dress them up, and give them nice
names, but let’s be clear about it. They’re not in physical form, running around
playing badminton. They don’t do that.
So when you’re looking at the Nodes, you get the same magic and you get the
connection to the outside. So, that first line theme that’s here now is the first
line theme leading us into our roles. What it’s saying—and it’s a short period,
it’s very quick, it’s from the 16th to the 27th—in that short period, it’s essential
to grasp certain basic things. What principles are important for me? And those
principles are: are my relationships fair? Is there loyalty in my life? Is there
enough to eat? If not, who has to be sacrificed? What has to be sacrificed?
The 4th gate in the first line is simply about the establishment of what’s the
basic formula. Not about all of the sophisticated stuff, just what’s the basic
formula. The basic formula, basic principle, leads to being able to be, like the
7.6, an excellent administrator. Remember that we’re going through a long
season here that’s just coming to an end of the 4-49. In other words, beginning
with trying to figure out what the principles are, to finally seeing what they are,
and then having that be your answer in terms of what you do.
MMMMeeeerrrrccccuuuurrrryyyy iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22225555....1111
In the inner planets today, Mercury is in the 25th gate in the first line. It just
left Pisces and the 36th gate sixth line, and it’s going
retrograde; again, the six to the one. Don’t forget these
transitions. By the way, that’s not retrograde, it’s direct; I’m
spinning this morning. I got wheels going in both
directions.
The 25th gate is a delightful gate in the sense that it’s a cusp
gate. Pay close attention, those of you particularly that have
an astrological background, because it’s so fascinating to see
that the nature of boundaries can be so arbitrary. There are many cusp
hexagrams; that is, a hexagram that crosses two astrological zones. You have
that in the Vessel of Love—all four of the gates of the Vessel of Love (25, 46,
10, 15) are cusp hexagrams.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 77777777
So, the 25th gate crosses a boundary. It
crosses a boundary between what is known
as Pisces and what is known as Aries—the
Piscean side and the Arian side are very
different. I mean, I know. I’ve met a lot
of Arian 25s, a lot of Piscean 25s, and
they’re really very different. It’s interesting
to look at that, and see the differences in
them, yet they’re both 25s. No question
about that.
So, here we are in the Piscean field, and of
course Pisces-Aries form the worm
Ouroboros, the snake that eats its own tail. That place of the beginning and
the end, of the Alpha and the Omega, is the cusp of the Pisces-Aries field. At
that point, you’re in the 25th hexagram.
So, this gate of innocence, this gate of universal love, sits in a really nice place.
It is both the beginning and the end. It is the beginning of life, and it is its
completion, and the wisdom that comes from going through the whole
process. The fact that Mercury is there means that the love today, generally
speaking, is going to be cool love that’s communicated. This is not a huggy
day. 25 love doesn’t appear to be too loving. It just tends to be cool in the way
in which it comes out. It’s not the 46.
So, on a day where you’ve got the 32.6 as a solar theme, and you’ve got cool
love around, opening up for initiation. Think about the people that have the
51 today. Anybody here have just the 51? We’ve got two. Both of you take
care. Wear life preservers all day and hold hands while you walk through life.
No joke. Jeez, I love to scare people.
If you have the 51, and if you have the 51 in an undefined Heart Center, today
is a day of initiation and it’s a day of powerful initiation. That initiation is
coupled with the events of the day. Initiation and completion. Initiation and
value. Initiation into depression. Initiation into taking risks. All kinds of
things are possible with that sitting there. If today was the 13th it would be a
really perfect day, wouldn’t it?
77778888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss

The saving grace of the day is Venus in the 20th gate in the sixth line. This is
the place of my natal Venus. The sixth line
is exalted. It’s the line of wisdom. It’s the
capacity to be able to recognize, in the
now, what is of value to society.
Interesting that with all of this unstable
energy present today,—and by the way, it
ends rather quickly because it’s Mars that’s
really carrying the weight here.
It’s the Mars in combination with the Earth
in 32.6, but the 32.6 as its own each year at
that point, is very important for all of us.
In other words, it’s not a suicide day.
Normally speaking when that combination
comes along, what you’re looking at is to see that whether what you have
completed has been a success or not. And whether as a success or not it means
that you can move further along in your track to continue your progress of
moving up the hierarchical ladder.

But the moment you couple that 32.6 with the 28.6, then you’ve got something
quite heavy. In other words, the 28.6,
because of its individual mutative capacity,
starts getting really,—it digs into your
body, and it digs in and it says, “I’m really
unhappy. We’ve got to do something
about it.” So, that brings the real pressure.
Mars on Saturday is going to have
transited into the 28.5. Now, it isn’t to say
that preponderance of the great treachery
is such an incredible improvement from
the 28.6, but at least the risk-taking then is
valued. Very few people, by the way,
understand the 28.5.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 77779999
I must say that I’ve taken a deep course on the 28.5 in my life, and I know it
very well. The thing to recognize about the 28.5, is that it has a great deal in
common, in a sense, with the 54, in that the 28.5 is incredibly ambitious to find
purpose. Their ambition for purpose is an enormous thing. What happens to
the 28.5 is that they will leave anything, if there’s a possibility that there’s
something else that’s better. Doesn’t matter what it is. Whether that’s a
religion, a lover, a toy, a sport—it doesn’t make any difference.
So, the 28.5 that is taking a course, and seems to be delighted by it, and
enjoying it, can leave it in the moment, because somebody has told them that
there’s an interesting course that’s even better somewhere else. And every time
they leave, everybody thinks they’re treacherous. It’s not that they are
treacherous. So this line is something that’s often misunderstood. It’s
important to see that it’s a fifth line, it’s a line of projection. Other people
project that they are treacherous. And, of course, if they leave you while you
think that they’re really enjoying it all, you feel like that.
If you’re the person that has to deal with that, you’re going to feel the weight of
that genetic strategy; however, it’s important to recognize that that’s their
movement towards value. They stop being treacherous the moment they find
something that they can’t find a better version of. That’s part of the individual
trait. If you finally find the right kind of breakfast, you eat it every day the rest
of your life. So, it’s always possible for them.
But the 28.6 is a different story. The 28.6 is just too much, and really at the
mundane level in the West, what you’re going to see is people pigging out at
lunch. I mean, that’s the most common thing, particularly in America.
Inherent in stuffing your face that way is the damage it does to your health, and
your heart, and your body, and so forth and so on. It is well recognized risk-
taking. Americans get that pumped into them on television all the time and
they’re always being warned and there’s more cholesterol advertisement than
anything else, and today is the day you really pig out. It’s the 28.6, you eat a
little bit too much, you have a little bit too big of a dessert, you have a little bit,
just a little too much.
And this is a great day for road rage. So, we’re a lot safer here in a small
community; however, New Mexico has a record of being one of the most
dangerous places on Earth. Tonight is not a good night for driving. The vast
majority of people who drive in this state at night are drunk, and on a 28.6 day,
look out, because this is a road rage day. This is the kind of day where
88880000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
somebody gets the personal hit of something coming to an end, that it brings a
sense of failure. They’re ready to take any kind of risk.
So, depending on their Type, and whether they’re emotional or not, or they’re
an Ego type, or Manifestor,—all you need is a Manifestor that gets hooked in
this conditioning today, and you get in their way on the highway, and this is just
pushing it to the edge.
JJJJuuuuppppiiiitttteeeerrrr iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22221111....6666
The other thing is speeding. This is a great speeding day. This is day where
you put the pedal to the floor just to feel a little bit of exhilaration, just to feel a
little bit better, and it’s a 21.6 day. Whoa.
You really think you’re in control of it all,
too.
When you look at the weather, you can see
that if we could sample in clans, not
families, but in clans,—let’s take five, six,
seven families as groupings, and if we could
take all of those groupings and look at them
all over the planet, we will see all of these
aspects lived out in each clan. There are
always going to be those that are going to
live it out as a full archetype.
I guarantee you today there are people who are going to take this whole trip,
they’re going to take control, they’re going to go to the edge, they’re going to
get rid of their failure by killing themselves, and there’s people that will do that
today. Now, however, that is not to say that that is what everybody is going to
do, but you’re going to have, at various levels, this kind of phenomena all day.

I went in this morning to get a cup of coffee and the waitress says to me,
“God, it’s an awful day.” And I said to her, “What’s the matter?” She said,
“I’ve been here since six o’clock in the morning and you’re the first person that
came in.” And she said, “The cook fell asleep.” And I said to her, “That’s
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 88881111
quite a risk.” I mean, it’s just all funny. There’s an energy at work. No
continuity, there’s a waitress.
She makes her money on tips, poor girl, and there she is. She’s been in there all
morning. There’s no continuity. There’s nobody showing up. It’s a real sign
of failure, and it works at little things. It doesn’t have to be all the aspects that
are working in her life. It doesn’t have to be all of these aspects that are
working in yours, but it’s all those aspects are working in the program generally.
You really see all of this coming alive when people are together. You know.
Tell your story, Ed. It’s a great story.
Ed: Oh, hey, it’s devastating. Got up on Sunday, and the guy that does all the
work, he didn’t send the stuff.
Ra: So he’s got a photographic show and the stuff didn’t get sent. Don’t kill
yourself in your truck today.
Ed: This is all hard wired.
Ra: Right. That’s what it’s all about. People and their lives, everybody is
going to live out some aspect every day, please understand that. Today’s fun
because we can have some dramatic fun with these lines, but the reality is that
this is an everyday process.
One of the greatest opportunities for research that I’ve had in my work was
living in my village on the island in Spain. I would go into the café every day. I
would go into the village at lunchtime, and I would pick up my mail or my
messages, and then I would go sit in this café that I had sat in for over a
decade. And I would watch people, and of course, I knew the program, and I
knew all the people, and I would just sit there. I could sit there for hours and
just watch the program come out of their mouths. I mean it’s amazing to see
people just talk the program, and you could see it. You could see things that
were going on.
People going in different things, and all you had to do was go back and look at
the program and you could see clearly. Certain people are living out a lot of it.
Certain people only live out an aspect of it, but it’s there, and it’s alive in the
world at the moment. So, it’s one of the things to see about the power of the
program. I mean, the power of this program. This ridiculous, absurd, vanity,
88882222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
that we have about controlling this or that, or choices, or all of this junk. I
mean, it’s unbelievable when you put that into a proper context.
This formula that’s pouring in on us. It’s not like the old days where you could
say, “Well, maybe these neutrinos aren’t...” Those days are long gone folks.
You’re in the densest possible stream you can imagine. It’s so dense it’s
beyond our comprehension to imagine. We don’t have any control over
anything, and this program is so incredibly dense.
TTTThhhheeee NNNNeeeeuuuuttttrrrriiiinnnnoooo OOOOcccceeeeaaaannnn iiiissss aaaa PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm
My friend Jürgen Saupe in Germany, he gave it the name the neutrino ocean. I
love that, because it’s true. It’s a real ocean, and we are all in that ocean, and
the ocean has its own laws. That ocean is not simply an environment. It’s a
program. We’re all in that program.
The moment you’re working with an ephemeris, take it beyond its obvious
coloring-in level. You color in what’s connected to you. Yes, that’s basic. Yes,
all that stuff. But see it for what it really is. This is a profound influence
impacting on every single life, and you’re the ones moving through that life.
You want to be recognized for your awakeness. All you have to do is be in
your own Design, living out your own Type, and understanding what
everybody around you is forced to live out ignorantly through the program
conditioning them.
You’re never caught. You’re never unprepared. You’re never unclear about
what’s at work, and there are, in the end of that, no real surprises. This is the
magic of being able to watch clearly what the program is, not just for yourself.
TTTThhhhrrrreeeeeeee WWWWaaaayyyyssss ttttoooo DDDDeeeeaaaallll wwwwiiiitttthhhh tttthhhheeee PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm
Remember these three very important ways to deal with the program. You
look at it for yourself. You look at it for the impact it’s having as the
environment that everybody else will live through on that day, and then
mystically, so that you become a part of the continuity of the whole, see each
day as a new generation coming into the world.
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 88883333
Look at this generation coming into the world. I mean, can you imagine? We
will have about six or seven hundred thousand survive today, babies. So, we’ve
got about six or seven hundred thousand human beings who are going to carry
this as their personality. And later down the road, we’ll have some more
hundreds of thousands who will carry it as their design. Powerful stuff.
Look at this generation. Look at these people. They’re finishers, eh. This is a
nihilistic generation. This is a wave of nihilism coming. If I was a science
fiction writer, and I understood Human Design, I would never run out of plot
lines. Never, never, never, never, never, never. What happens to these people
in the future? What are they going to tear down? What are they going to
destroy? Because that’s what’s in there. You can write all kinds of scenarios. I
have a few myself.
If you see the transits in that way, day-by-day, it will enrich your spirit. That I
promise you, and I’m not one to make promises, because that’s really what it’s
about. Everything, everything about the value of Human Design, for me, has
truly come from watching the program.
WWWWeeee’’’’rrrreeee tttthhhheeee WWWWeeeeaaaatttthhhheeeerrrr ooooffff OOOOuuuurrrr TTTTiiiimmmmeeee
It was the first thing that taught me the truth of Human Design, because I was
alone, and in being able to watch the program operate within myself, I knew
that I wasn’t mad. I knew that it was truth. And by being able to understand
the environment, I’ve been able to deal with the world around me in a way that
I never could.
Being a lone wolf and being very individual, I had no real social understanding,
and I didn’t really appreciate human beings. By being able to understand the
nature of design, and how the program impacts people, I suddenly could let go
of my own prejudices, and my own arrogance about human nature. And by
seeing clearly that generations are coming into the world, each moment,
carrying these programs.
Most of you know I work at the Global Incarnation Index, which is all about
seeing these movements coming into the world, and that part has given me a
sense of my continuity, my place in the whole. I’m able to see that my job, and
my generation, that we had our program to live out. Anyone who had had the
knowledge I had, who had been able to look at that day in 1948 when I was
88884444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
born, would have been able to see the general theme that my generation of that
time was going to bring into the world. I realize in that because that is a
generation that is finite and will come to an end.
In the moving of the wheel we have a continuation of the genetic continuity
through generations, each successive generation, and that those generations, in
terms of Human Design, are gate generations. They’re different. They’re
different every day, and they’re coming in with their themes and I watch it.
Slowly but surely, over the last ten years, I’ve been able to see 10 years of
human life that is here in the world, that’s going into the wave of the world and
beginning to dominate the world with its energy.
I have a clear perspective of what the environment of the next century is going
to look like. It’s a background field. I can already see the weather. I can’t see
the mutation, but I can see the weather, and that weather is us. We’re the
weather of our time. We’re the matrixes of our time. Everybody’s telling me
to go see Matrix. This is a nice word, no?
So, take the program and take the program in at that level. Find your place in
the whole that way. Don’t forget to look at the generations that are coming
into the world, because some of them may be your allies.
There’s a whole generation of children who came into the world when
Neptune was in the 61st gate. May, around 1992, '93. And all of these children
are carrying Neptune in 61, which means that they bring out the exalted in my
61.1. I love these kids. I’m glad they’re in the world. They bring the exalted
conditioning of inner truth to the whole planet. And as long as they’re alive,
they will carry that Neptunian power, and they will keep it in the aura of the
world for the next 80 to 100 years.
You see, each generation carries what is essential, and that it’s essential to the
whole, and in that way you can stop seeing the program as just personal. Yes,
there’s a part of you that needs to see the personal, because until you finally are
living your Type, in the way that you ride a bicycle, you can never fully leave
the personal behind. But, to see the larger scope of our interconnection, the
larger meaning of our lives, and to see it as generational, then you can begin to
grasp the beauty of the whole. It’s just a delight.
The generation that’s going to be born tomorrow. They’re going to carry the
Cross of the Laws. They’re going to be very different, very different. They will
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 88885555
bring a deep mutative force. This cross, gates 3 and 50, includes the 60 and the
3. So, in that cross there is the definition of the 3-60, the channel of mutation.
And so, tomorrow a whole new mutative generation is going to come into the
world.
By following the Sun-Earth program, you can see that we have these six month
processes, until we get the reverse of the Sun-Earth in the same gates on the
other side. And so, we go
through this binary sequence of
each cycle.
Just like everything about
Human Design is a duality,
please understand that this is a
duality as well. In other words,
the solar year, the year of the
Earth going around the Sun,
that it’s divided into two parts.
It’s always divided, and it’s
always working out through its
polarities.
So, the next time that you’re
going to have to deal with themes of completion, and themes of failure, will be
six months from now when the reverse of the 42-32 will be present, and then
those themes will be dealt with.
So every six months, we’re going through, based on all 64 processes, we’re
going through these transitions, or in that case, 32 processes that are binary.
That’s also the way that life is coming into the world in the program. So put
the ephemeris in your bathroom, wake up in the morning, and look at yourself,
and look at the world around you. By looking at the world around you, and
keeping in mind the line themes, you’re really going to find it much easier to
navigate in the chaos of the world. It will give you an insight
If you don’t want to be banging around when there’s a lot of chaos, don’t go
out on fourth or fifth line days, when everybody is trying to externalize and
universalize their chaos. You can go out on lower trigram days when
everybody is more self-absorbed and quieter. You can always take advantage
of the mechanics. Always. It’s about awareness.

And by the way, when I say you can take advantage of mechanics, this doesn’t
mean that it’s up to you. Awareness opens up the possibility of clarity and that
clarity will lead you in that direction. No choice, after all. Ok, enough program
for this morning.

Our little look at the program for the day. It’s one of those things to pay
attention to the days of the week and look at their names. Our Mediterranean
civilization ancestors, the way in which they understood the energy program
was in the way in which they named things, just like us. We named Pluto,
Pluto.
WWWWhhhhaaaatttt tttthhhheeee DDDDaaaayyyyssss ooooffff tttthhhheeee WWWWeeeeeeeekkkk MMMMeeeeaaaannnn
So we have days of the week and Saturday is Saturn’s day. Now Saturn is
heavy, the Jews understand that. They know that Saturday you do nothing. An
Orthodox Jew won’t even turn on a light switch on a Saturday because Saturn’s
going to kick his ass.
Saturn is Yahweh. Saturn is the heavy God, the vengeful God, an eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth, and your generations shall be cursed endlessly,
heavy God, not a nice creature. And yet at the same time a very rewarding
God for those who can follow the law. You follow the law, you become the
chosen.
So Saturn’s day is a day in which the formula says you shouldn’t be active.
That’s an old formula. There’s more violence on Saturday than any day of the
week,—it actually is what people call Friday night, but it’s after midnight.
There’s an enormous amount of violence on Saturday mornings. Welcome to
Saturn’s day. It’s always interesting to note.
Monday is the Moon’s day. And of course it’s the Moon that drives us, so
it’s a great name for the first day of the week. Drive on.
My favorite day is Thursdays. If there’s every going to be a Ra religion, they’ll
all rest on Thursday, you know. Because Thursday’s a real good day to rest.
It’s a story-telling day. It’s Jupiter’s day, Zeus’s day.
88888888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
Anyway, today is Saturn’s day. Tomorrow’s the Sun’s day. We’ve entered into
the Sun in the 3rd gate and the Earth in the
50th gate, and of course the 3 and the 50
together as a right angle cross forms the
Cross of the Laws. It is a deeply mutative
cross because within the Cross of the Laws
is the 3-60 definition of the channel of
mutation. How many people here have the
60th gate without the third gate? There are
three of us.
So today is specifically the beginning of a
mutative week, those of us that are open to
that harmonic activation. The fact is that
the moment that you bring either the 3rd or the 60th gate into the general
program, you know that there is a mutative field at work anyway, because of
the nature of the world aura.
FFFFiiiirrrrsssstttt lllliiiinnnneeee DDDDaaaayyyy
We are on a first line day. Now you’re supposed to be confused; it’s okay to
be confused today. And by ‘confusion’ all I mean is that you don’t know how
things are going to work out. Doesn’t mean they won’t work out, it just means
you can’t quite figure out how they’re going to work out because you’ve just
entered into a mutative week.
SSSSuuuunnnn iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 3333
The 3rd gate, difficulty at the beginning, is about the recognition that order
finally comes out of confusion. And it is the acceptance that order will come
out of confusion. People with the 3rd gate who have undefined minds can be
very neurotic, always trying to figure out why they haven’t mutated, why they
can’t figure out where it’s all going.
FFFFoooorrrrmmmmaaaatttt eeeennnneeeerrrrggggiiiieeeessss aaaarrrreeee DDDDeeeepppprrrreeeessssssssiiiivvvveeee
Remember that format energies are by their very nature depressive—by their
very nature. And the moment you have the 3rd gate present, you have the
potential for individual melancholy as a theme, so this can be a melancholic
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 88889999
week for many people. And at the same time to recognize that out of that 3rd
gate is the potential, out of the melancholy, out of not understanding the
melancholy, to get depressed with the confusion. In other words, to be
depressed that your direction hasn’t changed, or you don’t know if it’s going to
change, you don’t know what’s going to happen.
Now remember that we’ve just gone through a very, very important cycle. In
the movement of the Sun around the wheel, this is a moment in which the Sun
goes from 42 to 3. It’s always important for us. Every six months, through the
Sun-Earth, we get this movement. This is
a classic shift.
This is the shift that says we are going to
go from completing something to a new
beginning. And so there is an underlying
theme at work here that there is a new
beginning at work, but of course this new
beginning is not visible. It’s not like you
can see where you’re going.
Even when you get to the sixth line of this
3rd hexagram week, it doesn’t mean that
you’re going to be able to resolve your confusion about where you’re going.
What you’re going to be able to do is see how you’ve progressed towards that.
But you’re not going to have the results; it’s going to take time. As a matter of
fact, you’re not going to finish it until next year when the Sun comes back to 42
and finishes what it is beginning today.
Now the cycle that we’re looking at is beginning a mutative cycle. And it’s a
mutative cycle in which the potential is that you get down the road a year from
now and you’re going to be able to look back and see what that mutation
brought.
Now again, this is the whole thing about knowing Design. Not everybody is
going to respond to this cycle in the same way. They may get locked into the
cycle in the next step, or the step after that, or the step after that. They may
have a complete connection to that program.
There are many people who walk around who are archetypes of, well, astrology
for example in the newspaper. If you’re somebody like me who’s a single
99990000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
definition Manifestor Aries, I am basically the archetype of the description of
Arian energy. Now if I read my horoscope, I can see that in my life. I’m close
to the archetype and everything about me is single definition and there to
manifest, so it’s all hooked up.
So the whole thing to recognize about the program is that it is relative
depending on your own Design. Somebody like me with a 60, this is the
beginning of a very important cycle each year, always, because it has a direct
impact on me. But it doesn’t mean it’s going to have a direct impact on
somebody else. You’re going to be able to see it in the environment around
you, and you’re going to be able to recognize it at work, but it doesn’t
necessarily mean that it is your own process.
This is the whole thing about watching the program. You can only watch the
program relative to the knowledge you have of your own design, that when you
recognize in your own design where those connections are and how they work.
For example, let’s say that you’re somebody who has individuality in their chart.
Let’s say they have a definition. That 3 is going to impact on them, even if they
don’t have the 60. In other words, it’s going to open up greater opportunities
for them to be in the aura and feel within themselves the definition of that
channel. They will meet the 60s. They’re going to be there. So they’ll get a
greater opportunity at the mutative process.
It doesn’t have to be a direct link, but if you’re somebody who is fundamentally
tribal or fundamentally collective, this isn’t necessarily going to do anything
other than give you a bad mood once in a while out of the vibe you’re taking in
from everybody else. Because most of the people who are unaware and who
are carrying strong individuality, with only the 3 being there and the 3 being
there with the Sun, there is going to be this field of potential depression. There
is going to be the sense of “We don’t know where to go.”
You watch the news now about NATO dealing with Yugoslavia during this
week, and you’re going to have this whole movement of commentary that says
“Everybody’s confused. They don’t know what to do. None of this is going to
work out properly.” You’re going to hear all this kind of language coming out
and it’s going to bring a certain amount of depression. In other words, what
you’re going to have is a depression in the polls about things like that. This is a
week in which people think they have this sense that things are moving, but
they don’t know where they’re moving, and of course out of that can come a
lot of fear. “It’s not going to work. I don’t know where I’m going.”
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 99991111
When you have the activation of the individual format and you have somebody
with an undefined Self, it makes them very uncomfortable. After all, the
undefined Self has a dilemma in its life. The dilemma in its life is that it cannot
initiate its direction nor can it initiate the love that it meets. And of course the
moment that the 3rd gate is there and activated, what it’s activating is a new
beginning, a new direction, which can feel very confusing to the undefined Self.
At the same time, it can feel threatening to the defined Self. “But I thought I
knew where I was going,” and all of a sudden there’s this energy that’s there
that’s saying, “There’s a new beginning at work. There’s something new going
on.”
The mystical name of the 3rd gate is the gate of the new. That’s where the new
comes from. It comes out of the 3rd gate. But it doesn’t have a form; it’s an
energy field. It comes out of the 3rd gate and eventually, moves through the
whole individual process to mutate the whole body. And when the body is
mutated individually, then it mutates its tribal aspects. And by the time that the
individual and the tribal are on the same side, the collective caves in, and then
everything’s okay. That takes a year, to go through that process, inside of
everyone as a world program.
It’s a first line day, it’s the day of the chameleon and it’s the day of the
foundation; it’s the day of introspection. It’s the day of not knowing yet what’s
beginning. When you have a first line, 3rd hexagram day, it’s not like the
moment you step into the transit that there’s something new going on. It’s
going to take the first line movement of the Sun almost a day to get you into
the energy field.
So right now in our process, we’re all getting into that energy field. Don’t be
surprised that in some of the things I tell you about in the next couple of days,
that you can’t figure out what the hell I’m saying, or you don’t know where that
leads to. This is natural with a first line day in the third hexagram.
With a first line day, it’s always important to see that each first line day is a day
in which you’re absorbing; it’s not a day in which you should be putting out, in
that sense. The first line is very, very concerned with being able to withdraw so
that it has its opportunity to be able to reflect, that it has its opportunity to be
able to dig into things and see what’s going on.

Now with the 3rd hexagram, this is about the introspection, not into an
intellectual concept, but into the presence of a mutative energy. You have to
feel it. It’s down here in your Sacral. You
have to feel this energy; that’s what today
is for—to feel that energy. After all, that’s
the foundation.
First, you’ve got to know that it’s there.
And the moment you get that kind of
funny feeling,—I had that, I don’t know
when that transit was, but I had a strange
night, so I know that that 3 coming is very
powerful for me. I’m always very aware
of it, and you feel the energy. I have a
totally undefined Sacral, so I’m much
more sensitive to that kind of definition, but instantaneously there’s a
difference in the energy field.
I am Sacral today. I’m now a split-definition, with a Generator aspect, my
Sacral to the Root; it’s very, very different. I can feel the energy, but I don’t
know what the hell it’s going to do. In other words, it’s not like you can work
that out. It’s not a logical formula. It isn’t something you can make sense of; it
is not an abstract process. It’s just suddenly the presence of an energy and that
energy may or may not be mutative.
So when you’re looking at a first line day, you have to look at the nature of the
hexagrams that are involved in order to see whether that first line day,—for
example, if it’s the 4.1, then you know that that’s something that’s going to be
present at the mental level. In other words, your logic is going to be tested.
You’re going to suddenly feel the need for a certain kind of answer, that
foundation is going to be experienced differently.
And you see, the moment you can get it on the first day, then you’re really in
the flow of how that progression is going to work, so that by the time you get
into the second line day, you can just relax and live out that process, because
that’s what second lines like to do. “Leave me alone, I’m going to be busy with
being confused today.”

I’m deeply attached to the presence of the Earth in Human Design. Very little
is known about the nature of the Earth and its impact on us. The Earth is the
meeting place; it’s the medium of the neutrino ocean for us. The way that they
proved that neutrinos had mass was by watching it go through the world and
seeing that it changed. And of course, the Earth is covered with design.
Think about the person with the undefined splenic system who feels so
wonderful walking in the forest. They could stay there for the rest of their lives
and be elves and fairies. And why? Because the design of plants includes the
10-57-34. And if you’re walking through the forest, you’re going to be stepping
on defined Spleens.
Well, it’s true. And if you’re barefoot it’s going to work even better because
you’ve got to touch the aura. You have to touch the physical body of a plant to
make contact with its aura. And if you’re standing in the forest and you feel
terrible with your undefined Spleen, hug a tree. Now, not all trees are going to
make you feel good. Not all of them are going to have defined Spleens, just
like us, but you’ll find a tree that does, and you’ll recognize it right away. And
if you ever wanted to have an experience and a satori about the nature of life, if
you’ve got an undefined Spleen, go ahead and try that; it’s wonderful.

The Earth is nothing but a living design. And it is truly where we get our
grounding; that is, in the relationship between the sun and the Earth. The sun
is impressive, we all know that. And it’s even more impressive in the concept,
and now in the scientific fact of, the streaming of neutrinos that are produced
by the Sun, the material of them penetrating everything that’s here. But you
see, so what? I mean, so what?
There are all kinds of stars in the sky. They’re all pumping out neutrinos. You
see, the program of light, well, yeah it’s great. It’s very nice. But it can just go
passing by. I mean, on the other side of the world now, light has just passed
them by. If you don’t have the form, then the program has nothing to
program. It’s meaningless. So the Earth is everything in that matrix. Oh yeah,
it’s chicken and egg, we know that, but then again we are a yin-yang biverse.

We are a basic fundamental duality. And you can never forget that in this
fundamental duality, we’re on the Earth’s side, not on the sun’s side. We live
over here. And it’s here that it is all grounded. It is here that the program is
given its opportunity to work through us, through life here.
And it’s one of those things to be clear that when you’re looking at the Earth in
your design and somebody else’s design, to understand its significance: that
Earth is where you ground your incarnation. In other words, it’s where you
literally can find the stability that brings you the potential of fulfilling purpose.
Not knowing purpose, we’ve talked about that, but fulfilling purpose.
They discovered that in the center of the Earth there is a liquid iron crystal, and
it’s 2,000 miles across. Can you imagine? A liquid iron crystal. I mean the
Earth is quite an instrument for life.

The Earth is in the 50th gate. Remember, we’re talking about laws here; in
other words, this difficulty at the beginning is about the establishment of the
laws for the coming year. And the laws operate in three ways.
There is the law that is structured out of
experience and based on belief. That’s the
56.
There is the law of the tribe, and this is the
moral values established as code, and this
is the 50.
And then there’s mutation that both
breaks the law and makes the law at the
same time, and that’s the 3-60.
So the presence of the 50 and the Earth in the 50 is that this is the beginning of
a cycle, just as the Sun in the 3 is the beginning of a cycle. Together, this new
beginning is about finding the right code of behavior, the right code of activity,
the right code of nurturing for the coming year. And the energy of mutation
will not take the 3, it will not lead to a mutative cycle unless it operates
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 99995555
through a proper code. That’s what the 50 is there for: giving the mutation its
grounding through law.
Now, of course, that’s a foundation. It’s the first line. And the first line is
called the immigrant. Oh, I love this line. This is a great line. You see, the
basis of our moral code is dependent on where you travel. After all, the laws of
Kabul are very different than the laws of Kansas City.
So the foundation of law is the recognition of diversity of codes. And of
course, this is fundamentally tribal. In other words, it’s built into the tribe to
have different codes of behavior in order to distinguish them from each other.
It’s very important to understand that. See, the bonding of the tribe is based
on similarity. And so, built into the law from the very beginning is this
diversity of codes for each tribe. That’s why it’s so hard to get the tribe to obey
collective law. Because where some tribal codes will be in resonance to
collective law, most won’t.
One of the classic examples today is female circumcision—horrible thing.
Now horrible in terms of taste, not morality, taste. The idea of it to me is
distasteful; however, it is the moral code of millions and millions and millions
of people. But it’s a tribal code. Now the collective says “this is awful, and
you cannot do this anymore.” And of course you can see the fundamental
conflict in that. The tribe does not want to give up its code, because the
moment that it gives up its code, it loses its specific identity. And then it gets
lost in the collective, and the tribe dies.
Now, of course, this is what the collective desperately wants. They don’t want
Koreans and blacks to be killing themselves
in Chicago or Los Angeles. In other words,
we would like all those tribal distinctions to
fade away, says the collective, so that we all
have one standard.
But you can see right from the beginning
that the 50th gate has very, very special
significance. It is the place in which the
awareness frequency is established. In other
words, that the basic awareness of what it is
to live together is structured through a code
that says each tribe can have their own law.
99996666 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
On a day of the immigrant, all of us are open to different codes and different
laws. In other words, like the confusion on the first day in which you have to
wait to feel the energy, here in the 50th gate in the splenic system is the
beginning of the recognition of an openness in your awareness to code, to
change of code.
Now what usually happens to people is that when you have the 50th gate and
you’ve got the Earth there, very important time,—how many people here have
the 27 and don’t have the 50? Four. Okay. So, the four of you. Those people
with their 27s, this is a day in which they can change your values. In other
words, with the 50 being there, they are able to attract people to their
nurturing, attract them to the sexual genetic strategy that is in the 27, and this is
a moment in which, through the 50 in the first line, you get called by many 27s.
They don’t recognize that it’s only a transit, they just think you’re a natural
harmonic for them. And so by carrying this first line, you get to meet different
possibilities of how the code works that you ordinarily would not meet.
Now as an exercise for you today, try every once in a while, to bring your
attention around to these two elements operating in the community around
you. Everybody today has to deal with this 3rd hexagram, 50th hexagram
combination. Everybody. And everybody today is under the potential pressure
to change their values in order to secure nurturing.
And everybody today at some level is being very voyeuristic and looking at all
kinds of different things while being hidden themselves. The chameleon
watching. Being a chameleon has two advantages. The fact is that you can
watch without being seen. This is a lovely advantage. And this is the nature of
a first line day, so you need to find your authority on a day like today.
And remember that today is conditioned by the 13.1. It is a truly empathic day.
It is a day of being open, in that sense, to taking in the possibilities. This is also
a day in which people move. And I mean move. This is the kind of day where
you decide that you cannot stand where you’re living, and you’re going to
change,—your neighborhood, your city, your state, your country; and for the
banana people, your planet. This is a day of immigrating.
Anybody born with a 50, 1st line, they’re going to move in their life. They’re
always going to leave their native home at some point and go away. They have
to, they’re natural immigrants. My new son Jiva, he has the exact opposite of
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 99997777
today. He’s 6 months old today, has the exact opposite. His 50 is the
personality Sun and his 3 is the personality Sun, first line. He’s an immigrant,
he’s been making everybody immigrate since the moment he was conceived.
He’s been pushing us around all over the place, and he’s a 3-60 and it’s
connected to the Spleen. So, this mutative force is just pushing everything and
making everything move.
So today is a day where the foundation is established for whether or not you’re
going to immigrate. Whether you’re going to immigrate to new values, or
whether you’re going to immigrate to a new place. And remember that this is
the Earth. This is the grounding, so a lot of people today are getting ready to
book airplane tickets and we’ll see at the fourth or fifth line day that if you’re
working at a travel agency, you’ll see that the fourth or fifth line day of this 50
week, they’re going to have a jump in airline sales.
All kinds of people are going to be deciding that they’re going to go here or
there, and by the way it doesn’t mean that they’re giving up their homes. It’s a
time in this process where people literally will suddenly realize they need to get
away or take a vacation or whatever the case may be, but this need to get out to
immigrate.
You have to see that the two together, the 3.1 with the energy confusion, and
the 50.1 saying, “I got to go somewhere.” This is a day where,—relax, eh?
First lines really don’t know much about dealing with the other. What they’re
there to do is get the primary energy in first. So if you walk by the travel
agency here in town, you see a line up outside the door, you know what’s going
on.
MMMMeeeerrrrccccuuuurrrryyyy iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22225555....2222
Mercury is in 25.2. This is the line of the
existentialist, and this is the perfection of
innocence. Whenever you go through
hexagrams,—there’s some hexagrams
where, by the Chinese tradition the 5th line
is always the most exalted. We understand
why, through our way of understanding the
hexagram, is that because it can universalize,
it can have enormous impact. But the
second line is its harmony.
99998888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
And the second line is always about innocence. It’s interesting to think about
that. Second lines have to be called out, otherwise they want to be left alone
and they go about their own business. They’re rather innocent in the way in
which they operate in the world until somebody will knock on their door and
make their lives much more complex for them. And here the innocence of a
second line, in the gate of innocence, and this is pure existentialism. In other
words, this is all about communicating the importance of just being about your
business. This is not a day to get caught up in the transit.
Be about your normal business, but be sensitive to these forces that are
working on you. The Sun-Earth transit over a six-day period is very profound.
Our weeks go by, we forget. It seems in hindsight, as if they take a moment,
but they don't when you're looking ahead. Clearly you go through in six days a
real phase in your annual process, and to see that the 50 and the 3, they're
going to grip you like they grip everybody else this week. And if you watch it,
you'll see it around you.
VVVVeeeennnnuuuussss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 11116666....1111
The interesting transit is the Venus transit going from the 6th line of the 20 to
the 16th gate the first line. The 16th gate is all about our potential, as a logic
process, to be able to experiment with
things. It is the gate of skills, and as the
gate of skills, it's also the deepest gate of
identification, and you can see the beautiful
genetic continuity in this movement that
we have.
In other words, you've got the 3.1 that says,
“There's new energy at work within your
body, and you don't know where the hell
it's going.”
And the 50, 1st line says, “Values are very
important, but there are so many different kinds of values, which one could
possibly be for me in order to be able to live out this energy properly.”
And then you have Venus in the 16th gate, Venus who establishes our mores.
Venus in the gate of skills saying, “Well, let's identify it.” So there's a deep
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 99999999
theme today of identification, trying to identify it, and trying to be identified
with it.
The combination here of Mercury and Venus is beautiful. Mercury says, "Just
be about your business, just be here in the now." And Venus says, "Yeah,
while we're here in the now, maybe we can identify with our skills. Maybe we
can identify what this energy is, or what the value should actually be."
Whenever you're working with the Sun-Earth, and Mercury and Venus you
have to recognize that they're always very close to each other. And though the
themes don't often work exactly coincidental,—for example, next year that first
line of the 3 may not be coincidental to the first line of the 16, but that first line
of the 16 may come before that or just after, but it's always going to be nearby,
because Venus and Mercury are never going to move far from the Sun.
YYYYeeeeaaaarrrrllllyyyy CCCCyyyycccclllleeeessss aaaarrrreeee CCCCoooonnnnddddiiiittttiiiioooonnnneeeedddd bbbbyyyy tttthhhheeee IIIInnnnnnnneeeerrrr PPPPllllaaaannnneeeettttssss
So, understand that there's a genetic continuity, not simply in seeing how the
Sun-Earth operates as a code for us, programming our code throughout the
year, but to see that Venus and Mercury work in harmony with the Sun-Earth.
And they work in harmony with the Sun-Earth either leading us into the same
cycle each year, or following the opening of the same cycle each year, or being
coincidental with it. So this year, for example, having Venus in this position,
the 16.1, and there is the Sun in 3.1.
When I was born, Venus was in the 6th line of the 20 and that was on the 9th of
April. It varies from year to year, and it varies through the long cycles of this
50 year odd program that you can watch Venus through. So, the thing to
recognize is that the inner planets are going to work in the program, and pay
attention to them because it’s not the same thing as looking at Jupiter and
seeing that it’s only going to be in that position once every twelve years in
relationship to the Sun-Earth.
The inner planets are really part of the ongoing inner program. The Sun is
providing us with the feed; the Earth gives us the potential to ground it. But
without Mercury we cannot communicate it. Without Venus we cannot
establish it in our lives and in our relationships. To see them in conjunction
with the Sun-Earth movement is very important.
111100000000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
This particular year we have this combination on this opening of the 25 and 16,
in this way. There are other combinations and it means that the way in which
the cycles work each year are going to be conditioned by the inner planets. So
you have to see them in relationship to that movement.
The 16.1 is also saying that here is the symmetry in the first line theme for the
beginning of this Rave week; in other words, we do have to get to the
foundation of it, and what is there to be identified with? That's one of the
great questions of the 16. One of the great questions of the 16 is, “Is there
anything worth identifying with?”
The moment that a 16 has any kind of spiritual training, they begin to say,
“There's nothing to be identified with.” And, of course, the moment they're
saying there's nothing to be identified with, is the moment that we lose a lot of
talent in the world. It's a direct flushing of talent down the cosmic toilet. And
it's one of the things to see that it's a natural tendency for the 16 standing
alone, particularly, to say, "I don't
know what to identify with. Is
there something I can identify
with? What can I experiment
with?"
So, you have to see that the 16.1
today, along with the 3.1 and the
50.1, it is part of the confusion.
What do I identify with? Where's
the experiment here? What do we
do with this? What is this I feel
inside that something's happening?
And remember that the 50th gate,
because it's the Earth and it's in a
defense circuit, the defense circuit is always sexual. Oh yeah, we know that the
50-27 is nurturing in the sense that it is
the metaphor of Mother-Father, but it's
Defense Circuit
still sexual. You can tell by the way the
laws are structured around sexuality.
The 50 never forgets about sex. I mean,
it's the 50 that decides that you have to be circumcised, male or female. It's the
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111100001111
50 that makes the decision of how old you can be when you physically make
love. It's the 50 that decides how you're allowed to have a mate. I mean, the
50 is into a lot of stuff. So, this is a day in which a new cycle is beginning.
Now, of course, you can't have instant gratification in this. It's not going to
work that way. You're only at the cusp of Aries-Taurus.
CCCCuuuusssspppp HHHHeeeexxxxaaaaggggrrrraaaammmmssss
Remember, I mentioned to you the other day how interesting cusp hexagrams
are. Hexagrams that cross astrological lines. The 3rd gate is a classic example
of that, and the 50. They are
both cusp hexagrams.
So, you can see that this place
on the edge of Aries-Taurus is
that at the beginning of the 3rd
hexagram, this is Arian energy;
this is seed energy. Yet at the
end of the hexagram, the
second half of the hexagram,
it's all Taurian. It's all planting
it, getting it ready. You've got
to wait until the harvest comes.
You're going to have the
harvest when you turn the 3-50
around the other way, because
then you have the 50 which is in October, which is in Libra, and you have your
harvest season. It's an ancient program. It's just built into us.
So, you will be able to harvest the values. You will be able to harvest the
benefits of the values of your code for this year when it's the other side around,
when it gets to Libra.
And you can see that the same thing is at work at the Earth level, is that you
have the 50th gate, which is a cusp hexagram between Libra and Scorpio. And
you can really see that the only truly pure trans-personal 50th gate is Scorpion.
It's the 5th line 50. The rest of it is Libran.
111100002222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
This is one of those things. I don't mean to knock astrology, what to do.
Sometimes it's just standing in front of me. I know so many Scorpions. I have
my south node in Scorpio. I know a lot of Scorpions. I have my Kiron in
Scorpio. I have collections and collections of charts, like we all do, and I have
a book in which I have about 300 or 400 Scorpions that I know. Just
Scorpions. And that book is organized from the gate perspective. It starts
over here with people who have the 50, the 5th line and the 6th line, and it goes
all the way to the end up to the 14.
Now, if you know Scorpions, and you see them this way, you can see how
different all that is. In other words, the 44 Scorpion, how different they are
from the 1. I mean they're just totally different. Each and every one of them is
different. It's like me, I'm an Aries. Okay, but I'm a 51 Aries. I know 25
Aries. They're not like me at all. They're very different. I know 17 Aries, and
21 Aries, and 42 Aries, and 3 Aries. They're all very different. Yes, they have
this larger theme around them. And if you understand that larger theme, like
all generalizations, it has values when you can bring it to the specifics.
But really recognize that these hexagrams—and in the end, the lines themselves
and the layers below—they actually bring us finite, exact divisions. One day
sometime in the next five or six or seven years, when I finally get the Global
Incarnation Index out and you get to see the mathematics of that, it is the most
beautiful thing I have ever experienced in my life. It's as close as I come to
being romantically complete in a piece of knowledge. The mathematics are
unbelievable. They are so perfect. And this is the magic of being able to see
things in their proper framework.
So, when I talk about looking at a cusp hexagram, it's important to recognize
that these are hexagrams where there are very strong shifts inside. Very strong
shifts, and yet at the same time, they are fusion places. And it's these fusion
places that are important.
MMMMaaaarrrrssss iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 22228888....5555
The movement of Mars, finally, we have Mars in treachery. God, that makes
me feel better for the world. I mean, we don't have ‘blaze of glory’ (line 6.)
When you're looking at a gate, look at the line. Just look at the line. And the
one thing that you know about today,—and this is what I mean about the
beauty of genetic continuity at the larger level. The 3.1, new energy. The 50,
1st line, the immigrant. You have to be able to check out the values, that there
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111100003333
is pressure to find the right values. The 16.1, you're looking for something to
identify with. And then you get to the 28.5
which says, "Life isn't of value to me. I'm
ready to give up what I have for something
better." Because that's what the 28.5 is all
about.
Now, look at the pressure that's being laid
out by the program. That’s the program at
work saying, “Excuse me, it’s Spring!
Springtime! Time to plant seeds, time to go
out there and work, get off your ass, get out
of your winter trip. This is springtime! And
it’s almost Taurian time, so if you’re not
awake now, you better get awake.” It’s Spring. It’s in the program. Start
getting busy.
Look, the next six weeks, very important. In the neutrino forecast for April
and May (1999) you’ll hear these themes being expressed. This is when you
really get into your work. You have to, so that you can get to the reverse of the
3-50 in Libra in the Fall and have the resources you need to take you through
the Winter. This is an old theme at work. And even though that theme has
been civilized and modified, just like still being an animal underneath these
costumes, there is still this very specific program of seasons that are underneath
and at work.
So you have this Martian accent of the 28.5 in this situation, universalizing,
trans-personalizing the need to take a risk, to find something else. What that
means is today's the day that the status quo is not comfortable. That's really
what it means, at the most mundane level. The status quo isn't comfortable.
There’s something inside eating at people. Now, basically what it is, is the
program beginning to crank you up, getting you ready and you’re really going to
feel that tomorrow.
Because tomorrow, Jupiter is going to go into the 51. I'm looking forward to
that. Once every 12 years I have Jupiter cross my Sun. That's a very nice thing.
Here's Jupiter coming into the 51 so it's going to be quite a shock that's caught
up in this week. And not only that, but, of course, you'll notice that Jupiter
going into the 51 is going to be coincidental with Mercury being in the 25, so
you're going to have the channel of initiation this week, so get ready.

And you can just see that out there in the planet. You can see that out there in
the communities around you. Watch the world. Learn to take the ephemeris in
for yourself, and then outwardly watch those around you. It is magical. You
have these moments where you really think you're in a play.
That's my deepest satori with watching the program live itself out through
others. There's this moment that it becomes really hallucinogenic. There's a
moment in which it's like, "Wait a minute." You hear people speaking
keynotes. You see them acting out exactly what's there. And, of course, what
that does for you inside, all your cells start vibrating to that, because you really
see the living program at work.
The power of this knowledge is to give you the eyes to see the living program.
Not just to be clear within yourself, but to see that living program because it's
us. And out of that you can see how distorted that program operates, because
nobody realizes,—there's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this
new pressure, longing for it.
There are other people who, within the relative nature of their ignorance, are
content with the devil they know. And they're not comfortable on a day like
today, in which there's this kind of funny feeling inside, that something has to
be done, or somewhere, or there's just a funny feeling. It's an itch.
It's an itchy day, and for some people they don't like that. So, this is the
beginning of a new cycle for us. And when I say that, what it really is,—
because it started in January. It started with the Sun in the 41st hexagram
initiating a new experiential cycle for humanity. What this point is, in the cycle
that creates its own inner cycle, because there's all these inner cycles, is to see
that this is the time where the recognition of what a seed can do, it now has to
be concretized in the planting of the seed.

By design, the program wants us to have seasons in which we are
contemplative, as a theme, not as an actuality. And then seasons where that
contemplation is applied, given that for most of our civilized history we have
been agrarian. It was natural for us to have that kind of season, that from April
to October you worked like a dog. You worked in the fields. You made sure
that everything was nurtured and taken care of, so that when you came to the
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111100005555
harvest in October, you could then go through the winter, not being concerned
with food, not having to work in the same way. The opportunity to think
about what can be done in the coming year, but more than that, the
opportunity for intellectual development. The time to learn things. To share
things at the intellectual level, because the April 3-50 season to the October 50-
3 season is hard work.
TTTThhhheeee AAAAnnnntttt SSSSeeeeaaaassssoooonnnn
So what this cycle is initiating is put your shoulder to the wheel, and
everybody's got an itch inside as to what that's all going to mean. What is this I
feel? And this is the program grabbing you, and racking you into the wheel.
Get busy. Get productive, because if there is not enough food, then you're
going to die in the winter. In other words, that you're not going to be able to
survive it, and you're not going to have the opportunity to be able to be
productive intellectually, so that the next season brings greater growth, greater
accomplishment, whatever the case may be. So have a successful,—it's the ant
season.
I mean, that's what the 3-50 to the 50-3 is. This is the ant season. The ant
season with dog days in the middle. Go to work. This is a very terrible time
for people if they don't have a job. I mean it's a terrible time. The pressure in
the ant season if you don't have a job, whoa! You see, it’s okay not to have a
job in the winter. It's really funny. It really is okay. But if you don't have a job
in the ant season, you should be horse-whipped. That's when people really get
upset. It’s okay. You can have that, but this is the ant season. So, welcome to
the ant season.

Before I get into the ephemeris for the morning, I'm always talking to you
about the binary and the duality. A couple of questions today brought up a
point that I think is good for you to hear. Yes, it is a binary. But one of the
things that we know from the mystics, and we know from numbers, that life
begins with the four, not with the two. Two is the infrastructure, it's the binary
infrastructure. But by the time you get to four, you get to the real foundation.
So, if you look at the zodiac according to Human Design, according to the way
in which the hexagrams operate, basically the zodiac is cut into four. And you
can see that actual cut into four, because the first two lines,
the bottom line and the second line, of four different groups
of sixteen hexagrams, they’re the same. In other words, if
you go from gate 13 all the way down to just before gate 2,
you'll see that they all have the same two lines as their base
chop. So, the wheel itself is broken up into four. It's four
that brings things to life.
It's also something to keep in mind about the nature of the
hexagram structure and the way that amino acids are
proofed
structured, or how codons are synthesized. This is rooted in
the four. And it's one of the things to see that the hexagram
structure is divided into yang-yang; yin-yang; yang-yin; yin-
yin. These are the four basic divisions.
Now, think about Type, and you get the same four basic
divisions. That is, you have the two energy types, the
Manifestor is yang-yang; Generator is yang-yin; the Projector is yin-yang; and
the Reflector is yin-yin. In other words, you divide them up into their four
basic aspects. According to the Chinese that is the mother and the father that
is the yang-yang and the yin-yin, and that is the eldest son and the eldest
daughter. So, this is the basic four, and this is the basic formula.
Yang-Yang Yin-Yang Yang-Yin Yin-Yin

The ephemeris. Today is Sunday, I loathe Sundays, and of course, there is a
technical reason for that. It's mechanically offensive to me. I'm only kidding,
folks. Don’t take all that seriously. Okay. We have a wonderful day today.
Today is a three day.
Yeah. Bang into things. Now, it's Sunday, and it's a three day. Now, by the
way, I'm working with an ephemeris that
does not give us,—and, of course, we all
know that, it does not give you the exact
moment of transit and, of course, between
yesterday and today, the Sun is actually,
looks like it is covering three lines. So, the
one thing that we do know is that the day
began in the 3rd line and otherwise it
wouldn't be there. So, it's a third line day.
Now look, the nature of a third line day, it's
Sunday. Sunday is a day when people who
don't drive, all week…isn't it true? They
don't drive all week, and today is the day they’re going to get into their cars and
they're going to go driving on a third line day. How nice. Be careful out there.
If you could look at the accident statistics for this Sunday, and compare them
to other Sundays, you will see this is going to be a peak day. Now, it doesn't
mean you're going to have fender benders and things like that. It's just
practical, mundane recognition of what's going on in the world around you.
You see, everything about the ephemeris that is important for me, as a person
in dealing with life, is that I'm really only concerned with the environment. I
want to be dressed properly for the weather. I want to be prepared for the
energy that I see around me. And by being prepared for the energy that is
around me, I strip my life of expectations. Now, it's very important to
understand that.
Even though that's not a dominant theme in my life, it's a dominant theme in
the program. We are programmed as humans, experientially, to be expectant.
We simply are. And none of us escape that, in any way. It is more intense for
111100008888 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
those of us who have strong abstract definition, but at the same time, it’s
present in the world conditioned aura.
The moment I see clearly what the environment is around me, then all I can
look at is what its impact is going to be. And if there is anything that I have to
do on that day, it’s clear to me what kind of a field of energy I'm going to have
to work with. Because I know that the world is ignorant. I know that they
don't know. Now, of course, that's the part of me that still likes being a black
magician. It's the part of me that teaches you, look, one of the pleasures you
can get now is that you know the mechanics and they don't.
Now, at any kind of intimate personal level, or work level, that's a disaster.
Because, of course, this is all about getting people to the point where they
recognize their own nature. But the vast majority of the human beings that
you’re going to connect with in your life are not going to know what’s going
on. Now, if you know what’s going on, that is an advantage for you. It takes a
lot of resistance out of your life.
And it's a third line day—this is not a day to be going out there externalizing
and universalizing. This is not a day to go
out there and get things done. This is a day
in which, like all lower trigrams, they’re
busy about their own business. And, of
course, the opportunity of the day, or the
potential, of a third line day is that
something’s going to bump into you.
The other thing is that because it is third
line and it’s trial and error, there is a
tremendous amount of pressure in a third
line day to attempt things without being
clear about whether it’s going to work or
not. And a lot of people make that kind of
mistake on a third line day. In other words, they try to get something out, and
yet, on a third line day, you know that there is going to be a bumpy road there.
You just know that.
This is a martyr's day. So, if you are a Christian, great day to pray. It's a
martyr's day. But it’s also an anarchistic day. So, anybody who has this kind
of knowledge that's going to jump on a day like today is really going to look for
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111100009999
trouble. And one of the things that I do with third line days, and it's one of the
main themes that I see when I look,—remember, the Sun-Earth is 70%, so it's
70% of everybody's program today. What I recognize clearly about a third line
day is that I have to watch out for who’s about to bump into me. That's what
I’ve learned in my process.
I've learned to wait for those third line day surprises, because they're surprises,
and sometimes surprises are very pleasant. I'm attuned to the third line
through my mind, sometimes they’re very pleasant. It's typical for me on a
third line day that unexpectedly, I get a piece of information that turns me on.
Something that's fascinating.
My third line mind attuned to getting it that way. Often, though, I get a
surprise that I didn't know was going to be there. The bumps in the road that
come along. So, for me, a third line day is a day of observing. It's a day of
being very much a watcher, and it's the kind of day where you look over your
shoulder. Just in case something’s catching up on you.
I don't mean to insult Satchel Paige, does anybody know who Satchel Paige is?
Student: He’s a baseball player.
Ra: Yes. Satchel Paige, he was a black man. He played in the Black Leagues
in America before they were integrated. And when baseball was integrated, he
was finally allowed to play in the beginning of the 1950s, and at that time he
claimed that he was, I don't know, 28 or 29-years-old. This guy played
professional baseball into his 50s, some people think even into his 60s. I saw
him play. And he was a very funny country boy. And one of his favorite
expressions was, "Don’t look back, someone may be catching up on you."
That was my attribution to Satchel Paige. And another glimpse into the useless
trivia that my mind holds. Yes, the fact that I get access to all that trivia is the
painful part of a mind like mine.

The 3.3. One of the things that we forget about the Sacral is that the Sacral is
the only center that differentiates us according to sex, and sex differentiation
takes place in the third gate in the first 88 degrees of life. So, the third gate is
very interesting. One of its primary mutations is to mutate the female into a
male. That's one of the primary mutations. In other words, that males are
111111110000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
direct mutations of the female. It's not a question of the chicken and the egg.
The female came first.
So, that primary mutation is there in the third gate. And it means that all
genetic mutation, and all potential for genetic mutation, lies there in the third
gate. As a matter of fact, each and every one of those lines of the third gate
refer to a different kind of genetic movement. That is, whether it comes from
mother or father, whether it comes from the maternal grandmother or
grandfather, or the paternal grandmother or grandfather, and whether the
genetic material is recessive material. All of that is in the third gate.
So, to recognize the potency, that when we talk about the mutative capacity of
the 60 and the 3, it's very important for you to see that that mutative capacity is
very basic. It begins with where you get your genetic material from, which sets
in the chromosomes, and which selection you get, which is turned on, which is
turned off, whether you're going to be male, whether you're going to be female.
And one of the things to recognize is that as you go through the lines of the
third gate, children are being born, and they carry with them that specific
genetic material. You're overloaded on your mother's father's side, Ed. (Note:
Ed’s Personality Sun is in 3.3.) This all has to do with the lines of the 3.
Now, the fact of the matter is that by the time we get to the fifth line, we're
going to have a flow of recessive genes coming in. In other words, we're going
to have a generation of babies that are going to be born, that are going to be
dominated by older genetic material. Now, when I say older genetic material,
these are the kind of children that if you could see their great-great-
grandmother or grandfather, you'd swear, you'd swear that this was exactly the
same being. And this is a different kind of movement.
Now, of course, that's not something that you can read other than as a vast
generalization and very specific, like in Ed's case, because his Sun is there. But
the fact of the matter is that none of that genetic material can be read unless
you can read the first 88 degrees of life. In other words, unless you can read
the conception chart, and see it there in the conception chart.
But it does give another layer or another level of meaning for you, when you
see the presence of the 3, or the presence of the 60, because you know that not
only are we dealing with a very powerful mutative generation that can come
into the world, but a mutative generation that is very specific in the kinds of
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111111111111
genetic material that it brings for mutation. So, the 3.3 is mistakes in genetic
material and trial and error in genetic material. Sorry, Ed. What to do.
So what that’s saying is at the larger level of the genetic continuity of the whole,
that the 3.3 is there to bring in the most experimental genetic material. In
bringing in experimental genetic material, in other words, real trial and error
stuff, you also know that the theme of that genetic material is bonds made and
broken. And one of the interesting things about the 3.3s is that they have a
different incarnation sequence. That's my little mystical touch for Sundays.
Did you like that? Was that good? Yeah. You'd like more? You're not going
to get it.
Nothing gives us greater potential to survive in the future than the 3.3.
Nothing. The 3.1 genetically is a closed door, so is the 3.4. The 3.3 is the
epitome of the potential for mutative capacity within the genetic material itself.
And, of course, the way that works is that it brings genetic material that hasn't
been recently incorporated, and brings it in with state of the art genetic
material. You have genetic material that skips generations. Out of this, by the
way, you get a lot of still births, abortions, miscarriages, deformities, and the
children that we call SIDS victims, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The bond
can be broken. The genetic material cannot, is not able to stand up, and the
older material that's been reincorporated simply can't fit in.
Now, I'm anthropomorphizing that and making that a kind of story, but the
reality is that when you're looking at the 3.3, you really have to see that this
difficulty at the beginning, that this is the experiment in what can really be new.
It will take the sixth line harmony in its wisdom to be able to see and judge
whether the mutation really is of value. And, of course whether or not these
beings, once they mature, have mutative value. In other words, that their
genetic difference is something that can be reincorporated as a mutation into
the whole, and find its value.

Again, the story of northern Europeans who survived the Black Death, the
Bubonic plague. Out of that came a genetic mutation that would eventually
protect certain white people from AIDS. There's a direct relationship in those
things. Now, that genetic mutation that took place may not have run
consecutively through generations. In other words, that may be something that
111111112222 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
is picked up in the genetic cycle of things, to provide a certain amount of
protection in this time. If AIDS were to wipe out the world, there would be
those with that mutation that would survive. And, of course, that mutation is
the direct result of something banging into them, and genetic mutation being
the net result of that. They had genetic material that was able to survive an
onslaught that other genetic material could not handle.

In practical terms, we know that the third gate is about the beginning of things,
and we know that we've begun the ant season. Now, by the way, I always
assume that you always recognize that Human Design is a duality. When I say
that it's the ant's season, you have to recognize as well that for half, in that
sense of the population, sort of, you have to see that the other side has just
come to an end.
In other words, you have ant people that work all winter and rest all summer,
and you have ant people who work all summer and rest all winter. And you
have ant people who work all summer in the daytime and ant people who work
all summer in the night. And winter ants who work all winter in the daytime or
in the night. And if you add that up, you have the four variations, but it is a
season. In other words, the people that made money in the ski valley with
skiing, they're about to now close down. Their ant season is over, and they're
going to have their summer season. On the other hand, there are a lot of
people who are about to get ready for the summer season.
The important thing is to recognize that the cusp of that, the opening and
closing point, is the same. It's the 3-50, 50-3. In other words, this movement
from now to October on the other side, this divides the work year into its
binary. The winter people and the summer people, in that sense.
It's interesting if you look at major corporations, you can really tell who's who,
because you have people that insist on having their vacations in the winter, and
other people who insist on having their vacations in the summer. And, of
course, what the collective does is it tries to bring us into the same timeframe.
Now, by bringing us into the same timeframe, you have a lot of people in
which it's natural for them to be ants in the winter, and they’re forced to be
ants in the summer, and don't do well. They don't do as well as they could
have done if they were winter ants. Uncle Jesus and Auntie Christ.

Mercury is in one of these magical lines. The 25.3 is really a magical line. If
you look at the 25.3, you'll see that it's one of
these lines, that its dichotomy is so profound,
it's scary.
On one side is the ability through innocence to
be able to literally survive anything, to be able
to withstand any kind of failure. And
remember, this
is the ultimate
third line
theme. And if
you look at the
25.3, if it wasn't for the era that we live in—
and I'll explain that in a moment—that the
25.3 is the touchstone of the third line
experience. Out of the 25.3 you see the real
polarity of what it is to live a life of trial and
error. On one side is the power to grow out of
trial and error, in other words, to survive failure.
I know this because this is actually the position of my Mercury. This is my
Mercury return to the 25.3. And, if you look at the detriment of the 25.3, the
detriment is the spookiest detriment that you see in the 384 lines. It's the only
one that specifically talks about criminality. It can be incredibly violent. It can
be incredibly self-destructive.
And if you look carefully at that detriment, you'll see that the detriment is ruled
by Pluto. And if you look in the second edition of the Rave I Ching so that
you can see the illustration clearly, you will notice that the 25th and 51st
hexagrams, that they are both the 25 on the cusp of Pisces-Aries, and of
course, the 51 in the middle of Aries.
111111114444 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss

Now, the reason I bring that up, of course, is that the planet Pluto, which is in
the beginning of Sagittarius, isn't going to get to Aries for over 100 years. It's
going to be a long time until Pluto gets there. And it's been a long time since
Pluto has been there. In other words, there is nobody alive in the world
today that carries Pluto in this channel. Nobody alive.
That means it doesn't exist. It's not in the living program right now. It's one
of the things to see how lucky we are, how lucky I am, as a being, that that
aspect of the 25.3 is never active. Never. You cannot read that line to
somebody and include that detriment. It does not exist. It's not in the world.
Now, there are other lines like this. Notice them. Pay attention to Pluto and
Neptune. You'll find that right now there are probably seven or eight lines of
the 384 in which either their exalted or detriment has no application. And in
order for them to have no application it means that it has to be 100 years since
it's been active. If something was activated by Neptune, let's say 100 years ago,
we know that with possible rare, rare exception, there's nobody alive in the
world that's carrying it, and then you can see that that aspect may not be
affected.
So, this 25.3 is a magical, magical time for us. You see, this is universal love. It
is a chance to find universal love. It's our opportunity to find universal love, to
be able to recognize it, to be able to see it in that sense, and not to fail in our
endeavor.
HHHHoooowwww RRRRaaaa SSSSuuuurrrrvvvviiiivvvveeeedddd tttthhhheeee VVVVooooiiiicccceeee
If you look at my channel of initiation, and you see my Sun in 51.5 where it's
exalted, where you have the ability to withstand any shock, and my Mercury in
25.3, where failure is not possible for me. You can understand how I survived
the voice. What is built into my initiation is the ability to withstand any shock
without succumbing to it, without dying from it. And had Pluto been a part of
this, no way. So, it's a very special time for the world.
It's a time in which we cannot fail to find universal love. We cannot fail. We
just have to go through our trial and error and we'll get there. And I'm a 25.3
messenger. I say it's here. And, of course, Human Design will never fail. It is
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111111115555
rooted in this. It will withstand any scrutiny, and it will redefine the nature of
what we love, and how we love it.
Notice, by the way, the symmetry of Mercury in the 25.3 on a three day. Keep
that in mind. So, it means that if somebody bumps into you today, you're not
going to die from it. No, it's true. Nice thing to know. You know. The
bumper cars are doing well at amusement parks.

Venus in the 16 in the second line. The skills of today can only be called out.
So, any time you try to project your skills today, you're going to get into
trouble. They’re best when they're called
out, and otherwise keep it to yourself.
We still have Mars in 28.5, so we're still in
this time of treachery. And, this is the kind
of day where you realize that your car isn't
necessarily well designed, because that small
little bump is going to cost you $2,000, and
that's when you decide that you're not going
to drive a Ford anymore.
If that was a little too obtuse for you…the
nature of treachery is that you're always on
alert that what's going on in your life, that the forces that you're dealing with,
that you can find improvements. You know that you're always open to a better
possibility to be able to find that life is of value. And, of course, again, Mars
brings its immaturity to that, its enthusiasm to that.
JJJJuuuuppppiiiitttteeeerrrr iiiinnnn GGGGaaaatttteeee 55551111....1111
This is a day in which initiation is the theme. Jupiter has transited into the 51,
first line. That's where my Moon is. So the energy of the day is initiation. The
energy of the day is the foundation of shock, and the foundation of shock
through being bumped into. And what bumps into you today can be initiating.

But, this is a 51-25 day in the world, and the world doesn't know. And the 51-
25 says, "I need to be first.” All these Sunday drivers. You know? “I can pass
those three cars, dear, I really can." And the 28.5 says, "Yes. Go for it."
Kaboom! Car rolls over 17 times, neither one of them is hurt. Just shocked.
Now, that isn't to say that everybody is
going to have one of those speedway days,
but I tell you, you look and see tomorrow's
papers.
There's a lot of competitiveness in the air.
This is a day in which people are going to
walk faster, push harder. It's a good thing
that it's a Sunday. It's going to last until
Tuesday.
So, strong initiation. All of you driving
home, folks, take care. Look out for the
other one, because that's what it's all about. But, initiation is that you really
have to see that when you know that there's competition out there in the world,
it's not a time to be competitive, because everybody's being competitive. So,
it's not a good day to get involved with any kind of competition. And, of
course, what's going to happen is that you're going to have this kind of
conversation: "I'm right." "No. You're wrong, I'm right." "No. I'm right."
"No." And on, and on, and on, and on. Because the competition is there, and
it's going to fuel everything.
You see, it's rare that these so called mystical channels operate in a mystical
way. And so many people today, tomorrow, the next day, something’s going to
happen in the course of the day, for everyone. I mean, it is a world definition.
But not everybody is going to notice. Not everybody’s going to pay attention.
It's very rare that an event happens in a human being’s life, an ordinary day, just
something slightly out of the difference, and they don't pay attention. And that
was their opportunity for initiation. Pay attention. It’s the whole thing. The
moment you’re driven by the competitiveness, there’s nothing to see. Nothing.
You have a lot of blind Ego people running around. Everybody’s an Ego
person today. “I, I, I, I, I, I, I,” is the word of the day. There’s a lot of
comparison going on today. Don’t get caught up in this movie! Remember
UUUUnnnnddddeeeerrrrssssttttaaaannnnddddiiiinnnngggg tttthhhheeee TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss PPPPrrrrooooggggrrrraaaammmm 111111117777
that the theme is confusion, seeking out and looking for the right kind of
values to start your cycle. And whatever bumps into you, is only part of the
variety that’s open for you. The only way you can work with the 3rd line in the
50 is when you get to the 4th line stage tomorrow.
But today, particularly, is a day to recognize that initiation begins with you not
seeing it coming. You being surprised and it can come in any kind of guise.
And it involves shock. This is a day that people can drop dead. This is a good
heart attack day. So you bump into a car and it’s minor, and the guy gets out
and starts screaming at you. Gets very competitive. “It was your fault.” With
this kind of pressure on the Ego system, the whole being can just sort of
explode.
This is also a day when all kinds of people think they're going to be making the
most important promise of their life. A day of initiation of the Ego. And,
there's that poor undefined Ego going, "I promise that from now on."
Remember it's the beginning of the cycle, "I promise that from now on I'm
never..." Oh yeah. And then, of course, it's all going to go away like whoosh.
So, be careful today about being bumped into, and be careful about anybody
trying to get you to make any kind of promise. This is not a promise day. This
is not a day to be willful, because everybody else is going to be willful,
everybody. Push, push, push, push, push, push, push, eh? I'm a 51-25. I can
remember what I was like before I was aware. It's very pushy. It's deeply
arrogant. It's competitive for any reason. So, don't get yourself caught into
that competitive wave, and in that way, you may get an initiation out of this
process.

It's a very powerful combination to have Jupiter and Mercury initiating us.
This is the initiation of the communication of the law. That's what that is. The
potential initiation of the communication of the law. In other words, the real
initiation that's available is deeply tuned, deeply tuned to our theme in this
week. In other words, really to be able to initiate a new cycle, and to be able to
initiate that new cycle in terms of its values, because without the values as a
guide, the confusion is never going to be resolved. Again, the power in the
sense of the 50th gate.

The Saturn in 27.4 is the externalization of nurturing, so anybody that gets hit
by a car today, there's going to be somebody there to help them. Isn't that nice.
It's always nice to know the 27.4s are around. That they're going to externalize
their caring.

I don't like Sundays. It's my black sense of humor today. And the 13.4 is the
externalization of openness. The 13 is really open to experience, and welcomes
it, and calls it. And today, it's going to get
it. No question about that.
And, again, our Neptune in 41.3, so the
shirt can always be taken off our backs if
we don't know it.
And Pluto in 9.5 saying, “Be concentrated
on all this stuff, because if you're not
concentrated on all this stuff, you're really
going to get into a big mess.”
The moment you really grasp line
structure, that's the moment that you can
look at any day. And just like I talked to you about the surface of Design is
Type, where if you deal with your Type, then everything else will harmonize
within your system. If you look at the Sun-Earth line of the day, yes, it's
interesting to see all this other stuff. Yes, it's fascinating to see the Mercury-
Jupiter combination, and so forth and so on. But the line of the day gives you
the general theme.
You're all going to be much more productive by recognizing that's how
everybody is operating. That's the way the program works. And if you
harmonize with that mechanic, then you are going to find that your life is much
more productive. Simple as that.

Okay, one last thing, because this was mentioned this morning. I'd like to
describe to you, very briefly, December 31, 1999. Now, by the way, as I
mentioned in the Neutrino forecast, as far as I'm concerned the new
millennium does not begin until December 31st 2000. It is obvious to me,
given the way we count, that that is really the beginning of the new millennium.
However, it is also clear to me that to go from one, nine, nine, nine (1999) to
two, zero, zero, zero (2000) is also going to be, in its own way, quite
spectacular, because most of the planet takes that to be the beginning of the
millennium. All right.
The Sun is in 38.1, the Earth in 39.1. So,
you've got individual moodiness, you've
got the gate of the fighter for the Sun,
gate of struggle, and the Earth is in
provocation. So, the first thing to see is
that that's going to be quite a provocative
evening. The Mercury is in 10.3, the
martyr. Venus is in 34, first line, power.
And Mars is in the 30th hexagram in the
fourth line, burnout. Now burnout has
many values. We're going to have the
largest fireworks in the history of the world. We all know that, so there is that
burnout. There is no question about
that, but Mars in the 30 in the fourth line,
not only that, but the Mars, of course, is
going to be with the Neptune in 41. It's
going to form a definition in this channel
of feelings. You're going to have an
incredible burnout of feelings. You're
also going to have a very, very sexual
night.
And the South Node in the 41.3. It's
going to be a very, very heavy night. So,
it's something to keep in mind about
celebrating that. I think the world is
111122220000 RRRRaaaa’’’’ssss EEEExxxxpppplllloooorrrraaaattttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTrrrraaaannnnssssiiiittttssss aaaannnndddd LLLLiiiinnnneeeessss
going to see a very wild party, the kind of party that can really be outrageous.
So, again, that's going to be relative; actually, it's the whole globe after all. But
the one thing to be clear about this night is that it's going to provoke a lot of
dark side stuff as a by-product of the celebration. And there's going to be a
quality to it, if my first reaction to seeing this evening is the Bacchanalia, because
that's what it looks like. It looks like a kind of wild, hedonistic, potentially
outrageous energy.
It also says something else. This whole business of Y2K. On the 30th, the day
before, Pluto transits into the fifth gate for the first time in 265 years. And this
is about our rituals and our patterns. Now, it seems to me that there's going to
be some difficulty, in that Rave week, from the 31st to approximately the fifth
of January. As far as I can tell, that could be quite destabilizing.
So, whether that is a reference to Y2K, whether the burnout is going to
burnout the pattern. If there's going to be a burnout in the pattern, it's there.
So, that burnout in the pattern can work many, many ways.
But my assumption is that midnight is going to have the 44 involved with the
Moon. And one of the things that is clear is that, my assumption is, that there
are going to be a lot of fires that night. And they may be the by-product of fire
displays going awry, or whatever the case may be, but I have a sneaking
suspicion that we're going to have an awful lot of buildings being destroyed.
Now, those buildings being destroyed may be something else. In other words,
they may be knocked out by the phenomena of Y2K.
I'm not too sure about that. I'm not clear for myself that Y2K is as disruptive
as most people seem to like it to be. I’ve lived too long now with doomsayers
to give much credence to doomsayers every time there is some kind of
phenomena that people don’t really understand. They immediately assume that
it’s going to bring the end of the world.
From what I hear, there's already panic in America; that is, it's very hard to buy
a generator now. People are stocking up on all kinds of stuff. I'm not certain
that it is going to be as powerful an impact on our society as some people are
suggesting. My assumptions is yes, there will be some disruptions and
problems, but my assumption is also that it will be much more devastating in
the second world than the third world, which has much more antiquated
technology, than it's going to be in the first world.

What I do see for this night is that I really feel an undercurrent of dark force in
all of that. The millennium traditionally brings out a lot of madness, and I
think that there's going to be a lot of people getting carried away this night.
And when I say ‘a lot of people,’ I mean tens of millions of people getting
carried away.
It's going to be the most devastating in Asia, is my assumption. That is, in
countries where there is any kind of heavy weight over the nation. I think that
you're going to see an excuse for real madness. So, I think the burnout is really
there.
I also am sure that there are going to be many places, all over the place, in
which it's a very nice experience, and everybody enjoys champagning their way
into the new millennium. Because, of course, given the nature of how Human
Design works, our aspects, our definition, the nature of our Design, obviously
it changes the way in which the generalized program can operate in any of us.
But as a general theme, that fight, that obstruction, as a general theme, along
with this powerful desire that's going to be there through the 41-30. And the
desire that's there to burnout. It's like the last great fling. The net result of that
can end up being body count in the morning. I am certain that that's in the
formula.
Nonetheless, as I have done for every New Years since I was about 20 years
old, I will not pay attention to it. I will go to sleep when I’m tired, and I'll wake
up the next day and say, "Well, here we are." I'll let the others go nuts out
there.
