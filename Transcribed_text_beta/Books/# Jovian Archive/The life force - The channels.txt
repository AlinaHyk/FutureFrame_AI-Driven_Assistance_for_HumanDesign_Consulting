THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
Table of Contents
INTRODUCTION
The Life Force energies of the Channels is one of the least explored areas in Human
Design. A great deal of written and audio material is available about Gates but
very limited information on the Channels.
This course, originally taught by Ra Uru Hu in an 11-lecture series in 2008, was
designed for newcomers as well as long time students of Human Design. It offers
an in-depth examination of the Channel as a quantum expression of Gates.
We hope you enjoy this journey.

Lecture One
From Pressure to Conceptualization
Hello and welcome to all of you.
I mentioned before the class
that I think the last time I ac-
tually, specifically did a course
on the channels was in the
middle of the 90s, maybe ‗95 or
something, so it‘s interesting
for me at this point in my own
career to actually return here.
The channels are something, in
so many ways, not really seen
any more. There's so much
information available that when you're looking at a design, the interest you have in
what you are looking for, what you want to see, the simple things in Human Design
are often left behind and at great risk because despite its depth; it is in fact simple
knowledge. It is knowledge where its great secrets are very obvious and on the
surface. It is not the esoteric. Human Design is not esoteric. It is a logical system.
And because it's a logical system rooted in a specific set of patterns and rules, you
don't have to be a rocket scientist to be able to get to its essential truths.
It is these basic superficial and essential truths that are really the framework upon
which you can build your own process. Teaching at any basic beginner level, my
interest is about the individual. Each unique being, each of you in that sense, and
being able to see that in returning to the simple, and for many of you who I know
are involved in very complex programs in Design, that it is very—I was about to say
healing. In a way it is. It's very healthy—probably a better way to put it—to return
to the simple because it's here that we have the very foundation of what it is to be
us, what it means to discover our nature, and nothing is more profound than the
channel itself.
The Design of Forms
When I was given the knowledge, I was not given specifically the Human Design. I
was given the design of forms, of which Human Design was one of the forms. And it
began with the inanimate. When you look at the inanimate in terms of Design, in

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

terms of the way in which it's illustrated, the G Center is the only center, and the
only potential activation is the 25th gate. In other words, the inanimate is simply the
potential of a simple gate; nothing more, nothing less.
But the moment you take the next step in the form principle is the moment you go
from simply the potential of a gate activation to the potential of channel. That‘s
what you get when you look at the design of the single cell. You see that this transi-
tion between the animate and the inanimate, this extraordinary movement in terms
of design is so beautifully and so obviously illustrated. It is the channel. The mo-
ment there is this possibility for what is, in fact, a quantum, a whole that is greater
than the sum of its parts, a whole that is transcendent from its parts. In the lan-
guage of Design you would call it the juxtaposition of this and that. And in that jux-
taposition comes the phenomenon of what we experience of what is called the life
force.
The Channels
One of the most interesting things in terms of, personally speaking, looking at my
own career in teaching Human Design, perhaps the area that has been the most
weakly substantiated or investigated or expressed or taught has been channels. All
of the ways in which chan-
nels have been dealt with is
through the interpretation of
the values of the gates and
how those values of the
gates can be brought to-
gether.
But in fact, it isn't really
what channel is. The thing
that‘s so interesting about
the channel is that it is so
much more than the sum of
its parts, because the sum
of its parts is very, very
specific. And yet, the chan-
nel itself is a much broader
force. And what does the
channel represent, when
you think about? There's
nowhere to go in Human Design, nowhere to go without it, or the lack of it in the
case of the minority of the Reflector. The reality is that when we're looking at some-
body's design, it is the channel itself that establishes everything or the lack of it. It
establishes the very nature of the way in which a being can operate correctly. It is
out of the definition that we‘re going to find Type and we‘re going to find Authority.

LECTURE ONE
From Pressure to Conceptualization
A Circuit Board
But it's more than that. I can remember going back to my earliest personal read-
ings. I would describe or give a definition of definition. Basically the way I would
refer to it so that it was really ingrained—because I would repeat it again and
again—if you look at the BodyGraph for what it really is graphically, it is a circuit
board. It is very important to see it that way. It's a circuit board. And when you
see it as a circuit board then you can begin to look at it in terms of how the energy
flows. After all, it's a circuit board.
The first thing you get to see in the circuit board are certain areas that are perma-
nently connected to each other. This is the very essence of definition. You‘ve got an
activation at one end of the channel and you‘ve got activation at the other end of the
channel and the by-product is that the whole channel is colored in [above in blue],
the centers are turned on and you have a fixed, consistent movement of energy.
This is the life force, a fixed consistent movement of energy.
One of the things to understand about definition that‘s rarely seen—in the sense that
you look at the surface and you see this definition—but what you don't really see is
how fine a line that is, how narrow a fixing this is. It is that fixing that is going to
come out of the specifics of the way in which this being happens to be defined, those
specific lines, the way in which they specifically interact with each other, fixed to-
gether. Which means that all of the other possibilities—and there are thousands for
each activation—are not part of what is this fixed life force.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
Everything is a Binary
Everything is a binary. Everything is a ―this‖ and ―that.‖ This is what we are; again,
with the exception of the Reflector. What we are is ―this‖ and ―that‖ that you get to
see so obviously in our design; that is, what is defined and what is not. In the Ref-
lectors it‘s simply a matter of what is activated and what is not. It‘s another kind of
―this‖ and ―that.‖ But for most of humanity it is this very binary that establishes
what is going to be their nature, the ―this‖ and the ―that.‖
Everything about what is fixed is that it is incredibly narrow, narrow, narrow, narrow,
narrow, because after all, what you're looking at is the foundation of what is your
differentiation. And it needs to be incredibly narrow. It is limited to whatever the
number of activations happen to be; most of the time it's simply one at either end.
And it goes down beneath the line to the Color and the Tone and the Base to some-
thing that is very, very, very specific. That is very fixed and narrow.
Now, not only is it something that is deeply fixed and narrow, but it is the only thing
in the design that is always, always, always functioning. The most incredible thing
about your activations and your definitions is to understand that they are what they
are. And they‘re going to be that way always. It is the only thing that you're ever
going to deal with in this life that is truly consistent, the only thing; there is nothing
else. It is consistent with every breath from the beginning to the end. It creates the
great irony of what it means to be not-self, that you are so removed from your life
force that you get lost in what you are not and you disappear into that what you are
not.
Moving Away From Mind
At the very basis of Human Design is a goal, the goal to liberate the self, the being,
the unique being, the individual. And of course, the only way you can do that is you
have to move away from mind, because there is no way in which you can live out the
potential of what your life can be if your mind is making the decisions. It simply
doesn't work. It cannot work. As long as you're making decisions with your mind,
you are cut off from your unique life force and are spending your whole life tapping
into everybody else's, tapping into what the program imposes on you so that you
think it is your force, and it's not. It is this unique life force in each of us that, when
you're operating correctly, is what begins to emerge. Its power begins to be dis-
played. Its correctness becomes your frequency.
The channels are the very root for all of us. Because what they're really pointing to
is the fixed, narrow imprint that we are here to fulfill. You‘re not here to fulfill the
potential of the not-self. You can't; there is no such thing. This is just about becom-
ing homogenized. It‘s falling into the rest of the sadness and frustration and pain
that is the nature of being on this planet. The normal world is filled with human
beings who are deeply disturbed. And they are disturbed because they are not con-

From Pressure to Conceptualization
nected to their unique life force. They are always trying to accommodate, fit in,
work with, and be like what they‘re not.
The channels themselves lay a foundation for what we are here to perfect, after all.
The moment you express your nature correctly is the moment that perfection is what
it is. It is the same word as saying unique, because there is no comparison. But
there is something else. When you live out what is your true nature, you tap into
this force. It‘s your life force. It has to do with your health, your vitality, your spirit
and your mental acuity. Because this is where your power is, this is where your
essence is. This is where your gifts are. This is where your promise is; this is where
you‘re different from anybody else. And it's about tapping into it. You don't do that
by thinking it.
At the very basics of Human Design is a very simple thing. What we have been able
to learn from the revealed mechanics is a way of understanding how we can navigate
on this plane in such a way that we get to live out our true potential, the potential of
the form, the potential of our vehicles, because it is the vehicle that is the life. It is
the vehicle that empowers this life force. When you're operating correctly, what
you're doing is enriching the potential of this holistic being because you bring out the
essence of yourself. It's there in the channel.
The Two Pressure Centers
It‘s always interesting where you start things. If I think back to my early teachings
of channels I always started with integration. But I had a different intent. So I'm
starting at a different place. I guess it's the world of madness, the mind. It‘s so
extraordinary for me to look at the potential of self-reflected consciousness and to
have been privileged enough to be able to experience in my life the enormous gifts
that mental ability can bring. And yet, at the same time to look out at the world and
see the way in which the awareness level of this plane operates.
It‘s one of the most fascinating things
about the program and the way we‘re
conditioned. There are two pressure
centers in the BodyGraph. Other
than the early reference you get
when you're taking an ABC course,
the fact is that these pressure cen-
ters are not given enough attention
nor enough respect for the influence
they have on the life. They are what
drive us, the Head Center above and
the Root Center below. What is so
fascinating about the Head Center
itself is that 70% of humanity—that's
an enormous number of human be-
ings, it‘s around 6 billion human be-

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

ings—70% of humanity has an open Head Center, undefined Head Center. Of
course, the not-self strategy of the undefined Head Center is thinking about things
that do not matter. It's not so much that a thing, in and of itself, could not be of
value; it‘s simply that it does not matter to you. And 70% of humanity thinks about
things that do not matter to them. That creates an enormous pressure. It is one of
the great conditioning forces on the way in which humanity conceptualizes.
It's also something to grasp that the influence of people who have definition between
the Head Center and the Ajna Center are by far the most influential conditioning
forces on the planet as beings. Think about that because it's quite something. After
all, if 70% of humanity have an undefined Head Center, those 30% who carry Head
Center to Ajna definition have an enormous impact on the society as a whole. What
that says is that the way in which the 70% think about things is being conditioned by
the 30%.
Inner and Outer Authority
We also know that they're not-self. And the lack of correctness in their own nature
leads to an enormous amount of mental thought that is not of any value to anyone.
When you think about it and what human beings think about on a day-to-day basis,
you realize that 70% of them are thinking about all kinds of crap that doesn't mean
anything to them. That‘s really quite something to imagine. One of the most pro-
found areas of necessary development in humanity is correct Outer Authority—we
have an Inner Authority and we have an Outer Authority. Inner Authority is the
decision making Authority, the Authority you have through your Strategy. This is
making the decisions to literally move the vehicle in space.
But we‘re not here alone. One of our extraordinary gifts is a phenomenal level of
ability to communicate with each other. Outer Authority is when the mind has the
ability, or the passenger in that sense, to simply express what it experiences concep-
tually. Now remember that when your mind is both Inner and Outer Authority, that
is when you're not-self; there is no truth. There cannot be any truth. As long as
your mind is trying to control what's going on in your life, then what you express in
communication is going to be inherently dishonest. It just will be. It's always going
to be serving an agenda of one kind or another. True Outer Authority is simply the
expression of unique conceptualization. And quite frankly, unique conceptualization
that has no agenda; it is simply expressed. It is the way in which all of us, in a
sense, are intended to be able to communicate with each other.
The moment you grasp what uniqueness means, it means that within your own Au-
thority you are also unique in your capacity to be able to express how you expe-
rience being on this plane. It is this ability to express that without agenda that of-
fers the other something that can be truly of value. We‘re here to interact and
communicate in a way that is honest and a way in which the mind gets to display its
true gifts. But you can't have a mind that is busy thinking about whether you should
do this or that, or whether you want this or that, and all the stuff that goes on with

the mind; not only are you thinking that, but you act on it. That's the moment your
ability to express real Outer Authority is lost.

going to talk about the gates. I'm not going to tell you what the gates are. I don't
want the gates to get in the way. So let's begin on the left side with the abstraction.
Whenever you see the abstract in the language of Human Design, what you're really
looking at is the experiential. This is an experiential mind. Remember, we‘re only
talking about it defined. This is an experiential mind. Now, that‘s something that is
very, very different, because the experiential mind plays around with the way con-
cepts look, feeds the possibility of concepts differently, toys with things. When
you're looking at this experiential mind, it's far, far from being grounded. It can get
silly; it can get way out
there. You can see that the
force that is here in this
experiential mental process
is the force of activity—
busy, busy, busy, busy,
busy, busy, busy, busy,
busy.
The experiential mind, well,
it doesn't really understand
rules, and because it
doesn't understand rules,
anything can lead to any-
thing. It doesn't necessarily
hold together when that
‗anything‘ can lead to any-
thing is handed over to somebody who is logical, they go, ―What, what, how did you
get from there to there?‖ This is the experiential, abstract activity. It isn't just deal-
ing with one thing one way. It‘s dealing with one thing so many ways that it some-
times gets off on a branch and forgets all about where it started—mental activity.
But there's something really incredible about the experiential process, the experien-
tial mental force. With all of that activity, there is this moment that comes of, ―Ah,
got it,‖ this clarity.
If you think about the mental, abstract force, it is a pressure relationship to the way
in which the emotional works, and particularly the emotional abstract. But even
generally, because what you‘re really looking at is that it is this experiential force
that actually dabbles in all kinds of possibilities, regardless of whether there are rules
that say that you can do that or not. And because there are all these different ways
in which something can be processed in that activity, there's the possibility of land-
ing on that one thing that suddenly, mysteriously emerges. It's this ‗making sense.‘

And this making sense isn't just about, ―All right, this is the way we look at it, this is
the way it works.‖ No, this is not what this force is all about.
It is simply busy. And it‘s busy dealing with the consequences of being alive. This is
one of the most complex connections in the BodyGraph. They are, in essence, a
unit. Biologically, you can
see the Ajna is the neo-
cortex and the Head Center
is the deep gray area of the
brain. So what we have
here is a conceptualizing
area. This neo-cortex that
makes us so unusual. This
HEAD
place that houses our po- Deep gray area
tential of self-reflected con-
sciousness and the storage
zone.
AJNA
Neo-cortex
Now, the thing that makes
the storage zone so incredi-
ble is that we are unbeliev-
able absorbers of stimuli.
It‘s just that, given the fact that we are a bio-form that has evolved, there are cer-
tain things we simply do not recognize that moves through us, as an example,
whether that is subatomic particles, whatever the case maybe. In other words, we
have certain limitations; we have certain aspects of the spectrum that we recognize
as stimulation. But the fact is that, as an example of a human being, a conscious,
awake human being in the experience of their day takes everything in. Now, they
take it in in different ways, because we have different kinds of mental systems,
something that we explore at deeper levels. For example, in Rave Psychology where
we look at the different kinds of ways in which mind is operating in this new form.
But the fact of the matter is we are still taking this stuff in and it sits in here. Now,
the whole thing about understanding the experiential process is that every expe-
rience then gets put through this mental activity. How can we say that? It's sort of
like taking a beam of light and putting it through a prism. Every single experience is
put through the prism of the mental activity, so that each experience gets—I was
about to say re-lived, but I don‘t want you to take that too seriously—it gets worked
out over and over and over again. In some people, as an example, it can lead to
them totally misremembering what actually took place, because in that mental ac-
tivity they get to a variation that somehow impacts them and they hold onto that
variation of what they think the experience was all about, that piece of clarity for
them.
But to understand what happens, every experience is being dealt with in that way;
every experience. It‘s why it‘s so difficult for somebody who has it consciously, as
an example. It seems like the mind just won't stop. There's all this stuff and that's
only the surface, because this activity is so deep and intense. And it is operating at
so many levels. Not all of them is one consciously being tuned into. Again, I'm not

From Pressure to Conceptualization
talking about the way in which the gates work, for example in this case the 47, how
it deals with this. This is just about what the force is. In this energy force, in this
mental, pressured force is all of this activity and everything that has been taken in
experientially, all that experiential stuff is being broken down in the prism in as
many ways, and it doesn't stop there. The results get broken down again. You can
get very, very far away.
It‘s one of the dilemmas of these forces, particularly on the abstract side, and simply
because there is just so much activity. You have to realize that if you're dealing with
somebody who is not-self and they're not operating correctly and they‘re under this
enormous pressure to dictate their lives from the mental plane; they're going to end
up relying on this force in themselves. And they're just not going to be able to han-
dle it. They‘re not going to be able to handle all levels of it, because despite the fact
that you ‗get‘ in that moment of clarity doesn't mean you ever get certainty. You
don't.
And again, we're not talking about the process in the sense of where it goes to and
how it finally gets expressed and all of these other things; just begin to grasp the
force. Remember, looking at things this way we can look at the species, us, human-
kind. We can begin to look here because it's very important to see it, these three
great forces that define the way in which we conceptualize, the way in which we look
at the world. So, one aspect of it is that everything experiential can never be left to
just stand. There is no ―just been there, done that.‖ So we are driven, we are dri-
ven mentally, intellectually to break things down over and over and over and over
again and split them apart and look at every experience from every possible direc-
tion, even though 99,000 out of 100,000 of them are useless, but it's part of our
genius. It really is.
No Absolutes
It's a very deep, profound force that drives us never, never to say ―This is it.‖ That
can be very difficult for some beings. This life force does not recognize absolutes. It
does not. There is no such thing for this force; it‘s not possible. And ―absolute‖
simply becomes another thing that can be worked over and over and over and over
and over and over and over endlessly, parsed and broken down and reassessed. It‘s
the magic. But if you're not correct, if you're not aware, that can be an extraordi-
nary burden. It can leave you feeling that there is absolutely nothing in this life that
you will ever be able to trust, no certainty that you will ever be able to accept, and
no absolute that will ever give you wholeness. It‘s such a thing.
Remember, this is a general expression of a force. It‘s not about the nuance of how
you live with it relative to your design, to the correctness of what it is to be you in
this life, and so forth and so on. And it doesn't mean that if you are correct you
cannot live with such a thing; you can, it is correct for you. But it is to begin to see,
because of the very nature of this force, that if you don't accept it for what it is, the
beauty of what it is, it becomes your curse. It becomes a weight and a burden. It

becomes so difficult to dream, and I mean dream in the sense of the fantasy of
what's possible or what could be.
The 63/4 Logic: Experimental
When you look at these, you would think that the doubt of the logic created more
uncertainty, but it does not. It is here in the experiential. This force keeps us on
our toes. It does. It drives deep, deep creative processes within us. It is in that
sense, the mother of all ideas. I'm a great admirer of this imagery of the Body-
Graph. I think it‘s one of its beauties. The symmetry here is extraordinary, these
two collective processes.
And obviously with logic we're dealing with something very different. We‘re not
looking at the experiential, we‘re looking at the experimental. And of course, what
that means right away is that logic, in its experimenting, is very, very limited in what
it works with as a force. In other words, it is a force that is locked into things. It‘s
not like the experiential.
It's not all of this jumble of
neural firing that, in es-
sence, this mental activity
really is, this endless, end-
less, endless, endless, end-
less, endless activity that
covers everything and any-
thing. The logic is differ-
ent. It‘s different in that it
simply hones in on things.
It's its job.
When you look at the Root
pressure in the logical sys-
tem, that 52nd gate to the
9th gate, and you look at this incredible power to be focused and con-
centrated, this narrowing perspective, this is the logical mind. This
force is very, very narrow and very, very focused. Now yes, there is
ease in this, because the focus is limited to the experiment with the
pattern, nothing more. The only dilemma that arises is when there is
something wrong with the experiment, with the pattern. And the
moment there's something wrong with the experiment in the pattern,
there is a release of fear.
When we talk about the Ajna Center, we talk about it in terms of fear. This is a cen-
ter mental anxiety. We've already seen, or one can interpret that out of the intense
mental activity, the result of that in somebody who is unprepared, who is not-self,
who does not operate correctly, that the intensity of that can lead to all kinds of
anxieties just about anything, because again, the lack of the trust, the lack of the
certainty.

LECTURE ONE
From Pressure to Conceptualization
But it‘s very different from the deep, visceral fear that emerges in the life force when
doubt is present. We are governed by logic. This form that we are, the life forms on
this planet, is all rooted in logic. They are all built on the cellular infrastructure
which is the channel 15/5 which is the first and foremost life force in
the vehicle. It is logical. We operate out of patterns. The moment
that the pattern doesn't work, this is deeply, deeply frightening. It is
much more upsetting for someone logically to find doubt than for
someone abstractly to have confusion; in other words, all the multip-
licity of activity, because the doubt is life threatening, because it's
about the future.
These collective forces are about the past and the future. The expe-
riential is rooted in the experiential past and then processing it and
reprocessing it. But for logic it's always about: is tomorrow going to
be okay? Are the trains going to run on time? Is it all going to be there? The mo-
ment there's doubt, wow is there fear. It‘s one of the most corrosive elements on
the planet because it touches each of us at our core. We‘re setup. There's this men-
tal force that's always driving us to make sure that we process everything we've
been through, grind through all of it, dig through the garbage, find the roses, find
the treasure, find all that stuff. And on the other side of that process, the mirror of
that, is this staring out ahead, checking the way, constantly, constantly on guard,
constantly alert, constantly looking to see if anything is breaking down.
The Open Head Center
Think about all the people with open Head Centers, the 70% of them. They‘re being
conditioned by either the experiential or the experimental. Let‘s take doubt for an
example. The moment somebody gets up on the international media and raises
doubt about our survivability or the economy or this or that, there is this fear that
goes rushing through; it just does. And of course the moment you have an open
Head Center, somebody else's doubt becomes your amplified doubt, and the distor-
tion of what it is to live in this not-self world.
There's an irony in all of these things. I do enjoy them. Logic has a problem be-
cause is always afraid of something. It's why this force exists. Why this force is
there to check out the patterns. It‘s not really checking out the patterns to find the
flaw in the patterns, it really isn't. That isn't its major concern. Its major concern is
mutation. It‘s the most dangerous thing for logic. The most shattering of all things
is mutation because it can totally breakdown the pattern, totally. And logic knows
that so deeply. It goes back to the design of the single cell; the 15, the 5 and the 3,
that possibility of mutative transformation; in essence, the story of how we evolved.
So, logic is always on guard for mutation. This is actually a force that fights to keep
mutation away. In essence, it is very conservative. It wants to stay with the true
and well worked out pattern. It doesn‘t want to try anything different. It doesn't
want to risk that, it doesn‘t want to risk having ease in its process. These are people

who are happy with their little fixed pattern because it makes their life easier if they
have this fixed pattern to it. Don't break their pattern. You break their pattern, they
get really afraid. They can‘t get out of the box. They're afraid of what's out there.
Now, again, I‘m doing a lot of anthropomorphizing in order to give you a sense of it.
But I want you to really grasp what logic is there for. Logic is on guard. It‘s on
guard, making sure that everything is going to be easy. We benefit greatly from
that, after all. The patterns we establish to make it possible for us to live in these
vast megalopolis, how it's possible for millions upon millions upon millions of us to
live in confined areas and have enough to eat and not kill each other, I mean regu-
larly; the ease of establishing the patterns.
The 61/24 Individual Channel: Acoustic
The moment you move away from the collective and you move to the individual,
speaking of Human Design circuitry, you step into a different framework entirely. It
really is. Everything about the abstract and logical processes is rooted in the visual
cortex. They‘re deeply connected to the way we see. And when I say ‗the way we
see,‘ I don't just mean that in the physical sense of the way in which the eyes and
the retina and so forth
work, but the way we inner
see, the way in which we
bring things together. This
is the work of the visual
cortex.
The thing that makes the
61/24 different is that it is
so deeply acoustic. So it
isn't about ―looking at
things‖ that you get in the
experiential and the expe-
rimental. Here what you
have is an acoustic force. It
is a sound force. Now, it
has an interesting label, this
thinking. Whenever I look at that, I think about the statue of The Thinker, this pon-
dering. This is about hearing thoughts. And when I say ‗hearing,‘ I mean this inner
hearing. This is a hearing of thoughts. There is no control over that.
It's not like this is either abstract or logical. It doesn't work that way. It is simply
being able to hear the thoughts. They are an acoustic phenomena. And it is this
inner processing of the acoustic thought program that is what this force is all about.
And of course, what this brings is the potential for mutation. It just does. And it
brings the potential for mutation because there is no past or future to it. There isn't.
There just isn't. One of the dilemmas of this force is because it is full of acoustic
thought, it does not mean that acoustic thought is correct, whatever the case may

From Pressure to Conceptualization
be. But the thing to recognize about it is that where the abstract and the logic are
collective, here in the individual this is no longer about the ‗us,‘ it is always about the
‗I am‘; always about the ‗I am.‘
When you're dealing with both the abstract and logic, their force is always connected
to the other, always, always connected to the other. The fear that logic has of the
pattern breaking down is the fear for others, fear for its family, its friends, whatever
the case may be. This reprocessing of the experiential is the reprocessing of the
experience of being with others and what happened. But the force of thinking is the
‗I am.‘ It‘s just ‗I am.‘ And of course, it is full of trying to know ‗I am.‘ This is what
it‘s listening for. It‘s listening for the echoes of the ‗I am.‘ And of course, they come
and they go.
This is not about gates, because the moment you bring in the values of the gates it
is very easy to add meaning to what the force is. But you have to grasp the force by
itself. The force by itself is a force of sound. It‘s just acoustics. And it's the acous-
tic echo of the being existing; nothing more, nothing less; the acoustic echo of the
being existing. That‘s a real 61/24 comment, because it's very difficult to break it
down any other way. If we could see these things, if we could illustrate them, or if I
could illustrate them differently, I could show you movies for the abstract and the
logic. But I can only give you an audio for the thinking. There is no visual context to
it. There isn‘t.
It's what makes it so difficult to bring it down to earth. The abstract and the logic
never leave this plane. They don't. They don't leave it in the sense that they are
always relating to it, always. But this ‗I am‘ acoustic-ness, this is nowhere. It al-
ways seems like it comes out of nowhere, this return of inner truth over and over
and over again. It's always there, the echo inside. If you're an acoustic being—I'm
deeply individual with an acoustic mind. I can always hear the echoes. And the
echoes in themselves, every once in a while, express something that you don't know
where the original was, if you know what I mean. It‘s how mutation happens. Be-
tween the new one acoustic pulse to the next, something changes. All of a sudden
there is this potential of ―I know, I know.‖ Of course, it was always there.
This is the whole thing about understanding the Head Center specifically. Literally,
our inspiration is coming from within us. It isn‘t coming from out there. It‘s coming
from within; we store everything. We don't access everything, but we take it all in.
It‘s out of that that comes our possibilities of clarity, of doubt, of thinking.
Embracing Yourself
It is very beautiful to understand the way we‘re designed to work, the way in which
these forces are intended to work. And the moment you separate that from the
dilemma of not-self—because the not-self can never truly get to experience the pro-
fundity of the force that is there within them until they are correct. And I‘m particu-
larly talking about these mental forces, that if you're not-self, it becomes so dis-
torted that you end up with enormous problems wherever you go. The abstract

being who is totally stressed out on the mental plane, the logic being who is full of
fear, the individual who is simply out of it, unable to just take care of business, it‘s
what happens.
The moment you move away from your mind dictating what your life is going to be,
the moment you embrace what it is to be you, then these forces don't just simply
work well relative to you because they are your nature. Think about where I started
today. 70% of humanity has an undefined Head Center that is going to be condi-
tioned by the 30% who have it defined. Now, wouldn't it be nice if we were inspired
by those who were correct? That, in the end, is what it's about. The thing that
makes anyone who operates correctly on this plane so special is the way in which
they affect the other.
Understanding the Forces
These are forces. Don't just see them through gates. This is what makes channels
so profound. They are a force. Yes, the gate; we‘ll give you the nuance and the
line, and so forth and so on. But you need to grasp the power of the force itself so
that you can accept it if it‘s in you. Then you can see clearly what it is. And it's
okay. If you're 64/47 and there is all stuff going on, it's okay, as long as all that
stuff isn‘t telling you what to do and as long as you're not obeying. That's the real
secret; everything is okay. It is what it is.
In the end it becomes valuable to the other. Not just in the form of you conditioning
the other physically, but what is possible out of your Outer Authority. The purity of
that, the beauty of that starts with the simple: Strategy and Authority. You can
never figure out and control what you're meant to be. You can only live it. And that
means letting go of all of your expectations and your identification with this and that
and the other thing. Give yourself self a chance to actually see who you can be.
That's really the great joy in this, because it‘s a surprise, always.
Anyway, it‘s nice to start this with all of you. I hope you enjoyed it. Okay until next
time; bye for now.

Lecture Two
The Metamorphic Life Forces
Okay, welcome to all of you. We enter into one of my favorite areas, actually, these
metamorphic life forces. What we‘re going to be dealing with is perhaps, in many
ways, the great achievement of what is to be human, and it is what makes us incred-
ibly special. And that is this relationship between the neo-cortex, the Ajna Center
where we have the potential of being
able to conceptualize and this extraor-
dinary ability of concepts being turned
into language. That is, concepts that
are articulated into sound formulas. I
don't think there's any area in the
nature of what it is to be human that is
more specifically human, other than
the Solar Plexus, than these forces
that exist here between the Ajna and
the Throat.
They really distinguish us from all
other creatures and have given us an
enormous capacity to be able to—I
was going to say triumph over nature,
but most people would think that‘s not
such a great achievement, but none-
theless, our ability to be able to control the territory, our ability to be able to domi-
nate other forms, our ability to be able to survive through our incredibly fast rise.
That is, as a species, given that so-called modern man, what came after Neander-
thal, considering that it has been around for a couple hundred thousand years, that it
really has only had what we would consider modern human attributes for about
90,000 years.
When you consider how long it has taken other species to develop a secure niche on
this planet and the fact that those species never go beyond just trying to secure the
environment they can survive in, when you take a look at humanity we have had the
fastest rise of all any species. Not only has it been this incredible fast rise, but at the
same time the capacity to be able to dominate over all the other species on the
plane. It is an extraordinary thing. And it is not about what is below the Throat that
made that possible.

Again, it‘s one of the more interesting things about dealing with the gift of mind.
Obviously, one of the most fundamental themes in Human Design is to understand
how disruptive and disorienting the mind is in the way in which it operates and the
way in which the not-self operates in homogenized humanity. The very capacity of
mind to give us our power, because in fact, it is what distinguished us and gave us
an enormous advantage, at the same time that very capacity is also something that
gets in the way of our ability to be able to transcend. So, it‘s an interesting place
always to deal with, that is, to deal with the nature of mind.
The Metamorphic Process
But let‘s go to our metamorphic process for a moment. First of all, this language—
metamorphosis—is something that is deeply related to the Throat Center. The
Throat Center biologically is related to the thyroid and the parathyroid glands. They
are really metamorphic in the
way in which they operate. They
change the way in which we act,
move, behave, digest, all of
these things because this is an
information center that is passing
along information through the
thyroids to the vehicle.
Metamorphosis is something that
we tend to see in the context of
the metamorphic changes of a
butterfly, as an example, the
stages it goes through. For me
in terms of using this language in
relationship to Human Design is
that this is the only place where
there really is, and I use the
language loosely, a miracle, be-
cause it's really a miracle. The
neo-cortex, whatever it may be,
the fact is that these are concepts and these are concepts that are not in any way
articulated. They are simply concepts and they‘re based on different things.
That is, the 17 and the 11 are collective, it‘s rooted in vision. The 43 is acoustic, it's
rooted in sound; but of course, it's not a real sound, it's an inner sound. And this
funny stuff on the inside, this ability to be able to see in certain ways, this ability to
be able to have a sense of acoustic frame on the inside suddenly can become articu-
lated into sounds. Not only can they be articulated sounds, but in fact those sounds
can be interpreted by somebody else. It is really quite something. It is here in De-
sign we call these gates in the Throat metamorphic gates. In other words, these
gates have a unique quality.

LECTURE TWO
The Metamorphic Life Forces
The 12th Gate
How did it start? The first thing is that here is the 12th gate, and the 12th gate and
the 11th gate are oppositions in the wheel. About 85,000 years ago there was a
mutation that took place. Mutation takes place in individual circuitry; the mutation
at that point took place in the 12th gate, obviously in the
Throat. And the 12th gate as we know it in Design is the
gate of articulation, not simply articulation, but muta-
tive articulation, the ability through words to sway, to
move, to transform somebody else. It‘s why it‘s asso-
ciated with poetry and lyrics and these kinds of things.
The kind of language, the language of love, as an ex-
ample, that is there to move you and touch you and in
so many ways change you.
That 12th gate, it is here that the mutation of the larynx
took place. Now, it‘s something interesting to think
about when we look at our closest relatives, the pri-
mates and particularly, for example, if we take a look at
guerrillas which are very close to us, or chimpanzees. They have a very interesting
phenomenon, and that phenomenon is that they have a closed larynx. And because
they have a closed larynx it gives them the ability to do something that‘s rather odd.
They can drink and breath at the same time. Think about that, because that's quite
something to consider. They can drink and breathe; they can take in sustenance
and breathe at the same time.
The Dropping of the Larynx
Now, what happened to humans 85,000 years ago is the closed larynx, through a
mutation that was carried through the female, dropped. Now, basically what that
actually meant was that the dropping of the larynx allowed for a change in the way
in which sound could come out of the mouth. We take it for granted, because of
course we are the by-product of an evolutionary track; we take it for granted that
this is a very natural thing. That is, our ability to create nuances in language.
In other words, if you learn a new language for example, you realize right away how
your mouth is different, how do you breathe differently when you breathe out certain
sounds or whatever the case may be. We see in the extreme and those who are
very gifted vocally, opera singers for example who have a vast range, the tremend-
ous ability in this open larynx to be able to provide not simply nuances in terms of
the way in which sounds are brought out, but also the range of those sounds in
terms of the musical range, that is, the scale of those sounds.
None of that was really possible in our earlier ancestors who, like the primates of
today, are very limited in the sounds they can make. There is no question, as an
example, that the chimpanzee in terms of its cognitive capacity is a very intelligent

creature. There is no question about it. We can teach it very sophisticated things,
and it is able to master those very sophisticated things. The one thing, though, that
it can't do is articulate. It can produce what all mammals can produce. It can pro-
duce sounds that are related to particular immune system signals, whether that be
fear, whether that be trying to protect themselves, whether that is the basic Sacral
sounds, as an example, the moans, the groans, the sighs; all of those are inherent in
all mammals.
But language? No. The root of language is in this opposition. This is where it be-
gan. What is so fascinat-
ing about it is because of
the opposition here, a real
understanding that this is a
mutation that works for
the benefit of this connec-
tion; in other words, the
connection between the
Ajna Center and the
Throat. Basically what it
represents is that it‘s sort
of like a chicken and egg
story, in a way. The thing
to recognize is that the
ability for the ideas, the
perception of experience to
be able to grow is directly
related to the ability to be
able to describe it, and
vice versa.
In other words, the drop-
ping of the larynx that
opened up the possibility
for nuances also expanded the possibility of mind. It gave mind an outlet, an outlet
that as we well know turned out to be rather dangerous because in the end the pow-
er of this mutation led to a mind assuming it was in control of the vehicle. And it's
not, as we well know.
But of course, this was something that because it provided humanity with an enorm-
ous advantage, it was seen that this is the answer, to use mind to guide the life.
And of course, the seven-centered being was the source of this mutation that sur-
vived until the end of the 1800s. It was this seven-centered being that perfected
this ―mind is everything‖ because mind is the thing that allows us to control the
world. And this becomes all wrapped up into the way the homogenized world func-
tions in which the vast majority of humanity live in a world in which they are trained
to make decisions with their mind. Just about everybody on this planet is training to
make decisions with their mind.

The Metamorphic Life Forces
The Abstract
So let's see how it works. I‘m going to begin with the abstract. It‘s very important
to see clearly that the mutation that launched this relationship was rooted in expe-
rience. Whenever we are dealing with
the abstract we are dealing with the
experiential. In dealing with the ab-
stract we are always dealing with past.
In other words, the expansion of our
potential to be able to articulate was in
order to protect us based on being
able to analyze and share experience.
This was something that was enorm-
ously important.
In other words, somebody would go
out in a tribe and they would be wan-
dering around and they would see
something. Now, of course, before the
dropping of the larynx the only thing
that would be possible for them was
they would have to go all the way back
and they would have to, through sounds and gestures, pull the others to come with
them, to take that journey with them to go out there and to see what they had seen.
The moment you have the dropping of the larynx and the moment you have the
beginnings of the development of a language is the moment you have one of these
beings who goes out and sees something, they can come back, and the others do not
have to go there. And yet at the same time, they gain the valuable information.
Perhaps it was something simply to notice. Perhaps they saw something new, some-
thing different, something that was unexpected, but not necessarily something
where everybody had to go and see it.
We know this of course in the fact that when you look at the nature of humanity and
its development, particularly over the last 7000 years, everything about our enorm-
ous speed in the development of our collective consciousness has been rooted in the
sharing of experience. Today it is unbelievable what we have as an educational envi-
ronment. What I mean by that is with all the media we have, the Internet, all of
these things that the experiential, YouTube, you name it, the experiential is all over
the place and you can find out just about any kind of experience by simply Googling
it and getting it.
That's an enormous advantage. Think about the way in which a mammal has to
train its young. The only way they're going to be able to train their young is to be
able to demonstrate things over and over and over again. The only things that
they're going to be able to teach them are just limited to their survival, because that
is all that is there in their potential. The thing that has always made humans differ-
ent is that we have very, very weak and very, very fragile babies.

It takes a human seven years—we learned this after the Second World War with feral
children's studies in children whose parents died in the war and they were aban-
doned and they just roamed around. The fact is that it was incredibly rare that any
of them under seven could survive. And so much of what is necessary for that child
in that first seven years locked into the seven-year cycle is the amount of experien-
tial information we can give them. We don't have to put their hand on the fire to be
able to demonstrate to them that it's hot. We have the advantage of being able to
explain what things are, to be able to share experientially, and in sharing experien-
tially advance the educational level of our offspring. This was an enormous devel-
opment.
Collective Sharing
One of the great aspects of this was the tribal shaman or storyteller or whatever
name you want to give any of those. We only have insights into what went on 7000
years ago, because there were thousands of years in which the experiential story
was passed from one generation to another. And of course, this life force, this me-
tamorphic force of curiosity and searching, it‘s more than just curiosity and search-
ing. It is ultimately a force that is there to express itself in language. It is collective
after all; it is inherently social.
This sharing of our search, this sharing of our curiosity—it's one thing that you have
somebody who decides to spend a month at the bottom of the ocean. Well, I don't
want to do that, but it certainly may be interesting, what it's like, what they see,
what they experience and fortunately
this is a collective area. So, we have all
the scientists and everybody else and
they are always writing their experien-
tial experimental this and that. This is
what happened; this is what we saw so
that everybody else can get it.
I got some Hubble photographs yester-
day. It was like whoa, you know. This
is the treasure of being human. It took
about 18,000 people and probably about
half a million hours to build that Hubble
telescope. It took hundreds of millions
of dollars of investment and hundreds of
millions of tons of fuel to send that thing
up into space, to send astronauts up
there to fix it a few times. And here I
am in front of my computer downloading those images. This is the 11/56 at work.
This is what this life force is all about. And it transformed us as a species.

LECTURE TWO
The Metamorphic Life Forces
We don't really get to see the life force well. We don‘t, the complexity of people‘s
designs. Most of our understanding of this channel is rooted in people who have the
11 and don't have the 56 or have the 56 and don't have the 11. It gives that very,
very different quality to inherently what is here. But it‘s something to understand,
this is one of the most important things that happened to us along the way. This
power, this power to be able to be driven in a way, forced in a way, the power of this
to search; and not only to search, not to search for oneself, but ultimately to search
collectively, to share in the results collectively.
The 56th gate is the great gate of storytelling. One of the things that make us so
different is that we can tell those stories, we can change the way in which things
operate simply by sharing experience. We don't have to repeat the same mistakes
over and over and over again, it‘s the beauty of this.
The 11/56: Searching
So here we have this force of the search. Now, it‘s something that is deeply misun-
derstood by people who have this channel. They end up being seekers. They think
they are looking for a thing. They think they are looking for an answer. And they‘re
not. They‘re data collectors, experience collec-
tors. The moment they understand that they
are not seeking something, they are looking for
anything, anything, because in fact, that is their
process. It‘s their responsibility to educate the
rest of us. And to educate us experientially,
which means they have to do it.
It's those who do it, who are the ones that tell
the most interesting stories. Nothing worse
than a second-hand story. Second-hand stories
usually become jokes, but first-hand stories
always carry a certain magic, because it's the
gift of the unique experience to others. It's one
of the things that one gets to understand about
the abstract through the 35/36 and we‘ll get
there; the language of the 35: been there, done that. And through this force is the
possibility of being able to allow others to be able to see something before they jump
in, to be able to grasp whether or not it's even necessary to jump in.
But you notice something about this, that in the end this is not about the mind telling
one what to do. This is one of the things that is so deeply misunderstood about
mind. Mind is not Inner Authority; it‘s not there to tell you what to do in your life.
The very birth of the mind/voice connection was simply about describing what has
happened. That's all. It is the experiential catalog. This is what happened. It be-
comes perverted into, ‗This is what I'm going to do, I'm going to go look for that
thing.‘ And the moment this is ‗I‘m going to go look for that thing,‘ this is the mind
becoming Inner Authority. And this is a distortion of the life and the force. It‘s ac-

tually, ‗Gee, look at what I saw, or look at what I found.‘ It isn't about, ‗I'm going to
find it.‘ It‘s about experientially ‗This is what I have found. It is what happened to
me, it is what I have found.‘
The Logical 17/62: Organizing
The collective process is an obvious one. It says than the collective channels to the
Throat are there to provide essential information to all of us. This is what the mind
is good for. This is what other Authority is about. This is what you experience from
me. This is just simply what mind is about. And
here again you can see another level of the ad-
vantage that our capacity to be able to verbalize
brought to us. And of course, here in the 17/62,
you get to see the organizing force. The search-
ing force, but the organizing force.
This organizing is something that's very interest-
ing because it includes mammals. I bring that
up because it's an important aspect of this be-
cause that's its original value. That is, in mam-
malian design, mammals have the potential of
the 62nd gate, but they don't have the 17. It is
Collective
one of three ways in which mammals can con- Channels
nect to humans. And this way in which they
connect, this organizing, this is the way human
beings get mammals to follow patterns that human beings want them to follow. At
the mundane level we would call that a trick. Teaching your dog to give you its paw
because it knows it's going to get a pat on the head and a cookie.
Basically it is here in this channel that the human relationship with a mammalian
world was organized. That changed our life. That changed everything. This is
where you would find the term the ‗domestication‘ of mammals. It is where, in fact,
we were able to organize ourselves into the first sustainable communities, and to be
able to do that because the organizing could be articulated. It wasn't about waving
your hand in the air or pushing people in a certain direction, the nonverbal, threaten-
ing them, smiling at them, one or the other. Oh, this was something entirely differ-
ent. This was organizing them through what we call logic, and ultimately expressed
through what we call facts.
The 62nd Gate
Now, the 62nd gate is one of those gates that is the key to being able to take advan-
tage of the original mutation. That is, the original experiential mutation, that muta-
tion when you go out there and something happens, you have the ability to be able
to come back and share that experience, want to share that experience, want to—

LECTURE TWO
The Metamorphic Life Forces
remember that you‘re driven to. The 11/56 has to tell their stories about what hap-
pened to them. They are driven to do that. They are helpless in that.
And yet, at the same time, the moment you begin to expand the searching horizon,
that is, the conscious awareness of environment, the conscious looking at things in
order to be able to share them, then something has to happen. You have to be able
to develop more and more formulas. That is, sound formulas. And the sound formu-
las are what we call the naming of things; the naming of things is here in this meta-
morphic gate, the 62nd gate. This is the place where things are given their name.
They are organized by being given a name.
That‘s something that changes everything. The moment within the tribal context
you're all able to articulate the sound formula and know the relationship of the sound
formula to its intellectual value, is the moment that then you can be organized. And
of course, the organizing of humanity demanded that we were able to defend our-
selves and feed ourselves. In terms of the defense, this ability to be able to be cu-
rious, this force that drives one to look and search and figure out, well, how quickly
you learn about what you want to have for dinner. Your ability to look at the way in
which certain mammals operate, particularly herbivores, where they like to be,
where they are at certain times of the day, when they are the most vulnerable, and
the ability through the development of the language, the naming of things, to be
able to name that particular herbivore, to be able to organize the others into a me-
thodology in order for them to be able to form an attack that will allow them to kill
that herbivore and have it for dinner.
The Combination of Curiosity and Organizing
This combination of the curiosity and the organizing is an enormous power. It also
led to an understanding that that herbivore, all they really want, all they care about,
in fact, is having enough to eat and not being killed by predators. So what do you
do? You organize them. And of course here
comes the organizing of the mammals. So you
take those herbivores and you corral them, you
keep them in a protected area. You organize
some of the tribe to guard them and make sure
they are protected. And they will happily just go
along eating.
The fact of the matter is after 20 or 30,000
years of living that way in relationship to hu-
manity, they get dumbed down into what we
have today—sheep, cows, quite contented to be
in the field, munching away protected from pre-
dators and being easily available for sacrifice so
the human community, the organized communi-
ty, has enough to eat. It‘s something else. The ability to be able to organize the
community transformed forever the intellectual development of the human.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
If you go back to our primitive nature prior to the dropping of the larynx, everybody
had to be involved in the basic survival regimen. In other words, all males who were
old enough had to go out on the hunt. You just had to do; everybody had to partici-
pate. The survival of your group depended on it. But when we go to the era of the
dropped larynx and the relatively modern human, the first true seven-centered be-
ings, you get something that is totally different. That is, the ability to be able to,
through your curiosity, discover the way in which the mammals operate and develop
a strategy to be able to organize them. The moment you do that it means no longer
do all those males have to go out on the hunt. They don't. Oh, yes, some of them
will continue to do so. Some will spend their lifetime as simply husbanding the ani-
mals in the collected area, but it means that the others are free to do other things,
to be builders, to be artisan's, to be rebels, to be fools, to be whatever.
The reality is that the moment you're able to organize mammals and be able to or-
ganize them so that no longer does everybody have to do the same job, you begin to
get the diversity that leads to the expansion of our intellectuality. It‘s the same
thing about the discovery of the laws that underline agriculture. Again, here is the
11/56, the key, the wonder of what brought us up above the mammalian. Here it is
in this curiosity, the curiosity that leads to the understanding what a seed is and how
it works. And then the other side, organizing it into a pattern and be able to share in
a language with everyone so they know what to do. And then you can teach them.
The Solar Plexus Mutation
It is an incredible thing when you think about it. This is where everything changed.
One of the things to keep in mind about this is if you can grasp how profound a
change this brought, this living connection between the Ajna and the Throat, then
you have to begin to think about how profound the mutation taking place now in the
Solar Plexus Center is going to be. And that the development of the potential of
Solar Plexus awareness will transform life as radically, at least for those who are
born with it, as radically as the introduction of this Ajna process transformed the way
in which humans were able to totally change the nature of their being. They went
from being savages overnight. And I mean that, I mean in Earth time, it's an over-
night thing.
The Dominance of Mind
So, these metamorphic forces are more than just another set of forces. They really
need to be seen for what they are. This is what set us apart. And of course now,
because we are at the end of this process, we have to see that this reliance on being
able to dominate and control and organize and expand, all of that gets to a point
where, in and of itself, rather than being a benefit to humanity becomes destructible,
what we get to see today, the by-product of this long-term process. And not simply
destructive at the mundane level, how the homogenized world destroys its own envi-
ronment, but to begin to see deeply how this is all leads to the dominance of mind in

The Metamorphic Life Forces
our lives and has taken us away from the possibility of what is there for us to be able
to live out in this life.
So here is this great wonder. And like all things in a duality, I guess it's one of the
things that I treasure most about the nature of duality is that you cannot be moralis-
tic when you're dealing with dualities. There's just this and that, there's the ―this
and that‖ of the beauty and the ugliness of what this represents. But one shouldn't
forget its beauty; it's quite spectacular.
The 43/23: Originality
All right, let's take a look at our final life force here. Here we're dealing with some-
thing very different in the sense that the 43/23 is an opposition in the wheel. It is
one of those commonalities like the 20/34 or the
40/37, again oppositions in the wheel. It means
that if you have your Sun or Earth, or you have
your Node in one of these, obviously you‘ve got
the other. So this is the kind of channel that
shows up a great deal. Something to under-
stand about the design is to realize that the
43/23, the 20/34, the 40/37 that for us as nine-
centered beings, these are the most important
aspects. And what I mean by that is that they
lay the commonality foundation on the planet.
If you take the combination of the 43/23, the
20/34 and the 40/37 you'll see that, all of you
will know that sooner or later when you do de-
signs, you see they show up all the time. And
they show up all the time again, because they are in opposition.
So, one of the things to look with the 43/23 is
that this is a life force that really is a life force.
It‘s much rarer to see somebody who has one
of these gates and not the other. The commo-
nality, as you see, is defined. So this is a very,
very powerful life force. It's called the Channel
of Structuring. And one of the things about the
nature of the structuring, obviously when you're
dealing with a 43/23 you're dealing with an
individual channel, you're dealing with muta-
tion.
Now, this is very uncomfortable for the collec- Individual
Channel
tive. It's not what the collective likes. The
abstract says: been there, seen it; here is
what I saw. The logic says: all right, let's work out a plan, let's organize things.
And let's organize them so they're stable. Neither one of them like mutation, be-

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

cause mutation overturns the apple cart, mutation can make things very difficult
because mutation will introduce something that is original and you can see keynoting
here is that this is a life force of originality.
Now again, if you look at the collective, the collective is all about trying to master
the world. Think about that, because that‘s what it‘s about. The 11/56 in its search-
ing tries to figure out what the world is about, it tries to see, it tries to get the expe-
rience of it, to find the taste of this
fruit or the feel of that thing or what-
ever it is.
On the other side of that you have
the logical side that simply tries to
organize humanity so that it can be
successful in the world as it is. So
the collective here, in terms of the
way in which the mind/Throat system
Individual is operating, the collective is only
Mutative
concerned with one thing, being able
to manage our survival in the world,
and to be able to grasp the nature of
Collective Collective the world we live in in order to be
Logic Abstract
more secure in it.
Now, what makes the 43 so different
and the 43/23 different is that it's not
based on the same neo-cortex
process. It isn‘t. The 17th gate is the gate of the right eye, and the 11th gate is the
gate of the left eye. And everything about the way in which the mastery of the world
operates is all rooted in the visual. Master the world you see.
Now, ultimately that can lead to imagination about the possibility of what the world
could be. But the reality is that for the collective, this visual is simply ‗this is the
world we see so this is what we have to deal with.‘ The 43/23 is not dependent on
seeing. It‘s taking in or operating at a different frequency. That different frequency
gives the possibility of being tuned in to things that are beyond the capacity of the
visual, because the 43/23 isn't interested in the world. They're interested in what's
new, in originality. And that originality comes out in their ability to be able to devel-
op techniques, concepts, for what is a word we would call efficiency.
They look at the logic and they look at the way in which the logic has organized
something. And they say, ‗Why don‘t you do this? It will work so much better and
so much faster.‘ And logic says, ‗No, no, no, we‘ve been doing this,‘ it‘s a whole
struggle. It‘s one of those things about the 43/23 as the channel of the genius to
freak. The freak is simply the inability to be able to get your message across to the
collective. If the collective doesn't accept your message, you‘re left out in the cold.

LECTURE TWO
The Metamorphic Life Forces
The 43rd Gate
But what I really want to get to here in terms of the way in which the 43 operates is
that this is the root of the unique mind, the different mind, the mind that isn't fo-
cused on simply dealing with the world, the mind that is simply open. And in that
openness, in that acoustic openness, the potential of what we call insight, the poten-
tial that something is there that the visual can‘t see. It is such a thing, this capacity
that is there in us for this energy to arise in us, that we have this ability to be able to
articulate, and to be able to articulate in such a way that we can transfer all these
different kinds of information to the other.
What's Human Design really about? We‘re a binary consciousness, that‘s where the
whole story begins. We‘re a binary consciousness and for the last 90,000 years we
have been totally reliant on only one aspect of this consciousness. We have been
totally reliant on the mind. And you can tell why. You can see that these metamor-
phic forces were so profound in transforming the nature of our lives that without
question it was very easy to see that mind was the thing.
As a matter of fact, it wasn't meant to be any other way for the seven-centered be-
ing. It‘s only since the advent of the nine-centered being, that is, in 1781 the dis-
covery of Uranus by Herschel, it's only since then, with the emergence of this transi-
tional form that the ability to change our relationship to mind emerged. It was not
possible beforehand.
Decision Making and the Vehicle
The seven-centered being was purely strategic. The strategic value of mind is ob-
vious. It's obvious if you see the way in which it separated us from the beast and
transformed us into this kind of deeply, deeply complex human. But Human Design
says that we are binary consciousness and that the only way you're going to be able
to operate correctly in this life and fulfill the potential of your life is when you turn
over the decision making responsibility to your vehicle and take it away from your
mind.
This is the great challenge; it‘s the most enormous challenge that anyone faces in
this life now. It‘s not for everyone. It really isn‘t, it never will be. For the vast ma-
jority of humanity they will never be able to shake their not-self mind, they‘ll never
be able to get rid it dominating their lives. They won't. It is an enormous challenge.
It is what we have been dependent on for so long. But it's a false God. It belongs to
an older species, to that seven-centered being that rose up above the beast, but not
for us. It isn't.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
The True Value of Mind
We can already see the damage that it has brought. For us it is a different process.
It's about realizing the true value of mind. You can see it here. This illustration is
the true Outer Authority. What happens when
you make decisions according to your Strategy
and Authority, it‘s your design, it‘s your vehicu-
lar consciousness that aligns you to a geometry
that is correct for you, begins to reduce the
resistance, and opens up the possibility for you
in being in the right trajectory to have in front of
you what is the there for you to experience and
see.
It is in that that lies the possibility of the pas-
senger, your personality, to be able to take in
that experience and through these metamorphic
life forces be able to express what they take in
and to be able to express it as pure Outer Au-
thority without an agenda. Simply that that is what is natural for them. It is natural
to express the curiosity to meet somebody who has true Outer Authority who's going
to tell you about something they experienced. The benefit for you is the pleasure of
the entertainment. It's not that they're telling you that in order to change you.
Anybody who is trying to change you is the enemy. Not changing you, influencing
you to be this or that, it's the telling of a story.
There‘s that old joke about a mother and father and their children sitting around the
fire and the father is rattling on and on with some story he‘s telling. At some point
one of the kids blurts out and says, ‗Is that true?‘ And the mother smacks him gent-
ly on the back of the head and says, ‗Don‘t interrupt, it's just a story.‘ It‘s just story.
That's the beauty of the pure Outer Authority, of this searching curiosity life force, is
the ability to be able to just articulate that for the other.
The same thing is true on the other collective side. I love facts. I'm in a 62, so I get
off on them. I like facts. I like data. I like all of that information. But the fact that
I'm interested in the data doesn't mean that the data is influencing me; it's interest-
ing. It's entertaining. And I always find it interesting when somebody has some
unusual little tidbit of information that they can impart. It's not about organizing me
to do something. The pure Outer Authority of a logic being helps us to grasp deeply
how things work by being given more information, by being able to organize the way
in which we understand something, to ultimately be able to accept it, and just for its
interest.
It isn‘t up to mind to decide what to do. I offer you information. That's all. The fact
is that whether you do anything about it or not is not about me. And if you're doing
it for me, you‘re crazy. It‘s about doing it for yourself. When it's correct, do it for
yourself; otherwise, it's just interesting. Most of what I teach is just interesting. It
is what Outer Authority is about. It's there to stimulate us. It's there to stimulate
this tremendous capacity we have at the mental level and to be able to engage in

The Metamorphic Life Forces
our communication with each other at a level that‘s stimulating for those who are
involved. Isn‘t it awful to have a boring conversation with somebody? And isn‘t that
most of the time? And wouldn't it be nice if the people you had to deal with in your
life could express their Outer Authority, and it wouldn‘t it be entertaining to have
them as a relationship, because that's what Outer Authority is about.
Communicating Our Uniqueness
It's only when we begin to communicate out of our uniqueness that we begin to
transform the way in which consciousness works. The world is filled with communi-
cation that is nothing but lies, just lies. That‘s not what we‘re here for. The poten-
tial for us is that the moment you move away from your mind making decisions, you
finally open up the possibility to express Outer Authority.
And by the way, it doesn‘t matter if you have these channels defined or not. It
doesn‘t make any difference. It comes and it goes; there are transits, there are
people. It‘s simply about understanding that your ability to look at the world when
you are correct is something that can be interesting for others. It‘s what Outer Au-
thority is for. If I didn't have anything interesting to say, I wouldn‘t have much to
do.
The acoustic is really something that is very special, because basically it‘s just fre-
quency. It‘s about the inner ear or the third ear, because that‘s basically what it is.
We are nothing but frequencies. And of course, there is this possibility that lies in
every single one of us to be what the 43/23 most deeply expresses, to be an origi-
nal. This is our destiny. This is what is written in your code when you come into the
world. It says: original. Nothing like ever before, never will be anything like it
again. It's an original.
How quickly that originality is lost. How quickly that originality of that perfection as
it comes out of the womb is immediately conditioned. Immediately smothered with
conditioning, the way it is communicated to, the way it‘s fed, the way it will be edu-
cated, the way it will be trained to use its mind to run its life. And that treasure of
originality is lost. They may look different from somebody else on the street but
they‘re operating under the same not-self consciousness, far, far away from being
able to express what is their uniqueness, their originality. We‘re all originals, and
how sad it is to see that that is just lost on this plane. It's lost.
Authority
It's about Authority; it‘s what it comes down to. Who's in charge of your life? So
many human beings live under all of these authorities and bow their heads to every
single one of them. You cannot be an original when you're constantly doing what
you‘re told. You cannot be an original when you're constantly doing because you‘re
conditioned to do it, forced to do it, have to do it, and need to do it. Everybody from
your lover to your dog controls your life. You're afraid to make decisions for yourself

because of the impact it may or may not have on others. It can dance around in
your head trying to figure out some way you can lie in order to try to get what you
think you need.
It's about Authority. The clock is ticking as we move towards 2027, the changing of
the cycle, the precession of the equinox and entering into the 55th gate, 6th line of
selfishness. Well, learned it now. Don't wait until it's smacked up in your face; learn
it now. Selfishness is not a crime. If you cannot be selfish, you will never love your-
self, ever. If you cannot love yourself, you will never be an original, never, because
it's the only thing worthy of loving. It is what it is to truly be you. It's about your
own Authority.
It doesn't mean you're not going to do what some other wants you to do at any giv-
en moment; it‘s not about that. If your Authority says ―yes‖ you‘ll do it. And if it
says ―no,‖ then don‘t, because it‘s about you. This is the only way you have to oper-
ate out of your own Authority. It‘s only then that you begin to nurture this special-
ness, this uniqueness that‘s you, the original. And don't worry about those people
who don't like it; the hell with them. It's your life, and it‘s short, and it's fast.
I still feel 18 and I'm nearly 60. It flies by. You might as well get it right. And it
begins with this true Inner Authority. You have to trust it. You have to rely on it.
And what it does is open up the possibility for you to be able to express the beauty
of what is your mind, to be able to bring these metamorphic forces out, to be able to
offer that to the other, to share it to empower others with it for no purpose, for mu-
tual entertainment, for mutual interest, for the pleasure of what it can be to be intel-
ligent human beings in communion with each other. Because anything else that's
going to happen in your relationship, whether they are a friend, a lover, an enemy,
whatever it may be, has nothing to do with what your mind can offer. It‘s about
what your vehicle determines.
Honor your Strategy and Authority. Then you can get to that place where you can
begin to not just simply love your self, but see the beauty of what you have to offer
to everyone else.
Anyway, it was nice to share that with you this morning, or some of you are evening,
whenever; nonetheless, it‘s nice to share it with you. To all of you, you take care.
Until next time, bye for now.

Integration: The Survival Force
Hello to all of you. Later today, as you well know, it is the Rave New Year with the
Sun going into the 41st gate. I want to wish you all an interesting year and an enter-
taining year. It's always nice to start with clean, fresh slates. It‘s a great year; trust
in yourself.
Anyway, let's get on with our life forces. From the very beginning my work in look-
ing at the BodyGraph—I think I've mentioned this a number of times over the years,
particularly when I'm training people to be professionals—how important it is to un-
derstand the graph, that is, to visually grasp it. One of the things that I began with
was just simply looking at this graph as a circuit board and trying to understand the
way in which things move. The moment you do that, the moment you look at the
BodyGraph with naïve eyes, and basically that is what it demands, is that there are a
number of things you end up noticing. The most obvious of all of them is the com-
plexity of what is called the integration channels, the complexity of what it is to have
a four-gate system. And obviously this is the only system of its kind. It is the only
circuitry, within the context of BodyGraph as a whole, in which we have such a com-
plexity.

A Digital Book for Newcomers
The 34th Gate
Obviously, it means that these gates are different. It‘s something to be clear about.
Take the example of the 34th gate, because the 34th gate is the most obviously dif-
ferent gate of the Sacral Center, and it truly is. First of all it breaks the symmetry of
the Sacral. The moment you see that anyway, everything about the BodyGraph is
rooted in all kinds of symmetries. Clearly here in the BodyGraph with the three
above and the three below and the imperative genetic gates on either side, you have
this perfect, nice, symmetrical structure, and then, oh, there‘s the 34th gate.
It is the only gate of a Center—which is obviously the most significant motor power
we have on the planet in the sense that this is the source of our fertility, our repro-
duction, our capacity to be able to generate and maintain life—that of all the gates of
the Sacral Center only one is given the name of
the Gate of Power and that gate of power is the
34th gate. The 34th gate is interesting in many,
many ways. It takes away attention from every
place else. I think it‘s one of the things to grasp
about the 34 when it‘s operating. When it‘s op-
erating, the attention of that being is totally ab-
sorbed by wherever the 34 is putting its power.
An example of that is the way we describe the
channel 20/34, which is the Channel of Charisma
and one of the aspects of this. We talk about
this being a channel of busyness, and busyness
to the point that everything else gets excluded.
―Darling, the house is on fire,‖ ―Sorry, I'm busy
right now. My finger is caught in the vice; sorry I'm busy right now.‖ Just my black
sense of humor; but nonetheless, to really understand something about what the 34
does, it has a very, very funny subtitling as a channel. It‘s where thoughts must
become deeds.
And of course, it really has nothing to do with thoughts. What it has to do with, in
fact, is that whatever that power is latched onto, that‘s the deed that has to be ac-
complished, which means it's really obsessive. The thing to understand about
20/34s, they‘re really in their thing, and they‘re helpless in that because of the 34.
And despite the fact that somebody is calling to them and needs them, and despite
the fact that they can be very aware of that and would love to be able to do it, sorry
I‘m busy; because they‘re helpless.
The 34th gate is different in the Sacral Center in another way. It is fundamentally
asexual. In other words, its power is not power that can be tapped into for repro-
ductive or fertility purposes. This energy is very isolated the way it taps into the
overall energy of the Sacral; it is very different than the way in which all the other
gates do, because all the other gates have a part to play within the reproductive and
fertility process of what it is to be human, not the 34.

LECTURE THREE
Integration - The Survival Force
The Power to Drive and Empower Three Connections
So again, the 34 creates an illusion of the Sacral Center that has its generative pow-
er, which normally carries with it is reproductive fertility. And yet, in the case of the
34, that is not the frequency that is put out because that's not what this energy is
focused on. The focusing of the energy of the 34, to understand why it has nothing
for what is the essential Sacral process, it does not. Obviously there are enough
gates to take care of that business. The 34 has to be able to have sufficient power
to be able to empower and drive three different connections essentially and possibly
all at the same time.
So the resource necessary in the 34th gate is a resource that is far greater than the
actual resources that are there in any of the other gates of the Sacral Center. It is
the gate of power. But it's more than that. At the very basis of any discussion of
the Sacral Center we cannot escape the fact that approximately 67 or 68% of hu-
manity are Generators. And as Generators, the Strategy and Authority of the Gene-
rator is to respond. It is through response that they can operate correctly, that they
can have a proper decision making process, and so forth and so on.
Power in Response
It is something really to grasp about this 34th gate, whose essential direction has
nothing to do with fertility, has nothing to do with the sexuality, and has nothing to
do with the reproductive power of the Sacral. But in fact, is the key to and is the
root of what we call Sacral response. This is power in response. And it is not in
response in the sense that we understand it holistically in the context of the strategy
for the Generator, but understand what it means in the sense of this is power that is
ready to respond to intuition. It is power that is ready to respond to behavior. It is
power that is ready to respond to the circumstances of the now. In other words, it is
this deep power resource and it‘s there to respond.
The 57/34: Intuition Empowered
Ultimately out of this, because integration lays the
foundation for our survival, is something very, very
profound to understand. The channel 57/34, the
channel of the archetype; that is, intuition empo-
wered. And intuition empowered is the source and
the Root of our ability to be able to survive. Of all
the forces, of all of the life forces that we can look
at, if we're going to measure them in the context of
survivability, this is it. This is the preeminent sur-
vival mechanism.
It‘s also very odd. In other words, when you're
looking at symmetry, the thing that is so interesting
The Life Force is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

33
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
about integration are all these twists and turns; there are all
these things that are in there. It is very different in the way in
which the energy moves. And it means that despite the fact that
there is a direct connection through the 50/27, this 34/57 is a
very, very different way and much more primal in the way in
which the original relationship between the Sacral and the Spleen
was determined. Also something to note, we have about, I think
31% of all humanity are Manifesting Generators, but not all of
those Manifesting Generators are really true pure Manifesting
Generators. What I mean by that is that you can see here that
not only does the Sacral Center through the 34th gate create its
primal relationship to the Spleen, but it is also creating its primal relationship to
action. In other words, this action that can be guided by empowered intuition and all
of this is response.
The Root of Pure Individual Survival
In other words, this is about survival being a defense mechanism, defense rather
than offense, even though the offense can come out of it.
What we're looking at is the root of survivability in all ad-
vanced life forms. Any form that has a spleen, if you look
you'll see that after the cell and the plant upwards, they all
have a Splenic system, to really understand that this is the
bedrock of survival, the ability to be able to respond to the
circumstances of the now. This is survival. The epitome of
what survival is all about is being able to respond to the cir-
cumstances of the now. It is not about creating something.
That‘s not what this is about. This archetypal life force is all
about heightened respond-ability, not responsibility, but respond-ability.
When we're dealing with integration we are
dealing with the core of individuality. Re-
member that within the context of Human
Design individuality is something that is very,
very complex. We have the centering circuit,
which is the 51/25, the 10/34 [striped chan-
nels in the image to the left.] So you can see
that in integration [see pg. 31] the 10/34 is
not an aspect of it, yet is flowing through it.
When we‘re dealing with the circuit of indivi-
duality, which of course is the circuit that runs
right through the middle of everything, you
can see that the 57/20 is part of it, which
means that's not an integrated theme. And
yet, it flows through it.

LECTURE THREE
Integration - The Survival Force
When you look at all of this individuality you're actually looking at it in the stages of
its own evolutionary development. What you're really looking at here is the most
deeply individual, non-social aspect that exists in the BodyGraph, what I like to call
the lone wolf. This is the root of pure individual survival, because if there is no indi-
vidual survival, there is ultimately no tribal survival, no collective survival, no noth-
ing. The form, the species, has to be able to survive.

20/10 – Awakening 25/51 – Initiation
20/34 – Charisma 10/34 – Exploration
34/57 – Power
10/57 – Perfected Form
Integration: Self-Empowerment
So, one of the dilemmas of integration when you see it in a modern nine-centered
being is that those beings who are oriented deeply into integration often have great
difficulties in being able to establish the kinds of relationships in which the other
feels like they're really there for them, because in fact, they're not. Integration is
something that is very cold, and it is acoustically attuned it to its own survival. It
isn't attuned to anybody else's survival. It doesn't care about anybody else. It
doesn't.
When the rest of individuality comes into play, yes, it can be turned towards being
more concerned about the other and more empowering to the other. But this is
about as selfish as any configuration can be in the BodyGraph. It‘s about self-
empowerment. It is the force of unique survival. It's the one person who makes it
out of the plane crash. It's the unique survival. And they got out of there because
they were only concerned about themselves. You might say, well, they're not a he-
ro, no, but they‘re going to live another day. And they may produce more offspring.
And ultimately they can keep the species alive because they do not easily go down,
because they are so deeply, deeply attuned to risk threat.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
This is what this archetype is really about. I remember in the early years when I
was first laying out the information about channels and all that stuff, there were
these people who would have the archetype [Channel 34/57] in their design and
they would say to me, ―An archetype of what?‖ I said human. They never really
appreciated it, but that is what it is. It is the deepest human survival mechanism,
the empowerment of intuition, the empowerment of the acoustic.
The 57th Gate: Fear of Tomorrow
Think about the 57th gate. It is the fear of tomorrow. Everything rooted in integra-
tion is about fear of what can happen. And it's not about being paranoid. It's about
understanding how fragile existence is, how easy it is to leave this plane. Ask the
40,000 babies an hour that die. It‘s one of the things that we understand; this fra-
gility. It‘s why we're so concerned about the security of our societies, our food, our
infrastructures, the general hygiene, and on and on and on and on. We want to stay
alive. This is the mechanism of staying alive.
So here, what we‘re looking at is the beginning of this whole process. This is the
very root of it, this power that is dedicated to our survival. It‘s very interesting what
happens in life. I‘m an integration being. I have the 20 and the 10 and the 57. I
don't have the 34. So I know it really well because I have a totally undefined Sacral.
And it is an absolutely, unbelievable energy source. It just is. It is an unbelievable
energy source. I went

the 90s. It is absolutely ex-
traordinary the power that it

brings. It is something really

Charisma 34/20
And of course, it's not the only

thing. We are a deeply com-
plex species. It‘s one of the
dilemmas that arises out of Power 57/34
the mutation that's taking Response
place in the Solar Plexus sys-
tem, the way in which we are
having a transition in the way our mental system operates; we‘re moving further and
further away from this basic, survival foundation. And of course, this is where we go
into very, very risky areas, like the difference between left-minded and right-minded
beings. Right-minded beings don't know how to concentrate on their strategic sur-
vival; this is the strategic survival zone of the vehicle. It‘s what‘s there to keep us
alive.

Integration - The Survival Force
The 20/34: A Driving Force of Survival
Again, that single gate in the way in which it operates, the magic of the 34th gate, it
is just simply empowering the intuition, empowering that ability to be able to suss
out what's going on in the now. It is doing much more than that. It brings its power
to the now. This is the driving force of the inte-
gration being, the 20/34. And you know how
powerful this force is because it is one of the
definitions that exist in the BodyGraph that is in
opposition in the wheel. So, it is very, very
common to see it, people who have it as the
Sun/Earth or people who have it nodally. And
there are also those beings who just have it from
planets, though it's rare. The fact is that the
20/34 is something that is incredibly common. It
is a driving force of survival.
And of course, you can see that the way in which
the not-self lives out manifesting generating, in
other words, the not-self that is suffering from
Manifestor disease and meets more resistance
than anybody else, that the real power and the
glory of the 20/34 has long, long passed. It
might have been very, very impressive a long
time ago, but within the context of the not-self as
the not-self lives today, it‘s really a mess. And
yet, to see it for what its pure essence is: to be able to respond, to be able to re-
spond through awareness in the now. This responding through awareness in the
now is the power that the 34 brings to integration. It‘s its main responsibility, in
that sense.
So, we're looking at two distinct life forces. We‘re looking at the force of pure sur-
vival—stay alert, stay alert, stay alert—because that's what it is, stay alert, stay
alert, ears open, be ready, be aware, anything can happen at any moment. Here we
are on the verge of the Cross of the Unexpected. This is what life is at any moment,
at anytime. This is the power that is inherent in this. And at the moment there's
something, there is anything, then you have this incredible power. This is an incred-
ible power. There really isn't anything like it. It is real powered action.
You can see why pure Manifesting Generators have such an ordeal in shaking the
Manifestor trip because they‘ve been conditioned to think that they have to decide
what to respond to mentally. And then they put their energy to work to what they
think mentally they should be doing. And all they meet is resistance. This is a re-
sponse mechanism. It is a response mechanism to take action in response. It‘s why
it's so important that 20/34s, as part of their life process, there are those beings in
their life who can give them guidance. There are those beings who they can respond
to in which their response is going to enrich their process.

The Connection of the 20/34 to the 43/23
One of the most profound connections of the 20/34 is to the 43/23. And in the clas-
sic sense of seeing the 43/23 as a Projector and seeing the 20/34 as a Generator,
and this idealization of the inherent relationship between a Projector's ability to guide
and recognize and the Generator‘s capacity to respond and through that response to
be able to triumph. It is the essential partnership.
For those of you who know my discussions about Generator/Projector relationship
and how important it is for our future, this is where you get to see the underlying
foundation of that relationship In other words, the need for response to be guided.
After all, it‘s just logical. One has to have something worthy to respond to and it's
only when there's something worthy to respond to that one
can then go into action. That's what makes them so impres-
sive. They can be extraordinarily impressive. If they are
intuitively with awareness empowered to action, that is truly
charismatic. That's where what needs to be done gets to be
done.
Not-self 20/34s are the most pathetic beings one sees. I
only mean that in the sense that to be a Generator and not
use your power correctly means that you can never find
satisfaction and you can never reach your Signature. To be
a Generator and not to be satisfied is a terrible thing. It can
be enormously painful at the Manifesting Generator level
when they're incorrect, enormously painful, the level of fru-
stration. And it's not necessarily frustration with anything
specific, it‘s the deterioration in their system from putting their energy to work for
things that do not deserve that energy in which there is no reward, and the reward is
relative to what this is all about.
The Not-Self 20/34 Constantly Wastes Energy
There is something to understand. Let's think about survival for a moment. We're
no longer in a situation where—at least those of us who are advantaged in this life in
a situation where our survival depends on us being able to go out and to hunt suc-
cessfully in the traditional sense, to be able to defend ourselves against invaders,
and this and that and all of these things—that we don't have to be constantly de-
fending our territory and all this kind of stuff.
And yet, when you take all of this and you put it into the modern context, it‘s just a
change in the language more than anything else. It‘s not even that, as a matter of
fact, just simply the circumstances of being further down on the evolutionary plane.
We all need to survive, we all need it to be able to handle what it takes to live on this
plane, we all need to provide the resources in our life, and we need to defend and
protect ourselves. We teach our children how to cross the street so they know how
to protect themselves. This is all part of what is an essential ingredient in our lives.

LECTURE THREE
Integration - The Survival Force
The fact is that the most disadvantaged beings, and what I mean by that is that
those beings who earn in this life materially far, far less than their potential, that the
greatest examples of those are the 20/34s. As not-self they are constantly wasting
their energy. And because the 34 has this kind of focusing, obsessive, locked-into-
process to it, when they end up being involved in doing something that is truly use-
less or is not important for their survival within the context of the modern world, all
they're doing is taking away valuable energy that could be rewarded elsewhere.
Remember, what we call money is just energy, after all. It is just about energy. You
get paid for your energy; you get paid for the quality of the energy and the results of
the expenditure of the energy. If you're somebody who is gifted with an enormous
power resource, this great life force, this action force, ready to take action, ready to
jump like the predator in the savanna that lies there, is still, still, still, still, still until
there's that moment, a jump because if you don't jump you‘re not going to eat, to
know the timing, to be correct. And here are these 20/34s running around doing
every kind of nonsense you can imagine. Just busy, busy, busy, busy. And not only
is it non-rewarding, it is physically deteriorating.
Action Guided by Awareness
This is not what this energy is for. It‘s action that has to be guided by awareness. It
is action that has to be guided by awareness in response to something. It is not
there to initiate. There is no manifestation here in integration. After all, Manifestors
are not responsible for life on the planet; Generators are. If there is a true source to
what our power is, it is here. It has to do with the genera-
tive force. It has to do with response. It says survival is
response.
It's the Rave New Year, be prepared for the unexpected.
How do you prepare for the unexpected? You know how to
make a decision. It doesn't matter what the circumstance
is, it doesn't matter what happens, and it doesn't matter
where the world is going. It's about how you make a deci-
sion.
This is about survival. You can see that survival isn't about
initiating. Survival is about responding. And it‘s not blind
response. It's aware response. It's measured. Take action
when action is necessary. Take action in response and you
will succeed and you will triumph and you will survive. You don't see lions running
around an empty savanna when there's nothing to hunt. They find a nice tree, lay
down in the shade. They hear everything that's going on.
Oh, we are more sophisticated yes, yes, yes, with our neo-cortex, fancy box. But in
the end the same rules apply. If we are to understand the life forces that emerge
out of this power resource, we have to see that the golden rule for survival on this
planet, on this plane, it is written here in these two empowered zones. This is what

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

it‘s about to be aware, to wait, to take action when action is necessary. That‘s sur-
vival.
The 57/10: Behavior Guided by Awareness
All right, so that‘s what the 34 brings us. Let's look and
see what the 57 brings us. We've already seen the
archetype. But the 57 in integration has another pro-
found relationship and that's to the 10th gate. And of
course, the 10th gate, Treading, treading on the tail of
the tiger, beware; well, it‘s the gate of behavior. It is
not just simply the gate of behavior, because it is a
vessel gate which is the potential to love oneself. And
to love oneself displayed through the quality of one's
behavior. This is not simply behavior in the sense that
one is behaving according to the demands and needs or
the projections of the other.
Remember that in integration we are dealing with something that is deeply selfish
and that the life force is only interested in one thing, survival. This is all about sur-
vival. It is the correct behavior for survival. And again, this is the intuition brought
to this. It is behavior guided by awareness. This we call perfected form, behavior
guided by awareness, and behavior that is guided by awareness in response.
Your behavior is relative to the environment. If you're walking through a jungle full
of dangerous animals, you don't wear bright clothes and carry a boom buster loud
sound system on your shoulder blaring away. You‘re going to die. Behavior isn‘t
something that is set. You learn that in the 10.1. The foundation of behavior is to
know how to behave in different circumstances. It's how you survive.
It's one of those classic images of changes in the nature of warfare where you had all
of these armies in the 18th century that were still following these sort of ritualized
―We‘re all going to stand in line and we‘re all going to sing our songs and we‘re all
going to step at the same time and set up at the same time.‖ And all of a sudden
there were people coming out of the shrubbery and shooting them in the back. They
didn‘t know how to change their behavior to conform to the situation so they died.
Behavior is About Survival
Your behavior is about survival. It's so obvious when you think about it. How is
your behavior going to be able to respond with awareness if it‘s not hooked up? It
has to be hooked up. This is the perfect form. It‘s why the 1st line has a nickname
of the chameleon in the 10, taking on any kind of behavioral mode in order to sur-
vive. Those of us who have the 10th gate or through genetic continuity in terms of
the line functions, we all have a behavior that will suit us, that will allow us to sur-
vive in given situations.

LECTURE THREE
Integration - The Survival Force
It is this variability to find that perfected form that brings love, which brings love into
the appreciation of self. I survived; good for me. How did I do that? Wow, I made
it. So many times in the history of humanity, day after day, millions and millions of
beings have had that experience, the survival rush. And we all know that in the
modern life. By the time you get into your 40s, 50s you suddenly realize that you
actually know how to survive. You finally can be comfortable with it. It brings a
great deal of ease to the consciousness. It‘s what we seek in our lives. We are bio-
forms; we are cursed with that, after all.
For so much of humanity, the dilemmas of the form interfere with any possibility
ever of getting out of its traps, and survival is the key to it. Integration is there in
the BodyGraph because there would be no form without it. Oh, there would be a
form, but it wouldn‘t survive. It doesn't matter whatever the possibilities are of this
form, it's got to stay alive to realize it. We can see that the intuition of the 57th gate,
this deep acoustic potential, this immune system that is listening, that‘s on the alert,
that‘s concerned about its environment, it‘s paying attention to what‘s going on.
That awareness is there basically only to bring one thing about; that is, the exact
behavior necessary to deal with any circumstance.
So if you got to run, run. And if you have to hide, hide. It doesn't matter what the
face of it looks like. It doesn't matter what the role projection of it happens to be. It
is about the awareness to know how to behave in any given circumstance. This is
survival in the world. The longer we survive, the greater the possibility of what is
possible for us. In the nine-centered vehicle with the extended lifespan, with a mid-
life in the 40s, with a flowering in the 50s and beyond, you better know how to sur-
vive.
If you don't have the correct behavior, you're going to stand out. It's not going to
work. You‘re not going to love yourself. This is at the core of our nature. So many
human beings suffer in the world, particularly on the material plane, because they
don't know how to survive. What that comes down to is that they don't know how to
make a decision. It isn't anything else. No matter how profound this knowledge is,
no matter how deep you can go, it still begins with the same mechanical premise.
Everything about this integration, if you take it as the way it‘s illustrated, because
again remember that some people have it, some people don‘t, some people have this
part, that part, the other part; it‘s quite complex. But you‘re taking the example of
the full integration. You get to see clearly what survival is about. You get to see it
clearly. We are here to have the right behavior in response to any circumstance in
the now. We are empowered with awareness to adjust that behavior to any circums-
tance in the now. It is our gift.
So we have this incredible empowering force, self-empowerment of the 34 to bring
out the archetype, to bring us the potential of taking correct action when action is
necessary. We have the awareness that gives the power its quality, its effectiveness
and the awareness that guides our behavior. So we know how to act in any given
circumstance.

The 20/10: I Am
And then we have the final ingredient. We have the 20, and the 20th gate in its rela-
tionship to the 10th gate, and as we've seen its relationship to the 34, this taking of
action when action is necessary, action in response. But the 10, this behavior has a
very, very different expression between what it means to be guided by awareness to
have the correct behavior for a circumstance and how that
behavior is ultimately expressed in the now as ―I am.‖ If the
10/20 represents anything, because it has one of those
names we find very attractive, awakening—always remember
that Human Design is a duality, it is a dualistic system, that
the gate of power can be the gate of powerlessness, that the
gate of charisma can be the gate of sheer boredom, whatev-
er, perfected form can be imperfect form—awakening can be
fast asleep.
The 20th gate is the ―I am‖ gate. It is the true and only ―I
am‖ gate. It‘s what the 20th gate is all about. First of all, it's a gate in the Throat.
Obviously, it is a gate that standing on its own has the potential to articulate, has a
potential to express in language. And any of you in your educational process know
that this ―I am‖ of the 20 becomes many things, in a sense dependent on the way in
which it is connected and the way it is connected particularly in integration.
But this ―I am busy now, I am busy doing something for myself now, I know what I
am busy about for myself,‖ all these ―I am, I am.‖ But the thing to get is the ―I am.‖
It's not about anyone else. It is about this incredible survival: I am. It‘s all we
have. We don't have anything else, we only have our ―I am.‖
There is either ―I am depressed‖ and ―I am messed up‖ and ―I am unhappy‖ and ―I
am bitter and disappointed and frustrated and angry,‖ and ―I am this and I am that.‖
The not-self laments that I'm not good enough and I am not fast enough and smart
enough, and this and that. Here it is a pure essence of it.
In its correctness, because that is what it's about, when this power of intuition
guides the behavior in the now correctly through response, then you get to see the
―I am.‖ It's not a statement that has an answer, naturally. In other words, it's not
―I am this‖ or ―I am that.‖ It is an ―I am‖ waiting for circumstance. It‘s an ―I am‖
waiting to express itself in the moment. It's not the same ―I am‖ a moment later,
necessarily. And it is only that ―I am‖ of the moment that is the essence of the be-
ing.
It's the teachings of the Baba Ram Dass—I am here now—all of these deeply exis-
tential philosophical blah, blah, blah. By the way, it‘s not for everybody to be in the
now. It‘s what we get to see in the complexity of Design. After all, we‘re looking at
an infrastructure here. Not everybody has it. Not everybody is focused specifically
in this area. And so many of the survivors are keeping the non-survivors alive, be-
cause all of the other circuitry organizes us into support and sharing mechanisms
that‘s totally alien to integration. In that way we balance it out. In the same way

Integration - The Survival Force
that Socialism tries to balance out the cruelties of capitalism to make sure that those
who can't quite make it are looked after.
Security Comes From Making Correct Decisions
But all that‘s different from what this is. This is about only being able to recognize
who you are, not by what you think, not what you imagine, not by what the history
is or the future is, but it is how you function in the now. It is not important to me
whether that functioning in the now is rooted in any kind of existential awareness. It
doesn't have to be, because we have a key. We can bring anyone the benefits of
these survival life forces by bringing them their Strategy and Authority because
that's actually what you‘re getting.
Your ability to make decisions correctly is going to provide you with the security you
need in this life. It just will. It is the grace that comes to those who are not en-
dowed with such a thing, who are not here to be existential, who are here to be lost
in the future or the past. Or like most human beings have a little bit of everything.
The survival of the nine-centered being isn't based in this. Do not romanticize this
and take it out of context, folks. It's old. It is the continuity from our genetic
mammalian past. It‘s old. It is not the be-all and the end-all. It was once because
survival was the number one thing.
It means that in order for anyone to be able to gain the benefits of this resource, all
they have to do is follow their Authority, their Inner Authority. This awakening, be-
cause is it such an interesting concept, this force, this behavior expressed as a voice,
because primarily that's what it is. That voice, this ―I am‖ voice speaking from its
own source. Everything about the trajectory of anybody who enters into the correct-
ness of life is that ultimately we are here to see ourselves, to see who it is. For most
beings it's difficult. It is the role of the passenger consciousness, what lies behind
the veil of our mind. It is the role of the passenger consciousness to be a witness of
the life, to be a witness of what that ―I am‖ experience is.
However it views it, it doesn't matter. Whether it views it existentially or otherwise
is not the point. But everything about being correct is about realizing what your
true, differentiated, uniqueness on this plane is. It is the ultimate expression of ―I
am-ness,‖ because remember the primitiveness of this 20. It is really only saying
one thing. I say it myself. I am a survivor. That's my ―I am.‖ I learned that from
my survival of my encounter. I‘m an integration survivor. This is my ―I am.‖ I sur-
vived.
This is what that ―I am‖ is always there to state. I am alive. I have survived, here I
am. That's very primitive. It has its own aesthetics, I well know, but I want you to
see it in context. This is not about we survived, it's not about I survived and let me
tell you how I did it; it isn‘t about any of that. It‘s deeply, deeply, deeply selfish.
This is the perfection of the underlying power of what it is to be a bio-form. All of
the basic forms we look at on this plane all operate out of this imperative. And in
the end of the day or in the beginning of the morning, whether it is the birds that are

singing or it is the animals that are making their noises, each day as that sun rises,
they all express this one essential life force. I am, I am here, I am alive.
It‘s not like that is a cognitive, intellectual process for most species; it is not. But it's
there deep inside of them, what integration brings to us. What this archetype, at the
very basis of it, brings to us is that our power lies in our ability to be aware in re-
sponse to the circumstances of life. It‘s why Strategy and Authority is so important,
and it is the integration for humanity, in that sense. It's an upgrade, if you will. It's
a way of surviving while bypassing the most deeply selfish and self-absorbed survival
processes. It's a way in which the collective and the tribe can survive. And survive
not in the sense of the not-self survival, but survive in the sense of transcendent
survival, to go beyond it.
After all, think about integration. Integration says if you get this right then all the
other stuff is possible, and it's so true. It's just the way it is. It‘s something to un-
derstand. If your parents were good at survival and you were advantaged because
you have an education and good food and whatever the case may be, you imme-
diately have benefited from it. We know that. This is what this whole survival game
is about. It's only those who are skilled at survival that ultimately lay the foundation
for the possibilities of what go beyond survival. It‘s the great lesson that comes to
integration when they meet at 28/38 [blue line below], because the 20 says ―I am; I
survived,‖ and 28 says to them, ―Is that all what‘s life about? Is there nothing else?
Is it just for survival? Isn‘t there something more?‖
It‘s the magic of the 28/38, the same magic you see on the other side, the 39/55.
There is more to life than just
the surface. There is more to

life than just survival; if there

umph. But it's only an aspect of our nature. There is so much more to what it is to
be us, particularly to what it is to be us as a nine-centered being. But yeah, we can't
have all of that if we hadn't had this.

LECTURE THREE
Integration - The Survival Force
So when you're looking at designs, when you see integration in somebody, and par-
ticularly when you see it and it's not offset by a lot of collective or tribal activations
or definitions, you have to understand how difficult it is for these beings. They‘re so
locked in as not-self, so locked into the survival that they have cut themselves off
from a real life. We have the great panacea, the great cure for anyone with any
configuration. It doesn't matter. It's just Strategy and Authority.
As long as you can honor your own Authority, you‘ll see that survivability is not what
it's about for you, that no longer is that something that has to burden you, that
there's something else, much more, in that sense. The possibility of what it is for
you ultimately to express what your true ―I am‖ is. And not so much in the expres-
sion of it, but in your ability as a passenger to be able to see it emerge, who you are,
the mythology of your uniqueness, living out your cross, your profile, your design,
your perfection. Only then is it possible to see who that being truly is.
I hope you enjoyed that. It‘s always fun to go back and look at things. But, any-
way, to all of you, you take care and again I wish you all well in the new cycle. And
until next time, bye for now.

The Forces of Expressed Identity
The Relationship Between the Throat and the G Center
Good morning to all of you this morning. We come to one of those very, very special
areas and it is this relationship that exists between the G Center and the Throat.
Before I can begin to really even talk about it in terms of the forces that are inherent
in it, it‘s really to understand something about what these channels really represent
because they are not simply a construct within the design of what it is to be a human
but they're also part of the design of Penta. For those of you who don't know Penta,
it‘s a trans-auric form and a Penta emerges aurically the moment you have three
people, four people or five people together within auric contact.
The Penta is really the driving force on the material plane. It is the great organizing
force. We are all born into Pentas. We tend to spend our lives either creating our
own family Pentas or working in Pentas. It is very much a part of the way in which
we are organized on this plane to be able to maintain our viability. So, these par-
ticular channels have a transcendent value that goes simply far beyond what it
means within a single human being.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

The Driving Force Has Three Possibilities
The best way to really begin to understand it is to have a sense of these three gates
in the G Center. As a matter of fact, the best way of seeing that would be including
the 2 as well, because what we're looking at in this is the
Cross of the Sphinx, the great directional cross. Within this
configuration, the 1, 7, and the 13, are role gates. These
are roles of the identity. And of course, the 2nd gate, which
mystically is the driver and the place where the vision and
direction is established. You can sort of see it as a trident.
That is, there is this direction that is established out of the
relationship between the 2 and the 14, The Keeper of the
Keys, a force we will look at next week. In this driving force
you can see that it forks out into these three different pos-
sibilities. That is, the direction has three possibilities.
Those possibilities get expressed through the logic on one
side and the abstract on the other side and the individual in
the center. And of course, this is the three different ways;
if you were imagining this as an illustration of driving on a
highway, basically what you're looking at is the logic is
always looking ahead, it‘s looking out the front window, it's
looking towards the horizon. Whereas, the abstract is
always looking in the rearview mirror, it‘s always seeing
what was left behind. The real dilemma, and you don't want to drive with these
people too often, is the individual because sometimes they‘re not paying attention
at all, because sometimes they just suddenly
just go right off the road and head into new The Forces of Expressed Identity
territory.
The Role Model
So, what we're looking at is both a directional Individual

now, but more than that we are looking at
specific roles. And of course, the whole ex-
pression of this, the G Center to the Throat in
terms of the language within Penta, these
channels represent models. And you can see
that in the expression of the individual aspect
that is actually referred to as a role model.
They can all be referred to as a model.
Again, really grasp that this is something that transcends, as a force, more than just
the individual process. These are models that are designed to have impact, to influ-
ence, and to affect those who are aligned to the frequency. Again, if we looked at it
just simply through circuitry, what we're looking at here is the role expression of the
three largest circuits; that is, the logic, abstract, and individuality.

The Forces of Expressed Identity
Tribal Circuitry
By the way, the tribe—as you can see, it's an interesting illustration because I‘m
always interested in symmetries, if you look at the BodyGraph as a whole it's clear
that these three channels are running up the center of everything. And you imme-
diately have the illusion that it is running through the center of all the Centers, as
you see it here where, symmetrically, it is centered
in the center, in the G Center itself.
But of course, you‘ll notice here in the Throat Cen-
ter, which has an unusual configuration, that there
is this gap over here filled in by the 45th gate, the
45th gate being the tribal expression going down to
the Ego. And so what is also interesting to under-
stand in terms of just adding basic depth to your
understanding of circuitry is that the main cir-
cuits—logic, abstract, the collective circuits and
individuality—that they have an identity expres-
sion.
That expression is a model for everyone else; whe-
reas in the tribe there is no identity expression at
all. As a matter of fact, the only expression is an expression of the will, which is
quite a different thing. So it's just something interesting about the nature of the
tribe and how different the tribal circuitry is in the way in which it functions and ex-
presses itself than the rest of the main circuits.
The Construct of the World is Rooted Here
After all, the basic world, our construct of the world is rooted here. And the way in
which we are going to operate in this world is rooted here. This is where the deepest
influencing, we could call it conditioning or homogenizing, because in a sense these
are very much homogenizing processes. They are giving a life force to the circuit
itself as an expression. And again, when I say it is an expression, obviously the
expression is fundamentally verbal. We‘re dealing with a direct connection between
the G Center and the Throat, so we have the verbal expression of identity. And in
this verbal expression of identity, you have the standard being established for what
the purpose, in the end, is of that circuit.
When you see this within Penta, you realize that each of these models represent a
way in which we operate successfully relative to all the other forces on the planet,
how we operate successfully in terms of the way in which we put ourselves forward.
In other words, the way we express ourselves, the place that we‘re coming from in
that expression. So when we're dealing with these forces, we‘re dealing with some-
thing that is very special.

The Logic Side
Let's begin over here on the logic side. First of all, when you‘re dealing with the
collective you're dealing with a fundamental keynote which is: to share. It makes
the collective as different from
everything else in the circuitry as The Forces of Expressed Identity
can be. When you think about the
social nature of humanity, where
does that social nature come
The Role Model
from? We are a gregarious spe-
Individual
cie; we are able to come together
The Alpha The Prodigal
in huge, huge numbers.
Logic Abstract
When you think about the social
nature of humanity, the first thing
to notice is in individuality, almost
all of the BodyGraph, the majori-
ty, there's a huge amount of acti-
vations in the BodyGraph that are
specifically individual in their na-
ture—the integration channels,
the individual circuit, the center-
ing circuit. Yet, out of all of that
there is only one channel, the
12/22, that is social. We think about this tribe, and we think about the tribe being
fundamentally social and yet the tribe has two specific social channels: the 59/6,
which is The Channel of Intimacy and the 40/37, The Channel of the Community, the
channel of the bargain. The fact is that both the tribe
and individuality are deeply limited in their social po-
tential. And obviously individuality is the most limited
in its social potential.
Only Social
Individual And then you come to the collective, that is, the logic
Channel and the abstract. Every single channel is social, every
single gate is social [see the image of collective cir-
cuits on the next page.] It is one of the things to
understand why the collective is the collective. This is
the foundation of being able to bring human beings
together. After all, the tribe isn't necessarily going to
be friendly to the tribe in the next valley. Individuals
Channel of
Community in and of themselves operate pretty much within an
aloneness. The reality is that the way in which we
understand humanity being social is rooted in the
collective; it is the collective that binds the world to-
Channel of
Intimacy gether, that gives us, in fact, the modern world that
we have.

The Forces of Expressed Identity
So it is the sharing that is something really to rec-
ognize about any collective aspect. In other words,
that it's not intended to function alone. So for ex-
ample, if you have the 16/48 which is the Channel
of Talent, which is logical, which is collective, the
talent is something that has to be shared. There is Channel of
Talent
no point being gifted at something and being a
painter, for example, and never showing anyone
your paintings. That's not being a painter. It‘s like
the tree in forest and it falls and there‘s nobody
there to hear it. It is one of the things to under-
stand about the collective that it survives through
sharing. This is something ready to grasp. It can
make the collective very uncomfortable because
they are often ready to share things that nobody
else really wants to have anything to do with. But
nonetheless, that is their imperative; they must
share.
The 31/7: The Alpha
So first of all, when we‘re dealing with 31/7 we are dealing with the 7th gate which is
the identity gate, which is the role gate. These role gates are
very important. Normally in looking at any life force, you really
focus just simply on the expression, in this case The Alpha.
And yet, to really grasp The Alpha, you have to understand its
role. This is an identity role. And it means that the collective is
here to be the leader. That's all it means.
The 7th gate is a role gate and it's the role
gate of the various kinds of leadership,
whether you're going to be an authorita-
rian or a democrat or an anarchist, all the
variations that are there. But basically it
is something to understand about the way
in which we are designed.
The most significant life force of all, and again we will look at
the tantric forces, the 15/5, next week. The 15/5, of course, is
the Channel of Rhythm. It‘s the channel of being in the flow.
And this channel of being in the flow is one of those channels
that you find everywhere. It is a part of life on this planet. It is
in all the various forms and it represents the basic pattern of
life. It is the design of the single cell, as an example, the defini-
tion possibility of a single cell. And it means that life on this
planet is fundamentally logical.

The Patterns of Life
This is the first thing to really understand about the importance of collective logic.
Collective logic forms the basis upon which life is established on this planet. It is
these patterns, these rhythms, it is the cellular pattern mul-
tiplied and multiplied and morphed and so forth and so on.
Ultimately what you're getting is that we live in this incredibly
patterned world. Human Design gives you an extraordinary
perspective into the nature of the pattern just by being able
to watch the way in which the program impacts us, to be able
to see the way in which we are caught up in a pattern sys-
tem.
Channel of
Rhythm
Now, the thing that makes the pattern so important is that as
a bio-form, we are always vulnerable. We all know that; our
bodies are fragile. Life is not something that is guaranteed to
be long and guaranteed to be healthy. And the vast majority
of human beings really suffer on the physical plane. Life is
full of threats. And those threats vary, obviously depending
on where you are in the various levels and strata of life on
this plane. But the fact of the matter is that we are funda-
mentally insecure as a species. All species are insecure.
They want to survive and they want to be able to maintain their control over their
territory, and have the resources that they need, and so forth and so on.
What we rely on is patterns that work, because we can trust them and we don't have
to be insecure. We are always reminded of this in our modern lives, the way in
which we can be assured by the pattern that things are going to be reliable and con-
sistent. You come here this morning expecting me to be here and teach. This is
part of the collective logic process. And the fact that that expectation is met doesn't
mean that you‘re consciously making a big deal out of it; it simply maintains this
sense that we can trust the pattern.
All of us who deal with democratic societies, so-called, we‘re always dealing with
examinations of the pattern, criticisms of the pattern, promises of
introducing new patterns that are going to protect us as we move
into the future. And the thing to see in this is that when you take
this role that is given to logic, that logic is to be the leader [gate
7.] When we look at the other end of it, obviously this is some-
thing that is intended to bring influence [gate 31.] This is what
this is all about. This is intended to bring influence. And so it is
the role of logic to guide humanity into the future.
The irony of all this is that these are the only people we trust to
lead us into the future. And of course, they're not necessarily
correct. The fact that you can establish a pattern, which is done in
science all the time, that you postulate a specific pattern, doesn't
mean that it's the truth. It doesn't mean that it's anything other than a pattern.
The thing to recognize about logic is that it has a lot of power, because logic can

The Forces of Expressed Identity
make you very uncomfortable because the moment a logical person is saying there's
something wrong with the pattern—and of course they have to share that, that‘s why
we have in the logic system the two most deeply critical and confrontational forces,
that is, the 17/62 with its very, very powerful opinions and details, and of course the
18/58 with this vitality to be able to challenge the patterns.
The thing to understand about the whole pattern system is that at the same time we
trust the pattern, that we want to trust the pattern to lead us safely into the future,
we‘re still not sure. It started way back in the 63rd gate in the logic system, the
pressure of doubt [in the Head Center.] It‘s the question that kids will ask when
they do mathematics and they have to redo a formula that has been proven a million
times a year for a hundred years. This is the way that logic works, because at any
moment the whole thing could break down. We‘ll get there, but the whole thing
could break down.
The Alpha is a Force of Identity, Not a Motor
So, the role of logic, this role of The Alpha, is a model. And because this is a model
it gives all logical activations this quality of ―I know where we should be going,‖ or ―I
think I understand in the right language where we should be going.‖ And of course,
logic, because it is inherently influential, because we are insecure and we need a
secure future, the comments of logic really impact us. When you're looking at ruler-
ship, the role of those who lead us, the 31/7 is this classic, modern, democratic
leader. And I say ―democratic‖ because the 31/7, in and of itself, is not a motor.
There is no motor here. This is not a life force that carries motor energy with it.
This is a force of identity.
And of course, as a force of identity, if you think of it as a projected element, it de-
mands recognition. We know something about the nature of the Throat Center. The
Throat Center is a center that is always seeking identity. It is always seeking atten-
tion, attention to its identity. This is the whole thing about the Throat, ―Look at me,
look at me, look at me.‖ This is the Throat. You‘ve got an open Throat and you
have somebody always, in one way or another, saying, ―Look at me, look at me, look
at me.‖
Logical Gates: A Presumption of Influence
So, one of the things to grasp here is that these roles, these models that we‘re look-
ing at, they in and of themselves don't necessarily have any real power. What they
have is a capacity to express a role identity and impact others or influence them or
affect them. And it is only with that support that they really get to live out their
power. After all, they are an expression.
So the moment you're looking at any logical gate, you‘re always looking at a pre-
sumption of influence. It's a presumption of influence, because it's inherent in logic.
It's inherent to carry The Alpha quality. The other thing is that the moment you're

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
dealing exclusively with the impact of The Alpha is the moment you become overly
concerned about the future. That is the risk, being so concerned about the future
that you have no life in the present.
Think about this in the context of what it means on the material plane. Again, these
are roles that are there to, in this logic sense, be able to deeply, deeply influence us,
and to influence us to take a specific direction. Remember, this is the Sphinx. So
this is The Alpha's direction. The Alpha says, ―This is the way to go,‖ and it means
that every logical gate carries within it this quality. This quality of ―this is the way to
go.‖ And because it is shared, because that is the inherent quality of it, and because
logic is argumentative, understand that; it is deeply argumentative. Now, that
doesn‘t necessarily have to be a bad word. That is, argument can be also expressed
as discussion, however we want to put it. I don‘t want that to have just a negative
patina to it.
But it is something to understand about what happens to logic. The moment logic
says, ―This is the way,‖ somebody logical says, ―Are you sure?‖ There is nothing
sadder than a king without his people, if you know what I mean. The Alpha is noth-
ing without its ability to be able to influence the other, which means that The Alpha
in its understanding of the pattern cannot simply benefit from the pattern alone; it's
pointless.
In order for them to be able to fulfill what is their role they need to get others to
follow the pattern. And in order to do that they're going to have to deal with the
basic thematic of logic, which is to debate. You see that in the buildup to political
elections in democracies where you have this debating that takes place. This is clas-
sic logic, two Alphas trying to influence you in terms of which one will provide you
with a better future. That's basically what it is. And we accept the argumentation,
in that sense, the debating that is a part of the process.
In any kind of understanding of this role it is really leading you to appreciate some-
thing that logic brings to us that is very profound. It brings an insistence on our
ability to be able to express ourselves and to be able to express ourselves well to the
other. When you're looking at the logic system, because of the 62nd gate, you see
that within logic in order to be able to express the diversity of patterns that lan-
guage, words, had to be added. That language had to be expanded, vocabulary had
to be expanded in order to be able to express all the possibilities of the pattern.
It's one of the great gifts that we have as beings. And it is something to see very
clearly about what The Alpha brings is that the assumption with an Alpha, because
the word has many meanings, the assumption about The Alpha is that this is, like
the 1st line of the 7, just a pure authoritarian force, but it's not. It's really isn't. And
its ability to be effective as an Alpha is going to be conditioned on its verbal ability to
be able to influence others. And that verbal ability to be able to influence means it
has to be able to defend its pattern positions. And of course, with this comes the
development of logical linguistic skills, skills for debate, skills for argumentation, and
skills for presenting your positions, on and on and on and on and on. But what we‘re
getting out of that is something very special. Logic brings us a tremendous advan-
tage in the development of our communicative skills.

LECTURE FOUR
The Forces of Expressed Identity
It's also inherently democratic, if I can put it that way. I mean that is inherently
democratic in the sense that logic is always designed to be challenged. And so it
means that no force in logic is a force that is divine, a force that can simply make a
statement and that‘s it. Only in the tribe is that possible, because again the tribe
isn't connected with an identity. It‘s connected with the will, a common will. With a
common will one can be deeply, deeply dictatorial. But The Alpha is not like that.
Again, it is rooting in the sharing and the deep, critical function that is there.
The Abstract Side
Let's move to the other side, the abstract process. The moment you're looking at
logic, you're looking at these patterns, these constructs. You‘re looking at the
movement of the pattern to the future and security and all that. And then you go
over to the abstract and you see that it is only interested in one thing and one thing
only: living this life. Not thinking about how you can live it. Logic says: one day
we‘re going to have houses that float in the air. Logic with all of its fantasy and its
stories about what is going to be possible and what the patterns are going to lead to,
and on and on and on. And the abstract says: I just want to have an experience
now. I want to be involved in life. I want to be somebody who's alive. I want take
the best out of what life can offer, and so forth and so on.
33/13 The Prodigal
So, it's very, very different. It is
The Forces of Expressed Identity
also deeply social, because The
Prodigal does something that The
Alpha would never do. The Alpha
The Role Model
says here's the pattern, follow the
Individual
pattern. The Prodigal says, ―I don't
The Alpha The Prodigal
know what's going to happen, but
let's do it.‖ This is very different. Logic Abstract
It is all about that possibility of
something, the experiencing of it,
feeling it, taking it in as a process.
After all, when we look at the hu-
man experiential way, at least in
the way in which it is understood in
Design, the human experiential way
is an abstract process from the 41
to the 30, the 36 to 35. The whole
basis of human life is rooted in its
experience.
We know the story of The Prodigal. The Prodigal child is taken from the Old Testa-
ment Biblical story of the prodigal Child that leaves home and goes out into the world

and lives the life and breaks with the patterns of the family, of the tribe, of the col-
lective of its early years. Goes out into the world and visits strange places and so
forth and so on and eventually comes back and tells the story. This is history. It is
perhaps the most profound thing about us, in a way, is that experience is never lost.
You can see that to the extreme now with tens of millions of people blogging; every
kind of experience is recorded and available for others to share.
When you think about mammals, and you think about what happens when a new
generation is born, that the learning that can be passed on, the knowledge that can
be passed on by the older generation is incredibly limited. It is limited to the priori-
ties of their kind and their environment and their game and whatever it may be, but
it‘s very limited. From generation to generation there is absolutely no change in the
way, over all, the species going to function. It is what makes us so incredible and
again, it goes back to understanding that this is all about the Throat. It is about our
capacity to be able to communicate to each other.
The thing to recognize about the collective is that it guarantees our collective intelli-
gence, our collective consciousness, our collective awareness, because experience
and possibility are things that are constantly being shared. So, when we‘re dealing
with the abstract side, we‘re dealing with the way in which humanity grows exponen-
tially, generation after generation, through the sharing of experience. This is what
this force is all about. And it's not simply that the abstract is here to go out into the
world and meet the challenges of this plane. It's more than that; it‘s that they have
a responsibility to share it.
It is the beauty of the 13th gate. It has this wonderful name, The Fellowship of Man,
mankind or womankind, or people-kind, whatever it is. But I like what its real name
is; it‘s the gate of secrets. It is the role of being open to the
other, being ready to share with the other. But the secrets
are here. And what I mean by that is I'm not trying to be
mysterious with that word. Think about what happens to the
mammal. A mammal gets cut off from the rest of the herd,
let's say and it gets lost in some little nook or cranny some-
where. It is hungry. It sees something and it smells it and
it licks it and it‘s desperate so it eats it and it's terrific. The
fact is that that herd is going to move on. And when that
one gets back to it, if it's lucky enough to get back to it,
unless it is the oldest or the leading male that is going to be
moving that group, there is no way that it's going to come
back and say, ―Hey, I found this incredible place and it's got
this great food there that I‘ve never seen before and wow,
we should go over there.‖ It doesn't happen.
This is the thing about the secrets. When you live life, you learn so many things.
We all know that. This is a part of the mythology of the parent telling the child, ―I've
been there, done that,‖ because that's the language of the abstract—I've been there,
I've done that, let me tell you about it. Don‘t think it's this or that, I'll tell you what
it was because I‘ve been there and I‘ve had that experience.

LECTURE FOUR
The Forces of Expressed Identity
This is enormously profound because this collecting of experience, you can see that
in our most ancient tribes. After all, the larynx dropped; that great mutation in the
Throat that led to our ability to articulate about 85 to 90,000 years ago. So, we
have a very, very old tradition of the oral transmission of knowledge, the tribal sto-
ryteller who would keep generations and generations and generations of stories
available so that each new generation could benefit from its history. And in benefit-
ing from its history and having the ability to be able to have so much information to
start with, again there is this mutation in terms of its capacity to add to the possibili-
ty of the next generation.
Nothing is more evolutionary, in a way, than this process of The Prodigal, the roll of
this expression of the abstract, because after all, when we get to the 33rd gate,
which is gate of retreat, it‘s a voice that says ―I remember,‖ or not, by the way. This
remembrance which can at a mystical level be revelation, this is the ability to really
be able to express everything that has taken place in the experience.
It is why we have—if you think about the arts, as an example, particularly the writ-
ten arts, this is all prodigal work. That‘s what it is. It's all prodigal work. So much
of what we read, so much of what humanity reads is the retelling of experience. It‘s
the newspaper, it‘s memoirs and biographies, and it goes on and on and on and on
and on. It‘s simply just descriptions of things. It‘s the Web. It is all this vast, vast,
vast experiential knowledge that has been stored. It gives us incredible advantages.
As a matter of fact, we have reached a point; you can really tell that we're in a very
strange place. And when you think about it, when you were a child 60,000 years
ago and you listened to the storyteller, you basically could take in what they knew
and that was the knowledge of the world, after all. And they would add whatever
they could add in their own life. We‘re now in a situation where it is just simply not
possible. It is not possible to take in the story of the world anymore. It is not even
remotely possible. There is so much information you can access that it is absolutely
mind-boggling, in that sense.
So, we've reached a point in which The Prodigal system has reached its point of—
there's no other place for it to go. In that sense it's far beyond the ability of any
single being to take advantage of it. It's the same way with The Alpha, by the way.
That is, the determination to secure the patterns of the future have led to so many
branches of science that the average human being is incredibly limited. Most people
don't know why their cars work or why the lights come on in their house. They don‘t
know how all works. They have no idea.
It‘s interesting just to see where these processes have taken us because they‘re far
removed from what their original value was. One of the most interesting things to
think about in terms of evolutionary process is that mechanisms that were there for
us at a certain point in our development that served that purpose, all these tens of
thousands of years later, because of this very facility, we've actually gone to a point
where it has lead to what it started with.
That is, that when we meet logic now there is always some part of us that is filled
with doubt. And when we meet the abstract some part of us is always filled with

confusion. In other words, there is just so much out there that it's confusing to fig-
ure out what you need to know in this life. You all know that story. And there are
so many patterns that will tell you exactly the opposite thing that you don't really
know what to trust anymore.
It‘s just interesting to see. For me this is a prana. We‘re at the closing of a cycle
and near the closing of an epoch. We are really at a point of deep transitioning in
which we are moving away from our human fertility and moving towards something
else. We are in decline as a species, even though we are, at this moment, where the
power of our communicative impact and influence has never been greater. And yet,
it's full of doubt and confusion.
Individuality Changes the Game
There is always a spanner in the works. There's always something that throws
things off, there is always something that gets in the way that can make things diffi-
cult. And of course, that's individuality. Over here we‘ve got that Alpha with its
patterns and I'm going to look after you. Here we have The Prodigal and I've been
there and I've not done that, let me tell you what it is like. And these two live in
Solomon‘s World—nothing new under the sun. This is the world. And The Alpha
tries to make sure that it understands it as best as possible, and The Prodigal tries to
live in it as best as possible, but it's their world. And then there's mutation, and
mutation always changes everything. It changes the game.
8/1 The Role Model
So, what we're dealing with here with the 8/1 is a role of unique expression. And
unique expression that is doing the best that it
can to get your attention and change your The Forces of Expressed Identity
perspective on the nature of the world. This is
the 8th gate and its voice says, ―I know I can The Role Model
Individual
make a contribution, I know that I can make a
The Alpha The Prodigal
contribution, I know that there is this way.‖ Logic Abstract
And of course, that 8th gate is going to stand up
and it's going to say to you: follow me.
Many years ago I was first trying to layout
channel knowledge, a longtime time ago. I
used to tell a story about plane crash. You
have a plane that takes off, oh let's say some-
where in Miami and it has engine failure and it
manages to make a crash landing in a swamp.
Everybody survives, it‘s a nice story. Everybody survives, but there are minor inju-
ries and they‘re lost and they‘re in the middle of the swamp and there are alligators
and mosquitoes. And here we have these forces that are here to express the role.

The Forces of Expressed Identity
So, the first one, of course, is The Alpha, it's the first one. And The Alpha says,
―Well, I was looking out the window and I saw that the plane took a strange angle.
And I was very curious about that
The Forces of Expressed Identity and I took a look on my map and
it seemed to me that something
was wrong,‖ and so forth and so
on. There's The Alpha saying, ―I
The Role Model
think that we actually flew for
Individual
about 17 minutes and we landed
The Alpha The Prodigal
north northwest of where we took
Logic Abstract
off, so, if we turn around in this
direction, we‘ll all safely be able to
go back home.‖ That‘s The Alpha.
The Prodigal is just experiential.
It's just experiential. So every-
thing for The Prodigal is based on
past experience. So, any one of
those passengers who have been
lost before, Boy Scouts, Girl
Scouts or whatever the case may
be, out they get with, ―All right,
this is what we have to do. We need a glass of water and let‘s just head off and
away we go; we‘ll survive.‖
And then of course, there's the 8/1. And it says, ―I know how to get out of here,‖
and it doesn't give you any reason. It doesn't do an Alpha logic. It doesn't do The
Prodigal ―Well, I‘ve been in these situations before and I know how to handle things.‖
No, no, the 8/1 just says, ―I how to get out of there.‖
And because they cannot explain—well, The Alpha looks at them and says ―Well, how
do you know how to get out of here.‖ The 8 says, ―I have a feeling, I‘ve got a
hunch, I got an intuition,‖ whatever the case may be. The Alpha looks at that and
says to the people there, ―He doesn‘t know what he‘s talking about. He‘s going to
get lost out there and is going to get eaten by alligators. The future is frightening.
And The Prodigal says, ―Look, look, I know how to handle these things, I've been in
these situations before.‖ So, the 8 tries one more time, ―I really do know.‖ And
then they turn around and they leave. They‘re a Role Model. They‘re an example.
They‘re not going to follow The Alpha and they‘re not going to follow The Prodigal.
They're going to go their way.
In that situation, the only person I would trust to get me out of there is the 8/1. It‘s
the only one I would trust. So, you either follow them or not, because they will not,
like The Alpha or The Prodigal, try to convince you, because after all, these are so-
cial, they are sharing, they‘re communicative. They‘re going to give you all the rea-
sons and they‘re going to give you all the explanations. And The Prodigal is going to
give you an education on snakebites and how to avoid alligators and how to find your

way in the forest. They‘ve done all those things before. They‘re all going to go
through these long explanations.
Remember that all of them are trying to be the model. It‘s a classic situation be-
cause all of them are being driven to be that model. Remember that these models,
whether they are collective or individual, these models are there to guarantee the
survival of the group. That's what they're all about. They‘re there to be able to
master the material plane. And so in this situation, what you get is that competition.
You‘ve seen those things. You have movies like that, these disaster movies. You get
these kinds of things played out.
The dilemma for the Role Model, the dilemma for the individual, is that they are not
social so they don't have this capacity to be able to reach out in the social sense, nor
do they have the same linguistic direction because they're not designed to share. In
fact they are designed to empower and not be influenced. They don't go through
discussions. Their thing is: I know. I just know; I know, I know, I know, and that‘s
all they can give you. And of course, it‘s their deep limitation, because this is what
makes it so difficult for them to be able to have their impact, to be able to empower
in that situation.
If those three forces in that situation, one after the other, stand up in front of the
group and make their presentation, you‘re going to have a whole bunch of them that
will follow The Alpha and you'll have another whole bunch of them that will follow
The Prodigal and you'll have a couple, just a few of them, that will follow that Role
Model, because this is the way it works.
The Individual Brings Mutation
It's only when the individual Role Model actually establishes the viability of their
knowing that ultimately that can become something that will influence the collective,
and only secondarily. The collective will just have to accept it; it will have to accept
whatever the results are. Remember that the individual brings mutation; mutation
changes the rules. The Role Model changes the rules. The collective wants to tell
you why. It wants to get your vote. I don‘t want to get your vote; I just want to
make my contribution. That‘s very different. I'm forced in this situation; I‘m going
to make my contribution. I know how to get out of here. You either follow me or
not, the hell with you.
Obviously, they don't get a lot in the majority that goes with them until they estab-
lish the viability. If The Role Model leaves with a couple of people and a day later
the rescuers come because The Role Model sent them and told them how to find the
plane, then everybody there is sort of—aha. And it‘s only then that it is respected.
And it's only afterwards The Prodigal will go up to The Role Model and say, ―Which
way did you go? How did you know which way to go? And try to figure out what it is
in order to make it part of the story. And by the way, that Prodigal will love to tell
that story. They will make it part of the collective. This is the way in which mutation
gets incorporated into the collective and stops being isolated and begins to transform

The Forces of Expressed Identity
the way in which the collective is going to look at things, both from the logic side and
the abstract side.
Honest Communication
It's thinking about words and language. We tend to be incredibly blasé about this
unique power of communication that we‘re endowed with. But the moment you can
truly take in the power here, what this really represents, how it touches everyone, is
to understand how aware you have to be of what you say. One of the great dilem-
mas that we have is that so much of what is said is without truth. It‘s the dilemma
the not-self, it‘s the way in which the mind, when it‘s controlling the life, never really
communicates honestly; it can't afford to. It‘s at risk when it does that. It's trying
to control things and manipulate things so it doesn't communicate honestly.
And it means that these forces, these models, these are the models that are influen-
cing the coming generation, each generation. There is a lack of legitimate communi-
cation. And it means that every time you're opening up your mouth, the power that
is there in you, The Alpha in you or The Prodigal in you or The Role Model in you,
that if it's not correct, that is something you're putting out that somebody else is
taking in.
For me, I suppose the great ideal is that—I‘ve spent most of my life living in a kind
of intellectual isolation. This has not been a life in which I have often had human
beings that I could really communicate with. And what I mean by that is Outer Au-
thority. That is, the purity of expression, unique expression. Most people repeat
things that are part of the homogenized, conceptualized process and they just repeat
what they are trained to think and see. The beauty of the knowledge, the beauty of
Human Design is that through Strategy and Authority you slowly begin this process
of disengaging your personality from the delusion and dysfunction of trying to be in
control of your life. Your mind has no business being in control of your life.
And it's only when you begin to disengaging in that way, it‘s only then that the pos-
sibility of your conceptual power and the possibility of your Outer Authority can be
expressed in a way that there is a new model that is established. Something that is
essential for all of us is to transform the level of communication.
Every year here in Ibiza we have the annual Ibiza Event and for me what distin-
guishes it from any other kind of gathering is the communication. It's different. And
it's different because it's rooted in human beings being accepted for what they are
which means they are given ―the right to express themselves freely.‖ It is a very
different kind of communication and one that is very special.
It‘s still immature. It has a long way to go in the sense that the human beings in-
volved are beings who have had to go through deconditioning. It's not like what
communication will be for children in the future who are raised according to their
design and the way in which they will be able to express their Outer Authority to
those around them, to their friends, to whomever. For me it is really the opening up

of the possibility of a new and very profound intimacy. The intimacy of being able to
connect to somebody‘s—I was going to say soul; the personality crystal is the eternal
mechanism. That is, to be able to communicate passenger to passenger. This ulti-
mately is what's possible for us which transforms the nature of our communication.
It‘s time, because in fact the very nature of the world that we live in and it's homo-
genization has transformed these roles into dysfunction where there is only doubt
and confusion and the potential of madness.
So, as always, the journey begins with the first step and the first step is honoring
your Inner Authority. Only then can you challenge the mind. Only then can you
begin this process of finding the power in you to truly express a new model, a new
model that is unique. It‘s not even new; it's just unique. It's just you.
Anyway, to all of you, you take care. Enjoy the movie, and until next time, bye for
now.

Lecture Five
The Tantric Forces
Good morning and welcome to all of you. We have a very interesting subject today
that because of its naming—I went through that particularly in the early years when
I was first introducing Design and the people around me really didn't have the kind
of knowledge base where I could fully explain the terminology to them. ―Tantra‖ for
most people is associated with sex. There were always these questions about what
do you mean about these tantric channels, because of the way in which the naming
was structured for the breakdown of the circuits and the streams, and then of course
the power column through the center, the formats, the tantric channels, the role
channels and so forth. It ended up being one of those things at that point I really
could never fully explain to them. I simply talked about the powering of the identity.
Tantric Forces

Tantra is a Seven-Centered Concept
Traditionally, it is the application of divine energy towards purpose. It is very much
a seven-centered concept and as a seven-centered concept it was deeply connected
with the Root Center. That is, it can be referred to as the center of Kundalini. For
the seven-centered being, their tantra was actually rooted in the Root Center, the
Root Center and its relationship to the Sacral Center. It‘s why the heavy emphasis
on a direction towards generation, rebirth, the connection to the sexuality within the
context of the seven-centered being.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
We will look at it next week when we look at the formats themselves. Obviously,
then I can only do a surface discussion as I've been doing with these various forces.
For a number of years in Ibiza I did a series of lectures on formats and they are ac-
tually, really incredibly profound. You can see the roots of seven-centered philoso-
phies, magic, spirituality within the structure of those formats. And by the way,
they‘re available at Channel 88.
But when I refer to the tantric forces, I'm actually talking about the tantric forces as
they apply to what is a nine-centered being. And for the nine-centered being it is
the relationship between the Sacral Center and the identity; that is, the Sacral Cen-
ter and the G Center. This application of divine energy, you can substitute ―divine‖
for ―Sacral.‖ This is something that is very important.
Generators are the Center of Life and the Divine Force
I've been trying to reach out to the Generator consciousness for a very long time
now. I have often referred to the—again the language is just relative—the divinity of
what it is to be Generator. For me, if the evolving formula could be measured in
terms of its higher achievements, the Generator is really something incredible. It
makes everything possible. The world could exist, the whole process could exist
without Manifestor, Projectors and Reflectors. We (non-Generators) are not an es-
sential ingredient. We are the happenstance of the way the binary formula breaks
down.
But the reality is that you Generators are the center of life. It is the thing. And of
course, for the seven-centered being, in terms of their relationship to finding the
divine within themselves, this is what they were looking for. Their approach was
that the way to find it is through the control and then release of the Kundalini, what
is there in the Root, the adrenaline, the stress energy, and the pressure. And it's
this pressure relationship with the Sacral that creates this divine power. We call it
being a Generator. This is really the divine force.
If you think about Eastern mysticism, you will see it is rooted in an almost exclusive
Generator framework. At the highest level is the understanding that one is here
simply to respond to life. Not to control it; you don't mess with the river, you re-
sponded to life. And in responding to life there is this perfection. After all, this is
what the Generator is for.
It is one of the most extraordinary things to understand about the Generator within
the context of mythologies and spiritualities: The Generator is a perfect creature.
And of course, the large print giveth and the small print taketh away; there's always
the small print. The small print has to do with that funny thing that sits on top of
our shoulders—the mind, the not-self mind, the distortion, the destruction of the
inherent divinity that is there within the Generator, that divinity to be the pure life
force, the pure generating life force, the enveloping life force.

The Tantric Forces
The Tantric Forces
So, what we‘re looking at is the nine-centered; and the nine-centered tantra is here
in these channels. These are the tantric forces. What that literally is saying is that
this is where the fertility of life, that the main direction of the fertile power of the
Generator is to generate a specific
direction. And I say specific direc- Tantric Forces
tion, and not to confuse you, when
we're dealing with the G Center Beat/The Key
we‘re dealing with two crosses.
That is the fundamental make up
of it. Rhythm/The Flow Discovery/The Now
We are dealing with the Sphinx
and with what is physically direc-
tional. Yet, at the same time
when we're dealing with a Vessel
of Love, it‘s very important to see
that this is about a different kind
or quality of direction. It's not about physical direction as much as about identity
direction, the way in which the identity is going to operate, because this is what
empowers the identity.
It's not about, by the way, saying okay, there is that over here on the side [channel
10/34.] But as we have seen, integration is something that is very unique and is a
primary construct. This is the specific way in which identity is given its life. This
connection between the Sacral Center and the G Center is a functional form. It is
very, very powerful. This is the core of Penta. It is one of the most important forces
as a combined force that we have in our lives because it drives our identity. It gives
our identity life.
The 15/5
When we're looking at channels here in the tantric forces and when we begin with
logic, the 15/5, we're looking at the infrastructure of a cell. We‘re looking at the
basic life formula that is at the core of our success as a bio-form. In the design of
forms, a single cell has three gate potentials: the 15, the 5 and the 3. That is, all
cellular life is open to the power of mutation; all of it. But the defining element of
the single cell, the thing that makes it different from the inanimate—which is only
the 25—as a potential, is that the potential is this definition and it's the very bedrock
of why these are all described as life forces. It‘s what definition brings. It brings a
life force.
So when we're looking here in the tantra, the first thing that we're looking at in
terms of identity is that this identity is about life itself. It's about life itself. It is an
identity that is simply there because life can emerge. It‘s the presence of life. It is
there in 15/5. I have spent hundreds of hours of lectures, one way or another, on

this channel over all these years. It is really remarkable. It is what not simply is at
the very core of our life force, but it's at the very core of the life force of all bio-
forms. This is one of
Tantric Forces those cornerstones that
life is built on.
And when you think
about it in terms of this
description, the flow, I
Rhythm/The Flow repeat it endlessly in
my work, the reminding
you of the fact that we
are objects that are
moving in space. I
think that it's one of
those things to remind
yourself of once a day.
It‘s a nice little mantra:
Let me remember; I am
moving in space. Because we are and it is one of the most important elements in
order to be able to understand how the whole ―being‖ process operates. If you‘re
something that is moving in space, one of the most important things for you ob-
viously is to be able to align yourself to whatever the correct direction is for you.
The Nature of Life is Being in the Flow
Everything about the nature of life is being in the flow. It's being the river. This is
life. And only when you can identify—and I play off the G Center identity—yourself
with that flow, this is surrender. It‘s also about love. After all, in these tantric forces
we have two gates of love. The 15th gate is the love of humanity, or not. But it is a
love of the species, it is a love of what we all are as a potential. It is a deeply collec-
tive, sharing process. We are all here to be in the flow together, to share our identi-
ties in the flow together. That is not homogenization I'm talking about; the ideal of
that is that in that flow the opportunity of the bonding of outer authorities.
We‘re here to surrender to that flow, and to surrender to that flow as a response.
We cannot fight it. I know, I'm a Manifestor, I am non-Sacral. I stand away from all
that. I do not have the 15/5, and yet there is no way I can fight the river. All you
can do is surrender. There is nothing else. And for us surrender isn‘t a phrase, it is
just a metaphor for Strategy and Authority, because Strategy and Authority is what
aligns you to what is correct for you in terms of your direction, in terms of your tra-
jectory, in terms of the way in which you are here to be aligned. All of that is a re-
sponse.
One of the things you see about the nature of life through the tantric forces is to
understand that the nature of life demands response. We are all waiting. None of us
are in charge. None of us have the power to change the nature of the construct; we

The Tantric Forces
do not. We‘re here to be in the flow. The moment you're in the flow, you get that
opportunity for that divine fulfillment of purpose. And if you're not in the flow, you
can never have it.
I‘m not talking about whether it's in your design or not. Understand that this is just
a construct that is there in our species. It is a life force that is there. It is a life
force rooted out of a Generator, which means that envelops all of us. And because
we live in a not-self homogenized world, because the homogenized not-self Genera-
tor suffers from frustration, we‘re all frustrated with the flow. We don't like where
the world is taking us. We don't like what the now is doing to us. We don't like all of
that. We would like to get out of the flow because we're frustrated, we want to
change it.
Strategy and Authority
The moment you operate according to Strategy and Authority it doesn't matter; it
just doesn‘t matter. It‘s not the point anymore. You are in the flow. This is what
we are here for. You cannot find your purpose if you're fighting the world, if you're
banging your head against the material plane. You can‘t. It isn't going to do you
any good to curse your fate or to curse somebody else's. And you're not going to
change anything because this is a pattern.
The thing that makes the 15/5 so extraordinary is that we are built on a logical con-
struct. This is the very core of that logical construct. It is the pattern that is estab-
lished Cellularly; it is the pattern for life itself. You cannot get out of this one. This
is really a box. The flow sounds much prettier, but this is the pattern of life.
Finding Purpose through Surrendering to the Pattern
Until you can surrender to that pattern, you can‘t find purpose. We‘re not here to
fight the world around us. We‘re here to navigate through the world around us. We
know the way; that is, the way is known within us. It's known within that place
within our Inner Authority that is able to discern what the right way is to adjust the
navigational movement in the flow. Rhythm; it's all kind of like music any way.
One of the things you get to see about honoring your Strategy and Authority is that
your life develops a certain kind of rhythm, a natural rhythm. The flow is made up of
all kinds of different qualities. The pattern in its diversification is vast. That 5th gate
with its lines, colors, tones and bases; that 15th gate, with its lines, colors, tones,
bases and all the combinations that are possible between them, and the combina-
tions relative to the planets that bring the activations,; there are thousands and
thousands and thousands of ways to be in the flow.
But be in the flow we must. And it‘s not about accepting a pattern from the outside.
It's about knowing how to move through the pattern from the inside, from the Inner
Authority that is here to guide you in that. When we are in the flow, when we sur-

render to our vehicles and our trajectories, it is then that we can find in the other a
place for love, for that love in the larger collective sense of humanity.
You can't exactly say that you really love humanity when you look at the way in
which it has developed over the last thousands of years. You can‘t. At best you can
be disappointed. So much ugliness, so much disarray, so much disenfranchisement,
but that‘s not-self. It's hard to love a humanity that is nothing more than killer
monkeys. It‘s very difficult.
The magic of the Sacral Center, because it gives you the key to life on the planet,
says you're here to react to the world. You‘re not here to create it. You‘re here to
respond to it in whichever way you are designed. And the answer is always within
yourself, always within that Inner Authority, an Inner Authority that never initiates.
It does not. It's always waiting for something that it reacts to. It's only the not-self
mind that initiates, that tries to stand above the flow. That tries to find its own way,
when it doesn't know who it is.
It's a magical channel. It‘s what binds us to all of life, which means that the food
chain and all the other things that make it possible for us as a bio-form to exist on
this planet is all rooted here in 15/5. And if you look out at nature you will see that
nature just simply goes with that flow. There is nothing to get in the way; there is
nothing to interfere with them naturally being in the flow. We do not have cells de-
bating with each other whether or not it's correct to do this or that. They simply
function in the flow. It is their perfection, our security, the consistency of the pat-
tern.
It‘s our minds; it‘s the power of the mind over you. It's the mind that says I'm not
going to wait. It's the mind that says we have to act now. To find yourself, you
have to find the trust in your Authority. There is no other way; otherwise, it‘s just
chaos. And the moment you trust in your Authority is the moment the mind begins
to lose its power to distort the nature of your life, to take you out of the flow, to
break this down into chaos for you, to run the clock fast so that you're just out of the
movie as soon as possible.
The 46/29
The other side, the collective process, the 46/29—it‘s an interesting thing. It‘s
something that I‘ve always enjoyed as a surprise, in a sense. I‘m deeply individual.
My whole design actually runs through the 20th gate, and the 20th gate is this exis-
tential gate, this now gate. Individuality, because it operates in a pulse, and in my
particular case I‘m a splenic individual, that at first glance it would appear to be that
I'm as existential as you can be within the context of Design. But the fact is that the
most existential force in the BodyGraph is this channel, the 46/29. It is rivetingly
existential in the sense that it‘s about being so deeply in the now that there is a risk
of being out of touch, in a sense, but it is the most intensely existential force that we
have.

LECTURE FIVE
The Tantric Forces
Everything having to do with the abstract begins with the understanding that it is the
abstract that gives us the human experiential way. So it is the abstract that estab-
lishes what the deepest human experience is going to be. This is much more about
humanity rather than individual humans, in a sense, and individual humans in part-
nership. That is, the collec-
tive is always there, obviously
Tantric Forces
to share.
When we're looking at the
46/29 we have something so
interesting because the 29,
which is ready to make a
Discovery/The Now
commitment, and the 46,
which is all about whether
one can be in the right place
or not, that though the ab-
stract is based on experience
and the whole abstract
process is there to move us
experientially in life, and its
goal is to be able to give us hindsight, to be able to look back and to be able to say,
―been there, done that,‖ this is what that was. In other words, to give us a history,
to give us a stored memory, in order to be able to do that, there is one channel in
the whole abstract circuit that has absolutely nothing to do with the past. It‘s here.
It‘s all about being totally in the experience. This is where discovery is.
It‘s not that we're just put out on the track and they say, ―Okay go.‖ There is some-
thing that must come out of that process. We have a deeply diversified history;
because of deeply diversified experiences, that on the surface can seem similar. Yet,
if one goes deep within them, one immediately discovers differences. It is these
discoveries that transform our world, our collective world, discoveries of things that
are there that nobody has seen. Everything about this force is it is a force for deep,
deep, deep connection to a process, a deep focus in process right there.
The 46th Gate
And the 46th gate, this is not the love of humanity; this is about the love of the body.
This is the temple. It takes us back to the same place. It takes us back to the me-
chanics of the nine-centered being; that is, the nine-centered being is here to be
guided by its design consciousness. It‘s here to be guided by the vehicle because
the vehicle is the life and the vehicle, in and of itself, is intelligent. If you just leave
the vehicle alone you‘re able to experience the now.
This is one of the things about mind. Your mind, when it is the instrument of the
not-self, your mind is always moving between the future and the past, always. It is
remembering and it's deciding. And it never really allows you to experience anything
in the now. It doesn't. It's all over the place. So, you've got that thing that you're

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

supposed to be doing. And while you're doing that thing, your mind is adrift some-
where else. It's thinking about what you‘re going to do later; it's thinking about
what happened to you the day before. It‘s all of those things.
And of course, your mind is able to do that because your mind has been given per-
mission to be in charge of your life. So while you're doing that thing that the mind is
not in the least bit interested in, it's off and working on what we should do next and
where we should go and isn‘t this all terrible, let's quit. Whatever it is, the mind is
doing its number. And of course, what happens in that is that instead of there being
discovery, what we get is the homogenized experience. That's a hundred people
doing the same thing and having
basically the same experience. It
doesn't add anything to the collec-
tive knowledge. It doesn't add
anything to the collective wisdom.
Because there is no discovery,
there is no existential.
This channel says: succeeding
where others fail or failing where
others succeed. It's about being in
the experience totally, totally. And
it's being in the experience of the
body totally. This is about the
body. And not only is it about the
body, but it's enormously impor-
tant for our well-being. If you look
at the wheel, you‘ll see that the
46th gate, which is the Virgo/Libra
cusp in the mandala, you'll see that
following the 46th gate are all
seven gates of the Splenic Center. It is the keying element, this love of the
body, deeply connected to the immune system and the survival mechanisms that are
there in the body in terms of its continuity chemically.
Responding to the Vehicle
It is something to grasp about what this ultimately is about. This is about respond-
ing to the vehicle; this is the essential identity for discovery. It‘s what Human De-
sign teaches. It is responding to the vehicle. This is the bedrock of the technique
that anyone learns when they enter Human Design. In turning over your mental
decision making to your Inner Authority, to your Strategy, what you're doing is em-
powering your direction through your vehicle. But it does something else.
The moment your vehicle is making your decisions, it means your mind, it means
that the personality, the passenger, has an opportunity to have an existential expe-
rience, because that's really what it represents. The moment your mind isn't in-

LECTURE FIVE
The Tantric Forces
volved in the bits and pieces of running your life—and it takes time; I‘ve finished
three seven-year cycles. It's not like the not-self mind goes away. What happens to
it is that you can feel that it would like to get involved, it just doesn't anymore. It
takes time. But the longer you are dedicated to allowing your vehicle to guide you,
the more opportunities arise for your consciousness to be right there in the expe-
rience, watching the movie.
We‘re here to be in the flow watching the movie. We‘re not here to be fighting the
river. We‘re not here figuring out how to get the hell out of it. We‘re here to be
perfectly embedded in it, because this is our maia. You want out? Die. Other than
that, we‘re in it. This discovery is only possible through the body. It is not possible
any other way. It isn't. If your physical body doesn't operate correctly, neither does
your brain system, neither does your cognitive capacity. None of those things func-
tion properly; they don‘t. And because everybody else is like that, it seems to be
normal, which is its own tragedy.
You Awaken by Accepting Your Place in the Flow
What is written here between the Sacral and the G Center are the fundamental laws
of awakening; it‘s tantra. You awaken by accepting your place in the flow, whatever
it may be, because it's correct. And the
moment you can navigate in the flow with-
out threat, without fear, without a mental
trip, you can begin to relax.
It‘s like teaching a child how to swim. The
tension in their body, the fear that they‘re
going to sink, that they‘re going to drown,
the fear that doesn't allow them to see that
their own bodies are buoyant, that they
can just float. And then suddenly there's
that moment where the resistance disap-
pears, where their mind stops telling them
to be afraid. Where they suddenly sink into the relaxation of the recognition that
they‘re okay, that they can float in that world and how quickly they master it. It is
the same thing for us. It is.
The moment you are in the flow of your life, the tension goes away. And when
you're in the flow of your life, if your passenger is watching, the wonder of this life
gets revealed. This is where the discovery is, and the discovery is everywhere.
Human Design is a science of differentiation and it says that each unique human
being has a potential of a unique perspective, a unique cognitive recognition and the
capacity to be able to express it. This is what is waiting in discovery.
But it's only when you honor the vehicle. It's only when you accept that it is the
vehicle and the vehicle alone establishes the potential of an identity that can be
awake or not, because this is the core, this is the center of the BodyGraph. It is its

fundamental power and direction. And you can see that the great ailments on this
planet are all dysfunctions that exist in these tantric areas. On one side we accept
material power of the maia to drive everything. So we need to find a place in it.
And we find our place in it by honoring the vehicle, because the vehicle is one with
its material environment. It is the vehicle that rightfully recognizes what direction to
take within the flow.
The 14/2
And when you have this [gate 2] and you have this [gate 14], you get the keys.
This is, after all, pure direction. The pulse of individuality, the 14th gate with its—I
love it in the old I‘Ching, this Possession in Great Measure, the wagon, this enormous
capacity to have power. There is so much power that is rooted in this 14th gate, this
deep capacity to drive direction.
What we call the Magnetic Monopole, what I give as a metaphor as the driver that,
technically speaking, sits here in the 2nd gate. This is the great gate of direction. As
the great gate of direc-
Tantric Forces tion, you see that it's the
2nd gate, it is the yinest

 Sphinx is that it goes to
the 1st gate, which is all

But understand that the

direction is in the form,
all of this is in the form.
To be able to realize the
potential that lies within
us as a species we need
to be in the flow. In
order to discover what is
there for us to discover,
we need to honor the Authority of our vehicle. And here we have the great direction,
the pure mutative movement.
This is something that is one of the most magical things about Human Design. When
I first began introducing the knowledge there were people who suggested that this
was fatalistic. It isn't. It‘s like anything in science. It's what happened to Newton
when Einstein came along. It is a construct that is accurate now, but we are deeply,
deeply, deeply mutative as a species. It is one of our keys. It is something to rec-
ognize about us because this is the deepest of all life forces. This says anything is
possible. Anything is possible; anything. It is the magic in us.

LECTURE FIVE
The Tantric Forces
Embracing the Mutation
One of these things I'm trying to get across to understand is that we do not know
what our potential is because our potential is based on the collected wisdom of sev-
en-centered beings, and we‘re not seven-centered beings; we‘re nine-centered be-
ings. They did not in any way possess the kind of potential consciousness we have.
The functioning of Right sidedness is something that belongs to our species that is
totally new, in that sense. We are a mutation.
One of the things to be so clear about is that the only way in which we can embrace
life is that we also embrace the mutation. And the mutation is where we go, literally,
physically. This is not about the flow of the river. This is about where the river is
going. it has nothing to do in the end with what logic would like, because the one
thing that logic cannot do protect against mutation.
The Beat: The Key
This is the beat. And mutation takes place between the beats, unexpected. And it is
the key. It says something; it says there is a direction for all of us without any
guarantees. There are no guarantees. There is no plan. So there are no guaran-
tees. There is only a mutative direction. And it means because we are part of it and
it is part of us, that only when we are correct can we go with the flow, can we go
with the mutation. Our whole direction, these are not things that can truly be known
because at any moment mutation can take place.
It's interesting to think about how difficult it is for mutation to take hold. It's incred-
ibly difficult for mutation to take hold; all the individuality that lies within the Body-
Graph, there are always these little things going on, these little mutative moments
happening, but they don't necessarily become universal. Each and every one of us
has an alignment to the mutative direction because we are choiceless in that. We
are all connected to the direction of the world, we cannot escape that. We are all
connected to the movement of our planet around the Sun; we cannot do anything
about that. But it does not mean that we should ever, ever, ever sit back and say,
―Okay, it's like this now and is going to be like this forever.‖ No.
Participating in Evolution Consciously
One of the things that I truly enjoy is participating in evolution consciously. It's
perhaps the greatest gift for me as an intellectual that Human Design gave me. I
find it very exciting to be able to see evolutionary patterns at work and to be able to
watch those patterns. We are in a deep, mutative cycle. Things are changing deeply
in terms of the way in which the form functions and the future of the way in which
this form functions.
But all that comes back to the same thing. All that comes back to understanding
that this is the way the life force works. The life force cannot survive without muta-

tion. No direction is ever guaranteed, which means that all you can do is surrender.
Not to get stuck in the ―I want to go this way and I want to go that way,‖ not the
screaming of the passenger in the backseat to turn left or to turn right. And to be
aware of it as it happens.
What I love about being a conscious participant in evolution is to be aware of the
mutation, to see the changes at work. You cannot do that if your mind is absorbed
in what you're going to do for lunch. You can‘t. You never get to see it; you miss
the beat. It looks funny when you miss the beat, doesn't it? That person that can't
dance, that person that can‘t tap their fingers to the beat, how off it is. But you
have to be aware to catch the shifts. You have to be relaxed watching the movie to
see it unfold, to read between the lines.
It‘s only when you can recognize it that it becomes so transforming. We have this
enormous capacity inherent in all this. This is the real center of the being. And in
being the center of the being, it means that this is the architecture at the planning
stage, when they‘re looking at the holistic BodyGraph, if you look at this center from
the Sacral to the identity, what you're
looking at is the basic construct of how Tantric Forces
to be in the world, just how to be in the
world. It‘s not about all the other Beat/The Key
things, because there are all kinds of
other things that are there. It‘s just how
to be here.
You can see that it comes with the form.
It‘s only through the form that you can
be here in the flow and discover and that
you have the key. You have the key to
the fulfillment of your identity. The
fulfillment of your identity brings you
purpose and that is simply Strategy and
Authority; it isn‘t anything else. You
cannot escape this because it is the
world. It is the generated, enveloping
process. What you get to see of that is if you look at these three key areas and you
think about the fact that the not-self is up here (in the mind) making its not-self
decisions, this is where the dilemma is in the nature of being on this plane. It‘s
where the problem is.
The deep frustration that is inherent in homogenized consciousness, that frustration
is out of this. They struggle against the flow. They cannot find their rhythm. There
is nothing to discover. There is nothing that locks them in and they certainly do not
have the key; always trying to initiate, always ignoring what is the central power in
their life.
It is the magic of what understanding such extraordinary mechanics leads to. It
leads to taking advantage of the formula itself. It‘s what we do in Human Design;
we take advantage of the formula. But it doesn't eliminate mind. To operate cor-

rectly, to make decisions based on your Strategy and Authority, it doesn‘t mean that
all of a sudden your mind goes, ―Okay I give up.‖ It isn‘t like that at all.
The deepest and most profound challenge that we have is to deal with the nature of
mind and to control the impulses of the personality out of fear, to control its life and
thus destroy it. It‘s the fear that is the great dilemma. You'll notice that here be-
tween the Sacral and the G Center, there are no fears; fear is associated with
awareness centers. This is just a program of the way in which we are intended to
live. This is the generated, expressed identity that is supposed to be our identity as
a species, and you can see how distorted it is, and it‘s the fear.
Experimenting with Your Strategy and Authority
When you begin to experiment with your Strategy and Authority, you‘re really begin-
ning to trust yourself for the first time. You‘re beginning to trust something that is
mysterious, because it‘s not like your mind, listening to a Sacral or whatever hap-
pens to be your particular design, it is very different from the whole mind trip busi-
ness.
The moment you begin to recognize the validity in the experiment, because after all,
it‘s about you, when you begin to use the Strategy and Authority to guide you in
your life, what is happening to you is that you're beginning to find a place within you
that you can trust, instead of spending a life trusting the authority of others, only to
be disappointed, only to be manipulated and controlled by the authority of others
over you, by the authority of your not-self mind over you, the not-self mind in its
arrogance that thinks that it knows, understands and truly can make sense of things.
It‘s a joke.
It's only when you begin to experiment that you can begin to trust, and in that trust
is everything. It's everything, because the moment that you're trusting in your In-
ner Authority you are in the flow. One of the things to recognize is what it brings
you. And it brings you more than that; it brings you that potential in your life that
you can discover.
What that really means is simply the joy of seeing your worth, in a way. Most hu-
man beings don't really appreciate themselves. They don't see to see; they don‘t get
to understand because they never get to experience the real potential. When you
consistently make decisions as yourself, you begin to develop a fearlessness which
opens up these possibilities to be able to watch.
That‘s what we‘re here for. We‘re not here for just the experience of the physical
life; this is our vehicle‘s job. The vehicle lives the life. The personality has other
things as a potential. It‘s a great flaw in the way in which the holistic process oper-
ates, because the personality distorts the life. We don't really end of knowing what
mind is for; what a delight it can be, to be able to see the world in a way that is
unique to us.

These central life forces are at the very core of our being. This is what's driving the
holistic life on this planet, this illusion that we have. All it says is if we respond to
life we find our identity; that‘s what it is saying. And of course, this is what the pos-
sibility is for each and every one of you, to operate correctly and to experience the
life the way in which it's intended to be experienced, to find your identity in this life,
your unique identity.
Okay, it was nice to share that with you. I really appreciate the fact that you are
here. Next, we‘ll take a look at the formats and we‘ll check that one out. Anyway,
to all of you, you take care, enjoy yourselves, and have a nice weekend.

The Formats
Good morning to all of you. We come to one of those truly wonderful areas of Body-
Graph mechanics. I spent days and days and days in a past Ibiza event going
through the formats in a kind of depth they‘d never been treated to. Unfortunately,
because they are extraordinary in terms of their importance in the way in which the
whole body system operates, obviously in this kind of general approach to the life
forces it‘s not possible for me to go into that depth.
The Root Center
But I want to take a slightly different approach today. I want to keep it more prac-
tical in terms of what we're really looking at. The Root Center for me is that center
that gets the least amount of attention. I guess along with the Head Center, it‘s
funny about that, pressure centers being what they are, that here we are in a design
in which we‘re caught inside of a pressure sandwich. And we‘re always interested in
the stuff that's being pressured, all the emphasis we pay to the Sacral, to the emo-
tional system, to the
Spleen, and yet the great
engine is down here; this
is an incredible thing.
And when I say ―the great
engine,‖ it‘s not in the
same sense that the Sa-
cral is. Here we have this
truly, truly enormously
powerful combination, the
Sacral Center as the pri-
mary motor in life, that is,
it is the reproductive, the
fertile engine of life itself.
So in that sense, it is the
most extraordinary, if I can put it that way, of the motors. And yet at the same
time, what it is to be human, and one of the things about being human is that if you
really want to dissect what makes it so terribly different from all other mammals,
you follow along the human experiential way. That human experiential way begins
down here in the 41st gate in the initiating codon. This is the route of the human
experience in life.

it
n
e
ir It's one of the most profound things to
e
p understand about the madness of the
x
E world that we live in, the not-self world
n
a we live in, the homogenized world. The
m
u homogenized world is under vast
H
amounts of pressure. It is what you see

h out there in the world. Take a look out
T
your window on a busy street, just look
at the world and look at the energy that
is there and you'll see all this stress and all this pressure that makes up what we call
the human life. As a matter of fact, we think that somebody who isn't stressed or
isn't under pressure somehow has found some kind of miracle. People pay fortunes
to try to get rid of the stress and the pressure. They take in incredible amounts of
medications to deal with the stress and the pressure. And because they are not-self
and homogenized, the stress and the pressure ultimately leads to breakdowns in
their system because they make mental decisions based on the pressure.
The other thing is to recognize how many human beings have an open Root Center,
in the billions, who are amplifying the stress and the pressure. If you take all of
that, if you grasp what that is all about, you can see that at the very core of what it
is to be human is this Root and its dynamic. It‘s not about how we operate within
the life inasmuch as it is about being driven in this process and pushed really hard.
If anything, the formats lock us into what is—what did they call it in the 50s? They
called it the rat race—it locks us into the Skinnerian maze; it locks us into being
driven along the tracks. It is a key to the dynamism of what it is to be human. We
don‘t stay in a valley or in a forest. We don‘t just stay there. We don't just accept
that this is our environment and it is going to nurture us and we don't have to go
any further. This is not what we are. We‘re not going to sit there in that valley or in
that forest and allow all other forms to dominate all other areas. We will not do that.
We are driven by this pressure within us.
The other thing is that the Root Center has absolutely no relationship directly to the
tribe; none. It‘s something that is really fascinating about how different the tribal
circuitry is from anything else. The Root is all about the collective and the individual.
It is all about the future, the past and mutation. It is all about experiment and expe-
rience. This is what the Root is driving. It is driving the basic foundation of our
lives. You can see when you look—it's not, obviously, in this illustration—but when
you look and you see this whole system moving up from the center, how it goes

directly through the whole vehicle, all driven by this very, very powerful, stress,
adrenaline motor underneath.
The Abstract Format: Cyclical
So let's begin with the abstract, because when we‘re talking about what it is to be
human and when we‘re talking about the human experience this is at the very core
of it. Now, we‘re dealing with a very unusual coupling here. That is, the relationship
between what is this very, very powerful
stress, pressure system and the Sacral
together. And obviously the moment you
have this, because of the values inherent
in these two engines, the moment they
come together this is what we call the
format because the format establishes
not simply an energy resource, but a fre-
quency and a frequency that is going to
impact everything that is connected to it.
In other words, the frequency that is es-
tablished here in this format is the fre-
quency that will guide all of whatever the abstract processes are going to be. It is
the underlying way in which this specific stream and circuit is always going to oper-
ate.
What we know about this abstract format is that it is cyclical. It‘s cyclical. This is
the way it works. It has beginnings and it has middles and
it has ends. This is the abstract experiential frequency.
Everything about the abstract process, and when I say that
I mean every single gate, every channel that you can look
at that is abstract collective is cyclical in nature, all of
them. So, if you get to the 36th gate [circled in blue] and
you get to the gate of being ready to enter into a new
experience, everything about that is that there is a begin-
ning to that process, a middle to that process, and a com-
pletion to that process.
One of the most important things to understand about the
experiential way is that it needs to have finality. Logic
never wants there to be an end, because logic can just
keep on laying out patterns. But everything about the
abstract process is that you only develop your talent, your
skills, abstract experiential talent, by being able to have
many, many, many, many experiences. It what's gives
the abstract its sense of being unstable.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

You have that in the 35/36, this Channel of Transition, of change. It is inherent in
the abstract process. When you see the abstract process mentally, you see ideas
that come and go, ideas that have a begin-
ning, a middle, and an end. And if you get
stuck, oh is that ever painful, because there
is nothing about the abstract frequency
that is about stopping, taking a break. In
the abstract process, the only time there is
rest is the moment that something comes
to an end. And then immediately the pres-
sure begins for a new beginning.
This drives abstract beings mad in the not-
self world, because they feel so unstable.
They feel so unsatisfied. There is no satis-
faction in the abstract. Only logic can find
satisfaction. Only logic; and logic is not
sexy. It isn't. The abstract never finds its
satisfaction. It always has to deal with
expectation. And everything about the abstract process is that everything has to
end. Think about what that means to the not-self and the way in which the not-self
operates, the way it makes mental decisions, that it's got a frequency inside of it
that is driving it constantly to end things and start things and end things and start
things.
And of course, it can bring chaos to their lives, to their jobs, or many of them to
their relationships, to the sense that nothing is satisfying for them; nothing. Oh,
how painful it is not to be aware. How easily you are trapped. It doesn't matter
whether you have this format or not, it doesn't matter if you have the 42 and the
53; it doesn‘t matter at all. It doesn‘t make any difference.
What you get to see here is the inherent energy that is in every single abstract gate.
It‘s why it's so difficult to find stability in the abstract, why so many people crash
because of that. Why others see that they have problems. It's in every single place.
After all, many of us, not all, but many of us will have at least one or maybe two or
three abstract activations. It brings a frequency into your system. It brings a fre-
quency into how that gate operates.
Expectation
Understanding the formats is an incredible key to understanding the energy in the
system itself, with the exception of tribal circuitry, which has its own unusual
process, and we will get to that. But this is a way to really grasp the essence of the
way in which gates work. Think about it this way: wherever you have an abstract
gate, you have an expectation. And wherever you have an expectation you're going
to have a crash. And wherever you have that place of expectation, it means that
place is always open to ending something and beginning something else.

It just depends where it is. Is it the 29th gate and you end one commitment to begin
another? Does that become the theme for you, that you can‘t maintain your com-
mitment to something, that you‘re not stable in your commitments? Because any
thematic in the design that is abstract is going to carry this frequency of the cyclical
nature of this process. Everything about it is cyclical.
Without this format we really don't have death. This is a metaphor for the life
process itself that has its beginning, its middle and its end, this theme of maturation.
It is the design format for the life process; it's all cyclical. You enter Design and you
wait for the seven-year cycle to renew your cells in order to be refreshed. It‘s all
cyclical. Everything about the nature of being is that it's on the spiral, like the spiral
of our DNA. It is what it is.
And yet, at the mundane level, at the practical level, how important it is to under-
stand this mechanism within yourself so that you can let go. Knowledge is not pow-
er. It isn‘t. It‘s information. I can give you endless amounts of information. And
regardless of whether this bit or that bit rings
a bell for you, in the way in which life works,
in the way in which the not-self mind oper-
ates, simply knowing any of this does noth-
ing in the end. You have to live your design.
Oh yes, it's interesting to understand why
there is this instability in those abstract acti-
vations that you might have. Yet, being
aware of that doesn't mean you can change
it, doesn't mean that you can decide to do
something about it. It doesn't. It‘s sup-
posed to be like that. But it supposed to
operate consistently and correctly within the
holistic being that is you. No being can be
judged by their aspect. You have to see how
it operates within the whole, which means
that the whole, the holistic life, has to be
correct. Only then does the passenger get a
chance to look at that and see it and begin to
understand why you have these abstract
elements and why it's necessary that they
function in that way.
After all, experience is one of the keys to
being human. It is not something to avoid.
It is inherent in all of us. We are all driven
and pressurized to be experiential in this life. It is where we gain our depth. And it
is through our unique gifts that we can translate our experience into information for
others. So without this beginning, middle and end, we don't gain the experience.

You can see the next element in the movement of this energy, the abstract channel
of the 53/42, as it crosses the Sacral to go up here to the 29/46 [see arrow in the
Sacral Center in image above.] You can see here the key gets explained so clearly.
This is a theme of beginnings, middles and ends, but by the way, make sure that
you're really in the experience so that we get the information we need that gets
revealed through the 33/13. Collect the experiences, pass the experiences on.
So, everything abstract is where you are designed experientially to be on this plane,
your particular areas of expertise. Those particular areas where the instability of it,
the constant transition within it, is what‘s giving you the depth you need in order to
be an accomplished creature. It‘s what experience gives us. It gives us a sense of
balance. The great gift of the experience is that it is experience that is collected for
each following generation, which is why we develop intellectually so much faster than
we do biologically.
The Logic Format: Focused and Concentrated
Okay, let‘s go over to the other side. This is such a powerful, focusing mechanism,
the 9/52, the logical format. This is just plain focused and concentrated. It‘s not
cyclical at all. It has nothing to do with running through things over and over and
over, all kinds of different things. And of course, it is often an illusion that one takes
in this logical energy and
assumes that it's stable.
That‘s why we trust logic.
The abstract flows through
the emotions. This cyclical
business carries with it an
emotional frequency.
But focus and concentration
Focused
is moving through the Spleen
Concentrated cool; cool as opposed to the
Logical hot. Focused, concentrated,
and logical. Think about the
logical aspects that you have
in your design and under-
stand how fixed and focused
they are. It‘s the other ex-
treme of that abstract activation of yours that is always so ready to start something
new, get rid of the old, get through the experience. Here in the logic, all those logic
aspects have this ―stay with it,‖ stay with it; focus in deep, deep, deep. It‘s the
other side of the coin.
Here is the energy to dig into things, to get the facts, to get the details, to be able to
see clearly the pattern. This is the brilliance of logic. It really begins in the 52nd
gate. It's one of those wonderful gates—Keeping Still Mountain. It‘s all about the
journey of 1,000 miles that begins with the first step. It's about the brilliance of

concentrated, focused detail on patterns. This is what life is built on. The whole
mechanism is built logically, and the life is lived abstractly. That‘s the bargain, if I
can put it that way, or the deal or the mechanism or however you want to look at it.
Logic builds the vehicle. It builds the whole program. It is the program. All these
patterns and this deep, deep focus on those patterns, and the pattern is what pro-
vides us with security. It is what protects us. It‘s what defends us. It's all about
the pattern.
It‘s why when you look into the mechanics of Human Design, you know that the
technique of Strategy and Authority emerges out of the logical mechanics. Because
this is what's there; you get to see it. The collective, after all, is the framer of the
experimental experience of being human. This is what our world is, what I refer to
as Solomon's World where there's nothing new. This is the world of ―we are this way
and this is the way the world works‖ and on the other side the abstract is just finding
out the nuances of experiencing what is assured in different ways. This is the basic
world.
The thing that makes the collective so powerful is that every, single collective activa-
tion is social and demands to be shared. When you think about that you begin to
understand that those individual aspects you have, that abstract aspect you have,
not only is it cyclical and unstable, but it wants somebody to be cyclical and unstable
with it. It wants something to come and show up and may force it to end to start
something new. It's looking for somebody to do it with.
It's the same thing with logic. Logic says ―come focus with me, come concentrate
with me, let's study together.‖ This is logic, inherently social. And yet, at the same
time, because it's inherently social, it is what gives the collective its great power.
Because of all the circuitry in the BodyGraph, there is nothing that is more social
than the collective; nothing. Every channel, every gate is social. Every channel,
every gate demands sharing. It‘s why they can be so interesting or so annoying,
after all. They will share with you their
dissatisfaction. They will share with
you their failed expectation. They will
share with you things you don't neces-
sarily want. But they are driven to
share.
There is quite a difference, in that
sense, the final line or the bottom line,
if you follow the trajectory of these
streams on either side. And by the
way, we‘re going to begin that next
week, you follow these streams and
what you get to see is that at the end
of the logic stream (black), you get to
skills (green circle). At the end of the
abstract stream (red), you just get to
expectation (purple circle.) Logic can
find satisfaction. The deeper you con-

centrate, the more perfected the pattern, the deeper the satisfaction, the deeper the
security. And it‘s shared. You cannot just simply have your criticism, you have to
share it. You just can't have your fantasy, you have to share it.
The Mind of the Not-Self
It makes the tribe crazy, because the collective not only dominates the way in which
the basic construct of being on this plane works, but it controls the mind. It's the
majority of the activations on the mental plane. So, we are dominated by collective
homogenization. And whenever you see the infrastructure, you also have to think
about what the not-self is in the way in which the not-self operates.
As long as the mind is making decisions, whatever you are becomes distorted, and
whatever the inherent frequency is in you, whatever that may be becomes a deep
part of the distortion. The mind doesn't know in the not-self that the fact that it's
carrying certain abstract gates gives it, at times in different situations, this anxiety,
this lack of stability, this needing to end things and move on to other things.
The moment the mind catches that, it's going to make up a whole story, because
that‘s what mind does. It's going to take whatever the main conditioning elements
are, the open centers or the missing gate in a split definition, the gate that would
bridge it together, these deep areas of conditioning, and they become the way in
which the mind is going to decide anything. So, suddenly you have this mind taking
an aspect of you that is correct, when it's correct in terms of its situation, take that
aspect and turn it into something that completely distorts the whole life, that blows it
up out of all proportion, driven by what it is as not-self.
These are just frequencies. They‘re like the chemistry of the emotional system or
the chemistry of individuality; these are just chemistries, frequencies. Just because
a frequency changes doesn't mean that you have to make a decision about what to
do about that. One of the most interesting things to understand about the nature of
Strategy and Authority is that it liberates you from the dilemma of not knowing your
system; your vehicle knows. It knows precisely what is correct. It doesn't mean
necessarily that your mind concurs. Or that your mind grasps it. Your mind is al-
ways basically opposed. But the fact of the matter is that the moment you're oper-
ating correctly out of your Strategy and Authority, it doesn't matter what your confi-
guration is. It doesn‘t matter whether you have this or that; it doesn't.
We are Here to be Conditioned
The great dilemma is that we are here to be conditioned. You can never escape it.
We are conditioned by the very chemistry in our design. We are conditioned by the
very construct of our unique designs. We are conditioned in the classic sense
through the openness that we have. But this is what we are. We‘re a bio-form with
a genetic imperative; we‘re designed to be conditioned by what is different from us.

The Formats
But being conditioned, in and of itself, is not bad. Human Design isn't about condi-
tioning is bad. It's about making decisions with the mind is bad. That's where the
dilemma is. You always have to remember that through your openness is the only
place in this life where there‘s any wisdom. If you‘re going to garner wisdom in this
life, you get it through the open centers; you get it through taking in, filtering the
conditioning that comes from others without that being you. And it cannot be you as
long as you're operating according to your Strategy.
We‘re here to experience being conditioned uniquely. After all, that's what your
design is. Your design lays out the possibility that you can differentiate, that you can
experience what it is to be a unique, authoritative being. But that very design you
have, this is frequencies, energies, pressures, whatever. And it's not about they‘re
good or they‘re bad. It isn't.
The greatest dilemma people have is that they take their lives so seriously. This is
the mental identification with the life. So everything that is going on in your life,
that somehow you have to be in there calculating and working on it and figuring it
out and dealing with it. The suffering that goes on in the not-self mind, the measur-
ing that goes on—you‘re not good enough or they‘re not good enough or it‘s bad.
It‘s a horror. And so, when we're looking at these frequencies and I‘m describing
them to you and that they‘re there in your system, it isn‘t about saying, ―Oh, terrible
I‘ve got an abstract gate and it's unstable.‖ That‘s not what it's about. Yeah, it‘s an
abstract gate and it‘s designed to be unstable, unstable in the sense that it's de-
signed not to stay with things, not to be logical, not to be focused and concentrated,
but to be truly experiential. And that can be wonderful. After all, it's an aspect of a
totality; it‘s not the life itself.
And within every human being are all these combinations of all these different chem–
istries and frequencies and alignments and this and that. It‘s not about getting your
mind sunk into one of these corners and turning the corner into a huge problem. It's
about experiencing it, it‘s about experiencing yourself. It‘s about beginning to see
what happens to you when all of those elements are choreographed into a direction
that is correct for you.
The Circuits
Okay, so on one side we have a cyclical frequency that is at the root of experience.
And on the other side we have a focused and concentrated energy system. This
ultimately leads to skills, to talent, to the ability to be able to work with patterns. So
we have cycles and we have patterns. This is what the collective brings to us and
because these are format energies, these cycles and patterns are inherent in all of
those aspects that are part of these circuits.
The collective would like to be alone. The collective never ever, ever trusts the tribe;
it just doesn't trust the tribe. The collective thinks that the tribe is primitive and
materialistic and closed off and prejudiced and narrow and all kinds of things. The

collective would like to rule the world. You know that any time you meet an 18/58—
the collective wants to rule the world—the 31/7s, the 17/62s. And if you go on the
abstract side you get the same thing. They‘re very, very uncomfortable with the
tribe. Mentally they don't know how to deal with the tribe at all.
And then, of course, is the real problem for the collective. It‘s individuality, pure
mutation. Pure mutation operates in a pulse. So we have the cyclical, we have the
fixed patterns, and we have the pulse: it‘s there and it‘s not; it‘s there and it's not.
It's the beauty of us, because in essence we are all of it. After all, we‘re designed to
be open to the conditioning of everything that we are not. And so, in essence, we
take in whether we have the activations or not; this is the frequency of human. The
cycle, the pattern, and the pulse; this is the whole thing.

The Mutative Pulse is Unpredictable
The pulse is deeply, deeply unpredictable. It appears to be logical, in a way. That
is, the pulse is something that can appear to be very normal and consistent. It‘s a
pulse, after all. You can have a pulse that‘s set at a specific beat. The 2/14 [blue
arrow] happens to be the Channel of the Beat. It can seem very logical as a pattern.
And then all of a sudden, whoosh, something happens. It's called mutation. This
mutation, what really annoys the collective is that it is this mutation that is the for-
mat of the driving force of what our direction is, and not just the direction of the
individual. But ultimately, as it moves out into the Sphinx, it is, in fact, the direction
for the collective as well and the collective can do nothing about it.

The moment there is mutation, everyone has to adapt. You adapt or die. It's just
the way it goes. And if you're not equipped to
adapt—dinosaurs are a good example—you pe-
rish. It‘s why the collective is always very, very
wary of the individual. I‘m a 43/23; I've been
through a 21-year, three seven-year cycle
process of trying to introduce something new to
the collective. And the collective is deeply, deep-
ly, deeply resistant. It‘s why the 43/23 is most
often referred to as the freak by the collective
because the collective is very, very wary of ac-
cepting its potential genius because if it does, the
rules change. New patterns have to be investi-
gated, new experiences have to be taken in, old
patterns and old experiences don't count any-
more.
So, in essence, individuality brings this very,
very dynamic force and yet, at the same time,
there's no guarantee it‘s there. Think about
mutation. The most interesting thing about indi-
viduality is that the biggest part of its reality is
what it doesn't know at any given moment, and cannot know at any given moment.
And therein lies the dilemma in every single individual gate, that dilemma of uncer-
tainty.
The Uncertainty Principle
There is a wonderful principle, the uncertainty principle. I can sort of deconstruct it
and rip it apart—the uncertainty principle in individual activations. We‘ve seen that if
you've got a logical activation, it points to a real fixedness there. You‘re really into
things, which means that there are other things you're not paying attention to. If
you've got that abstract there, it means that there is this instability, this drive to
move on, even though you may not be finished with something; again, the potential
―this and that‖ of any of these processes. But when you're looking at the mutative
activation, what is there is uncertainty.
So think about that, think about any individual activation. Take the 2nd gate as an
example, which is all about direction, knowing the direction. So, you go to the 2nd
gate and you say to the 2nd gate, ―I‘m lost, where should I go?‖ And they go, “I
don’t know.” ―Yeah, yeah, but please give me your best guess.‖ “I don’t know. I
don’t.” The person walks away. Fifteen minutes later, in the pulse, between the
pulses, comes the mutation and the 2 suddenly remembers, or suddenly realizes
where the direction could be. They have no control over that, no control over the
timing of that. They don't.

Every single individual aspect is uncertain until mutation takes hold. Now, of course,
the mutation doesn't have to be some kind of grand mutation. That mutation taking
hold is what, within individuality, we call knowing. And the thing to recognize about
knowing is that knowing has an existential appearance. In other words, it literally
comes out of nowhere.
Think about the not-self dilemma. You have a logic person and an individual and an
abstract being. And you've got the three of them, and you're asking them to make
up their mind about something. You've offered them a job or whatever the case is
and you want them to make up their mind and you‘re asking them now for their
answer.
So, the logical person looks at the pattern of it, it looks at what kind of work it is, it
looks at its own relationship to that kind of task, whatever it may be, it looks at the
possibility of what that can be like to do that over a period of time. It lays out the
pattern. It thinks about its basic security, and it makes its decision, and it makes a
logical decision based on its detail, based on the facts or whatever its relative facts
happened to be.
The abstract person goes back into their own experience. They look back at simi-
lar kinds of things that they have done. They look back at the way in which they felt
about those things. And based on that feeling, they will say yes or no to whatever it
is.
And then the person who is offering the job turns to the individual and says, ―What
about you?‖ and the individual says, “I don't know.” And the person says, ―You
have to make up your mind now because I can't wait any longer. We have to do this
now.‖ And the individual says, ―I don't know.‖
The collective ones on either side look at the individual as if they're nuts. What do
you mean you don‘t know? You must have an idea; well, that's abstract. What do
you think? No, that‘s logic. The individual doesn't know it doesn‘t know. It can't
make up that it knows. It can‘t do the logical thing. It can‘t do the abstract thing.
It has nothing to base its knowing
on, only if it‘s there. And of Individual

your mind is so logical. To muse
over things in order to decide is so

circuitries—is to recognize that in every single one of those aspects is a brake, like a
brake in your car. It‘s a brake that holds that aspect back from functioning correctly,
because it cannot function, it cannot operate correctly until it knows. Otherwise, it is
uncertain. For somebody like me who is an individual and a knower, in my ordinary
life I say, ―I don't know‖ much more often than I say ―I know.‖ Because this ―I don't
know‖ is simply that there is no direction. That‘s the point. There is no direction.
The real transition comes going back to the foundation of what this is all about, that
is, Strategy and Authority. Because the moment you enter into something correctly,
the knowing is inherent in the system. In other words, it is correct action, and
through the continuity of the vehicle and the way in which we operate holistically,
this is a healthy and correct thing to do and you're not going to have this dilemma.
But, it becomes so uncomfortable for the not-self that carries individuality, always
pretending that they have made up their mind. This is what happens to individuals.
Individuals become pretend-collective. They pretend that they‘ve actually worked it
out as pattern, or they look back into their own experience. But this has nothing to
do with knowing.
The 3/60: Melancholy and Depression
The other thing is that when you're dealing with a 3/60, because you are dealing
with individuality, you're dealing with another element here. You're dealing with the
element of the chemistry of indi-
viduality. That is, the pulse car-
ries an energy that can be best

understood by most people, par-
ticularly not-self, as melancholy.
That is, as sadness. It is a highly
creative energy. It is the energy
of the muse. And in the same
sense of the muse, it is not some-
thing that one can control. You
cannot control it. It is there when
it is there, the creative impulse is
there when it is there. And when
it‘s not there, it is simply not
there.
This chemistry in the 3/60, this melancholic chemistry, this creative chemistry, it is
only in the 3/60 that there is the potential for depression. And it‘s a depression
that if it takes hold, literally can move through the whole vehicle. And again, this is
when the pressure of the homogenized world to conform brings the deepest devasta-
tion to the individual spirit.
The whole thing about individuality is that it cannot follow the collective law. If it
follows the collective law, nothing new will ever emerge. It‘s why it‘s very difficult to
influence people who are individual. It's not that they are stubborn and that's built

into their design. It is not that they are deaf and that is built into their design. They
are helpless in that because they are not intended to be easily influenced. In this
way we open up the possibility for the emergence of true mutation. But it means
that if you're not-self, the way in which you‘re going to interpret this ―not knowing,‖
and the fact that it carries with it this potential melancholic depressive energy, is
that you feel lost.
Think about somebody who has the 3/60 and they've got an open Heart Center and
they feel so deeply unworthy. They‘re always trying to prove themselves to other
people. They‘re always trying to get other people to be impressed with them, for
other people to see that they're really terrific and useful and whatever. And they
don't really know and they have something that comes in their direction and some-
body says to them, ―I would really like you to do this thing.‖ And what that person is
really asking them is to be a cheap, abused slave. And they do not know. And there
is this sadness that is there in them.
And that undefined Heart Center, because it's going to be the key to the way in
which their mind is going to make decisions, that Heart Center is going to say, ―I
have to say yes to this job to show them that I'm really worth it. And I've made up
my mind. I‘ve looked at the past and I've looked into the future.‖ And then they
end up doing something that is absolutely horrendous. And they hate it and they
become more depressed.
Wherever I look at the BodyGraph, it doesn‘t matter where I look, I can point to
places that can make you suffer so much. Every activation, every line, every color,
every tone, every base, it doesn't matter what the configuration is. The moment you
lack awareness, the moment you don't operate correctly, you are not-self and noth-
ing is going to truly work for you.
And the fact that you are sad and depressed and feel unworthy, your response to
that isn‘t going to be operating according to your Strategy and Authority. You are
not-self. The response is going to be whenever, psychology, drugs, get deeply me-
dicated, take a new training, follow a guru; it goes on and on and on and on and on
instead of just being able to sit back and to enjoy the ride. How beautiful it can be.
The Formats: The Source of Stress
We are all of these things: the cycle, the pattern, the pulse. It‘s us. And we all have
nuances of this and that. This is the construct, but it doesn't have to be the prob-
lem. It doesn't. The formats, as extraordinary as they are, for the not-self this is
the source of their stress. It is the source of their deepest, deepest pressure. It is
very uncomfortable for them. And it leads to the way in which modern mind works
and all of its homogenized answers to what's wrong. And there isn't anything wrong.
These mechanisms are beautiful. It‘s like a fine Swiss watch, they all fit together,
they all work perfectly together as long as the mechanism as a whole is operating
correctly. It is that simple. It's always been that simple. There isn't anything else.

The Formats
The dilemma of the not-self is that it doesn't understand what life is. It doesn't un-
derstand how to live this life. It doesn't. And it doesn't trust in itself. It doesn't. To
trust in yourself is such an extraordinary thing. Human beings have given their au-
thority to everything, to stone idols, to animals, to false gods, to prophets, to teach-
ers and parents and politicians, and on and on and on and on.
Live According to Your Strategy and Authority
To be correct in this life is about living your life according to your Authority; your
Authority, nobody else's Authority. And your mind cannot be trusted in that. Your
mind is just homogenized, collective soup. You can‘t trust it. It knows nothing of
what is correct for you. It‘s the body‘s life. This is the great grace, to allow the body
to live its life, to live its perfection, to live its beauty, to see that the cycle and the
pattern and the pulse is not just simply us. It is life itself, and we are here as pas-
sengers to take it in. We're not here to spend our time worried about our daily
bread. Let the vehicle look after the vehicle; let the passenger watch the movie.
There is so much stress, so much pressure, so much pain by relying on the mind to
run the trip. Well, it can‘t. And if you want to put a saddle on this powerful ride,
you can only do that with your Strategy and Authority. There is no other way.
There is nothing else that can take all the ingredients that are you and function ac-
cording to all of those values.
Anyway, formats are interesting business; they really are. You can feel it in your
body; you can feel it in all of those aspects. It is one of the things for you to look at,
is to just go one by one. Just look at your logical gates, if you have any, your ab-
stract gates, if you have any, and your individual gates. And think about the fre-
quency that runs them. Begin to see how honed in they are on working in a very,
very specific way. And then through Strategy and Authority sit back and watch it
work. It's entertaining.
Well, to all of you, I hope you enjoyed that. I hope you have yourselves a good
week, and until next week, bye for now.

Experimental & Experiential Forces
Welcome to all of you. We enter into one of those areas in which the basic nature of
life is established and the basic nature of life on this plane is maintained. In that
sense we are looking at fundamental forces that drive us.
Experimental Experiential
Identification Expectation
Looking at the BodyGraph I talk a lot about the symmetries and how significant they
are. In a way, you can see that the collective forms what is, in a sense, the outer
shell. Wherever you look, the collective is always there as the outer shell. In a
sense, it is what's holding it all together. And in a way, that's so. It is the collective
that gives us our world, what I enjoy referring to as Solomon‘s World where nothing
is new under the Sun. This is the world that is maintained and contained by the
collective.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

We've already seen that it is in the collective that we have all the fundamentals or
the basics of life itself. We have the 15/5 which is the source of all life, which is the
logical aspect. We have the 41/30 and 36/35 which we‘re going to look at here spe-
cifically, but this is the human experiential way. This combination of our deep con-
nection to the pattern of life, to the rhythm and flow of life, and to the experiential
process of moving through this life, the very nature of our humanness is embedded
in the collective.
There‘s something else about the collective and I've mentioned this before as we‘ve
been moving through, that one of the things, particularly if you‘re relatively new to
Design, it is very helpful—Human Design is built upon layers of keynotes, actually
hierarchies of keynotes. When you're looking at a circuit it is very important to re-
member its keynote.
The Three Basic Circuits
Collective
Individual
Sharing
Empowerment
Tribal
Support
The Three Basic Circuits and Their Keynotes
We have three basic circuitries that run thematically in the vehicle. We have collec-
tive, we have individual, and we have tribal circuits. When we look for a keynote for
each of the circuits, as a general formula to describe them, with individuality we
have empowerment, with the tribe we have support, but when we‘re dealing with
the collective we have sharing. The collective is very California. It's all about shar-

ing. ―Let me share this with you.‖ And of course, what
in fact the collective is ready to share with you isn't al-
ways precisely what you would like; after all, that‘s
another side of the story, but nonetheless, it‘s the way
the collective works.
Individual
What makes the collective fascinating is that it is the
social nature of this construct of the holistic being. Yes,
there are other social channels [illustrated to the right].
That is, the individual social channel of the 12/22, the
tribal social channel of the 40/37 along with the repro- Tribal
ductive bonding that is there in the 59/6. But these are
highly specific, very, very specific, and very specific for
certain kinds of social function or social interaction. But
when we‘re dealing with the collective everything is so-
cial.
The Cross of Life
When you're looking at your design, the most important place to begin to look when
you're looking at the database is at the Sun/Earth and the North Node and the South
Node. This is what I first began to teach when I first started my career. This is
called the Cross of Life. And this is the basis upon which our lives are constructed.
That is, you have the vertical of the Sun/Earth [below, circled in blue.]
You have 70% of the neutrinos that are streaming down from this great life force.
And you have the Earth that receives it, that transforms it, that grounds it into what
is the life itself; that is, the possibility of the life. Then you have the horizontal, you
have the Nodes [below, circled in purple.] And the Nodes are moving you along a
track, a trajectory, a movement in space. So what we have in this Cross of Life is
this combination of the being and its movement.

We Are Not Designed to Be Alone
When you're looking at the Sun/Earth, through the Sun/Earth you get to see your
Profile and your Incarnation Cross. The Sun/Earth is a deeply personal. It is your
particular personality style, your line, your cross, whatever the case maybe; it‘s very
personal. But we are not here to be alone. We are not. As a matter of fact, within
the context of the program we are here to be conditioned. It's essential; you can
see it in our design. We are designed to be conditioned. And we are designed to be
conditioned by the imprinting forces; but more than that, obviously, we are designed
to be conditioned by each other.
What you are in terms of your Sun/Earth may be interesting, but in fact it does not
define your life or holistically who you are, and that is something very important to
grasp. It cannot. It cannot because we are not alone. We‘re not allowed to be
alone. It would be suicide for the species. This is not the way it works. We are
designed to be with the other. It is fundamental, and not in the same way that the
tribe says that. The tribe carries another responsibility. The tribe says we‘ve got to
make more; we‘ve got to make more.
No, it‘s something else. The life is all about the potential for the development of
consciousness. And the development of consciousness cannot happen alone, it can-
not. The collective is very much about the Throat.
There are more collective gates in the Throat
than anything else. It‘s about the Throat. It‘s
about the potential to be able to communicate to
each other, because it is our ability to communi-
cate with each other that has allowed us to triumph
on this plane. That is, triumph relative to the
terms of the strategic mind, survival. It is our
complex sophisticated communication that has
allowed us to conquer this planet, to be the top of
the heap. When we are looking at the collective, this is what the collective drives us
towards. It drives us towards sharing the life with the other and is deeply connected
to our Nodes.
Decision Making and the Nine-Centered Being
Think about what it means, what the very basis of Human Design is, which is about
decision making. We inherited dysfunction from the seven-centered being, that is,
making decisions with the mind. I can understand it in a way, because 90,000 years
ago mind was still a surprise; the fact that the world was expanding, the maia was
growing, language was evolving, mind was becoming something that was really,
really interesting. And the seven-centered being trusted mind completely. I think
therefore I am. Everything was mind. I decide, I know what's right for me, I under-

stand, I will take this action, I will do that thing, I will stop that, I will want that, I
will get this.
The moment you move away from being a seven-centered being to one of these
nine-centered beings that has a very, very complex cognitive potential that has nev-
er existed before, you're dealing with a vehicle that the only way in which it is going
to function correctly is if the decision making process is correct. That‘s the decision
making process that is rooted in the vehicle itself. Wherever you look in Human
Design you see symmetries and binaries and oppositions. None are more extraordi-
nary than seeing that there is this huge difference between the function of the Per-
sonality and the function of the Design.
We Are a Binary Consciousness
The Personality has no right to be responsible for decision making in this form. It
can‘t. When you're looking at your graph what you see is this binary between the
Personality information and the Design information. You are looking at two different
forms of consciousness potential. We are a binary consciousness. It is perhaps the
most revolutionary aspect of Human Design.
An interesting digression for a moment, but I like digressions: The Phoenicians.
They were a great people, they gave us our alphabet. They gave us the root, in a
sense, of our genius as a species. But the Phoenicians had something else that they
didn't give to us that nobody paid any attention to, and it has always been fascinat-
ing to me. The Phoenicians had a very strange idea about what a life was. They
believed that a being had two souls. One soul was what Christians would refer to as
that kind of soul, the soul of the being that is eternal, what in design is basically
what the Personality represents. But they believed in these two souls, one that be-
longed to the spirit and one that belonged to the body.
The Phoenicians who plied the waters of the Mediterranean and were a great seafar-
ing culture, they came and conquered the island of Ibiza thousands of years ago.
They were the majority people on the island for maybe a thousand years ago. They
built the foundation of the ancient walls of the main city on the island. And there are
Phoenician graveyards that still exist here. There is this wonderful curiosity that
they have two different graveyards, one that buries the spirit and one that is for the
body. Obviously, they are quite different in the way they are constructed.
It is not surprising, I guess, that thousands of years later I would have this expe-
rience here on this island, and by the way I never knew that history then, and be
told of the two souls. It strikes me as a fascinating thing that the Phoenicians who
were powerful enough to transform our whole communication system, and after all,
that alphabet, and yet at the same time, this extraordinary clarity they had about
the nature of our mystical being that nobody paid any attention to. It‘s one of those
fascinating sidebars.

Anyway, we are a binary consciousness. This is the great thing to grasp. And
they‘re not intended to do the same job. They're not. And of course, what we have
had is our Personality consciousness trying to do everything, being inner and outer
authority, and as a result becoming deeply dysfunctional.
So the thing to grasp about our nature is that when you're operating according to
your Strategy and Authority, the first thing that really happens to you is you get
aligned to the right direction. And that right direction is an alignment towards the
other, because the Nodes represent the other always. How to meet the other, where
to meet the other, how you see the other, how you see where you are. All of that
is brought to you by the Nodes so that as a being it is possible for you to be correct
in your encounter with the other.
The Collective Fulfills Our Collective Relationships on this Planet
So when we're looking at the collective, the thing to recognize about the nature of
the collective is that it is fulfilling this fundamental aspect that life is about our rela-
tionship to the other. And this is not about, necessarily, our personal relationship or
our tribal relationship, but this is our collective relationship on this planet. We get to
see that today in that we are living in an age where the collective actually rules. It
has taken a very, very long time for the collective to be able to exist because the
real collective is global.
Marshall McLuhan, a great thinker, when he postulated the terminology ―global vil-
lage,‖ actually in the late 50s but it became popularized in the 60s, this was really
the triumph of the collective. Collective principles are something that literally can
wrap itself around the whole planet, wrap itself over all of humanity. And of course,
we know there is a conflict in that, the conflict against so-called globalization, the
fear that is in political or religious groups that they are going to be overwhelmed by
collective principles that they don't necessarily agree with. And of course where the
drive is closed off and only friendly to its own, where the individual is only friendly
for those moments of potential mutation, the collective is always schmoozing. The
collective is always sharing. The collective is always there doing its work. And it‘s
very, very, very powerful.
The Collective Doesn’t Like Tribes or Individuals
It represents the dynamic of the way in which everything on this plane is supposed
to work according to collective. If you don't do things according to the collective,
they don't like you. The collective doesn't like tribes. It thinks tribes are primitive.
The collective doesn't like individuals. They think they're dangerous. The collective
wants everything to be socially harmonious. This is the collective. Let's share. And
by saying ―let‘s share,‖ it‘s saying something else, because remember we talk about
this within the context of the homogenized world, it says, ―let's agree.‖ Let's agree
that retarded children should be euthanized; it‘s better for the race. Or let's agree

that—those collective agreements can be frightening, they can be horrifying. And it
doesn't have to be something so mad.
Think about any modern nation we live in and think about the collective laws that are
established because they‘re collective laws; they are not laws that recognize the
idiosyncrasies of individuals. They are not laws that necessarily correspond to the
tribal laws. These are collective laws, and as collective laws there are always going
to be those who feel that they are disadvantaged or treated unfairly by that law.
I'm a smoker. I love to smoke. The collective law banning, trying to legislate these
kinds of things, to me it's just the collective meddling in the world. And yet, that‘s
what the collective does. And by the way, the collective within its own not-self prin-
ciples thinks it is doing the right thing. They think they are doing the right thing for
humanity, for the world; they do. It doesn't necessarily mean they are. But this is
the way in which the collective dominates.
The 58/18: The Channel of Judgment
So let's take a look and begin with the con-
struct. This is where you set up an experi-
ment. This is where you test things. This
is what this is all about. And once you have
a pattern, then you wait and see if it's real,
if it works, if it works in the real world, if it
can go from the theoretical to the possible.
When we begin with the logic, we also have
to understand that we are dealing with one
Experimental
of the most dynamic forces in terms of the
Identification rooting of logic.
One of the reasons I say that, the 58th gate
[black arrow] is a very unusual gate. It‘s
unusual because everything about the
splenic system logically, because the
Spleen is not a motor, logic is always
starved. Logic always has this problem, the
62 points at a non-motor, the 16 points to
a non-motor, and the 31 points to a non-
motor [green arrows.] Logical collective is
starved for energy. It's not like the ab-
stract, because the abstract collective goes
right down to a very, very hot motor indeed
[Solar Plexus.] So it means there's an
enormous amount of pressure, you‘ll par-
don my pun, enormous amount of pressure
on the 58 to be the ultimate pressure for
logic. And so what you get out of that, out

of The Joyous, its very foundation is that here is a resource of the love of life itself.
In other words, this is incredible vitality that is in the 58th gate.
One of the things that it says to us is that it's very, very difficult for everybody else
to compete with the collective, because when you look at the bottom of the Root on
either side, the 41 which is the great initiating gate that starts all processes that is
the root of the life experience, and the 58th gate that carries with it all of this funda-
mental vitality, there is enormous power in the streams. And because they share,
that 58 is going to share its vitality with you, it's going to share its energy with you.
It's not going to be in it alone. And of course, it becomes contagious, addictive.
We are dealing with logic; we are dealing with the depth of awareness and aware-
ness at its most sophisticated. Awareness begins here in the 50th gate [red circle.]
It moves out like a wave; frequency. And the awareness goes
from being instinct at the tribal level [green/lavender,] intuition
at the individual level [green,] and you get to this outside fre-
quency to the shell, you get to taste, you get to judgmentation
[lavender] and judgmentation is deeply, deeply collective, deeply,
deeply, deeply collective.
And here in this 18 you have this great gate of challenging. Think
about this channel. It is the channel of judgment, or not, satisfac-
tion or not. Most people think of it as dissatisfaction because the
18th gate is the gate of the awareness of what is not right in the
pattern. And it is a great gate of challenging, but all of this is a
force of ―we must find satisfaction.‖ This is the driving force of
logic.
Logic Can Find Satisfaction
Only logic can find satisfaction. You teach a child how to add or subtract. And you
will see this incredible joy in the power of logic. It is an incredible thing to master
the patterns. There is this enormous satisfaction when the pattern is right and it
works, like putting the last piece into a jigsaw puzzle, the satisfaction that the pat-
tern is right. The abstract never knows this. It wants it terribly. And because so
much of the abstract is sexual, it carries with it is deep dissatisfaction. But logic
wants the satisfaction and it wants everybody to be satisfied. It wants everybody to
agree that the pattern is satisfying. It‘s never alone in that. It never challenges
alone.
The 48/16: The Channel of Talent
This is the channel of talent [see below.] This is a channel of logic talent. It is about
the perfection of pattern. It's about its perfection. And the dilemma of perfection is
that perfection, to get to perfection, can be incredibly boring. Have you ever watch-
ed a child learn to play an instrument? There is this dream and wonder of what the

instrument can actually sound like. And then there's the
ordeal of the logical process that says you have to prac-
tice over and over and over and over and over and over
again. As a matter of fact, you never stop, ever.
Experimental
Identification As a musician, I've played certain pieces thousands of
times, thousands of times over and over and over again.
This is quite something, this force. All of it is about iden-
tification. If there a theme that belongs to the logical
forces, it is this theme of being identified, this identifica-
tion. It's so interesting, if you go to the East, they will
say, ―do not identify.‖ And yet, the reality is that if you're
going to be able to operate logically, there is no way, no
way at all that you can perfect that pattern without deep
identification because without the identification you can-
not go through the repetition, because it never stops.
There is always this movement towards perfection, but
what is perfect?
You can play the piece a thousand times; you can play it beautifully, but is it perfect?
Not if you‘re logical. If you‘re logical it can be satisfying, but it's still not perfect.
You're identified with the magic of the formula. This is talent. This is why they say
that talent is 1% gift and 99% hard work, because it's the repetition.
This is the thing that makes the logical being so different from the abstract being;
the logical being by its very nature through the format is focused and concentrated
on some thing, deeply identified with it. It doesn't have to be the arts, after all. The
16th gate is the gate of skills. It‘s about the skills for being in the world. It's about
the skills to be able to deal with the world.
The 48th gate in its depth, this is the depth for what the world is. It's all about work-
ing on these corrections, perfections. These are the people who are constantly—
you're aware of them all the time, in the political life of any community, those people
who are always behind the improvements of this and that and the other; it's always
improvement. The logical influence in marketing and advertising, this new and im-
proved; it‘s new and improved, it‘s a better pattern. We are so identified with giving
you the best damn toothpaste that this is our 107th version and isn‘t really the best
yet. This is the process.
Logic is Experimental
Because this is the logical force, these forces determine the way in which we live our
lives and what we will challenge, what we will correct, what we will put our depth to,
what skills we will develop for living in this world. This is the experimental. And so
much of the experimental is simply saying, ―Look, the pattern is not right, we have
to fix the pattern.‖ But that fixing of the pattern, it still doesn't mean that that‘s it.
It doesn't, because this focus of logic, there is this huge gap between the logic and

the abstract. This is the great cosmic monkey.
This is the spanner in the works. This is the
thing that changes everything; that is, the 30th
gate [circled in black.]
The 18th gate is very specific [circled in red.] It
challenges authority, period, any authority. And
once it has that authority that it challenges,
that's what it's going to be focused on. That's
going to be the thing that it works on. And there
is this possibility for satisfaction. There is this
possibility that the challenge is valid, that this
valid challenge leads to a new depth that ulti-
mately results in a new skill that results in a new
way in which the logical pattern can be lived out.
And for that being who is an 18 who sees the dirt under the rug and can get to the
16 and have it cleaned out, there is satisfaction, even if it's only momentary, there is
satisfaction, because it's logical—if you do this, this and that, you‘re going to get
there. Logic loves that.
If you go down to the train station and you‘ve got a ticket, the train is going to be
there when the ticket says it'll be there; this is logic. And it‘s very satisfied when all
of these things work the way they are intended to work. This is how we organize our
world. This is the power of the collective.
The 30th Gate: The Fates
But the 30th gate; the 30th gate [circled in black] says to
the 41st gate [circled in blue,] ―Excuse me, but you're not
Experiential
going to get any satisfaction, because you think you've
Expectation
got this fantasy of yours that you want to focus on and
I'm telling you that where you think you're going you‘re
never going to get there.‖ That‘s the fates. It‘s what the
30th gate always does. It says there's no logic here, so
forget about logic.
There are all these abstract collective beings who go
around trying to be logical. ―If I do this, this and this,
I‘m going to get there.‖ They‘re stuck in expectation.
―If I do this, that and the other, I‘m going to get there.‖
And the 30th gate says, ―Excuse me, sorry, no it doesn‘t
work that way. You‘re going to have to deal with the
unexpected, you're going to have to deal with the fates,
you‘re going to have to deal with something getting in
your way, you‘re going to have to deal with things not working the way you think
they're supposed to work. That's logic.‖

Experimental & Experiential Forces
The Abstract Discovers Possibilities within the Pattern
The fantastic thing about the abstract is that because it's not logical, it discovers so
many things that are there within the possibility of any pattern. After all, no matter
how much the collective would like us to be homogenized—and that‘s the way the
collective operates—we are not, no matter how much it wants us all to be satisfied
by the same thing. The collective says, ―Here is this wonderful product and every-
body is going to be happy with this, and everybody is going to be satisfied.‖ And
they‘re really annoyed when people aren't satisfied. You're supposed to be satisfied.
You know those famous failed collective societies in the 20th century, the so-called
Communist countries, and the homogenized collective where everybody is satisfied.
And of course, it‘s a myth. It doesn't exist. You have an election and 99.7% vote
for you, the great homogenized society, everybody deeply satisfied with the pattern,
well, that‘s not life. And of course, the moment you cut underneath the propaganda
of that and you go over onto this [abstract experiential] side, you get to see it's not
what you think it is, because this is where the real life is lived out.
In some ways, this is so much of trying to put your finger in the hole in the dyke, to
keep some kind of sanity in our societies because you can see if you move down the
hierarchical ladder in terms of material well-being and nations in the world, you be-
gin to see how quickly the logical side breaks down and disappears so that you end
up with countries that have very little infrastructure, and this [logic] represents in-
frastructure, and so much of them is dominated by the abstract side.
And of the course, in most of those cases, the main theme is going to be tribal. It‘s
only in the most sophisticated societies where you see the dominance of the logical
side structuring the pattern for the way in which society is supposed to operate. This
is where the basic rules of living in a modern society are established. And everybody
is supposed to be satisfied.
Of course, we know that this is what drives our modern political systems. Every
election year in every democratic country has the same thing. You have one saying
their pattern didn't work, it‘s not good enough and we have to improve the pattern
because people aren't satisfied, and if you vote for me you‘re going to be satisfied.
It‘s the same stuff over and over and over again. It‘s the ongoing process of trying
to better the society.
But remember, it's always, in a sense, an experiment, because you don't really know
what the promises of the logical pattern that any politician offers you, you don't
know how it's going to turn out until you get to see it, until it's actually worked with.
And then you see all the problems, the kinds of things where governments set up a
program and it is a disaster because they simply didn't construct it in a way in which
experientially it was actually going to work. There is often a deep, deep conflict
between these two sides, because the logic can often be threatened by the experien-

tial because the experiential says, ―Hey wait a minute, your formula is wrong. You
say it‘s supposed to be 1, 2, 3, 4 and I'm telling you it's not.‖
The Experiential Process
Of all life forces we can look at in the BodyGraph, this really, in a sense, is the most
important one for us as human beings. For me, there are two basic constructs in the
BodyGraph that speak to the essence of our humanness. That is, integration where
we have the deep empowerment of intuition and form to lead to survival in the now
so that we have the power of individual mutative survival [see lecture 3.] And on
the other side we have the human experiential way, this collective journey through
life and the collective journey through life in the now. It is one of the things about
the collective process, despite the fact that it is about the collecting of experience
and ultimately it means that it is very much about the past and about detailing our
history, yet at the same time in order to have a good history you have to have good
presence in the now while history is happening in order to record it later.
One of the things about the abstract is the need for it to be so absorbed in its expe-
rience. This is its kind of focus, different from the pattern focus, but at the same
time this deep absorption in the feeling, because we're talking about an emotional
stream as opposed to what is a splenic stream, cool, rooted in awareness.
The 41/30: The Channel of Recognition of Feelings
Here we‘re dealing with the hot and we‘re dealing
with the wave motor function and we‘re dealing with
a very, very dynamic force. We are dealing with the
Experiential theme of desire. This is not taste or judgmentation,
Expectation this is just desire. And that 41st gate [circled in
blue,] like the 58th gate, because they are so impor-
tant, where the 58th gate gives this focused vitality to
working with the pattern, here you have this incredi-
ble energy to be, just to be.
This is one of the deepest sources of life. It‘s the
root of it. It is the initiating codon. It is an incredi-
bly powerful force. And of course, this force is the
root of our experiential process; every experience
has to go through the 30th gate [circled in black,],
has to go through the fire, the clinging fire. Remem-
ber that this is a channel of a recognition of feelings.
This is a force to recognize what an experience is at
the deepest level. Not a formula that says this bus
can hold 92 people, but the experience of what it's
like to be on a bus with 92 people and you realize
that's many, too many people to be allowed as a maximum on that bus. Theoretical-

ly, they all fit in, but you've got to experience it. And it is about recognizing through
feeling. The recognition isn't necessarily something that is there immediately.
Again, so much about the experiential process is about being able to look back after
is the experience. But you have to see that this feeling, feeling it, living it, is not
something theoretical, is not something that is just a pattern. This is about feeling
it, living it, breathing it. It‘s a dynamic that roots all of us. One of the things that
human beings have often commented on is how tenacious we hold onto life. We
have all kinds of records now of human beings who have been put through horrend-
ous situations and still survive, still had that desire for life. And it's this desire for
life that you've got here in this 41. This is an incredible power.
The 30th Gate and Its Lines
So, when you're looking at the 41/30, when you're looking at this recognition
through feeling, it‘s that one has to feel one's way through life. You‘ve got to take it
in; you‘ve got to take in the full experience of what it's to be there. And more than
that, the 30th gate is one of those great continuity gates because a line of the 30th
gate will always tell you the way in which you are intended to deal with that. That
is, if you look at your Personality profile, your Personality line, you match that line to
any of the six lines of the 30th gate that is in resonance, the same line. And that
becomes a thematic for you. So, for me it's irony, I‘m a 5th line Personality. This is
what I get to feel about life. This is what I get to recognize. I get to feel the ironies,
the irony of the way in which a logical pattern ends up being so bizarre when you get
to see lived out by dysfunctional human beings.
The 35/36: The Channel of Transitoriness
The channel of transitoriness, the jack of all trades, the bufon de mil caminos, the
fool of a thousand miles. It‘s amazing how many
cultures have this expression, this jack-of-all-trades Experiential
expression. It was interesting because when the Rave
Expectation
I‘Ching was first being translated into different lan-
guages I was always curious because so much of it is
very specialized language and phrases and whatever
in the original English. But this was one of those
phrases that seemed to have a universal quality to it.
It is an attribute of how fundamental this is to life
itself. This is the channel of transitoriness. This is the
channel of change. This is life. This is its great
movement.
The thing that is so interesting about this channel is
that it is filled with the potential of excitement. There
is something deeply exciting in the abstract process that carries with it this desire,
this strength of the feeling of what life can be, how deeply that can be experienced

physically. After all, we‘re dealing with the emotional system, the pleasure and the
pain, how deep the experience of life can be felt, and that life isn't just a pattern of
how to get from A to B. It's, wow, getting there is the whole thing. The journey for
the abstract is everything, because when they get to the end of it they are always
disappointed, because there is no satisfaction, because they are not logical. There is
only experience, this great tool for the future.
It is the collective that allows us to be able to merge our collective history, all of the
knowledge that we have assembled, and be able to have that available to be able to
look at where we can go. After all, these collective circuits, despite the fact that they
are this and that, they are the same. All ―this and that‘s‖ are the same. It‘s just
angles of perception. The collective process is a singular process within the holistic
construct of what it is to be a human being. And it is this collective that establishes
our world; the way it functions. This is what we have the deepest connection to out
of the social power of all of this.
The 36th Gate
When we look at the transitoriness of the 35/36, the first thing is about the 36.
Again, it is always one of those things to always look at symmetries because they
are fascinating in the insights that they can give you. We know that the 48th gate is
the gate of depth. Well, so is the 36th gate. People always think the 36th gate is the
gate of crisis. It is one of its keys. It is, in fact, the gate of inexperience. And yet,
it does not suffer from the kind of inadequacy, primal inadequacy that the 48th gate
can deal with. Oh, there is inadequacy here. Most of it gets experienced in the sex-
uality of this. But the fact is this gate of inexperience. Its ability is to penetrate the
surface. It's not the well deep, deep down. It is this penetration of a surface that
nobody imagined could be penetrated. It‘s the breakthrough at the abstract level, to
crack through, to go from inexperience to experience, to go from ―I‘ve got to do it, I
have to do, oh, oh, I really have to do this,‖ to finally ―I did it; been there, done
that, put it in my history.‖
This is an incredible power, this power to penetrate the surface, to break through, to
go from inexperienced to experience. And it says a great deal about us as beings. It
doesn't matter whether you have this or not, we are designed to be conditioned. We
all have receptors to the 36th gate in us. We only experience it within the collective
nature of our planet. It's something to see how powerful a force this is in humans.
We are not stuck on the splenic side. On the splenic side you get a pattern, you stay
with it.
You look at mammals; if you do anything to disturb their pattern they‘re really upset.
They‘re deeply upset. They‘ve got these very, very fixed things and fixed ways and
fixed diet and fixed territory and all of these things. But it makes them deeply vul-
nerable. My favorite is the panda bear that can only eat one particular rare kind of
bamboo shoot, only one kind of rare bamboo shoot. It‘s not very difficult to see how
easy it is for that creature to become extinct.

Experimental & Experiential Forces
The thing about the 36th gate is that it says that we are not going to accept, because
the fates won‘t let us anyway, we are not going to accept that there is only one way.
We're not going to accept any of that. We just want experience and were going to
go get it. And of course, you can see that that can lead to crisis. Any of us who
have been inexperienced at something, the first time that we try it, you can end up
with a crisis, you can have a problem. This is part of the whole way in which the
experiential teaches us. It‘s not an imposed doctrine and formula, because that's
what the collective logic does. It imposes the pattern on everyone. What the ab-
stract does is that it lives. And in the very living of its life, there is this vast diversity
that emerges because we are all unique. And we will all experience the world in
slightly different ways from the standard, whatever that standard happens to be.
The 35th Gate
The great dilemma for the abstract process is that it doesn't get to the same place as
logic. And yet, there is the symmetry. In the logic we get to a place of the expres-
sion and expression of skills, the ability to develop new skills, to articulate new skills.
But the dilemma for the 35 is that the expectation is never fulfilled. Remember I
told you that through the 16,
through identification, this is
the only way in which true
mastery and perfection can
happen in the logical process
because it demands deep,
deep long-lasting repetition,
which takes an enormous
amount of identification.
On the other side, the 35 is
very unusual chemically.
This expectation is something
that is always, always pain-
ful. It's painful. And it
drives this whole cycle. I
used to describe in the very
early years the 41st gate as a
fuel gauge like you have a
car, and a fuel gauge that
points to empty, and the 35
is a fuel gauge that points to
full. The fact is that the 41,
all it wants to do is fill up the
tank. It wants to get its desired experience. And when it gets to the top and it's had
that experience, it immediately empties out again and starts this process all over
again. And it's almost invariably accompanied by a crash. And whether that crash is
a big, deep crash or it's sort of a thin little crash, it always comes with some level of,
―I wasn't completely satisfied.‖

The Abstract Is Never Satisfied
It‘s quite a thing. The abstract is constantly driven back to a new experience. It
can‘t get satisfaction. If it‘s given satisfaction, there would be no more new expe-
riences. It's not logic. Logic is there to finally get to a pattern that ―this is it, this is
a relative absolute now, this pattern works‖ and you can get to that place of satisfac-
tion, you can get to that place where you finally play that piece in a way that you can
stop, because you played it. But here, no; it‘s why the abstract process can feel so
cruel sometimes. It just never stops. You‘re never allowed the satisfaction. You‘re
never allowed that. There‘s always something. There's always something that just—
but I wish.
And of course, because it's abstract and because it's collective, it's always about the
other, always about the other; always. And it always ends up with, ―I could have
been satisfied if I hadn't done this with you.‖ But it's always drawn back over and
over and over again to more and more experiences. Look at our species. At this
point in our development what exactly is it we haven't done? There are zillions and
zillions and zillions of experiential processes that have taken place in this plane. It‘s
really amazing. Look at YouTube, whoa.
The Potential to Differentiate
This is us. And in the end, the beauty of the abstract is that it points to a great mys-
tery that we‘re all a part of. And that is that human beings came into this world with
the potential to differentiate, to be absolutely unique. And in that uniqueness, to be
able to experience life in a way that does or does not have anything to do with col-
lective principles. And the abstract points towards that. It always reminds us that,
yeah, there are patterns, but you never really know what the outcome is going to be.
You're never really sure.
In the end, what you learn is that you have a certain ability to be able to move along
this plane differently from others, differently from the general rule. It points towards
our uniqueness. After all, as the human experiential way, ultimately it points us
towards what is possible for us. It‘s like Human Design in its appeal to the collective.
After all, this is a global environment; it is global knowledge. It appeals directly, in
that sense, at a collective level. And Human Design says, well, experiment and see
what the experience is, and see if they hold together, because this is what it's about.
It‘s something for us to understand so deeply about these forces as they mold the
world: They do not operate correctly. The rules of the road are given to us by the
not-self. The experiential guide that we need from the history of experience from
others is an experience that's operating through homogenization and through the
mental decision making of the not-self. The real value of any given pattern, the real
value of any experiential way is not something that's part of the public domain, and

is only something that now can begin to emerge with the correctness of beings who
have entered into this experiment to live out the experience.
Well, that's it for today, I hope you enjoyed that. To all of you, you take care, and
until next time, bye for now.

The Mutating Forces
Individuality is a Creative Force
All right, we come to mutation and we come to the mutative forces. We looked at
the collective forces, the experiential and the experimental. Here we‘re looking at
really the central theme of our potential, because that's what individuality really
represents at its deepest level, is that it represents our potential. That is, our poten-
tial is not determined by the experiment or the experience that it is a creative
process, and it is a creative
process that is rooted in mutation
and that everything about the
nature of being and everything
about the nature of a bio-form is
that mutation is something that is
always possible.
When one recognizes that indivi-
duality carries with it a deep crea-
tive aspect to it that this is what
truly enriches the life, it‘s what
gives the life value, in a sense. It
is one thing to be able to work
with patterns or to go through
experience, this is testing the
world. The whole thing about
individuality is that it is a deeply
creative force, and it is not held
within the constraints of the
world, to be metaphorical.
Knowing Often Has No Way of Expressing Itself
These are very unusual forces. And these are the forces that drive the dynamic that
in a sense underlines the presence of Human Design in the world. That is, the possi-
bility of the establishment of unique absolutes, the perfection that is possible in the
differentiation of a single being, any single being, that that is the Holy Grail of our
consciousness pursuit to be able to stand as pure absolute authorities within our-

selves. And in so many ways this is its expression in a sense within the BodyGraph.
That is, genetically within us is a potential, a deep driving mutative potential to bring
us to a place of knowing. And knowing is something that is very deep. It is not like
understanding or making sense out of things. Knowing often has no way of express-
ing itself.
It‘s so interesting to see the dilemma of how difficult it is to express knowing, be-
cause knowing is unique. It‘s not based on a pattern. It's not based on an expe-
rience. It simply exists or not. And of course, this is the pulse of what individuality
is, that pulse that originates deep here in the connection between the Root Center
and the Sacral in the format, the 3/60, this mutative format, this pulse, this there
and not, and there and not.
Here the symmetry is almost perfect.
That is, the symmetry of ―this and
that.‖ And yet, it is so interesting
because it is so different, and yet it is
so similar. Over here we have the big
―N‖ word. We have the Now. Now—
this thing that is and is not, because
any now disappears the moment that
you think you have it, because we‘re
moving, this endless Now. It's really
about presence. And on the other
side we have the big ―W,‖ we've got
the Wave.
The now is rooted in the Spleen, be-
cause the Spleen says look, if you're
going to survive you have to be able
to make decisions instantly, magical-
ly. This is the incredibly fast
processing system of the Spleen. It‘s incredibly fast in processing information; it has
to be. And so everything out of the splenic system resonates, it vibrates to this im-
mediacy, this tension of being in the now.
The 20/57 “I Am”
And what is there in the now? What is the root of the now? It is this ―I am.‖ This is
being alive. It is the self-recognition of life. After all, this is part of very, very primi-
tive infrastructure in the BodyGraph, this channel, the 20/57. Obviously, there is a
deep relationship in it, as well, to the whole process of integration and the bedrock of
what it is to be a bio-form that can survive on this plane. And more than that, how
profound the influence of the Spleen in eventually being able to establish the cogni-
tive alignment of the way in which the Ajna Center, of the way in which our concep-
tualizing G Center is going to work.

The Mutating Forces
This is very, very deep and old within us, this ―I am‖ and it has a voice. You see this
in the mammal, because in mammalian design the 20/57 is there. And it is that
voice, that sound that the mammal makes, whatever the mammal may be, whether
it is sheep or dog or cow or whatever, that expression of ―I exist, I exist, I exist.‖
This is our ―I am.‖ And yet, our ―I am‖ is not as fundamental and mundane as simp-
ly the auditory expression of existence that the dog makes when it barks. I‘ve had
dogs all my life. And you dig into any kind of research on dogs and the one thing
that nobody understands is why they bark, what it is for. It‘s an ―I am.‖ It‘s in their
context of ―I exist, I exist, I exist.‖
The 28/38
We‘re more complex than that. I think one of the most fascinating channels for me,
because I am an integration person, is the 28/38. This is an incredible force. First
of all, think about integration. When somebody has integration they‘re really caught
up in their own trip. These are
the most deeply selfish beings
that exist. They‘re totally into
their own trip. It‘s not their fault,
by the way, but what to do.
They‘re focused on their unique
in-the-now survival. You meet a
20/34 when they're doing some-
thing, it's very, very hard to get
their attention. I‘m into my thing
and I‘m into my thing now and
I'm lost in that.
And the fact is that when you look
at this within the nature of human
sexuality, for example, the nature
of caring, you see that this is
totally absorbed in oneself; total-
ly, totally absorbed. I care for
myself; I care for my own exis-
tence. But the moment you bring
the 28/38, this totally self-absorbed selfish individuality, and specifically the 20/57,
suddenly is ready to pay attention to the other, is suddenly ready to care for the
other. And why, what magic does this bring?
I‘ve watched it all my life. I have this channel in lover‘s children; I've seen it in
every possible way. The 28th gate, particularly, I'm a 20/57/10 and the 28th gate in
my life is one of those things that is there wherever I look. I have nothing in this
channel, so I‘ve had a very interesting process in looking at that and watching that
over the years. And you look at this 28/38, this force, this is the Channel of Strug-
gle. People often forget that Human Design is a deep, deep, deep dualistic system

that every single channel can be understood by its opposite. This does not have to
be the Channel of Struggle. But it struggles for something.
This is what gives life its meaning. The meaning of life is not derived from the pat-
tern or the experience. This is what we do over and over and over and over and
over again, because it is the plane that we‘re on. This is something deeper than
that. This is what gives life its meaning. There is an inherent, not so much search
here, but a demand, in a sense, that existence is more than just being born and
dying, that there‘s something else. And this is what the 28/38 brings. It brings this
incredible struggle to find purpose.
The “I Am Because”
Integration says, ―Hey I‘m cool man, I‘m alive, I can survive.‖ And the 28/38 comes
along and says, Yeah, but isn't there more? There has to be more. It can‘t just be
that we are here just to survive.‖ This is the thing that makes this force so extraor-
dinary. And it‘s mutative, it‘s individual, it‘s in the pulse. At any moment the strug-
gle can end. It ends in purpose. It ends with a corollary or an addition to the ―I
am.‖ It is the great ―because.‖ Oh, how human beings are addicted to ―because,‖
it‘s funny.
So the ―I am‖ becomes ―I am here because,‖ oh how good that ―because‖ feels. This
is the power of the force of the 28/38, the power of this struggle for purpose, to give
the monotony of turning on the wheel some glamour, some romance, and some art.
For me, this is how the savage got dressed up. It's beautiful in a way, this play, this
drama, this movie.
What is purpose, after all, but a costume that you wear? In Design we call it your
Profile, your Cross, to get there, to find your ―because.‖ And in doing so, moving
further and further and further away from the basic I am, that basic I am that says, I
just am, and that‘s my glory. The ancient primitive ―I am now,‖ this is it; nothing
else. This is the ―I am‖ that says, I need no purpose, I am purpose. And the 28/38
says, not enough. I‘ve got another mutation for you, not enough; ―I am because‖;
and everything changes.
The collective and the tribe are very uncomfortable with individuality. It fucks things
up. It really does. And the moment that the individual ―because‖ becomes a general
mutation, the collective has to deal with it, has to learn a new trick. Old dogs hate
new tricks. And the world is always changing. And because this is art, it is never
fixed. It's not like the pattern of logic. It's not like the experiential history. It‘s art;
the art of being human.
I try to teach you a new art form, the art of being a nine-centered being, this ―be-
cause.‖ It‘s an art. And when I say that, to understand that the most deeply crea-
tive thing you're ever going to do is to discover you. There is nothing more creative.
And in doing so, a new artifice emerges. For me, this is all a drama. There are good
actors and actresses, and there are poor ones. There are great scripts and there are

The Mutating Forces
lousy scripts. There are wonderful sets. There are all kinds of things. It is a drama,
after all. And we are characters in this play, each and every one of us; characters
without distinction is the world, homogenized characters, the flotsam and jetsam of
the background of any kind of drama who never get to be stars, who never get the
good dialogue, who never get the big credits.
The whole consciousness movie is the same thing. I've watched the history of pur-
pose. There is no absolute in it. It is just the driving mutative force constantly driv-
ing individuality towards its ultimate expression, which is its own uniqueness through
its own Inner Authority. This ―I am,‖ we are characters. How well do we fulfill the
potential of these characters? You look at your Cross, your Profile, how well do you
fit into that costume, because we are given within the mechanics of Design where
this purpose leads to.
And without it, if you don't find your ―because,‖ and look at the world around you,
the homogenized world is what people are chasing. They‘re chasing a purpose.
Some of it is very, very, very, very mundane just to be able to have enough. But
they‘re all chasing homogenized purpose, to be able to put something after that ―I
am,‖ it's not just simply ―I am.‖ This is my reason for being. I am here to—you
know; that‘s why so many people end up with religion as their only answer, because
they don't know how to complete this sentence. They don't know how to go ―I am
because.‖ They don't know where to go. They take all the homogenized concepts
that are floating around and they grasp onto it.
Because the way this works in reality out there in the world, this is individuality. It is
deeply melancholic. The normal expression of creative purpose is not something
that is natural to the not-self. They simply suffer under the pain of being different.
And they live with their depression and their depression becomes their ―I am.‖ It
becomes their character. It is the sad one. Every story has these characters, the
ones that are adrift, the ones that can see no purpose, the ones that can see no
meaning, see no value. The ones to which ―I am‖ is just unfair.
The “I Can”
It gets much more powerful when you go over to the emotional side, if such a thing
can be more powerful, because I am giving it its appropriate drama today. I guess
you can taste that. So the ―I am‖ is so that the ―I can know in the now.‖ It‘s really
what it's about. It is to know that answer in the now, to know that reason, that
purpose in the now. But this is something else. This is ―I can‖; not ―I am.‖ ―I know
I can, I know I can,‖ however, ―I know I can‖ in a wave. It‘s hard to find knowing in
a wave. It is a symmetry, after all. These life forces here are really something.
Here we have this incredible channel of struggle for purpose, and here we have this
incredible channel of struggle for spirit, because that's what it is. Oh, the language
is the language of moodiness; yes, yes. But that's what it is.
It is a struggle to find the spirit. This is not about finding the purpose. Remember
that we are never just one theoretical aspect that I happen to point my finger at.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

This is a complex matrix, and it has many formulas within any of its circuitry or its
streams. But it's something to grasp here about what the individual contribution is
to the life itself. Remember that it is the central theme of the BodyGraph. That is, it
is the central dynamic; it is the direction, the mutation. It is the movement. It is
the way that we go, because this is about life.
Purpose and Spirit
And of course the thing to recognize is that these two aspects that are presented to
us by these life forces that they become the basic ingredient in whether or not we
are going to be comfortable in our lives or not. The cliché would be to say, ―Are we
going to be happy or sad,‖ but that's the cliché. It really
isn‘t about that. It is about whether one is okay with
existence or not, because in the end that's what it really
comes down to, this combination of purpose and spirit.
And this spirit is part of the answer that individuality is
trying to express in the Throat. There is nothing more
complex than individuality in the Throat; that is, of the 11
gates of the Throat, 4 of them are individual voices. So it
is the dominant voice of the Throat. And you can see
that in this, this ―I know I can make a contribution,‖ ―I
know that I can explain to you what you need to know,‖ that this ability to contri-
bute, this ability to be able to structure is dependent on whether or not there is a
purpose and the spirit to go with it, because it's altogether.
When you see it is a formula within the way in which it works within humanity as
forces that, this is the formula: purpose and spirit. This is the fundamental underly-
ing mutative transformation that is built into everyone as a possibility. And yet, at
the same time, you have to see that it's creative. It's creative.
Our Dualistic Experience
I‘ll digress for a moment. When I think about the nature of life, it is clear to me as a
dualist that this experience of being alive, that this is a deeply dualistic experience.
There are two things at work. There is the body, the form, the brain and everything
that goes with it. There is this vehicle, and it has a life within a program. It is a
form moving in space. It has a geometry. It has all kinds of obvious potentials.
And then there's a passenger, this personality consciousness that somehow is em-
bedded inside of this interesting meat package. And the moment that you are con-
vinced that the life is your life is the moment you‘re lost, and you never get to live
the drama, and you never find the purpose or the spirit.
This BodyGraph describes the holistic vehicle, the way in which it operates. Each
and every one of us is here as passenger consciousness to be able to release our-
selves from anything other than being the observer of the phenomena, and the phe-

The Mutating Forces
nomena is you. I am an observer of the phenomena that‘s Ra. I‘m just an observer.
And in that I see what it is, what happens to it, the way it operates, because it is an
―it‖; it is.
Purpose and Spirit are Themes for the Vehicle
When we think about these themes of purpose and spirit, they are themes of pur-
pose and spirit for the vehicle, because there's no other way to get there. Oh, do
human beings suffer, oh do they suffer; they‘re very messed up. It‘s all the mind.
It's endlessly the mind. It‘s the claptrap and bullshit of the mind, the deep, deep,
deep manipulation of the mind. And you get stuck. You get stuck trying to run this
thing, and then you become caught in this painful, painful struggle to find a purpose
you cannot find, and a spirit that you will never have. And it brings this deep ma-
laise and sadness into life.
For me it is so clear that you only find your purpose and your spirit when you are
released from trying to figure out what the hell that is, because it's only your mind
playing with you. You don't know until the vehicle lives it. It‘s the vehicle's life.
And here we have this deep, deep struggle within us for spirit.
The Solar Plexus Mutation
You cannot talk about this part of the BodyGraph without understanding that it‘s
responsible for the most profound mutation and coming mutation in our history. The
mutation of the larynx in the 12th gate that opened up the possibility of the articula-
tion of sound formulas, and now the mutation that's taking place in the Solar Plexus
Center through the 55th gate and
the 49th gate. This stream is so
deeply, deeply, deeply mutative.
And there's something interesting,
obviously, that‘s at work here in
this mutation that is taking place
in the 55. The Root Center has a
very, very unusual relationship to
the emotional system. That is,
the Root Center is a pressure on
the emotional system to stop
being in a wave. That‘s what that
pressure is all about coming out of
the root. It‘s trying to lock; it‘s
trying to fix the Solar Plexus sys-
tem.
And in a sense, the mutation, to
be simple, that's taking place in
The Life Force is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

117
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
the Solar Plexus is about the elimination of the dominance of the motor wave, the
motor wave that has given us what we call the emotional field and the distortion that
has arisen out of the wave process of the emotional field. There's obviously a trans-
formation that is taking place within the Solar Plexus, and that transformation is
deeply going to impact this wave pattern.
As it is, individuality is not an emotional quality that exhibits strong wave pattern.
That is, it tends to plane. It tends to operate at relatively the same frequency and
will go through periods of peaks, whether those are rising up or falling down peaks,
but generally speaking, it can actually be quite flat in the way in which the emotional
field is put out from this system. That obviously is the power of the impact of the
39, to begin with.
The fact that the 55 is in mutation, the reality is that this struggle for spirit is some-
thing that is changing. I think that it is one of the things that is so satisfying to the
individual aspects that are inherent in anybody's design, after all, there's more indi-
viduality than anything else in the BodyGraph. Most human beings have at least a
gate that belongs to an individual stream or circuit. This is our link to change. This
is our link to being able to adapt, because that's really what it's about. It‘s the
deepest capacity within us to survive.
And more than that, any individual aspect within you resonates to what is at the core
of this knowledge, which is to liberate the unique being so that you can stand on
your own Authority and to be able to function in this life in which that purpose and
spirit emerges. It‘s like those old stories about if you go looking for wisdom you can
end up writing a good travel book. Those things that you seek, they have a way of
hiding from you. It is about knowing how to exist that allows purpose and spirit to
emerge.
Signature
The other night, on Sunday Cathy [Kinnaird] did her introduction to Type and Signa-
ture; by the way, I enjoyed that Cathy. Signature is something that's really so im-
portant to grasp, because it is the great promise. And it is in the Signature that
literally you find—it is the by-product of your realization of purpose and spirit. It is.
The Generator that finds satisfaction has found purpose and spirit relative to that
experience in that moment, in that place in the movement. But of course, this is
what individuality tells you all the time anyway. It says the now is forever. The now
is forever. Well, as far as forever goes. But that's what the now is.
This beauty of what this life force brings, and to understand these two forces, this is
what gives life its character, its potential for character. It is an underlying theme of
differentiation that is there in the BodyGraph. It says: I have to have a purpose; not
we, not you, not us; I, my purpose, my spirit, my creativity. We are art. This is
what individuality teaches us. It's what so beautiful about us. It's art imitating life;
or something like that.

LECTURE EIGHT
The Mutating Forces
The 12/22
In human sexuality, the 12/22 is all about romance, about poetry and words, basi-
cally. And whether the words are just prose or fine poetry, whether the words are
riding on top of a musical frequency; after all, individuality carries with it a deep
musicality to it, it is acoustic in
nature. And it says that one of
the ways in which we express our
spirit must be in our language,
must be in the beauty that is
possible in the way in which we
can communicate with each other.
It can be something very, very
extraordinary, in that sense.
For me, it points to what I talk
about in terms of the potential of
each human being in terms of
their Outer Authority. To meet
pure Outer Authority, to be able
to communicate two beings out of
their pure Outer Authority is a
kind of contact that it is an ideal;
it‘s not something that exists.
Human beings, despite the fact
that we know how to speak, we have enormous dilemmas in being able to communi-
cate—talk, talk, talk—but our ability to communicate, that‘s something else.
And it's not about how many words. Sometimes words, you don't need many. It's
not about that. It's about understanding that we are here to express our presence,
and we are here to do so creatively. It always reminds me of family sitting by the
fire and the father is telling a story and in the middle of the story his child interrupts
and says, is that true, and his mother smacks him gently on the back of the head
and says, don't interrupt, it's just a story.
Life Needs Drama
Life needs drama. You go back into the most primitive societies; they had their way
of creating dramas, organized dramas, whether they were pretending to be some
kind of animal. We need drama. Why do you think there is so much hyperbole in
history, so much puffery, so much this and that, so many lies? But we need the
drama. And of course, for me there are two ways of looking at this. I see the drama
as it emerges in the homogenized world through the not-self. It's not exactly deli-
cious, but it is something to understand about us.

119
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
And when I say that we are here to dramatize our lives, what I mean by that is that
our very existence is the stuff of our Outer Authority. We‘re not here to take on the
cloak of someone else, to be dressed up like everybody else, bowing down to the
same concepts. It is not what we‘re here for. There is nothing in individuality that
says I am a ―yes man‖ or a ―yes woman‖; that is not what individuality is about. It's
not what uniqueness is about.
It‘s not about seeing that life is boring, dark, difficult, all those things. Certainly
that‘s what at least half of all humans experience most of the time. If you don't get
to live correctly, you never get to see how beautiful it is, how interesting your cha-
racter is, and how deep, how rich the resource of that potential Outer Authority. We
are not here alone. Individuality is not alone in the BodyGraph. We are not here
alone. We are here to be with the other, we cannot avoid it. And yet, at the same
time, we have to see that if we are not correct, if we do not live out our drama, if we
do not live out our story, if we cannot live out our purpose and find our spirit, then it
doesn't matter. Your relationship with the other is all just lost in the homogenized
movie and you'll be pigeonholed like everybody else into that‘s who you are, you‘re
that kind of the person thinking those kinds of thoughts, the madness of the homo-
genized world. It‘s really mad.
Life is a Creative Process
This is about understanding that there is beauty in us. That life is a creative process.
It‘s not fixed in stone. It isn‘t. It is this incredible pulsating unfolding. The moment
that you‘re disengaged, because you have to be, you can't allow your mind to take
away from you this chance now. Are you going to wait for your next life, you‘re
going to bet on that you‘re getting one? Individuality says: Now. Mutation says:
Now. Now is forever; now. And it's all about the struggle with the mind. It‘s why
the whole nature of being is about struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle. And it's this
mind that gets in the way.
Homogenization strips you of whatever possible purpose or spirit can be found in
your life. These forces become negated by the not-self mind. They just do. And the
mind is so beautiful. After all, it is the most delightful gift of the vehicle to us as
passengers. The facility we have for this so-called self-reflected consciousness. It is
unbelievable, this mind. And its potential is even more unbelievable, because its
potential has been locked behind millennia and millennia and millennia of condition-
ing, fear conditioning. Old seven-centered fear conditioning; the fear for survival—
get to the top of the ladder, control everything, defend yourself.
Strategy and Authority brings the Reality of Your Nine-Centered Life
But we‘re nine-centered beings. We have been for a long time now, and different.
You don't have to rely on your mind to protect you anymore, because it can‘t. It‘s
what Strategy and Authority brings. It brings the true revolution of moving away
from your seven-centered conditioning and moving into the reality of your nine-

LECTURE EIGHT
The Mutating Forces
centered life. We are a binary consciousness. And in that binary consciousness,
each has a role. And it‘s about time that we allow those roles to be played out.
The Inner Authority that guides the vehicle, that aligns you to a trajectory and geo-
metry that is correct for you, that takes away the resistance in your process, that
opens up the possibility of mind to begin to observe, to begin to watch, to begin to
experience a different kind of perception, because when your mind isn't busy with all
the stuff that it‘s normally busy with, you begin to discover its acuity, how sharp it
is, how clear it can be when it takes in experience, without needing it to serve some
kind of an agenda. And it begins to change the way in which you can express your-
self.
Inner and Outer Authority
We have two authorities: the Inner and Outer Authority; the Inner Authority for de-
cision making, the Outer Authority for communication, this communication of the
unique individual drama. ―I am now.‖ Hear this; and I know because I can watch it
and see it. It‘s only when you begin to see that your vehicle will look after you that
all this deep underlying struggle slowly begins to dissipate, because this is what it's
about.
Uniqueness is not about measurement, so there is nothing to measure. It‘s not
about you can be more unique than somebody else, or you can be a better unique
than their unique. All of that is just absurd. This is an incredible freedom. And
more than just a freedom, it brings perhaps even an obligation to be able to commu-
nicate the uniqueness of that perception, to enrich our lives through the quality of
our communication with each other, because communication, in the end, is the most
extraordinary bond that can exist between beings.
The Not-Self Mind
When I look at these forces, what I really see is the need for all of this power to get
to the Throat to be able to express itself. This is what we are about. It is the great
tragedy of the world that we live in that human beings, when they open up their
mouths, tend to lie. And by lying they are simply not telling the truth, they‘re hiding
things. They're not saying what they really want to say when they want to say it or
could say it. They change the way they say things because they presume that it
may be taken this way or that way. They project on what they think somebody else
is going to say, so they say it first, and all of that to protect themselves, all of that to
shield themselves. This is the not-self mind at work. This is the great sickness of it.
You can go nowhere in this life with your mind making your decisions, and you're not
going to find a way out of the struggle. You won‘t, it becomes the burden of your life
and you live out the not-self theme and you‘re far away from what is the Signature.
Human beings‘ lives are nothing more than not-self themes played out grand on big
stage. The world of frustration and the world of anger, the world of bitterness and

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
the world of disappointment, it's our world. Human beings are saturated with this,
to the point that it stinks, that you can smell it in just about every being on every
street. It's always there—anger, frustration, bitterness, disappointment, it's always
there. This is our world. This is what happens when the not-self rules.
We’re Truly Alone
The Signature is so different, but you‘ve got to get there. And you only get there
one person at a time. You only get there alone. You only get there by yourself,
within yourself. It‘s only when you accept that you‘re truly alone that you will look
to yourself for help. Think about that. Only when you really understand this, you
are alone, the only thing that you can rely on, the only thing that you could trust,
the only thing that is there is you; not someone else, not someone's concept, some-
one's ideas, someone‘s God, someone‘s story.
The greatest dilemma is that human beings do not trust themselves. If you‘re oper-
ating out of the not-self mind, it's easy to understand. It makes so many screw ups;
you have to live with them for the rest of your life. What‘s to trust? And people
have grown up with conditioning all of their lives and they look themselves in the
mirror and they‘re not pleased. These are not human beings that trust themselves.
Self-Love and Self-Trust
It‘s only when you're operating out of your own Authority that you build those two
pillars of life: self love and self trust. And it's only there that you liberate yourself to
the point where that ―I am,‖ ―I can,‖ is you living out your purpose. I can live out
the creative life that's my potential. I am what I am; period. And out of this every-
thing else emerges. This is the beginning of your life.
You begin your life the moment that you accept your aloneness. You begin your life
the moment that not only do you accept your aloneness, but you trust in your ve-
hicle, in your life, in your body, that you trust it, that it becomes your temple, that is
where you bring your devotion to the perfection of your form so that you can be
released into the pleasure, into the possibilities and the wonder of what conscious-
ness is.
The World is Waiting for Unique Expression
We're not here to be stuck in mundane, lost, confused roles. We have a place on the
stage of consciousness. We have a place in the wheel. We have a place in the sub-
structure of the breakdown of that wheel into this bit and that part. The world is
waiting for unique expression. This is the end of the road for our kind, what will
mark our completion of our process is the flourishing and the flowering of unique
Outer Authority. It will bring a new intelligence and wisdom into the world.

But most of all, it is what it is for each being. I don‘t have great concerns about the

it will go. Where I place my attention is on those of you that find yourself in the
serendipity of knowing the mechanics. It‘s for you uniquely to reach where you have
to go to live out this creative life. And the most creative thing that you're ever going
to do in this life is follow your Strategy and Authority. It‘s remaking a distorted old
painting and turning it into a work of art. And that's what we are. It‘s what we‘re
intended to be, each and every one of us, these extraordinary differentiated works of
art.
Well anyway, I hope you enjoyed that. To all of you, you take care; bye for now.

The Forces of Preservation
We get to one of those fascinating places within the construct of the BodyGraph,
these forces of preservation that are better known as the Defense Circuit, that is,
this alignment out of the Sacral Center at the core to either side and in that sense
creating two very, very unique channel systems.
When we talk about, for example, emotional Generators and most people when they
think about an emotional Generator they think about anyone who happens to be a
Generator and happens to have a defined emotional system. And in the broadest
sense of the word, that's true. But there's only one pure emotional Generator. That
is, there is only one emotional Generator in which that relationship is a direct one,
that is, the direct connection that
is there between the Sacral Center
and the emotional system. And in
that sense, it is very unique in the
way in which it operates. It's very
unique in the way in which it be-
comes an Authority in the life,
because obviously the moment we
have a defined Solar Plexus sys-
tem, we have an Authority.
And of course, on the other side,
again, we have a very similar con-
struct. However, on the other side
we have something else as well.
That is, there are two direct ways
in which the Sacral Center and the
splenic center can be connected to each other. And we know that in relationship to
the 34 that in dealing with integration, we‘re dealing with something that is a very
primitive theme. And at the same time, it is deeply coupled to this, these two direct
connections that are there between the Sacral and the Spleen.
And again, this thing about being a splenic Generator, there are many kinds of splen-
ic Generators, but there are only these two versions in which the relationship is a
direct relationship and it makes a difference, it makes a large difference. And ob-
viously, in this particular situation in which you have these two variations of the
connection of the Sacral to the splenic system, that what you have is a Sacral Au-
thority that is endowed with splenic awareness. In other words, this is where the
intelligence is. This is where the awareness is.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
The Defense Circuit
It is known in Design, anybody who studies Design,
you begin by examining circuits in the BodyGraph.
We have two tribal circuits. We will look at the rest of
the tribal forces next week. Here we have what is
known as a minor circuit, there are two minor circuits
in the BodyGraph, that is, the Centering Circuit [left],
which is that movement from the 51 to the 25 and
then from the 10 down here to the 34. And that's a
minor circuit is individual in its nature. And then we
have the minor circuit of the Defense Circuit [below
right] and of course this is deeply tribal in its nature,
but it's more than deeply tribal.
The name I give to this force, that is, the force of
preservation is, in fact, the very name of the
channel itself, that is, this channel; the 50/27 is
the Channel of Preservation. Obviously, this is
intimacy over here. But both of them are about
the same thing. And the other thing to recognize
about the grounding of these forces is that these
forces are grounded in the only two genetic role
gates.
Role Gates
We have six role gates in the BodyGraph, and the role gates are very important for
the development of your analytical skills. That is, to be able to understand lines,
which is one of the most important aspects of learning Human Design, the first thing
is to understand the construct itself, that is, the construct of the hexagram, and then
to begin to look at lines theoretically, that is, the value that's inherent in each of the
lines through their keynoting, as an example.
But in order to really understand the way in which a line lives, because, after all,
lines are the surface, so it‘s really what we get to see, is that we get to see the lines
at work. After all, all these activations, whatever activation you have, in terms of
the surface, the bottom line is the bottom line. That is, it's the line itself, the line is
the surface. Below the line is never the surface. Below the line you enter into the
separate domains of personality and design, and they only come together holistically
through what we see as a line. So, the lines are very important. They represent the
surface dynamic, the surface imprint that is there.

LECTURE NINE
The Forces of Preservation
The six role gates, for example, five of the six names directly apply in profile come
from the 10th gate, from the 2nd to the 6th line; the 1st line is called modesty and it
has a different value. It‘s called the investigator in terms of profile. But in fact, all
of the profile terminology is rooted in the line divisions of the 10th gate, which of
course is the gate of the behavior in the world. And given that profile is our cos-
tume, this is where you the deepest rooted value within the line. Alokanand Diaz del
Rio in his ongoing process of looking at continuity and connectivities, said continuity
is one of those things in Design that is really, really important to grasp.
So, when we look at the role gates, that is, the
10th gate, the 7th gate, the 1st gate and the 13th
gate, those are the four role gates of the self, that
is, the four role gates of identity. And if you look
at their lines, for example, if you look at your pro-
file and you see you‘ve got a 1st line profile, look at
the 1st line of the 10, of the 7, of the 1, and of the
13. It doesn‘t matter whether you have it or not.
It's about understanding that inherent in the value
of the line itself, that is, in your profile, which is a
synthetic expression, 70% in that sense of what
you are, that in that line in your profile is the con-
tinuity to all of the 1st lines.
The Sacral Center: The Life Force
But to really get a grasp on it, to learn analytically how to get a feel for lines, then
you look at the role gates. But there is a big difference between the four role gates
of the identity, which is very, very much connected to the potential development of
the personality, and the role gates of the Sacral that in the end are very much about
the physical life itself. Obviously, the Sacral Center being what it is, it is the center
of life. It is the great fertile force that is there within us. And without this fertile
force, there is no way as a bio-form that we are going to be able to either function or
survive. More than that, there is no way that we are going to be able to procreate.
When we take a look at life, all life, every single one of the forms that I was given
other than the inanimate all have a Sacral Center. You cannot be without it. It is
the life force. And it is something deeply, deeply, deeply to grasp about the Sacral,
why, in fact, so much is dependent on Generators. When I say that, the dependency
on the Generator has nothing to do with the individual process. But if there is going
to be a transformation in society, if there is going to be a transformation in your
family, in your neighborhood, in your community, that transformation has to come
out of Generators. They are the ones with the great enveloping aura. And they‘re
the ones that are constantly giving life what its potential fertility happens to be. We
cannot exist without the force that is there within the Sacral Center.

Genetic Role Gates
And when we're looking at role gates, these are genetic role gates, they‘re not iden-
tity role gates, they are genetic role gates. And they‘re called genetic role gates
simply because they are there to fulfill the genetic imperative. And the genetic im-
perative is very simple: Make more. That's the genetic imperative. Make more,
make more, make more and make more. In fact, be born, make more and die. It's
not a very romantic description, but what to do, this is the genetic imperative.
The genes are not interested in the quality of your life, please be aware of that, they
really aren‘t. They are so far away from the illusion that exists on the surface. And
obviously, within their own nature, they are not cognitive. I can anthropomorphize
the genes all I like, but they don't know
what the hell is going on, they‘re just
mechanisms, in that sense. And they are
mechanisms that operate in a specific
way. We are designed to be fertile and to
reproduce. This is the bio-form.
So we have genetic roles for that. And
those genetic roles dominate us. And
they dominated us in the deepest, deep-
est possible way. We all know that. We
all know how we are dependent on the
serendipity of the encounter of our par-
ents to produce and support and raise us,
if you think about it that way. That is, there's an enormous difference between a
child that is born into the middle class in advanced society, than a child that is born
into some Third World dilemma. There are all kinds of things in all of that. We are
always at the mercy of what is the reproductive program. The reproductive program
begins with the genetic combination that is going to be the result of any bond.
When I look mechanically at the population explosion, so-called, things started to
heat up in 1781, this is when global warming began. It began on the inside and
began on the outside. You‘ve got this incredible heating up and with this incredible
heating up you have this enormous expansion that takes place in every possible way.
The fact of the matter is that the billions and billions of human beings on this planet
produce enough heat on their own to make an enormous difference in the tempera-
ture of the planet compared to what it was like 350 years ago when the population
was 130th, 140th whatever it was of what it is today. All of this heat and all of this
reproduction and all of this expansion of the population is in order to be able to open
up the broadest possible spectrum for mutation. Bio-forms advance through muta-
tion. This is the mechanism.

LECTURE NINE
The Forces of Preservation
The Theme of Preservation
So, one of the things for us to understand is that this theme of preservation and it's
not the theme of preservation of the individual, it‘s not the theme of preservation of
the bond and its offspring, it is the preservation of the species. That's a big formula.
It's very powerful. One of the most extraordinary things, and you can sort of see it
just sneaking out of the corner here, is the 55th gate. The 55th gate is the center of
where this deep mutation is taking place now in humanity and in the Solar Plexus
Center. But there is something really very, very fascinating about that, because of
course, the 55th gate is the opposition of the 59th gate.
One of the things to pay attention to, particularly if you‘re a relatively newcomer to
Design, is to sit down and stare at the wheel, the Rave Mandala, and get a good
resolution. And just stare at it and look at the way it
works, because the wheel is so incredible. Truly, the
Rave Mandala is really something incredible. One of
the things that you get to see, aside from all of the
symmetries and the movement of pattern and the
beauty of what that wheel is, is that when you begin
to look at oppositions you begin to see something
really magical.
When you see the oppositions through their hexagram
chop, you begin to see that every opposition is simply
a perfect mirror of the other, it is a perfect mirror; all
around the wheel, wherever you look, these incredible perfect mirrors, the ―this and
that.‖ And the ―this and that‖ in the end is an illusion because the mutation that's
taking place here is going to be a mutation that's going to impact here. It‘s going to
bring one of the most important mutations in the history of our process.
The Channel of Intimacy
The future has two possible tracks. And
those two possible tracks are written here
in this channel, this channel of intimacy,
the great force that drives us to bond. Not
only is it a force that drives us to bond, but
it is a force that is designed to break down
barriers. There is absolutely nothing on
this planet that is more penetrating than a
59/6. They can get into your aura the way
a hot knife goes through butter, because
this is the mechanism. It is very, very,
very powerful. And there are two ways this
can go, because it's all being determined by
the genetic role that says how am I going
The Life Force is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

129
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
to get the other, how am I going to get them? What role am I going to play to bring
them into this bond? And the role I'm going to play to get them into this bond has
become more complex, because in this bond I actually want a specific result, a spe-
cific genetic result.
In other words, what's happening to the 59 in the way in which it's going to mutate
is that it's going to become more and more discerning, and more and more discern-
ing in order to end one reproductive tract and open up another. That ending of one
track happens to be us, human. That opening up of the other track is rave, the fu-
ture.
Population Crashes
Many, many years ago, I guess the first time I talked about it was in the early 90s,
and there was particular concern at that time about population expansion and all
these things, and along with telling people that neutrinos have mass, which wasn't
science yet, I was telling them that the population was going to crash, don't be too
concerned. And that population crash isn't about the traditional ways in which popu-
lation crashes.
Population crashes are normal, they‘re normal in all mammals, they‘re normal in all
species, as a matter of fact. Normally, a population crash is environmental. And it‘s
environmental in the sense that for certain species if there are not enough resources,
there is a real dying off. Sometimes it comes from disease. In the case of killer
monkeys, Homo sapiens, we invented population crashes, like the Second World War
where hundreds of millions of people just simply disappeared from the planet. There
are many ways of a classic population crash. And of course, there are other things.
There are disasters, the crash of the dinosaur population because of a meteorite
hitting the planet. There are all kinds of crashes, in that sense.
But what is interesting here is that this is an old formula. It is a very old formula.
As a matter of fact, it is an ancient formula. It is the way in which mutation finally
takes hold. One way becomes less and less attractive in terms of the genetic me-
chanics; the other way becomes the way of least resistance. And of course, what
that means is that the way in which we are going to be open to the other is slowly
going to diminish over time because it is going to be more selective as an indicator.
It is not going to be blindly looking for the other side because the tradition has al-
ways been that there is only one obvious goal in that bond, the reproduction of
another human.
It is very different when the 59th gate becomes, through its opposition, this perfect
mirror, it becomes the place where the kind of fertility begins to change, which
means that the way the roles will be played out, not that their quality will change,
but their attention to specific detail in the other will change. Again, this is part of the
awakening of the Solar Plexus and part of the awakening of the neural transforma-
tion in the Solar Plexus, that neural transformation that leads to a different kind of

The Forces of Preservation
potential cognition, a different quality of intelligence, and a different way of reading
the other.
The Change in the Life Force’s Focus
So of course, when we‘re dealing here with this channel we have to see that as a
force, as a life force, it is the primary foundation of the establishment of that force.
The continuation of that force, the continuity of that force is something that is embo-
died in the 59/6. And it means that when this life force changes its focus, an enorm-
ous change takes place. So we are going to move into an era in which we are going
to have less and less viable births, less and less viable conceptions is probably a
better way of putting that, and what we're going to end up with, ultimately what has
been predicted by all of this from the beginning
of this revelation, is that these beings, these
raves, are going to begin to emerge. This is
where all the pressure is now and where the
pressure is going in terms of doing that.
I have been discussing the fact that the rise of
prostate cancer and the rise of autism and I'd
been talking about this since the early 90s that
these are directly associated with the mutation
that is taking place in the Solar Plexus system.
And one of the things you can see is that this
higher ratio-- it isn't simply a matter of what they'd like to say, well, maybe it's be-
cause only now we‘re reporting all these cases-- the reality is that there is this in-
credible increase percentage-wise in the number of children that are being born with
these handicaps, a number of men that are suffering from prostate cancer. The
reality is that this is the earliest aspect of this shift beginning to take hold. It‘s
something really to grasp.
Again, I think one of the dilemmas of working with a graphic like a BodyGraph is that
you don't see that it is something that is alive, that it is sparking and it is full of the
movement of information and the transformation of information into activity, into
neural activity, into muscle movement, into the illusion on the surface. This is a
living thing. And this deep, deep life force inside of it, the root life force of it here in
the 59/6, this is the driving force that keeps this species going, and it‘s changing.
And when the root life force changes, everything changes, because what is going to
be preserved is what is new. And what is not going to be preserved is us.
Human Design and the Individual
Human Design is about the liberation of the individual from the overwhelming mo-
mentum of the program towards the future. It has already passed us by. The world
is homogenized. We can thank the seven-centered being for that; the mind, decision
making through the mind, the distortion of the world, the lemmings all moving to-

wards the cliff. But by being able to see within the mechanics, we end up with a
being able to take advantage of that, to escape the homogenization.
But to recognize something else, to recognize how important it is for the individual to
fulfill their process. There‘s no point waiting around for the next life. This is not the
beginning of a movie. This is the end of the movie. We are here to live out our
uniqueness, because this is the only way that we can escape this.
It also says something very, very, very special. I know this myself. I have a deep
love for my children and I recognize that in every child being born, this is an incredi-
ble opportunity that must not be lost, because there are going to be less and less,
and each and every one of them needs to be able to live in the world that they are
going to live in. A world that will not be rooted in the tribal collective, a world that
will not be rooted in the institutions and the concerns of societies, the movement
away from the Cross of Planning. The movement into the era of the 59-55, the
Sleeping Phoenix, the cycle of the Phoenix, a cycle that is so deeply individual. The
59-55 with the 20/34, I am busy now surviving.
The Solar Plexus System
This life force is an extraordinary one. Think about it this way; think about the way
in which this mutation is transforming everything about the nature of the Solar Plex-
us system. The Solar Plexus system operates in a wave; we all know that, it‘s part
of basic Design. The emotional wave, the high, the low, it never stops rolling along.
So that every human being that has emotional definition has the challenge in their
life to reorient themselves to a new kind of timing, not to be in a hurry, to be able to
ride the wave like a surfer, to be able to develop great depth by being able to take in
as they move through their wave.
And because the wave is so powerful, it dominates life. Nearly 51% of humanity is
emotional. It means just about every emotional couple, just about every emotional
partnership, just about every family has emotional nature one way or another, condi-
tioned or otherwise. That there is no truth in the now, we are blinded by the reality
that there is no truth in the now. All of this is the result of the emotional wave, and
the only way we understand emotions is through that wave. I never speak of the
emotions as offering true awareness. It can offer clarity; it can offer an assessment
that takes place over time, that‘s never 100 percent. It can't be because this is a
wave.
And yet what we know, both from the knowledge of Human Design and from modern
medicine, that within the Solar Plexus is a neural bundle that is far more impressive
than what we have in our neo-cortex. They are only beginning to discover the neur-
al depth that is there in the Solar Plexus. We know that this is the Root of the
emerging awareness that is going to come out of the Solar Plexus. For students in
Design who study substructure with me, it is clear for us that the new cognitive po-
tential that is there in the 4th, the 5th and the 6th tones, that this brings a new quality
of cognition, a new potential for intelligence in humanity.

LECTURE NINE
The Forces of Preservation
Now, think about this relationship of the 55 where the mutation is taking place, the
59 that is its perfect mirror, and the 59 that is the fertile power that meets where
the wave is created, because the 6th gate is what creates the wave. It is out of the
6th gate that the three waves of the emotional system emerged, in the same way
that is out of the 50th gate that the three waves of intelligence—instinct, intuition,
judgmentation—that they arose out of this 50th gate.
These systems are primary to us. And obviously this mutation that's taking place
here—and it's not like it starts in 2027, it started in 1781. It started a long time
again, at least in our framework of time. This isn‘t something that‘s starting in 19
years. It‘s something that is
finally going to reach the sur-
face after all this underground
work since 1781, and it is
going to have an impact on
the nature of the wave, be-
cause the power of the wave
is actually going to be dimi-
nished.
It will open up the possibility
for the expression of the cog-
nition underneath without the
distortion of the wave, so this
life force here, of all the life forces we've been looking at, this is the one that really
in the end is a key. It's always been the key. It draws you and me together. This is
what it does. It bonds human beings. It locks us together in our dance; it locks us
together in this intimacy. It locks us into the sexual encounter that is inherent in
this. And the encounter that is intended to produce offspring. We can see that the
intent remains the same, but the mutation will make it so different.
The 6th Gate
When you think about the way in which intimacy operates, because the 6th gate car-
ries everything about the Solar Plexus within it, it carries the touch and it carries the
feeling and it carries the emotional intuitive grasp, it has all of that. And it means
it's taking in information. We do not blindly go into a connection with somebody.
Just because you're a 59 and somebody has a 6 doesn't mean you‘re going to make
love. You will find attraction there, obviously, but it doesn't mean there is going to
be a bond because there are other things, after all, we‘re a holistic being, there are
other things that become part of it.
One of the things to recognize is that we have a very brute recognition through
things like touch and feeling. In other words, a kind of clarity, sort of, that we get
from the wave interpretation. But the thing to recognize is that the moment the
The Life Force is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

133
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
mutation begins to take hold, these values, that is, the feeling value, whatever it is,
these values are actually going to have a cognitive quality.
The 59th Gate: Searching for the Mutative Partner
In other words, they're not just going to be intangibles anymore. They're going to
begin to take on a real cognitive value. The first thing that they're going to be able
to do is that they‘re going to be able to discern through that feeling, through the
aura, through the touch, they're going to be able to discern whether or not it's possi-
ble through that other to be able to produce a mutation. Because as we move closer
and closer to 2027 there is more and more pressure building on the 59 to find the
right mutative partner. It takes two to tango.
We have something in the most advanced levels of the knowledge, it‘s called Va-
riables, and variables basically pinpoint our relationship, in a sense, to the past and
the future. The most extreme of the future variables, which is built on what is called
a quadruple right, all of this is what is necessary to bring a rave child into the world,
and to bring them into the world post-2027. Everything has its markers.
So, what's happening in the 59 is that the 59 is beginning to search for a mutative
partner. It is not searching for simply a partner that is acceptable. It is looking for
something else. It‘s getting more and more finicky. We already see that. We give it
another name. It‘s so funny the way the social context of life is interpreted by the
homogenized experts. Take a look at all the advanced countries. And what's the
first thing you notice in all the advanced countries, is that the moment they become
advanced they have less and less children. And everybody claims that's because of
economic, selfishness, this and that and the other thing. Well, it's a change that's
taking place in the 59th gate. It's changed that‘s taking place.
There is a different kind of selection process that‘s at work, a very different kind.
The infertility rates have been going up astronomically over the last 25 years. Most
of the blame on that is environmental. That is, they blame the chemistry that has
become a part of our lives that we take in every day from all kinds of different areas.
It‘s a nice way of explaining it to people so that they feel like it makes sense. This is
how homogenization works, because if you don‘t really know how something works,
you make something up. This is what the collective does all the time with its ideas
and its facts. It doesn't necessarily mean that the facts are true or the ideas are
interesting, but this is what they do.
We have a transition that's taking place here in this life force. And it's changing
what the future is going to look like in terms of the life force, because this is the
trigger that is bringing about the emergence of a new species. It has to come from
here. It can all start here. This is the mutation, but again, the perfect mirror, this
direct route to the transformation in the way in which the fertility process is going to
operate.

The Forces of Preservation
It‘s still going to be the same themes. The seducer will still seduce, but they‘re look-
ing to seduce something very, very specific because they're looking—they don't
know, by the way, what they‘re looking for—I‘m anthropomorphizing. They‘re simply
not going to be fertile in certain situations. This again goes back to one of the ad-
vantages of correctness, that if you're operating correctly in this life, you don‘t con-
cern yourself with all these things, life unfolds the way it should.
The Channel of Preservation
All right, we come to the other side. I guess this is one of the aspects of us that
makes us different, in a way. It is here that we take on a very special quality. That
is, we take on the quality of altruism that we begin to be concerned about the other.
The Channel of Preservation, after all. The 27th gate is a great gate of nurturing. It
is about making sure, as a genetic role gate,
that inherent in all of us in the continuity of
our design, that we all have a specific way in
which we are designed to look after the oth-
er. And particularly in that context, that is
the chemistry that draws us to be concerned
about our own genetic connection to the oth-
er.
What the impact that a child has on its moth-
er is in many ways an obvious one. That is, it gestates within her and there is this
deep connection. There's also a connection, though, with the father which runs
through the genetics itself. And it is this genetic imperative here that says that
these genes, these new ones, that they have to be nurtured and they have to be
nurtured long enough so that they can survive.
The 50th Gate: Spontaneous Knowledge
Again, whenever we're dealing with a splenic system we‘re always dealing with a
center of survival consciousness. It is an absolute essential to all forms of life, it is
absolutely necessary to survive. Survival is the main thing. And the thing about the
nature of the 50th gate is that what the 50th gate brings us in its parallel or its sym-
metry to the 6th gate, is that rather than bringing these waves that potentially have
clarity, here we have the presence of spontaneous knowledge and spontaneous
knowledge through three different processes.
And spontaneous knowledge in the sense that this is a defense mechanism and it is a
defense mechanism first and foremost; in other words, to protect oneself to stay
alive. And it operates in a wave. It moves out as a kind of frequency, a better word,
as it moves out from the 50. You have the inner instinct and then you have the
middle intuition and you have the outside collective judgmentation. And this even-
tually leads to the logical mind and this leads to the individual mind. It leads to the
foundation of what is our intelligence.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
So it is something to grasp that there is a huge difference between mating, which is
dumb, and nurturing, which is intelligent, which is kind of a great joke about life and
love, isn‘t it. You dumbly match up with somebody and then you end up with all this
great care and concern and intelligence applied to the offspring. The human comedy
or the human tragedy, I guess, whichever way you like. But it‘s something to grasp
that any transformation that's going to take place in this life force is going to bring a
transformation that's going to take place in this life force. That is, a transformation
that is going to change ultimately the way in which we think. All of these things are
related to each other in the continuity, all of them.
So, we are entering into a totally new world, we really are, but not for us. Many of
you, many of us will get there. We‘ll get to see the beginnings of what is really just
a continuity of what we already see. But it's for what happens 50 years from now,
100 years from now in terms of the way in which human beings are prepared and
the way in which they are nurtured. It is essential.
The Knowledge is for Children
From the very beginning, the deepest thing that was clear to me, from the very mo-
ment that I was given the knowledge was that the most difficult thing I was going to
have to do was teach it to adults. That was going to be difficult part. And it wasn't
who the knowledge was for. It isn‘t that it‘s not for you, but in the sense that it is
only through adults that ultimately it could be made available for children.
The dilemma is that homogenization doesn't teach us who we are; it teaches us what
it wants us to be, what the school systems do, as an example, what any kind of or-
ganized society and culture does to its young. We give them homogenization tools.
Yes, we teach them how to read and write, but at the same time we tell them how
to behave like everybody else, behave the way they're expected to, do what they're
expected to do, and on and on.
One of the things that‘s clear is that the most fundamental aspect of knowledge that
young people deserve is not part of their education. That is, they're not taught to
understand themselves, to understand themselves uniquely, to be given the tools to
be able to operate uniquely, and the awareness to be able to demand from others
that they are treated with respect. This is the most important education that we can
bring to any young person. And not simply that it gives them advantages in life. I
think that's an obvious. But it is about being able to prepare them for a world in
which the structure that we understand, have always understood, and have lived
with for generations is beginning to break down.
The Cross of Planning
It was in 1610 that the Cross of Planning began, and it ends in 2027. It is all we
have known in what is, relatively speaking, our modern history. It‘s all we under-

The Forces of Preservation
stand about the nature of the modern human being. It has been the background to
our development of our societies and our cultures, the way that we are integrated
together, the way we have institutions that support our societies. All of this is Cross
of Planning. And of course, this is something that is going to literally disappear.
This is not one of those markers where you say, well, you won‘t ready feel the
change.
If you want to know what it feels like, watch the Nodes of the Moon in the daily tran-
sits, watch the Nodes. And when you get a situation where the Nodes are going to
bring definition to you, they‘re going to condition you, they‘re going to bring defini-
tion to a hanging gate that you have, or whatever the case may be, pay attention to
that. Pay attention to it as long as it's there.
Make sure that you notice it every day, and
then see what happens, what it feels like the
moment that it goes away. You feel it instant-
ly. It is an instant change; something is taken
away.
We don't know any different. We don't know
any different because in 1610 we have been
living with exactly the same background fre-
quency—40/37, 16-9. The 40/37, the Channel
of Community, Channel of the Family, Channel
of the Institutions, build the schools, hire the
police, do all of that stuff. Everything is a bar-
gain, everything is a contract. My God, since
1610 the largest exponential growth in human work is lawyers. It‘s our contract
world. And the 16, the skills and that 9, that deep focus on those skills, the deep
focus on all the details, the foundation of science in 1610, what has happened in the
scientific explosion of knowledge, the detail, the skills and all of that there to benefit
the tribe in its contract.
We talk about the social contract between the government and its people. It's all a
contract. And in 2027 the contracts get torn up. It will disappear as a background
frequency. There will not be this driving force for any of that. And it's not like it just
disappears, it gets replaced with something.
The 1st Line Theme Moving Into a 6th Line Theme
There‘s something else, something to really think about. We‘re living in the 1st line
theme of the Cross of Planning. These larger cycles operate in the precession of the
equinox. In other words, they move retrograde. So as we have moved through this
Cross of Planning in 1610 we started in the 37th gate, 6th line. And now we‘re down
to the 1st line. In 1961 we entered into the 1st line.
It‘s an interesting thing for me. I'm a 1st line being, I‘m a 5.1, profile-wise, and until
I was 13 years of age, I was born in 1948, until I was 13 years of age I just didn't

know why I was even in the world. I really felt out of place. The world was just not
my place. And then in the 1961 it went into a 1st line theme, and everything clicked
into place. In 2027 it‘s going to go into a 6th line theme. Those of you that have a
6th line in your profile, it's going to be quite something to enter into that world and
resonate to it. But if you're somebody like me who has a 1st line, by the time that
you get to 2027 and it disappears, it‘s going to be really like that this is not my
world.
The Change from Tribal Gates to Individual Gates
The background frequency is going to change. And not only is it going to change in
terms of the line frequency, it is going to change in terms of the gates. It‘s going to
go from being tribal collective to being three parts individual, and the only other
aspect, the 59, is under mutation and is moving us in a totally different direction in
terms of our fertility. And the 20/34, instead of the 40/37, instead of the bargain,
the contract, instead of all of that tribal stuff you‘ve got busy, busy, busy, you better
be busy, otherwise you‘re not going to survive—busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy,
busy, busy, busy, very busy, busy surviving.
Wow, is that different, I tell you. And the 20/34 is busy alone, for themselves, for
their own individuation. This is not the social contract. The 20/34 within the context
of caring is only caring about itself. It is only self-concerned. I am busy now, I am
busy now, don't bother me. This is not, ―you have my support, dear, let's go do it,‖
this is not the tribe. And all the things that come with it, the trains that run on time,
the phone that's answered when you dial 911, all that stuff, the shipments of food
that mysteriously come out of the air for some Fourth World horrendous sickness
famine zone. This is all part of the Cross of Planning.
The Pressure to Nurture our Young
It‘s disappearing; the life force is changing. And it puts enormous pressure here to
nurture our young, to nurture our young with the deepest possible intelligence and
awareness that we can give them, to heal them of homogenization, to nourish them
in a way in which both their body and their mind and their spirit is correct, and it is
the pressure that is here, to preserve. And as this begins to split off, and as this
human fertility begins to diminish, that each and every one of these children deserve
the utmost of what is possible in terms of providing them for the tools that they need
to survive in the world.
This is what the genetic imperative is always about. It's not enough to make more.
You have to be able to endow them with what they need. And for us the imperative
is much more profound in that each one of these children that are born, this is prob-
ably the only opportunity they are ever going to have. This is it. And they deserve
the right not to be concerned about the reproductive necessities for the future. Not
to be worried about that they have to find that bond and lose themselves in the rela-
tionship; no, not at all.

LECTURE NINE
The Forces of Preservation
The 55.6: Selfishness
It is about the fulfillment of their unique potential. When that precession of equinox
slides into the 55th gate in 2027, slides into that 6th line, the 55.6 is the line of sel-
fishness. The 55th gate is the gate of the spirit, the potential of the spirit, the deep-
est spirit within us. Selfishness; the opening theme of the cycle is selfishness. And
that pressure, how important it is not to see
this in the context that that's somehow
ugly. It isn't. We are here. We are here to
totally surrender to enlightened selfishness.
If you cannot be correct, if you cannot live
your life correctly, none of this matters. It
is Strategy and Authority. It‘s Strategy and
Authority that aligns you to what is possible
for you.
Human Design as a science of differentiation
is based on the reality that we see within
the mechanics itself that every human being
has the potential to differentiate in this life.
We are here to express our uniqueness.
That's all we have. We're not here to ex-
press our genetic future. That's history. We're not here to say that I gave my life
for my children. It‘s not about that. It's about first and foremost you have to be
selfish for yourself, you have to be correct. Only then are you able to love, to care.
Only then does it not matter what the movie is, or the way the movie goes. It‘s just
a story, after all. This is the turning of the wheel. But in this movie, in this turning
of the wheel, we do not have to go blindly. We don't. That's not what this know-
ledge is for. It says you‘re here to have the most open eyes. The magic of what it is
to see. And you only begin to see when you liberate yourself from the homogenized
program; strategy, Inner Authority, step-by-step, cell-by-cell deconditioning until
you reach that place in which your mind can finally begin to watch and see. It's our
glory, and in that lies our wisdom; the beauty that is there inherent in each and
every one of us.
Reaching the Place of Our Potential
As I watch the 59 slowly but surely go through a deep, deep mutative transition, for
me it is a marker that gives great hope for the possibility of any human being to be
able to reach that place of their potential. It will give us this possibility by diminish-
ing the pressure on the intimacy side, to begin to open up the fact that if we do not
nourish ourselves, if we do not nourish our intelligence, if we do not transform our
process now we might as well just surrender and stop all the bullshit about you want
to change, because it's what Human Design brings.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
It brings a very, very simple mechanic. Very simple—strategy, Inner Authority—it‘s
simple; I didn‘t say it was easy. Nothing is easy, nothing worth having is easy.
Nothing of value comes right away. But the mechanism, the mechanics, they work.
This is the only way to free yourself of mental decision making. That's the enemy.
It doesn't matter which way the wind blows. It doesn't.
If you're operating correctly you always know, you're always going to know where to
be and in that what's there to see and the life that is there for you to experience
without the pain, without the suffering, without the martyrdom, without all the stuff,
without all the whining. The homogenized world whines all the time. This is an in-
credible life. It‘s an incredible privilege to be alive, to be conscious. It‘s an extraor-
dinary privilege to have the knowledge that you don't need to be fooled, that you
don't need to be lost. Anyway, Strategy and Authority, it‘s the only way.
Well, to all of you, I hoped you enjoyed that. Until next time; you all take care, bye
for now.

Lecture Ten
The Supporting Forces
I like this name, actually, the supporting forces, it is a bit of a play on the keynote of
the tribe, and of course, the keynote the tribe is to support, as opposed to individual-
ity which empowers, or the collective which shares. The support is something that's
very different, and it is very different because it is the most deeply rooted in our
genetics. To really understand
the meaning of this word, sup-
port, you can really only grasp
it in the way in which we un-
derstand the relationship that
generally speaking exists be-
tween parent and child, as an
example. That is, the effort to
support the development of the
child and the loyalty that goes
with all of that and all of the
things that are part of what
ultimately we describe as the
tribe.
It is support that is conditioned
not by whether you particularly
like somebody or not. It is support that is conditioned by bloodlines; it is support
that is conditioned by genetics. It is a very, very different kind of bonding. And it is
one of the main forces that is there that holds together what we call our civilization,
our society, whatever labels that we want to put on it. All of it is found here, in this
interesting configuration because, after all, when we're looking at forces and we've
been looking at them in terms of streams that clearly, when we're looking at the
collective forces and we are looking at the individual forces, that they are always
seeking the same focus. That is, they're looking for the Throat, they‘re looking for
expression, and they‘re looking for manifestation.
The Tribe is Focused on the Heart Center
This is something that is so uniquely different about the nature of the tribe. Every-
thing about the tribe is focused on the Heart Center. As a matter of fact, three of
the four gates of the Heart Center are specifically tribal in their nature. And in es-
sence, the Heart Center really is the key to understanding the tribe; it is the key to
The Life Force is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

141
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
understanding their power. That power is rooted in the motor. That is, when you're
dealing with the Heart Center, the motor, what you're actually dealing with is what
we call willpower.
This Center, anyway, is an enormous dilemma. I'm actually looking forward to it
because I've never really done it in such detail as in the upcoming Ibiza event, where
one of lectures I‘m doing is on the undefined ego. This undefined Heart Center is an
enormous dilemma on the planet. And it‘s one of the things that really controls in so
many ways the priority of the way in which the not-self mind or the homogenized
world operates. About two-
thirds of human beings are born
with an undefined Heart Center.
And we know that in terms of
the not-self, that the undefined
Heart Center is all about having
a sense of a lack of worthiness.
It‘s interesting to understand
that concept. That is, that con-
cept is rooted in the fact that
what the tribe considers worthy
is will, which is something in
and of itself to ponder intellec-
tually. This is what is important
for the tribe, that one has the
will to do what is necessary
within the relationship of the tribal needs, because everything about the tribe is
rooted in its needs, whether those needs are its basic resources or the basic ways in
which it is going to operate on the material plane, that everything about the tribe is
rooted to needs and is rooted to the material. There is no other circuitry that is
more material than this. You can‘t get more material. It is really the bedrock of the
way we function on the material plane.
When we‘re looking at the open Heart Center and we‘re looking at this lack of will or
inconsistent will in two-thirds of humanity, you can see why the seven-centered
being put so much emphasis on will, God‘s will, your will, this will, thy will be done,
and so forth and so on. It really became the goad, the great goad. That is, invent,
create out of your mental not-self an artificial willpower and let's watch you fail, and
then we can see that you're not quite worthy and so everything becomes a competi-
tion, everything becomes an enormous comparison game and everybody's trying to
prove that they‘re worthy. We have a planet that's locked into that. That is, they‘re
locked into the malaise of what is the open heart.
And of course, everything about these supporting forces is they are all there to pump
up this ego to support it so that there is willpower. And of course, the way in which
we have Human Design mechanics, you can see that in essence that‘s quite true.
That is, you sit there with your Heart Center, for example, and you have hanging
gates—again, two-thirds of humanity has an open heart—you're waiting for the sup-
porting cast, and it's the supporting cast that actually gives you your willpower.

LECTURE TEN
The Supporting Forces
The 40/37: The Channel of Community
The classic example is the 40/37, because it is one of those ever-present combina-
tions that you bump into in people's charts and that's because the 40/37, like the
20/34, like the 43/23, these are the three channels that are actually oppositions in
the wheel so they are commonly defined by the Sun/Earth or the north and south
Nodes as polarities. So, they're a commonality to see in people's designs, these
three particular definitions.
The 40/37 (blue arrow) is the Channel of Community and it is particularly influential
in our times. That is, we are in a global cycle that is called the Cycle of Planning, is
based on the 40/37 and 16 and the 9.
We‘ve been the Cross of Planning since
1610. It comes to an end in 2027. So,
we've been living in a time in which this
energy, this 40/37 is a force that has been
deeply, deeply supported by the background
frequency.
In many ways it has becomes the great iden-
tifier of the way in which life operates on this
plane, because it is through this Channel of
Community that the basic infrastructure of
society is confirmed. That is, this is where
the marriage contract is written, this is where the basic contract is written within a
community for the mutual protection and nourishment of that community. This is
where the bargain is struck for the way in which the community will be led, and on
and on and on. In other words, it represents the way in which the whole bond of a
community is established. And that bond of the community is established on the
strength of being able to guarantee the willpower.
That‘s the thing that is so fascinating about the 40/37 and is very different than the
26/44 (green arrow), which is not in opposition. In other words, you'll find a lot of
people with this (40/37) defined, but you're not going to find a lot of people that
have the same kind of numbers with this (26/44) defined. You won't. And of
course, the thing that is so interesting about this is that this channel guarantees
willpower. It guarantees the presence of willpower. It‘s interesting in the affilia-
tions, the 40th gate is the gate of the stomach, and the 37th gate is the gate of the
mouth; an odd place for the mouth. But it‘s metaphorical in that sense.
The 37: Affection/The 40: Denial
It‘s something to understand about the needs of the emotional community. Because
what the 37 really represents is a magical quality. It's called affection. Affection is
the most profound of glue in the tribe. Not particularly or necessarily love, and not

143
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
particularly or necessarily friendship, but affection, and this is a great massage that
the 37 always provides the 40. The 40 is relatively uptight, it is an ego gate. And it
is one of the two gates of denial, the 40th
gate and the 26th gate. These are gates of
denial. The 40th gate says I don't need
you; I don't need you because the moment
you come near me I know what that
means.
It reminds me of a joke I was told. It‘s a
joke from India. A story told from a friend
of mine. It wasn't even actually told di-
rectly to him, he was talking to a couple of
children. They were at a monkey temple
and he said to them, ―why do you think
that monkeys don‘t talk.‖ Obviously, the
children had no answer to that. He smiled at them and said ―they don‘t know how to
work.‖ Anyway, the interesting thing about the virtual environment, you never know
if anybody is laughing.
The 40/37, that‘s what it‘s like. The 40 says no, no, stay away from me, because
the moment that you are in my life, I‘m going to have to work. And of course, the
37, the only way that they can combat that is that they offer affection. And basically
what they do is they tell the 40 how terrific it is. You're terrific; I really appreciate
what you're doing. I think it's wonderful what you're doing, let me give you a hug;
affection.
This is the glue in the tribe. And of course, the tribe always has this problem with
the ego. Everything about the tribe is rooted in the ego. So, everything is about
how do you get that ego to play along, how do you get that ego to work for every-
one, how do you do that? And by the way, because we're looking at the basic infra-
structure of society, in other words, the demands to work, the rules about all of that,
if we didn't have the 40th gate, we would still have 14 hour days, because it‘s the
40th gate that says I did enough work today, I'm done, I need a rest. This is the 40th
gate. It is a gate of denial. And at the same time, it brought in that bargain for that
affection okay, okay, okay I will, I'll take out the garbage because otherwise you‘re
not going to give me any affection. But after I take out the garbage, don't ask me to
do anything else, I want to rest now.
The 19th Gate: Neediness
It‘s so interesting to think about how so basic all of these things are. And yet, this is
what locks us in. Take a step deeper in that process. Here is one of the mystery
places now, really, it‘s a mystery place. It‘s mystery place because the 49th gate and
the 55th gate belong to the same chemistry, that is, the same genetic codon. That
codon is histidine. It is in the 55th gate specifically that the mutation is taking place;

144
LECTURE TEN
The Supporting Forces
but of course, because they are the same chemistry, the mutation in fact is taking
hold in both of these gates.
And as a matter of fact, there is a tremendous amount of pressure specifically on the
49th gate and the way in which it operates. One of the things that is predicted in
terms of the mechanics as we move towards 2027 is that the frequency that is here
in this particular channel is going to begin to narrow and in essence, breakdown.
And of course, this has been one of the most powerful forces in creating the possibili-
ty of the viability of the tribe. It begins with the 19th gate, this incredible pressure
that is here. It is an unbelievable pressure.
It is that pressure of neediness, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep neediness. And the
needs are always fundamental: food, shelter, protection, a bond; all of those very,
very basic things; a God, something to be-
lieve in, glues, the things that hold you to-
gether. What does hold a tribe together?
The resources are there. If the resources
aren‘t there, slowly it breaks down, slowly
members of the tribe go out and look for
resources. If the resources are there, eve-
rybody calms down.
Remember that the 19th gate is a cross-
speciel gate from animals to humans. In
fact, this is the place in this channel, the
49th gate is the sacrificer or the sacrificed,
the butcher or not, this gate of principles. It is here that we first controlled what
would we would call husbandry, where we first controlled animals. And how did we
control them? We gave them precisely what they needed. We gave them resources
and protection. We gave them a field where they could eat in peace. We guarded
that field so they would not be threatened by their natural predators. And it is all
out of this 19th gate, and we are and still carry within us these deep mammalian
markers.
It's the same thing in us, this 19. The only difference in our 19 is that our 19 is also
looking for a partner and in mammals that is done over here (circled in red). And so
there is this built into the 19, this flirtation, that is there looking for the advantaged
resource. What I mean by the advantaged resources that if you're looking for a
mate, at the deepest biological genetic level, this is a selection process in terms of
what the possible reproductive advantage is, but on the surface level you're looking
for other things, the basic criterias.
No matter how romantic it is to have an attraction to somebody, if they have abso-
lutely nothing and they're going nowhere, it is quite a burden to become part of that
life. It‘s an ancient story that's been going on. To bond with somebody, resources
are always necessary. They‘ve been giving out dowries for millennia. It‘s about
resources.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
The Emotional Side: Loyalty
So, one of the things that is so interesting here in this is Channel of Synthesis that
this force is the driving force for us. It says that this is what we have to have. And
of course, you can‘t just get it from here. You can‘t. All this does is set up an emo-
tional pressure, a wave that cranks and cranks and cranks and ultimately what it is
looking for is how do you do all that. You‘ve got to lock everybody in.
And if there is a force that we can give a name to for this whole stream, to think
about what this really does to us, this is the glue. This is what locks us in. It has
locked us into our way of life. It has locked us into our concepts of responsibility.
And what it has brought to us is the force of loyalty or not. This is what this force is
all about. This is what the real supporting forces are all about on this emotional
side, loyalty. And oh, the irony of that, to say loyalty and emotional in the same
breath, because we know what emotionality as a motor function brings, it brings the
wave. It brings the duality of the 49 being, the principled one or not, the butcher or
not, the marriage or divorce, all of the binary possibilities, the sacrificer or the sacri-
ficed.
So, this loyalty goes up and down, so that you end up with matricide, patricide, fra-
tricide; the great, great crimes of loyalty broken; siblings against each other. It‘s all
about loyalty. The tribe cannot survive without loyalty. Why do you think that the
religious fanatics are so demanding of loyalty to the way, their way, that you must
not break that, that you must stand loyal even if what you see horrifies you, but it is
your blood it is your family, it is your tribe, you are loyal. And you are loyal without
question. I was only following orders, so to speak. I was being loyal to my family. I
was being loyal to my tribe.
This is what this force is all about. And this loyalty is something that can be deeply,
deeply, deeply, deeply blinding, because the loyalty will fall apart the moment that
the resources fall apart. The moment the resources fall apart, the loyalty will break
down. It‘s all about the bargain. It's all about a deal. This is the real deep power of
the genetic forces. We saw preservation last week.
We are designed to bring a new generation over and over again into the world. It
must be nurtured. It must be protected. It must be educated. It must be, or the
species will fail. And it is not left to us that that is an intellectual concept choice. It‘s
rigid. It‘s built deep, deep, deep within our mechanism. Nothing will change it other
than this mutation, nothing. It's how powerful it is. After all, it is life. This is what
life is from the point of view of the genetics it is simply about successful reproduction
and maintenance of a viable gene pool and the potential of that bioform to keep on
keeping on. That‘s what it cares about.
The Breakdown of the 19/49
So, let's deconstruct this for a moment and look at it from another perspective.
What does that mean that we have the breaking down of the 19/49? It means the
The Life Force is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

146
LECTURE TEN
The Supporting Forces
glue is breaking down. It means this pressure that this must be the way is breaking
down. Remember that every stream begins with a pressure, whether it begins from
the head above or it beings from the root
below. It is about the pressure. You want
to understand a stream, understand its
pressure. Everything else is just dealing
with it, literally. The pressure here is pro-
found and the pressure is being cut off,
squeezed out.
We don't feel it now because we have Nep-
tune sitting here. Neptune is going to sit
here for awhile. It is truly, truly a myste-
rious process that is going on in this chan-
nel. The frequency, literally, is breaking
down. And of course, that is going to change all of this. It will, because without the
pressure you don't need the bargain. Without the pressure you don't need the loyal-
ty. The 19/49 is the bride and groom sexually. The 19 attracts the attention of the
49, and the 49 says, okay, as long as you‘re loyal—love, honor, obey—as long you‘re
loyal everything is going to be fine.
But the moment that you're not loyal, this is not going to work. It‘s all built on loyal-
ty. After all, the bond that is made between the male and the female is not blood
bond. They don't really truly become linked to each other unless they have
offspring. If they don't have offspring they are never linked to each other. They're
not. They‘re genetically different; that's the whole purpose. So something else has
to link them together. It is this loyalty and the contract and the beginning that holds
them together long enough. And of course, in the tradition of the seven-centered
being, pregnancy was something that was going to come very, very quickly. If it
didn‘t there would be problems. It would come very, very quickly, and many ob-
viously, unfortunately, for the women that had to bear all of that, but nonetheless.
The Breakdown of the Bargain-Loyalty Relationship
It‘s like Catholic Church dogma. The only way to keep a male and female together in
an honest relationship is to make sure that they have children, have them fast and
have many of them. And then you've got this built-in loyalty. You have a loyalty to
support those young. And of course, what we have seen since particularly 1961, this
is when we entered into the retrograde 1st line theme of the Cross of Planning, so its
completion in that sense, since 1961 one of the things that we've observed sociologi-
cally, particularly in the West, is that we have seen the beginnings of what appears
to be breakdown of the family. That is, there are as many divorces as marriages in
most western countries; that the support mechanisms, the contracts, are breaking
down.
We can see that, for example, historically we have always lived in multigenerational
families. The multigenerational family is the most loyalty-bound. The grandparents

and the grandchildren have a genetic relationship to each other that is very deep.
They are closer genetically than the child to parent. The three-generational family
carries different lines of Authority; all of it is rooted in this loyalty and bargain. And
of course, it‘s gone. It‘s very rare.
Even here when I first arrived in Ibiza in the early 80s, the farm families you still saw
three-generational families, but even those are disappearing because the moment
that the island began to become successful because of tourism and wealth came,
immediately everybody wants their own zone. And one of the things that we've seen
is that there is this breakdown of the bargain.
For example, so many human beings who are going to bond with each other no long-
er bother with an agreement at all. This drives the tribe absolutely nuts, because
there is no guarantee for the successful nurturing of the young, because again the
genes do not care about you, your relationship. They don't, they can‘t, obviously.
This is just a mechanism. And the mechanism is a pressure and the pressure de-
mands that you're going to give that support to those, and it‘s going to be concre-
tized through a bargain-loyalty relationship.
The moment that the bargain begins to get shaky, after all, the 40/37 is a back-
ground frequency that started in 1610. Since we‘re 19 years away from the shifting
of the cycle in a 400-year plus process, you have to see that it's already fading. It is
beginning to lose its power as a background frequency. And the power of the bar-
gain is beginning to break down.
One of the jokes about that is that the more the power of the bargain breaks down,
since 1961, we have produced more attorneys and lawyers and barristers on this
planet than in the entire history of the planet before 1961. Think about that. I
known lawyers aren‘t everybody's favorite cup of tea, but really understand that the
proliferation of that bargain business: the bargains break down, new bargains are
established, people fight over the bargains all the time. There is no more real loyal-
ty. This is all breaking down.
So, we are living in very unusual times. We are living in a time of evolutionary
change. We are nine-centered beings, we are very different from our seven-
centered past, and it means that we are living with a transition literally within the
wiring of our form. Of course, regardless of all of that, the fact of the matter is that
your life is determined by your Authority. That‘s what matters. It‘s the only thing
that matters that you know how to make a decision. And as long as you do that,
you‘re going to be able to navigate through a world of change, because it‘s a world
change.
But really grasp deeply how this force has locked us in forever. It really has locked
us into our families, our tribes, all that pressure on us, all the bargains in our lives,
all the deals that we've had to make, all the arrangements that you have to work
out, those deals with your family, those bargains that you make, think about them.
This is something that has been locking us in for a very, very long time, and it's
changing.

The Supporting Forces
The 32/54: The Channel of Transformation
The other side is very different. It's different in the sense that if I were to divide this
politically, over here would be socialism (right side), this is socialism, and over here
is capitalism (left side), the difference between the emotional system and the splenic
system, the difference in the way in which these to operate. This is deeply, deeply
communal after all; it‘s the Channel of Community (channel 37/40). It is about the
shared or the supported resources (channel
19/49), that those are part of the tribe come
to eat at the table and everybody gets
treated in a way that is correct because they
are part of the larger family and so forth and
so on that all of this, working together as a
community and sharing in it and building it Capitalism Socialism
together and taking responsibility for your
neighbor watch, and all that stuff.
This is the social side (right side). But the
social side is very primitive. Over here (gate
19) you gather sheep and cattle and you
grow some crops and you make sure that you have enough resources, but this (the
19 to the 40) is a very, very primitive economic infrastructure. As a matter of fact,
you spend more time praying to God that it's going to rain so that you all have
enough to eat than anything else, because this is a very, very primitive economic
level. It is the basic survival, shelter level.
The 54: Ambition
The other side is different. It begins with a 54, this gate of the Marrying Maiden, this
gate of Ambition. One of the cute things in the program is that the gate of the Em-
press or the Emperor is the 45, this sort of shifting of these letters, the very top of
the process and here's the lowest rung of the process, this 54, this driving pressure,
this pressure of ambition. The one thing that makes this ambition palatable is that
though you see it in a being, the fact is that it is rooted in tribe. In other words,
though the ambition has an individual quality to it, it‘s there to serve the tribe. And
it's there to be able to make money in the tribe because this is all about money.
The 32: The Personnel Manager
Here is the ambition. This is the personnel manager, the 32nd gate. The 32nd gate is
here to recognize where or how ambition can be fulfilled or not. This is transforma-
tion, the Channel of Transformation, this force to transform the economy. To make
more, but not to make more in the biological sense, to make more in the physical

sense, which by the way leads to many things like wars of conquering and so forth
and so on. We‘ll get to the war part in a bit.
The 54 looks at the 19 and thinks, I don't want to be a shepherd. It's nice that there
is food to eat and stuff and I've got this simple little house. I don‘t want to be a
shepherd. I want more than that. And of course, their wanting more brings more to
everyone. And on the other side, you have 32 and the 32 is absolutely terrified of
one thing and one thing only: failure. Oh, is it afraid of failure. It can be suicidal
about failure.
The Tribe Needs to Develop
And it knows deep within it biologically, this is the Spleen after all, this is about sur-
vival, the Spleen is a center of intelligence, and this is an aware gate that it carries
within its awareness memory the recognition of the fragility of the tribe. It's not
enough that there are enough sheep, it isn‘t. The tribe has to develop. It has to get
better educated; it has to have more control over its environment. It has to nurture
its gifts.
In the earliest ways this would be developing specific hunting skills to be able to go
out and do certain things or develop certain crafts that can be traded with neighbor-
ing communities and all these kinds of things that are possible that enrich the poten-
tial materially of the tribe. The 32 is deeply afraid that there isn't going to be
enough talent. It‘s looking for talent.
It‘s looking for those that are going to be able to bring the tribe further ahead, be-
cause the tribe itself has this deep loyalty in it in which it is or wants to see itself
through its ego as being the tribe, the best tribe. No tribe ever says we‘re second
best. They might say they‘re oppressed, but they‘re never going to say they‘re
second best. Tribes have a vanity. This is part of that vanity that they don't want to
be the only village that doesn't have television, whatever the case may be.
So, the 32nd gate with the 54th gate, you get this force of transformation. It‘s ma-
terial transformation. Oh, yes, there is a mystical quality in it; the 54.4, it‘s a very
unusual gate. The 54 calls for attention, like the 19 calls for attention. Sometimes
the forces can be very kind. Sometimes you can get the attention of just the right
forces. But it is all about this material transformation to maintain the viability of the
tribe and to allow it to grow.
What do the genes want? You can see what they want today. In a world of seven or
eight billion we have a fantastic genetic mix. That‘s very important. When you think
about the fact that a couple hundred years ago, that the population was next to
nothing on this planet by comparison. What we have is the broadest stretching out
of genetic impossibility in order to open the door for a vast mutation. And what we
have seen about tribes is that the tribe that began in one valley eventually became a
tribe that controlled the continent.

The Supporting Forces
And it is not a uniform story. It is a story that is taking place all over this planet
throughout its history—the rise and fall of tribes and their growth. And this is just a
genetic impulse. Once you can maintain your viability, then expand it. Don't just
stay in the same valley with the same number of sheep and the same number of
beings because you're going to grow, and if you‘re going to grow you need more
space, you need more territory, you need to expand. You need to be able to develop
the skills that members of the tribe are going to need to master in order to be able
to transform the economy of the tribe and constantly keep it in competition with
other tribes.
Most of the history of civilization is one tribe murdering another, incorporating as-
pects of their culture and moving forward. It‘s where you find this. We are rapa-
cious creatures. We are a plague after all, to just about every life form on this pla-
net, because we are not satisfied with this nice little commune, the isolated com-
mune, because that is what this is over here (right side). Everybody is loyal, every-
body's working together, everybody does their bit, and everybody celebrates togeth-
er, eats together.
This is all business, it‘s really all business (left side). And when you really get to
business you‘re here (channel 44/26). There is nothing quite like this, by the way,
this mechanism. When you first get to see that, there is an excellent book by And-
rea (Reikl-Wolf) and myself on pregnancy—I gave pregnancy lectures a number
years ago on the various stages of all pregnancy, the first 88°, the interregnum in
between the 88° before the Sun, that whole process. And when you look at the
stages of the first 88° from the point of conception, this is one of the most important
stages in the process, because this is the establishment of the immune system.
The 44/26: The Channel of Surrender
In the 26th gate we have the thymus gland.
The thymus gland is still a mystery to the
scientists. They know that in the first three
years of life, it's the thymus gland that ac-
tually manages the development of the
splenic system; makes it possible, in that
sense. Of course, what we know about the
Spleen is that it is the center of our immune
system, the lymphatic system, the Spleen
itself. This is our body‘s laundry, our clean-
sing system.
But what is particularly interesting here is
that this channel—I mentioned that over here we had a cross-speciel connection
between mammals and human (channel 19/49), that is, mammals have the 19th
gate, they don‘t have the 49. This is a cross-speciel channel between birds, reptile
and fish. And birds, reptile, and fish have the 44th gate, but they don't have the 26.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
What is interesting about that is that all those creatures, the birds, reptiles and fish,
that these are cold-blooded. And of course, the 26th gate is the gate of hot-blooded.
This is a hot gate (26), this is a cold gate (44), or cool gate, and it is this blending of
this hot hitting this cold that actually initiates the immune system in the beginning of
the conception process. This has an extraordinary name. It‘s called the Channel of
Surrender.
I have a black sense of humor, so I find many kinds of amusing things, that there is
a great deal of violence that is potential in this. The 44th gate is a gate that says ―I
am responsible for the survival of the tribe. It is my responsibility. I'm the one
that's in charge. I have to make sure that the tribe survives because I'm the one
with the memory of the past. And I know that tribes disappeared and I know that
things become extinct. And I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen to us.‖ This
is the awareness that is there in the 44. And of course, the dilemma for the 44, like
the dilemma for the 40/37 is how do you deal with these gates of denial, because
they‘re gates of denial.
The 26: T Cells; the Salesperson
I know them well. I‘m a 40 and a 26 and I don't have either side of the other end.
The gate of denial is really in so many ways feels like an absolute, even though it can
be changed by the meeting of its electromagnetic. When we‘re dealing with the 26th
gate, we‘re dealing with T cells. If you wanted to make a horror movie and you
wanted to create a monster that would really be absolutely horrifying, all you need to
do is blow up a T cell into big enough size. It is as savage as anything can be. It‘s
the T cells within you that are your defense mechanism, they‘re your soldiers. They
will kill anything that‘s alien; they will kill anything that's trying to infect you. That's
their job. They‘re a real killer.
This is the place of the soldier. That is, a place of the soldier for the tribe. In other
words, one of the things about being this transmitter here and this transmitting force
is it transmits the power of the tribe and it‘s usually bullshit. In other words, the
26th gate can tell big stories, it can exaggerate things. In the civilized sense of the
word, this is the salesperson. Here we have the marketing manager (44) and here
we have the salesperson in the 26. So, that salesperson with their ego, they say
―We have the best tribe, we are the greatest tribe, and if you get in our way we‘re
going to stomp on you.‖ This is part of the tribe.
The 44: Manipulation
Remember that because the 44 is deeply concerned about the survival of the tribe
and because this is the great gate of manipulation—I don't mean that in the negative
sense, it‘s simply what it means—the ability to control the ego. That‘s what the 44
can do, because again the moment that they meet, they have the juxtaposition and
of course that gives you the quantum of the channel and the channel is a different

The Supporting Forces
thing. The channel is this very, very powerful transmission. And ultimately what the
44 does is that it controls the way in which the 26 is going to act out. In other
words, is it going to act out as ―I am mar-
keting, I am selling.‖ Or is it going to act
out as ―I am protecting, I am defending,
and I am going to fight for.‖
There is within this context supporting
forces that are military forces or rioting
forces, or guerrilla forces. And it goes on
and on and on. The terrorists that emerges
out of some particular tribe, for them every
other tribe, the collective, all those beings
are evil. And one of the things that you get
to see in the 44/26 is that you get to see
the power of tribal propaganda, because
that's what it is. That is, the tribe always blowing its own horn, always exaggerat-
ing, always putting itself further ahead and always trying to catch up, always trying
to be the best. It‘s a driving force in it.
And of course, this is what ultimately supports the tribe. It supports the tribe be-
cause it brings the new economies to the tribe. So, instead of having a couple of
women in the village who were weaving, all of a sudden there is a weaving factory
and the weaving factory becomes a big business. In other words, there is this de-
velopment out of the skill set within the tribe, witness from the 32/54 to be able to
transform the basic ambition, the basic need for more, to be able to transform this
and be able to do so by advancing the economy. It's all money. We can call it re-
sources; but, in the end it's really about money.
And of course, it‘s one of those things about the tribe. You can see that, most of the
businesses on this planet, literally, the vast majority of businesses on this planet are
small family businesses. And this is the way in which it has always worked. This is
where there is this confusion. The 19/49 is the bride and the groom and the 54/32
is about the ambitious one trying to get the attention of the personnel manager and
what you end up with is that sometimes these people have sex, and it‘s supposed to
be over here (19/49). The whole tradition of people having affairs in their
workplace; all of these affairs in the workplace are simply a distortion of what is this
side of the program and confusing it with the other side. Or this 49 that says love,
honor, and obey, or this 32 that says excuse me, you can't have the job you want
unless I have sex, which is quite nasty thing, obviously, and something that is quite
common.
The Not-Self and the Bargains
The tribe has its great beauties, I'm well aware of them. It also has its horrors. We
are a duality, this is about the dualism. And to recognize clearly that in looking at
these basic themes that are here, understanding that these themes do not operate in

153
THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels

the way in which they should, after all, they don't. We live in a homogenized world.
It‘s ruled by not-self decision making. And it doesn't matter; if you're somebody for
example that has the 40/37, it doesn't mean that your bargains are correct. But
you're driven to make bargains. And if your bargains aren't correct, you‘re going to
suffer. And your bargains can only be correct if you're operating correctly. There is
no other way.
What you have to see is that there is an enormous distortion that takes place within
these forces in the way in which these forces exist in our world. The few examples I
give you of the dark side of it, the ugly side of it, are sides that shouldn't be there at
all. It is simply the way in which the not-self operates, it is the way in which homo-
genization works.
The 44/26 can be very frightening. At the same time, it is a beautiful force, this
force of transmission, the ability to get the ear of the tribe, because this is the pow-
er. After all, if you belong to a tribe and you open up a store and you're selling refri-
gerators, you're going to call up every relative you have, you're going to send them
all a little invitations to the opening of your shop, you‘re going to get those members
of the tribe to buy your product, they're going to have to support you because you‘re
a tribe member. Oh, yeah, James‘ little boy, remember him, well, now, he‘s a big
guy and he‘s got this shop and he‘s having trouble and let‘s go over and support.
Not only that, but the one, but the one that is running that tribal store will actually
have the audacity to tell you not only is it the best refrigerator ever, but you're get-
ting it at a fantastic price, which isn‘t true. It was like those guys or women who
gets these jobs as life insurance salespeople, and who are the first people they call
up, every relative they have, second cousins, third cousins, looking for the support.
This is one of the dilemmas about tribes and the way in which their economies work
is that they began to spiral inward if they don't grow. They become incestuous with
inflated prices, and so forth and so on, with inefficient organizations in which people
are making money and they're not actually doing anything; again, the support sys-
tem that's there in the tribe. When you see that distorted to political systems it
becomes devastating in terms of the human beings that have to live with those con-
ditions.
Dysfunction and Backlashes
None of this operates correctly. And of course, we are not only dealing with the fact
that we've got a homogenized planet, but we‘re dealing with the fact that the under-
lying function of this, because this is a unit, it's one thing, and the moment that you
see that and you understand that there is something going on here, it means that all
of this is beginning to display dysfunction, and display dysfunction deeper than what
homogenization brings. Out of this dysfunction has come the advent of the individu-
al war. One person, strap them full of bombs, walk them into a supermarket. We
have an enormous dysfunction that is taking place. It just is.

The Supporting Forces
What you get out of that is you get all kinds of different backlashes. You get a mate-
rialism that is really gone crazy, and you do. We have such a disproportionate out-
lay of resources on this planet that it's beyond shameful. And we have an enormous
problem with the religious underpinning of our world. This is what's bringing the
greatest tension.
We inherited from the seven-centered being and its strategic way of living its life
through its mind many, many philosophies, religions, moralities. As nine-centered
beings operating within a totally different matrix, the fact is that these philosophies,
these religions are beginning to break down. And they're beginning to break down
and the result of that is that there is a rising up of an amazing backlash. We are
seeing this incredible backlash.
One of the most powerful movements on the planet is Islam, regardless of what
anybody thinks about it, it is one of the most powerful movements on the planet. It
is the most vital religion in the world today. It has just about over a billion and there
is a subculture in the Islamic world that wants to be purely seven-centered, would
like to go back to the 13th century, literally go back to the 13th century where the
power of this was overwhelming. That the bargain was locked in, that no child would
be teased by Western television commercials.
Living Your Inner Authority
We all understand day-by-day in our world what is happening as a result of this,
what we get to see on the surface. We are in deeply, deeply transforming times.
And it means that we have to take advantage as much as possible of the awareness
that we can derive from operating correctly as ourselves in being able to navigate on
this plane. You cannot handle all of this intellectually, you cannot find a solution;
there are none. This is just a wheel turning, this is just a mechanism. What matters
is your own process. What matters is your life. That's what matters. And you‘re
only going to find your life within yourself. You‘re only going to find that within your
Inner Authority. You cannot find it anywhere else.
Whatever these functions happen to be in these forces, if you're operating correctly,
they will be correct. This is the secret. It‘s always been the secret. It is the basis of
this knowledge. I have taught thousands of classes, literally thousands of classes,
and they all lead to the same place. You can understand ―this and that.‖ There is so
much ―this and that‖ to grasp. But that is for the mind and the passenger. The life
is for the body. It's only when you hand Authority over to your vehicle that you have
the opportunity to see how these things are intended to work, how beautiful that can
be. And at the same time, the great privilege that comes in your ability to be able to
be entertained by the movie, to be able to sit back as a passenger and to be able to
take in the richness of what it is to be you.

Lecture Eleven
The Forces of Diversity
The Heart Center and the Tribe
Welcome to our closing session here, our journey in the life forces; the forces of
diversity. It almost seems like a repeat for me. I did a lecture not too long ago, I
think in Rave Anatomy, it was a lecture called The Fork in the Road, and this is the
fork in the road. It is here, perhaps, more than any place else that the power of the
tribe and its influence over all life emerges.
The Heart Center is really an incredible thing. It is so profound in terms of the im-
pact it has on humanity as a whole in just about everything that we do, because
when you look at the nature of the tribe and you understand that the tribe is the
circuitry that is most connected to what is the genetic imperative of reproduction,
that in essence the tribal
circuitry is so different from
the collective or individuali-
ty, because the tribal cir-
cuitry has its own unique
agenda. It‘s not like any
other circuit. It doesn‘t
have its focus in the
Throat. The focus is there
in that Heart Center, in that
Ego Center, in that will
center. And it is a will and
an ego to drive forward the
genetic future of the tribe.
And of course, it is this
very tribalism; it is this
very tribal process that
actually has made human life possible. And yes, an individual can exist on their
own, but their ability to be reproductively successful in the sense of being able to
nurture young long enough and so forth and so on, that‘s not their thing. And the
collective is very interesting, but the fact is that their main thing isn't having babies
and making more. It‘s not what it's about. It isn‘t. It‘s only in the tribe that this is
what life is about. It's only the tribe that life is how we all see it, how we all live it,
how we all have to accept it.

THE LIFE FORCE: The Channels
A Digital Book for Newcomers
You come into the world, you‘re raised in a family, you go out and find a partner,
you make a family yourself, you spend 20 or 30 years of your life focused on the
development and nurturing of your offspring and then you're done. And this is the
tribe, and then you go to a retirement community where you hang out with the rest
of the tribe waiting for the Grim Reaper to show up. This is the tribe. This is what
the tribe is all about. And it‘s the very basis of life.
It‘s integrated into every single one of us. It has such a deep profound effect on
what we are. It‘s where our heart is, after all. It‘s really something to understand
about the complexity of this center, the heart, the gallbladder, the thymus, the T
cells, the stomach, all here in this little triangle that has a very odd geometry within
the symmetry, the general symmetry of the BodyGraph. You can tell right away that
something is odd here, different. It‘s like it was layered on, or like everything else,
was layered on to it, in a sense. Because there is no life, there is no humanity with-
out it. And that means that in the end, it has to be a binary. This is life.
And the binary itself is a way of enriching this process. We see that the tribe has its
binary anyway. The emotional tribe and the splenic tribe are very different from
each other, and yet they're bound by the same road, the road that leads directly to
the Heart Center. It‘s here where the tribe meets. Your meet your blood through
love, you meet it through your heart; the power of the tribe in our lives.
And then you get to this fork in the road and this is an incredible fork in the road.
For me as a pure individual, when I look at the collective or the tribe, if you give me
a choice of who I'd rather spend time with, give me the tribe, because there is a
connection there, a deep one. I happen to be a 25/51, so I have a very deep-rooted
connection to the tribe, to the heart, to the stomach, to this core of what this tribe
is.
The 45 Speaks for the Tribe
The tribe has a natural root. It goes here (the
45). That is, when we‘re looking at the tribe, the
only expression of the tribe, the only verbal ex-
pression that the tribe has, the only voice that
the tribe has is its leader; in that sense histori-
cally, the elder. It is the elder who speaks for
the tribe. That elder who would become the
genetic bloodline ruler, the king, the queen, the
emperor, the empress, who speaks for the tribe
no matter how big is the tribe gets. It is where
we get the royal ‗we.‘ All 45s have this. Some-
times it comes out as a slip of tongue when they say ‗we‘ and you look at them, and
think—it‘s kind of cute, actually. We are a binary consciousness; we could probably
all get away with it, but anyway.

LECTURE ELEVEN
The Forces of Diversity
The 21 Controls the Tribe
That‘s the 45. It speaks for the tribe. And in speaking for the tribe it has an incredi-
ble responsibility, a fascinating responsibility and that is that its role is ultimately to
be able to educate the tribe. On the other side, the 21, you‘re dealing with the pow-
er to keep order in the tribe, that tribes have to be controlled. Now, I want you to
think about what I just said: Tribes have to be controlled. And not have to be; be-
cause that's philosophical, they have to be because that's the design. Tribes are
controlled. That‘s what 21s do. That is what its job is all about; the hunter/huntress
controlling the tribe.
And when you think about the tribe, tribes as we understand them, tribal communi-
ties as we understand them, they are very, very controlling. They‘re controlling in
terms of morality, they‘re controlling in terms of religion, they‘re controlling in terms
of dress, all the things that are there within the context of the power of the control
that is inherent in the 21. And this is the channel of materialism. This is the materi-
al life force. This is the material life force that says there are always going to be
those who have and those who have not. And we are going to struggle to be the
have, and we are going to fight to be the have, and we are going to control you for
your own benefit so that you can end up being the have a rather than the have not.
And if you don't do what we say, we will ostracize you, push you out of the tribe and
you can become one of the have-nots.
Democracy and the Tribe
It‘s built into the tribe. It‘s this joke that we have now that goes on in the world.
That is, it's an old joke, the battle of ideologies. And there is this assumption about
the nature of democracy that democracy is something that everybody is ready for,
everybody wants to be ―free,‖ everybody wants to have ―free choice.‖ But, one of
the things that you get to notice if you see it within the context of Design is that if
you are in a collective society, that‘s very easy.
It is very easy in a collective society to be able to
have democratic so-called ―elections.‖ It‘s very
easy, because in a collective society everybody is
there to share. Everybody has a right to be in-
volved, everybody is in the pattern, everybody
needs to be involved in selecting, electing what
the pattern will be, and all of that is correct. As
a matter of fact, if you don't vote it's a shame,
because you're not participating, you're not par-
ticipating in the collective process.
It‘s very impressive. They just had an election here in Spain, 70% of the eligible
voters voted. This is a collective society. That's quite a triumph. But this idea that
you can take deeply tribal societies and impose democracy on them runs in the face

of what we're looking at right here. It says we do not speak for ourselves. Our
leaders speak for us. And whatever our leader tells us to do, whether that's the local
mullah, or it's the local warlord, whatever the hell it is, whatever our local leader
tells us to do, we will do. The theme of loyalty that runs in the tribe, the theme of
support that is inherent in the circuitry, that your support is not something that is
asked for, it is expected. That you do not challenge the elder in the tribe that you do
not challenge what they say is good for the tribe.
The Collective
If we only had this way, we would still be caught in a deeply, deeply, deeply tribal
mess. And you can see how pervasive this is that so much of the world is ruled this
way. The collective, and the way in which the collective rules, is here. A projected
element that needs recognition that has to look for votes, that has to share its pat-
terns and concepts in order for them to be accepted. That it cannot just act. And
here, this is a manifestor. This Heart Center has an incredible power. This is quite
an expression of power. It is much more powerful in its pure structure than anything
that's there in the collective; anything.
And we have this struggle in the world over this ideology business. How different is
it that a union decides what its members are going to vote for, or who they're going
to support. The unions that are spread out throughout Europe and North America
that are in the democratic collective world, but they don't vote that way. They don't.
They vote in the old tribal pattern. It‘s not that long ago that politics was ruled by
local bosses and local barons that told people how to vote. And the assumption was
in the idealized view of all this, that's very corrupt and so forth and so on, but hey,
this is a 45/21, this is the way it works.
This is how the material plane works. The boss of the corporation, what that boss
says everybody is going to do, they do. It is controlled by the 21 who makes damn
sure that everybody does what they're supposed to do, otherwise they get fired.
And I don't mean to paint a dark picture of this because of course for me, looking at
the life force is looking at the life force in the context of the world we live in. It‘s a
homogenized world. It doesn't operate correctly. The relationships between beings
on this plane are not correct. The societies that are still ruled tribally are filled with
enormous numbers in their population that are disenfranchised that literally are
deeply oppressed beings who submit willfully to this.
It‘s what makes the collective so interesting. I look at the collective; we‘ve been
through this process together so you know I look at them sort of wow, what a thing.
This ability to be able to transcend this kind of control, to be able to liberate the
individual, the individual being, to be able to open up that possibility that one simply
doesn‘t have to bow down to what the elder says, that you don‘t have to accept the
controls, that there is something else, that there is another way to go. That every-
one, in that sense, has a right, even though in a homogenized sense we know that
it‘s all a chimera.

The Forces of Diversity
The reality is that what the collective society has brought to us is what we get to
experience in its fulfillment through Human Design, that is, the potential of an indi-
vidual to establish their own authority. The collective is a way of breaking the hold
of the tribe, of changing the way in which leadership operates, giving the individual
being an opportunity to participate in the way in which their lives are molded by the
larger society. That opens up the doorway to the process of the individual standing
on their own and saying yes or no in their own truth without fear of retribution. You
cannot go against the elder without retribution. There is real price to be paid in the
real world out there for those that challenge this kind of tribal rulership. They're
eliminated.
The language of the world has become the voice that says ―I have,‖ or ―I don‘t
have.‖ There are 11 gates in the Throat. And this is the most prevalent word on
everyone‘s lips. This is where the world suffers, this world of the haves and have-
nots, and it's mostly have-nots. This is the dominance of this; it‘s also the problem.
It's very old, this mechanism. It‘s one of the frameworks of the development of our
species. But in so many ways it's outdated, that it no longer serves the common
good, that the tribe is no longer necessarily genetically pure, that the changing of
the world, the collective nature of the world, the emergence of the global village, in
the influence of globalization, all of these things are changing the way in which
members of tribes look at their life, that they‘re beginning to compare, they‘re be-
ginning to want to go this way.
The Fork in the Road
This is the fork in the road. You go this way and the tribe will look after you in a
sense relative to the nature of that tribe. So there will be the security of that, those
members of the tribe that will never rock the boat no matter what the leaders ays,
no matter what they do. But in a way it makes life less complex, less challenging.
And then there‘s this. This is no longer tribal. It is an individual channel. It is an
individual life force. And it is basically a life force that opens up the possibility to
step out of the control of the tribe. And the tribe doesn‘t mind. It‘s can‘t anyway,
it‘s simply mechanically the way is.
Tribes have a problem. They do. It‘s a serious problem. It‘s a genetic problem. A
tribe needs to replenish its genetic pool. If it doesn't do that, it's going to die out.
At some point it becomes incestuous. At some point inbreeding will take place, at
some point there are going to be problems if it's a closed gene pool. The way histor-
ically the tribe has dealt with that is through the power of its ability, the combination
of the 21 and 26 to go to war. And basically going to war was just a way of expand-
ing the gene pool. Kill the men, rape the women, and integrate the children into the
new tribe.

The Tribe and the Individuality
Now, there are still examples of that in the world, unfortunately. This developing of
the gene pool; I guess the best illustration of that, my favorite illustration of that is
the traveling salesman story. There were always these dirty jokes when I was a
teenager about the traveling salesman that would show up inside some farmer and
the farmer's daughter, whatever the case maybe. But basically this is something
that is something that is a tradition of tribe. The tribe will always accept an individu-
al as long as the individual will play by the tribal rules to some point, they will accept
the individual because they need the new blood. The need the new genetic material,
they need to refresh the genetic pool.
Here in this 51/25 is the deep relationship that exists between the tribe and indivi-
duality. Not simply that the tribe will take in individuals at that deep level in order to
replenish the genetic pool. But the tribe itself will give up its own to the individual
way. Now, the tribe has nothing to do with the collective; absolutely nothing. There
is no place where they meet. There is no connection between them. But there is a
deep, deep connection between the
tribe and individuality. And it is here
where you get this initiation into the
possibility of self, the unique identity,
the unique behavior, the unique awa-
kening. ―I, I, I, I am; I know I am.‖
Not ―we are‖; but, ―I know I am.‖ This
is a totally different track.
Something to understand about magic,
shamans, spirituality, and mysticism, is
that religions are all tribal. And the
greatest exponents are individuals. The
mystical way passes this way. The
40/37 and the 19/49 are deeply, deeply tribal. The pressure to have God in the 19,
that whole pressure driving its way upward; the glue of the tribe. So much of what
we see today, for example, in the Middle East is this theocratic force where religion
has become the politics. In this mystical way, one has to not enter into the material
plane, not accept the control of the 21, but have the gall to go one's own way.
There is a blind stupidity to this, truly, I know. It can seem very brave to be ready
to walk away from the security of the tribe, but very foolish in most cases, because it
is truly a leap into the void.
The Primary Life Force
This is the primary life force. You‘re looking at it right here in 25/51. When you look
at this G Center and you just see the 25th gate, that‘s the design of all inanimate
objects. It's the design of the biverse. It's the design of neutrinos. It's the design

LECTURE ELEVEN
The Forces of Diversity
of quasars, you name it. This is the great inanimate, one gate, one potential, no
channel. But the moment there is something on the other side, this is the great life
force. This is where the animate and the inanimate meet, in a sense. This is where
the inanimate is given life, literally given life. The Catholic who takes the wafer in its
mouth—this is my flesh—the inanimate becomes life, that you bow down to the great
idol of thought. And the inanimate has life. We can endow objects with life; we do.
It's such a strange force that sits in here. It‘s this place of magic. It's a world in
which everything is life. It is to understand that a grain of sand is alive within this
context. It‘s all alive. This is the awakening to universal love. It‘s awakening to
understanding the vast throbbing life force that is the totality. It‘s not simply this
microcosm where we play out this dance in this movie, that it‘s alive. This is where
the priest and the shaman is, the ones who can feel the life force through the inani-
mate, who can stand there with their staff and point it towards heaven and the seas
part; or just walk away, because this is the individual way, to find your own way.
Uniqueness and the Tribe
I love the tribe because I know that the tribe nurtures and sanctions the emergence
of uniqueness despite themselves. They give birth to it. That the very control of the
tribe breathes in certain children, the dream of breaking free. That has space for
those that are different, that are strange, the odd childhood that is taken and nur-
tured by the shaman so that their gift can be something that is useful. They do not
have to be homogenized into the tribal rules and mores. The tribe will nurture their
uniqueness. They will just not nurture rebellion. But they nurture their own, they
point them in that direction: go that way.
And this opens up the whole possibility. When you look at conception mechanics,
the first 88 degrees of life after conception begins here, the Throat and G Center.
And the next step is here. This is how the life force gets established in the fetus.
It‘s something to see that what we are as a mechanism, the way in which we are
established, is not to bow down on the surface holistically to the tribe. But we are
born with a unique right to express this special uniqueness, out of the vessel, from
the universal love, from the recognition of the life force itself to the establishment of
unique individual behavior in the world, the place where you learn to love yourself.
And where that love of self, the correctness of behavior, emerges in the now, and
emerges in the now with the self-reflected recognition. I am here now; this is it. I
am alone. I am not this or that. I‘m unique. Uniqueness is everything. It is that
uniqueness for the tribe in a deconstructed sense that is their reward because they
get the new genetic material. It is that uniqueness that ultimately can open up the
doorway for the nine-centered being to be able to establish in its life its uniqueness.
It's not about that this is bad and this is good. Please understand that. It has noth-
ing to do with any of that. Everything is a mess. If you‘re not-self these aspects are
going to operate through your dysfunction, they‘re going to operate through your

distorted decision making process. They‘re not operating the way in which they were
intended to operate.
The correctness and the awareness of the 45/21 is something that still has an ex-
traordinary value and place in the world. It‘s just that we don't see too many dem-
onstrations of it. The same thing is true for the 51/25. Most people who carry the
51/25 basically are people who feel like that they haven't been able to win in life. It
is deeply competitive on the mundane level. And for the not-self, there are so many
dilemmas in life. And these are people who basically see themselves as losers. It‘s
not like it's a great thing to carry around if you‘re not-self, nothing is.
But in correctness this is one of the great binaries that‘s there in the BodyGraph. It‘s
one of the things that really tells a very profound story about what we are about,
that there's always going to be those beings on the planet who need to be led by
45/21s. And that the quality of their life is dependent on the correctness or aware-
ness of those that rule them, that they submit to. You will not free these beings.
You cannot. But their lives can be enhanced, improved, enriched. It‘s a matter of
how they are ruled. But you cannot escape what's written there in the program.
You cannot.
Power of the Tribe is Beginning to Fade
Let us have those who say ‗we,‘ and carry with them an awareness of what that
responsibility is. Then they're going to act correctly for the benefit of those that
need them. The tribe is about need. It is about support. And the tribe is entering
into its most fragile era ever. We‘ve lived in a deep, deep tribal age since 1610,
since the beginning of the Cross of Planning with the dominance of the 40/37. This
goes away at 2027; it‘s gone. The background frequency, the inherent support sys-
tem that is built into our modern way of life that gives real humanity to collective
pattern organization is going away.
The power of the tribe is something that is beginning to fade. And without correct-
ness you just get backlash; the not-self feeling that something is being lost and
struggles to maintain it. Those places in the world that are overwhelmed by globali-
zation and the threats to its moral way of life have become so incredibly violent in an
attempt to protect their tribal order. This is simply the breakdown of this tribal pow-
er. And the individual way has been so deeply perverted that a single being
strapped with bombs walks into a supermarket and ignites themselves.
With the not-self, there is nothing but madness. Look out in our world; there‘s noth-
ing but madness out there. I am somebody who follows what‘s going on in the world
in detail, day by day by day. It is a horror trip. All of these life forces that I've
shared with you, each and every one of them, are either something of great wonder
and beauty or a horror and ugliness, and anywhere in between. Humanity is so dys-
functional that these life forces don‘t operate in the way in which they were intended
to. They don‘t operate purely, they don't operate correctly. We live on a plane
where everything is being manipulated by the not-self mind, by mental decision

making that distorts all of this, that uses whatever is there for its own distorted pur-
pose.
We really don't know what these things are, because we don't see them through the
purity of the human being operating correctly; we don't. I look at the fork in the
road and I see what the program lays out. It says, okay, let's be clear. Genetically
speaking, there is only going to be about 5 to 7% of children born that are going to
have the possibility of truly being different. That‘s it. That's what I see. I see the
93% that flow through the 45/21 and the rest that go through that 51/25. And it
doesn't mean that because they are a percentage that is the different that they're
actually going to succeed in being able to express the fullness of that.
I've mentioned it before that when I look at the world I see that somewhere between
30 and 50 million people could be correct. In a world of billions, seven plus billions,
it isn't a lot. It really isn‘t. It's the same thing about the nature of the world, that
understanding that this is a deep underlying theme and again under stress, because
in the not-self world most people succumb to the homogenization, they just do.
And whether it is a true tribe, or it is an artificial tribal construct, the fact is that we
live in societies where we accept all kinds of level of control, because that's what you
do. No sense fighting City Hall. That's what you do. And those that break the rules,
those that jump out, it doesn't mean that they are going to be something that's
going to be special. Most of them end up, well not most, but a lot of them, end up
with all kinds of psychological and physical problems; they just do.
We’re Here to Stand within the Power of Our Own Being
There is not an infrastructure today for dealing with uniqueness. We are all homo-
genized from birth. We‘re homogenized before birth. We‘re homogenized all the
time. This is what the seven-centered being gave to us—universal homogenization
through the mind. You emerge out of a vehicle that‘s homogenized into a homoge-
nized world. That's why it's so difficult to wake anybody up. The density of the ho-
mogenization is extraordinary. You‘re all trained the same way, raised the same
way. I look here and I just see the world as it is and what is acceptable in the pro-
gram, a certain amount of deviation is acceptable. In a sense it is our doorway. It
opens up the possibility for us, because the fact you are in this class, you are not
normal. It's the only way.
Normality is the mindlessness of the homogenized world. It is in this possibility of
abnormality that we get this opportunity to break not just simply with the tribal pat-
terns, the collective patterns, but we break with all of it, we break the covenant, we
enter into a very special arrangement within ourselves.
It is only through your unique authority, it is only by establishing your life on your
authority that can fulfill what is the possibility of this form, what it means to bring
the beauty and correctness to your life force, whatever that force is, and not that
there is anything to do because there is nothing to do. It is simply about watching it

emerge because that's what correctness, strategy and authority gives you. It gives
you a platform to begin to observe, to watch the movie, your movie, to surrender to
the fact that you do not have to be in control, that you do not have to be controlled,
that you're not here to be a servant, a slave, a supplicant. You‘re here to stand
within the power of your own being.
Human Design is the science of differentiation. It‘s an extraordinary thing. A way
mechanically not simply to be able to see the unique potential in every being, but to
be able to provide the techniques necessary to that being to fulfill that potential.
And it is the only thing that matters. It is more important than anything else. It is
the basis upon which this incarnation that you have is what it's all about, because
don't think that you're going to get another chance. You're not. This is it, now. And
it is about preparing the way for those that come.
Human Design Knowledge is for Children
This knowledge was given to me for children, for babies; but, oh, the dilemma of
parents. I've had to go through this long journey, this journey of teaching adults
trying to snap them out of the homogenized malaise to awaken in them a process
that leads to their deconditioning. And though I care about each being who enters
into this process, my motive is to get to those children, to be able to provide them
with essential education, to be able to provide them with essential nourishment, to
be able to give them every single possible opportunity not to be conditioned, not to
be homogenized so that they can live this life as a nine-centered being as them-
selves to enjoy the beauty of what it is to trust in yourself, to trust in your own au-
thority.
Not everybody gets to make it. Not everybody can. Not everybody even comes
close to getting a chance. It's the thing to grasp about how special it is. It's not a
right. It isn‘t. It‘s just something that's there; for whatever reason, something
that's been revealed. It opens up the possibility to be able to live out the fullness of
this process, the fullness of what is to be this kind of being. I love being a nine-
centered being. It's really something to finally understand how the mechanism
works, to be at peace within myself as I watch the flow of this movie, to be free of
the burdens of the mind. It‘s something very special.
As always, it seems to me that it‘s the ironies in life that I enjoy so much, something
so easy to do. And it's so difficult for so many. Strategy and authority is not a com-
plex thing. It isn‘t. It‘s very straightforward and very simple; and yet, well, the
mind, the world around you, its pressures, those forces that are not you that bind
you, that condition the world, that forces you to be this or that, that drags you away
from yourself, that just gives you the normal life and its emptiness. Well, you don‘t
want that, do you? I don‘t think anybody with any kind of sense does.

Luck
It‘s just simple. I have a word. I used to tell people there was no choice. It really
pissed them off, because they could never really understand it. And now I just talk
about luck. Everybody sort seems to understand luck, which is the same thing as no
choice, by the way, but they don‘t get that either; but anyway. You people are
lucky. You have to understand that. You have to appreciate that deeply within
yourself how lucky you are.
And that says a lot about how important it is to appreciate it, to make sure that you
take full advantage of it, because when luck shines on you, you can‘t afford to take it
for granted. It's a great gift, this gift of self. It‘s a great gift to be able to stand in
what is your own beauty. It really is. It‘s quite a thing. And you‘re lucky enough to
be able to see that. And the great thing is that there is, without question, the ability
to live it, not just to see it.
Anyway, to all of you, I‘ve enjoyed this very much. It's been a lovely program and
nice to return to basics like this again to look at them in different ways. Next seme-
ster, by the way, I'm going to the six lines. I haven't done the lines in a decade,
anyway, so that should be interesting to do. I hope to all of you that it was enjoya-
ble for you. And for all you, wherever you are, you take care over the break and
hopefully we‘ll see you in the new semester. Those of you that are going to be here
in Ibiza, I'll see in a few days. Bye for now.
