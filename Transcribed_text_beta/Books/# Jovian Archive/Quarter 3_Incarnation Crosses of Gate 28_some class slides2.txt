HE OF THE NEXPECTED
If they surrender to the struggle, the unexpected comes
out of the process of taking risks. In this Quarter, this is
the first gate where we really meet the foundation of a
true relationship. It is the root of love. The true nature of
relationships is found in finding a way to mutually
a
Macrocosm: empower each other to be better than on our own. It is
q
something to struggle for. However, the impact of the
Not Self is particularly devastating if your mind attempts
to dictate the struggle. You must be invited to the right
struggle with the right people. You can’t really get to the
right place with others without the tension.
a
The lower trigram Profiles are in a mighty struggle of q
finding their purpose while they are dealing with the
Microcosm: difficulty of living on the material plane. It is hard to
escape the impact. Everything hinges on the relationships
that you develop & if they are mutually beneficial.

HE OF THE NEXPECTED
Profiles:
1/3: Investigative Martyr
They are discovering & developing their strengths. They do that
by honing their intuition. They begin to select those things that
a
first allow them to survive on the material plane. This assuages q
their sense of the fear of death and a life without meaning.
They need strength to deal with the challenges of life in
general. They do not start with a plan. They are struggling to
find their purpose & it shows up from the unexpected. Power
is transitory & individuals understand this. The world is under
a
constant change & evolution. So they learn from mistakes and q
taking risks.
This Profile can be very challenging if it doesn’t start with an
invitation to connect with the other. It loses its intuitive
discernment and doesn’t know who is the correct person to
develop a mutually empowering relationship. If they become lost q 28 q 31
in the material plane, they don’t know which details are
a 27 a 41
important. Details are necessary to know which risks are correct.

Profiles:
2/4: Hermit Opportunist
a
They know that partnering with someone can be distasteful. It
q
is worth it because you can get somewhere with that partner
that you might not be able to get to on your own. However, it
can be a big struggle. The payoff is the possibility that they
see the potential in you & you impress them in some way. You
will take that deal with the Devil if it gets you something you
a
feel you can’t get on your own.
q
This Profile knows the biggest risk they take is to connect with
another person. Individuals tend to be only interested in
themselves. They need to find another person who is equally
self-absorbed. They will answer the call if they think the other
can empower them in some way. Then the risk is worth it. q 28 q 31

HE OF THE NEXPECTED
Profiles
3/5: Martyr Heretic
This Profile sees how difficult it is to find purpose. They know
how difficult it is to find the “one” who you can empower. They a
take unfounded risks in their explorations. They mistakenly q
attempt to handle the chaos of life by sharing it with someone
or supporting them. These approaches are a collective or tribal
process. They fear that no one will ever see their beauty &
amazing nature and they won’t find someone to feel the same
about. For 3/5’s they end up going for the unexpected that arise a
q
out of the relationship vs. the empowerment.
This Profile worries that the true connection will never come.
However, it shows up unexpectedly and suddenly. This is the
nature of an empowering , individual relationship. And if it is the
wrong relationship, they get the unexpected too – you get hurt.

At this point they run away.

UXTAPOSITION ROSS OF ISKS
They understand empowerment with another is
good, but having a territory is better. A by-
product of the intelligence that has been building
Macrocosm: in Q3 is the understanding that it is better to enter
into a bond if we have shared territory. It is much
easier to create and hold onto a relationship if you
a
have a common home and bed. q
They are very fixed on their struggle to hold onto
those things that help them feel as if they have
won at the game of life. They don’t see that the
game is fixed. They obsessively pursue winning. It
Microcosm:
a
is what makes life feel worthwhile and filled with
q
purpose. Winning is being able to hold onto those
who not only empower you, but that empowering
relationship brings advantages.

Profile
4/1: Opportunistic Investigator
They take risks based on what they need. They constantly
pursue the new risk. They are looking for thrills that let them a
q
say “I survived!” They can take big risks. They prefer to
gamble to gain great rewards. It is often a blind risk. They
don’t hesitate often. It can lead to the possibility of more
territory and security. The one-track nature allows them to
struggle and persist. They are good for others who they take
a
in. They can help you get to your meaning. Or conversely,
q
they can be very selfish in their pursuits because they don’t
want to go in the direction you want. They are fixed on their
own direction.
The more risks they take, the more alive they feel. Also, they
are very focused on their connections with a partner and how
q 28 q 33
it brings them advantages, including the security that comes
by having your own territory with them. a 27 a 19

LA C A (Q3)
ROSS OF LIGNMENT
There is a binary operating in this LAC. The fifth line
profiles are here to take advantage of the unexpected.
Their gift is knowing how to align themselves in these
new circumstances. There may not be many
opportunities for them to have these unexpected
Macrocosm: moments, but when they are there, it is great. The
sixth line Profiles are always struggling to feel and a
q
experience the deep sense of aliveness and purpose.
They can take many risks to generate this sense of
purpose in life. There can be some of the deepest
melancholy found in the individual circuitry here.
Taking risks and encountering the unexpected leads to
a
change. Sometimes this requires us to leave one thing q
Microcosm: behind to explore another. There is often an
advantage in that for these folks. The other may view
the actions you take as treacherous or too risky.

5/1: Heretic Investigator
Their goal is to align to the forces and situations that make
a
q
them feel as if they don’t have to look further to feel like they
have found their purpose. They know empowerment is great.
They like the idea of empowerment, but do they have to live
with this empowering person. Maybe there is someone or
situation that is better. It is a threat always present in their
bonds. Also, the 5/1 is here to manipulate the collective a
q
without really engaging. It ends up breaking alliances and
others don’t like it.
The 5/1 knows that trust is a transitory state, especially if your
nature is freaky. The empowerment the fifth line brings is in the
moment. Therefore, they can never be content with those who
q 28 q 33
empower them for the long run. They are always looking to see
if there is some other alliance that will serve them better.

The 28.6 is looking over the roof to the 44.1 that is coming.
a
q
The 44th Gate remembers all the death and extinction that
has happened so far on the planet. Her the 6/3 says “See I
was correct to fear death. This is proof that it is hopeless.”
What they really want to know is that life is worthwhile. The
best the 28 can ultimately know is that life is. They need the
a
57 and the 20 to help them deal with the expression of a life
q
well lived.
This Profile sees the futility of the struggle. They are either
pushing the envelope to the extreme or are resigned to the
meaninglessness of life. It all ends in death anyway. They are
slowly burning themselves out because they cannot find what
q 28 q 33
is worthwhile in life. There is a truly deep melancholy here.
Strategy and Authority can offer short periods of hopefulness.
