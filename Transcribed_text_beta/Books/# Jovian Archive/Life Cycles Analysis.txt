LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Introduction to Life Cycles Analysis
This is a transcript of the Four Part Life Cycles Certification training course that was
taught online by Ra Uru Hu in June of 2005 for Human Design analysts. This course
involved for the first time three classrooms and multi-translations.
Ra teaches in depth how to analyze Returns using the natal chart as a foundation for
providing the appropriate Rave Return, Saturn Return, Uranus Opposition Return
and/or Kiron Return Analysis, including the timing for each reading related to the
client’s Profile and age. The 6th Line Profile process is covered in depth. Also dis-
cussed is how the Nodes are key for Life Cycle analysis as well as the importance of
an Incarnation Cross reading for non-6th line Profiles.

Lecture One
Cycle Analysis: General Introduction
Introduction to the Solar Return
Welcome to the Cycles Certificate Course. Obviously, over the next four days we're
going to go rather deeply into looking at the techniques for doing cycle analysis. In
fact, something that has always been quite obvious to me is that it's not so much
whether or not doing a cycle analysis is difficult or not. I think based on simple
techniques that it's rather easy. The difficult part is really understanding the per-
son's chart, and understanding their chart in terms of the impact and the condition-
ing impacts that affect them.
One of the first things I had to deal with when I began my process as a professional
analyst was that there is a binary in front of you when you sit down beside some-
body. You can either look at their definition and tell them that they're a gift from
God—because whenever you look at anybody's definition that's precisely what you
can tell them—or you can realize the person sitting beside you is unaware, not-self,
in a lot of trouble. Otherwise, they wouldn't be there in the first place, not clear and
not comfortable with who it is they are.
The Not-Self Responds to the Conditioning
I used to make the comment that the great disease of the world is self-hatred, that
human beings are conditioned from the moment they come into the world to see that
there is something wrong with them that can be improved. So, my real concern
about doing cycle analysis is: Do you understand the not-self of the being? Because
it's the not-self that responds to the conditioning, it's the not-self that takes it over.
The real dilemma with human beings is how difficult it is for us to be able to deal
with the power of our minds, the power of self-reflected consciousness. This is
something that is really very profound. It's so dense; it makes the maya so dense.
It is so incredibly difficult for most human beings to disengage themselves from the
power of their minds to run their life. Over and over again, what we all confront on a
day-to-day basis in our lives is dealing with the fact that every single one of us has a
mind that is very busy trying to tell us what to do, what not to do, constantly, mo-
ment-by-moment, breath-by-breath interpreting in one way or another precisely
what is going on in the world around us.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Because it seems like the mind is the only thing about us that seems to be con-
cerned about us and because the mind is always engaged in trying to figure out the
―this and that‖ of our process, it seems rather logical that we turn over to mind the
responsibility to make decisions in our lives. When you look at humanity as a whole,
what you look at is the mental plane. When you're talking about the not-self, you're
just talking about the reality that human beings make decisions with their minds.
I used to make jokes about the Eastern teachers and their 'no mind' pitch and how
difficult that would be for somebody with a fixed mind. Because after all, if you have
a fixed mind, it's to like you can get rid of it. But really so much of 'no mind' has
been confused with what the real message is. That is, it is mind that creates the
maya. It is not mind that understands how we are to operate in the maya success-
fully. It cannot.
Looking at the Vulnerability of the Being
So, when we're looking at any kind of Cycle Analysis, we must have a deep sense of
the being's vulnerability. Over these four days, I will use different types each day to
illustrate the various analysis techniques. In fact, I rather enjoy this format of being
able to break it up into these four parts because, in fact, we can look at each of the
cycles for each of the types separately. I think that this will bring a value continuity
to the work we're going to do.
So, what I really want you to focus on now is the theme of vulnerability to condition-
ing. Only when you see the true vulnerability of the being and how that vulnerability
is going to impact the way in which they make decisions can you begin then to in-
terpret correctly the patterns that are established by looking at any cycle. When we
get to the actual aspects of the cycles themselves, it really isn't difficult if you just
figure out what makes this being's not-self tick.
Krishnamurti’s Natal Chart
The Single Definition Manifestor Basic Thematic
So, I began with a favorite of mine. This is Krishnamurti. He's an interesting being.
He's somebody like me who is very individual. I appreciate the fact that he is a ge-
nuine freak; it's quite obvious. I think the thing that is so fascinating for me about
him is that he came to the concept of 'no choice' mentally. I think it's an enormous
accomplishment for the human intellect to grasp the nature of helplessness and to
grasp the truth of the way in which the illusion of the maya hides us from what the
mechanism is, and within the mechanism we are choiceless. [Birth Data for this lec-
ture: May 12, 1895, 12:25 PM, Madanapalle, India]

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
But I don't want to spend a lot of time in this context doing an analysis of Krishna-
murti. Let’s just use this as a template and begin with the obvious. The obvious, by
the way, is that conditioning of the not-self will bring out the theme of anger. This is
a basic. In the sense that if we were looking at a Generator, we would say that the
theme of the not-self, the conditioning is going to bring out frustration. In other
words, we're going to deal with what is the basic thematic of the not-self and the ba-
sic thematic of an emotional Manifestor is going to be anger.
All Emotional Beings are Designed for Confrontation
The first thing to see is that the negative aspects of conditioning are always going to
bring out anger, which means they're going to bring out confrontation one way or
another. By the way, all emotional beings are designed for confrontation. Think
about that. So often, when we think about the open Centers and their not-self strat-
egy, we don't necessarily relate it to the defined Center. So in the sense of the Solar
Plexus Center, we know that the open Solar Plexus is the avoidance of confrontation
and truth, and then you know very well that the emotional system is something that
creates confrontation. The word itself isn't either a positive or a negative. It is
simply a reality. That is, the emotional system is very powerful and is very penetrat-
ing.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
We have somebody whose theme is going to be anger and it means this is really
going to be the framework upon which we can look at the way in which its not-self is
going to operate. In other words, anything that doesn't work right in the condition-
ing, the result is going to be anger. It's either going to be internalized anger and in-
ternalized anger leads to physical dilemmas, or it's going to be externalized anger.
Single Definition: The Real Focus is on the Open Centers
We have open Centers. I wanted to begin with somebody who is both powerful—
obviously this is an emotional Manifestor so there is a great power in that—and yet,
at the same time to see the deep vulnerability of this design. We're looking at six
Centers that are undefined. With
this being a single definition, and we
will look at splits tomorrow, the real
focus is on the open Centers them-
selves. You'll see as we move to the
split definitions, we are going to look
for primary conditioning in the bridg-
ing of the splits rather than primary
conditioning being through the open
Centers.
To begin with, we have somebody
who has an undefined self. So you
have somebody who is always in
their life looking for direction and
looking for love; always. Again, you
can see that if you have somebody who is always looking for direction and love, any
cycle that hooks up that identity is going to bring a confrontation, one way or anoth-
er, with direction and love. This is what would be brought to it.
Yet at the same time, the way in which this mind is going to make decisions—and of
course you have a complex mind here. You have a very powerful 43/23 configura-
tion. Yet at the same time, you have both the logic and the abstract that's feeding
into it and you have a very, very difficult 47th gate because you also have the 47.6,
which is Futility. One of the things that's interesting about Krishnamurti was that he
suffered horribly from migraines.
Not-Self Decisions: The Open G Center
Let's think about the way the not-self mind operates. The not-self mind is going to
use, as its framing to make a decision, the strategies of its open Centers. So, the
first strategy of his mind is that he makes a decision based on finding a right direc-
tion or avoiding a direction, finding love or avoiding it; one or the other. In other
words, the mind is always going to be in there no matter what the decision is, even if

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
it's the most mundane thing you can think about—where are you going to go out for
dinner?—you're still going to have this open G Center having its impact.
The Open Ego Center
When you look at this chart you see the open Ego. The majority of humanity has an
open Ego. Think about what that really means. It tells you so much about the in-
credible pressure that's in humanity to succeed in one way or another. This huge
movement of doing better, being bet-
ter and all of those things come with
the undervalued qualities of the open
Ego. The open Ego is always trying
to prove and improve.
Obviously if you have this open, then
actions, whatever actions are going
to be decided by the not-self mind
are going to be actions that hopefully
will try to ensure one's worth. In
other words, if it isn't going to bring
you improvement, if it isn't going to
show others that you're worthy, then
you simply don't do it. It's the kind
of thing where somebody who likes
publicity doesn't do anything of value privately that nobody sees, but needs to do
those things in front of people in order to get the attention and get the reaction that
they feel the activity is going to bring them.
The Open Spleen Center
This becomes all very perverse in which the mind will manipulate decision making
based on these underlying themes coming out of the open Centers. This is an unde-
fined splenic system. You have an undefined splenic system with only one gate op-
erating out of it, the 28th gate. Again, you can see that when you look at his Design
28th gate, that's his Saturn, that's Blaze of Glory. He has the self-destructive aspect
of that.
This is somebody who could be highly, highly depressed. Yet, here is somebody who
is going to hold on to things that are bad for them. Their mind is going to tell them,
explain to them—because it's a very loud 43rd gate that's going to be explaining to
them—why it's necessary to hold on to somebody because, in fact, this is probably
the direction for love and if we hold on to them we can prove that we are capable of
holding on to them, and all of the manipulations of the mind digging in and pulling
out themes from each of these open Centers.

The Open Sacral Center
You have somebody who has an undefined Sacral Center, a totally undefined Sacral
Center like myself. Of course, there is an interesting value in that. You're obviously
very interested in the mysteries of life because the Sacral Center is life and if you
don't have any aspects in it, it can be very interesting, but it does also not know
when enough is enough. So, not knowing when to let go of something that isn't bad
for you because it's not proving to show you're worthy and it hasn't led to a direction
of love, and your mind is in there saying, ―Let's hold on, let's hold on, let's hold on
because we don't know when enough is enough. We don't know how to let go.‖
The Open Root Center
Then you have this open Root Center. In the open Root Center, you have all of this
pressure. People who have an open Root are under tremendous pressure all the
time. Every time they amplify the
connection to their Root system,
that's the moment they try to unload
that pressure as quickly as possible.
In many ways, because I love to play
around with the slave terminology, if
you really want a fast, efficient slave,
then you really get to that open Root.
And you put them under pressure be-
cause when you say to them, ―Here's
the job, it has to be done in seven
days,‖ they actually want to get it
over with as fast as possible. Then
eventually you can get them to a
point where you give them things that
other people have to chew on for ages
and you just keep on loading them up and they go faster and faster and faster and
faster until they literally spontaneously combust; boom, gone, over.
Defining the Open Centers
So, here is somebody, and I'm not going to talk about the open Head because he
was obviously somebody who thought about all kinds of things that didn't matter. I
guess it gave him a headache, who knows. But the reality is when you look at the
not-self, you have to see how deeply, deeply complex it is. What happens when
these Centers get defined? What happens when somebody comes along and defines
his Spleen? What happens when the cycle of the moment—you have this connection
wherever it may be, the 57th gate, the 48th gate, the 38th gate, the 18th gate, it can
happen a lot for him, and all of a sudden the Spleen is connected. This is the hor-

The Solar Return
that Spleen and you would think now you're going to not hold on to what isn't good
for you, but that's not true.
As a matter of fact, what you're going to do is you're going to let go of what is good
for you under the illusion that you're secure. And it is about security. But anybody
who comes into the world with an undefined splenic system is somebody who is fun-
damentally afraid. Now, fear isn't necessarily a bad thing. After all, fear is the basis
of intelligence, it's the basis of making strategies, and it's what our immune system
is about, to be able to protect us and to be able to keep us alive. But if you come in-
to the world with an open splenic system, you do not have consistent security in your
immune system. In other words, you're not secure in your survivability; you're not
secure in your skin. That's not a pleasant thing, necessarily.
Of course, you have to see at a very early age, because it's one of the first lessons I
teach analysts that when you look at somebody's chart, think about them as a child,
a young child before seven. Think about them in that context and understand the
way in which they were conditioned. So they have the splenic parent who conditions
them. The fact of the matter is they will hold on to that conditioning because it gives
them a consistent sense of security. They'll even hold on to it when the relationship
is fundamentally negative. They just will.
If somebody defines this person's Sacral Center, it's not like suddenly they're going
to know enough is enough. As a matter of fact, they can end up in a situation where
they abruptly stop what, in fact, is something that they should continue with. In
other words, you get a whole mirror response with that. It's like the person with the
open Ego suddenly has her Ego defined and thinks she can conquer the world. So
you go out there and you put all that pressure on your Ego because you say, ―You
have the will to do this, to do that, to do the other thing,‖ and then of course you
have to deal with the fact that it's all going to end up collapsing.
The Key is about the Being and How They Enter into Life
When I do the daily neutrino forecast it's like a sermon. Every day I finish with the
same thing. It really is the essence of all of this. It's all about how you enter into
life. It's all about the being and how they enter into life. This is really what the key
is all about. It goes back to the individual. The fact is there is so much information
out there, it's impossible to be able to analyze all of it in a timeframe that makes it
of value. It can take me a year to analyze somebody's Rave Return. There is so
much potential information. But the fact is that having all the information or provid-
ing all the information to a client is not what it's about.
When your client comes to you for one of these readings, they're coming for a sooth-
saying session. Let's face it; this is what they want. They want some kind of predic-
tion about the future. And of course, they tend to put enormous emphasis onto
whatever you describe as the cycle's potential. Yet to be clear, the fact is that for
most of these beings they're not really going to be able to live out what is the poten-
tial of any cycle, of any moment in their life if they're not operating through their

Strategy and Authority because it is the only way that they can navigate through the
weather as themselves and, in that sense, be able to take advantage of it.
The real key is—I've been doing a lot of virtual readings lately. I find I'm entering
into a new Nodal cycle that I'm returning to my working roots. I'm obviously going
to be doing a lot of teaching this year and I've been doing a lot of readings. One of
the things I've noticed, because I've had so many years now of experience, is that in
the cycle readings I think I give them about six or seven percent on what the cycle is
about and 93 or whatever percent on them, reminding them what this is all about.
The Not-Self Never Lets Go
It's about them operating correctly as themselves. Everything about being able to
deal with a cycle—it's not hard to do the soothsaying part. I'll show you. It really
isn't. The difficult part is to get the human being to recognize that all of that would
be very interesting, but it's going to be very messy unless they're operating correctly
as themselves. It's just going to be a mess. We are enormous suckers for condi-
tioning. Please get that, how deep it is. I'm in my third seven-year cycle and I want
to tell you, the not-self never lets go. How can it?
If you look at Krishnamurti's openness, you also have to see that through those six
open Centers is the potential that he has
to be wise. There is enormous need for us The Courses
to operate correctly through our open
Centers. After all, they are receptors. It's
The Student
my old metaphor about when you're
looking at definition, you're looking at
the Student and when you're looking
at the open Centers, you're looking at
the Courses you have to take in life.
For most human beings, they never get to
a point where they master those open
Centers. Mastering them is not possible
intellectually. It is simply not possible in-
tellectually. It is only possible mechanical-
ly. This is the point.
The Solar Return is for Everyone
So, whatever you're going to do—I appreciate the fact that cycles are interesting,
some of them are very important, particularly for 6th line beings. I think that the
Rave Return, the Solar Return, is the only reading that is really of value to everyone
and is really essential for anyone entering into a deeper relationship with this know-
ledge. I think it's very important. I also think it's very important as a bedrock for
the continuity of the business of being a professional analyst. This is a very impor-

The Solar Return
tant connection with your client and it's the kind of thing where year after year you
have the power through doing their Rave Returns to reinforce the basic principles of
Human Design. It is these basic principles that are going to allow somebody to really
operate correctly as themselves.
When Living Correctly, One is Not Controlled by the Imprint
Cycle analysis is not-self analysis. Please grasp that. It's not-self analysis. What
you're really saying to somebody is, “If you’re operating correctly as yourself, I don't
know if this would impact you. But given that you don't operate correctly as your-
self, I can predict pretty much what is going to happen to you and you need to un-
derstand this, how important it is to grasp.” In other words, a cycle analysis is one
of my jokes. If I do a cycle reading for somebody and they come back and say to
me, ―Ra that was really incredible. It was so accurate.‖ In my head is boy, great
not-self, because if you're operating correctly as yourself, you are not controlled by
the imprint. You're not. It's the point.
It doesn't mean that you don't interact with the program. That's the beauty. That's
why I enjoy calling it weather forecasting because if you know that it's really going to
be cold out, well ok, dress up. And if you know it's going to rain, bring along an um-
brella. You can interact with the environment without the environment controlling
you. You can continue to do the things that you're here to do in this life without
having to take detours and get into dilemmas because this is the general imprint.
The 42-32 Nodal Configuration
I have been fascinated for a very
long time with the 32-42 Nodal con-
figuration, and we are dealing with
that now [Chart is for June 1, 2005,
11:38:11 UT]. We're in the 2nd line
themes. For example, the 2nd line of
the 42 is all about the ability to get
involved with trends and move for-
ward into the future; or miss the
boat and stand by the wayside. And
in dealing with the 42-32 Nodes,
we've been dealing in times where
there is a tremendous amount of in-
consistency and lack of continuity in
the general frequency. We went
along for about seven weeks with the
3rd line themes which are very diffi-
cult.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
It's very important to understand that even those beings who are there in Human
Design, the people who listen to Jovian Archive Radio, who've been listening to me
making these comments over and over again for months now, does not mean that
they actually can avoid the impact of it. You can't because it's in the air because
human beings are not-self. So, the impact of those Nodes as written as lines in the
book is visible in the general community and in the way in which people deal with
each other in these times. It means that somebody who is involved in Human De-
sign, the tendency is to forget that they are still vulnerable to the program at every
single level. I don't care how long you've been in Human Design, it doesn't mean
that your open Centers don't take in the general imprint, they do, and how easy it is
to get caught in that.
It's why there's only one way. You have to follow your Strategy. You have to honor
your inner Authority. There is no other way. And I see this in all kinds of people
around me who should know better and they don't. They have this sense of "I don’t
know what to do, and this doesn't look right. Should I do this thing? Is it that direc-
tion I should go? Or should I stay with this?" There is all this stuff floating around.
It's just the Nodes.
The Nodes are the Key to Cycle Analysis
By the way, as you'll see over the next four days, the Nodes are the key to cycle
analysis. If you can really grasp what the Nodes are and how they function, basically
you can provide anybody with an analysis that is going to be accurate. The Nodes
are deeply, deeply important in this context because it's the Nodes that are always
going to establish from the outside what the environment is going to be like and al-
lows you to see how anyone in any cycle is going to be impacted by the world around
them. And of course, that's what most people want to know. What's going to be
happening around me?
The Heart of Cycle Analysis: What Happens if You’re Not-Self
So, I want to get back to the very heart of what a cycle analysis is. That is, a cycle
analysis is what will happen to you absolutely if you're not-self. That's the place you
have to begin. It doesn't mean that those things you're saying, for example, some-
thing you might see that you would indicate to someone, it doesn't mean they will
not necessarily experience that. That's the beauty of being correct. It's the beauty
of being able to integrate within the general imprint with what is correct for you.
We already know at the obvious level that the position of transiting planets today
doesn't affect everyone the same way and doesn't affect everyone necessarily. In
other words, it's very, very important for us to begin to see that the analysis is an
indication of how the not-self will be conditioned. There are many aspects within
that that may, in fact, be aspects of value to somebody who’s operating correctly.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
For example, let's take the conditions we have right now with the Nodes being in the
42-32. If you do any cycle analysis for somebody, obviously they're going to show
up as the Personality and by the time you get into July, they will show up as the De-
sign for a number of months. So during the course of this year, you're going to have
this frame. After all, this is about the potential to avoid failure and to find successful
growth. This is the theme of the 32-42 as Nodes. But it also means as a binary that
you can find failure and no growth. In other words, this is the pressure that is there
in this Nodal configuration.
This pressure is something that comes around every 9.3 years. That is, a Nodal
cycle is 18.6 years, so every 9.3 years we have a shifting, a repeating of the polari-
ty. If you're going to do somebody's analysis and this is in their chart for that analy-
sis, no matter what kind of cycle it is, whether it is a Rave Return or it's their Saturn
or their Kiron, what you're going to be able to say without question is that this is a
time in which you have to be able to make very important directions in terms of
where your life is going to lead.
This is a time where either you're going to or not find the resources to find the conti-
nuity to be able to enter into what will bring growth as an experience, because this is
something you have to work with over the next 9 years because the North Node
theme is the 42 and the 42 is a gate that doesn't give up. So what you're going to
enter into now this year, it's going to be there for you for the next 9 years. Well,
whoa, you'd better enter into that correctly.
Think about all the people now who are being impacted by these Nodes. You have
people who see a new trend and think they should be a part of it and give up what,
in fact, may have been wonderful for them. Undefined Splenic Center—you define
that Splenic Center, all of a sudden it's ready to give up what's good for it. You have
to see that there are all kinds of people on this planet right now who are caught in a
bind. Do I take a risk and go forward? Or do I stay with what's reliable and trust-
worthy that stood the test of time, and do I go in that direction? In other words, do
I avoid what the 42 promises—growth, new trends, all of this process that comes
with the 42.
Today is a classic day because it is the day that the Biversity was launched. And
here we are, all of us together in this virtual environment, which by the way I really
love. So here we are in this environment. Now, there are going to be teachers in
Human Design who are going to see this as the trend of the future. This is the way
that it's going to go. This is the way because it's global knowledge. You're also
going to have those people who don't want to step on the bandwagon. You're going
to have those people who'd rather be in a room with somebody somewhere having a
physical contact with them. They don't feel comfortable with getting involved in the
technology.
Then you end up with two sets of people, who 10 years down the road, are going to
be able to look at it this way or that. One may say, ―I missed the boat. That was
really the future; I should have gone that way.‖ And the other one is saying, ―Wow,
we got out here and I really miss the contact, I really should have stayed with that.‖

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
In other words, we're dealing with these themes now in everything in our lives. The
Nodes take on this deeply, deeply powerful quality.
Focus on the Client: Reinforce the Basic Reading
What I'm trying to get at is that this is only one aspect of many, as you well know.
You look at any cycle chart and you can go nuts with all the data. Think about it.
It's so much stuff. When you get right down to it, what you really have to deal with
is the person. That's what matters; just the being. Every step you go through, any
cycle reading has to come with a caution all the time. That caution to the client of
"This is the theme that will impact on you. Now, whether it's good for you or not, I
can't tell you, because only you can make that decision." That's what's going to be
there.
You can enter into what is new. At the same time, you can ignore what is new. As
long as you're correct, as long as you're operating correctly, it does not matter. It
will be correct for you. Of course, this is the whole point. This course, there's very
little that I need to do to be able to teach you the techniques. That's not what my
concern is. My concern is truly your approach to the client in terms of how you
present a cycle analysis.
For me, any cycle analysis is an opportunity to reinforce the basic reading and to
reinforce the basic themes in Design. It's essential. The only time that can really
change, quite obviously, is when you're dealing with somebody who has really
worked at their design, who has really experimented deeply with honoring their
Strategy and then perhaps you can go to a deeper intellectual level about all the
nuances that they can check off in their notebooks as they come by.
But for the vast majority of clients who are coming to you, when you say to them,
―You're going to have this and that,‖ there is a part of them inside saying, ‖Oh good,
that's terrific, that's exactly what I need.‖ Well, how do they know that? The pro-
gram provides everything. It's all there. Every day there's all kinds of stuff. But if
you're operating correctly, it does not control your life. It doesn't.
Today I was doing a piece on Bird Flu, Avian Flu. You take a look at that chart for
July 7th of this year and it's absolutely horrifying. It's horrifying because the vast
majority of the planet is not-self and that's the way they're going to function. So,
when you're doing a cycle analysis, the first thing you have to see, the one that's the
most important for them to have, particularly from the beginning of their design
work is an annual reading. Again, this is a way to realign them to what the priorities
are. And at the same time to give them a basic preparation of what the imprint is
going to bring.
After all, what we talk about is trends. We're talking about trends that are imper-
sonal. Think about that. We're just talking about the weather. The fact that you
can draw the weather on a map and compare that map to their map, we're still talk-
ing about a large weather pattern. The way that being is going to operate within
Life Cycles Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
that pattern is totally determined by whether they operate correctly or not. There is
no middle ground in that. And as I said, the more accurate you are in terms of the
client, it can just be your private black joke because the greater the compliments
you get, the fact is the deeper these beings are in the not-self.
Using the Cycle as a Signpost to One's Development
The beauty is to be able to change what they think they're coming to get from you.
This is what I particularly want to get across today. In other words, what you have
to bring them to is what we have been discussing here. For them to really under-
stand that we can see the program and the way in which it's going to impact every-
one. But if you want to be homogenized in that, then our job is very simple. All we
have to do is just give you a few keys and you're off because you're going to get all
that.
But if you really want to use the cycle as a signpost to your development as a being,
then to be able to understand that in operating correctly as yourself, not only are
you going to be able to discern and select what imprinting is of value to you, but
you're also going to see the blind obedience of those around you to the program it-
self. In other words, if you're really operating correctly, the reading you give some-
one is what they see in the people around them. After all, everybody is taking in this
program, everybody is taking in these imprinting frequencies and the key is they are
not all for us. We don't need that bucket of pain poured over us. We're only going
to take little dibs and dabs of it from here and there.
Seeing in the General Program What is Correct for You
So, the first thing is to recognize that the first job is to reinforce in them the service
you're providing. The service you're providing is if you operate correctly as yourself,
here is the opportunity field that you're going to deal with. Here's your smorgas-
bord. Here is this complete layout. Here is the table full of pastries. Now, don't be
a pig, because if you're a pig you're not-self. If you eat all those pastries, you're re-
ally going to have trouble. But there is one for you. There may be two for you. If
you're operating correctly, you're going to see what, in the general program, is really
there for you.
By the way, the chart that's just been put up, all of you received from me the Krish-
namurti Solar Return. If you do have the cycle program in you MMI, if you open up
that chart and you go to edit, what I did was because he died in 1986, I didn't think
it was fun to do a Rave Return for 2005. So, the chart that's actually up there is the
Solar Return from 1985, the last Solar Return before he died. And I thought that
would be much more interesting to look at.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
The Rave Return is the Most Complex
The most complex cycle reading of all, and if I could put them on a scale of complex-
ity being from 1 to 10 and the most complex is a 10, then the Rave Return is a 10
and the Saturn and Uranus and the Kiron are a 2. So, really understand that when
you're looking at the Rave Return, this is where you need to have the most skills be-
cause this is where you really get to use the various keys that I've given you and to
be able to use them effectively.
When you're looking at Saturn, Uranus or Kiron, as you will see, it is Profile and
Nodes that tell the whole story. And anything else is pretty much incidental. Be-
cause of the length of the cycles and because of the fact that when you're looking at
long-term patterns, it is the Nodes that are going to be the most accurate for you.
It's obvious when you're looking at a Solar Return, the one thing that you're dealing
with and is so important is that you're not dealing with a change in the Profile, ob-
viously. But this says something very important about the nature of the Rave Re-
turn: The Rave Return is always about characteristics. In other words, it's not about
purpose and it's not about being awake; it's about the challenge to finding purpose
and being awake. It's all in the characteristics.
So, when you're dealing with a Rave Return, not only are you dealing with the com-
plexity in the way the reading has to operate, because obviously the Rave Return in-
itiates at an 88° apart program, but you're also dealing with the most complexity in
terms of having to look at just about everything that's changed in the chart, because
this is where you get so much information. It's the kind of information that is really
of no value when you're looking at long-term transits, but the kind of information in
terms of a Rave Return that is deeply significant. So, to begin with, the Rave Return
is something in which you really have to be able to have all of the tools in order to
be able to do a really good job.
The Saturn, Uranus and Kiron Returns are about Purpose
Obviously, when you're dealing with long-term cycles that are going to take 20 or 30
years, the nature of the information you give has to be very general. You're dealing
with large themes over large periods of time in a mutated world. That's another sto-
ry. Ultimately, you will see with Saturn, Uranus, and Kiron basically what you're
looking at is not characteristics but purpose.
These are cycles in which the larger question of purpose and the larger question of
the movement towards the fulfillment of purpose are where the guidelines can be
found. But in dealing with a Rave Return, you're dealing with the nitty gritty of deal-
ing with the pressure on the not-self on a day-to-day basis that distorts the life and
takes you away from what is correct for you.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
Krishnamurti’s 1985 Solar Return Chart
When I began, I began with simply the openness. That is, the open Centers that he
has and the fact that given those open Centers, these are going to be the areas
where you're going to see the strongest impact on the conditioning. If you look at
the configuration for the return, what you're seeing is that the Sacral Center and the
Root Center are defined, and that the G Center is defined. So you have this whole
movement directly down the center. As a matter of fact, you can see that very
clearly.
This is the 1985 return which was May 12, 1985. He would die in February of 1986.
So, this was his last return. It's very interesting that when we talk about the death
process, one of the things that we talk about is how the Design Crystal, when it re-
connects with the Magnetic Monopole at the moment of biological death, it moves
down from the 2 through the 14, through that channel, and through the channel of
the 3/60 and then ultimately out.
[Note: For Krishnamurti’s 1985 Solar Return chart, the newest MMI software produces
his return with different lunar lines. This chart reflects the one used for this training.]

Defined G Center: Pressure on Themes of Direction and Love
One of the things very clearly about the obviousness of this configuration is that
there is this mutative direction that is being brought. But rather than getting into
any kind of deep thing, I want to deal with the obvious first. We saw to begin with
that this is somebody with an undefined G Center and the G Center is going to be
very strongly defined.
You see that there are three different definitions to the G Center, then you know that
there is going to be enormous pressure on the theme of the G Center—direction and
love. In other words, direction and love are going to be one of the prominent
themes of that year. That's just a general theme. We'll be able to see that we can
look at the nuances of that, but it's a general theme that is the obvious.
The Defined Sacral Center and Root Center
When you look at the defined Sacral Center, one of the things about people who
have open Sacral Centers is, as I described to you, because the not-self strategy is
not knowing when enough is enough, the strategy through the defining of the Sacral
Center is thinking one knows when enough is enough, if I can put it that way. In
other words, this can lead to the premature and abrupt end of things, including a
life, by the way. After all, this is somebody with a totally undefined Sacral and you
can see that the Sacral is under enormous mutative pressure. The other thing is
that you have the defining of the Root Center. With the Root Center there is this
enormous pressure to get things over with.
Themes of the Rave Return
So, we have three themes here.
The Root says that this is
somebody who is going to be
placed under a lot of pressure
in this year. And they're going
to be placed under a lot of mut-
ative pressure this year. And
they will be. That's just simply
the fact. You can see that in
the Sacral Center they will
overreact to enough is enough.
In other words, they will be
more likely to stop things than
to start anything. We know
that they're going to have this
theme of love and direction.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
So at a very general level, these are the three areas where this being is going to go
to school in 1985. This is where all of the courses are going to be. But the other
thing is when you're looking at a Rave Return, look and see what is left open. He is
going to continue to hold on to things that are bad for him. He's still going to be un-
der not-self pressure to prove himself.
And he's still going to be thinking about things that don't matter. In other words,
those things are still going to be basic vulnerabilities in the way his not-self makes
decisions and deals with the world. Remember, you're dealing with somebody with
mental definition. It's exceedingly difficult to get somebody with mental definition to
give up on their mind running their life. It's tough, because it's a fixed consistent
mind. It seems like it can get a handle on all of these things. It seems like that.
So, the first thing we're going to look at is that you start with the basics. In other
words, what has replaced the openness? What are the major themes going to be?
We see that we're going to have three major themes that are going to operate and
we're going to take a look at those major themes.
The Weather Impact Illustration
The next two illustrations contain the essential keys. They're very basic. If you're
looking at the Rave
Return, right here is
The Human Design System where you begin.
WEATHER IMPACT What I mean by that
IHDS Cycles Analysis
is that you can begin
to discern what's real-
ly going to impact
your client and what
EDUCATIONAL isn't. Obviously, this
is just simple configu-

rations. In other
words, if the program
gives you a hanging
PERSONAL gate somewhere—you
can see the example
ELECTROMA GNETIC/COMPROMISE
here where the 7th
gate is colored in—this
is called 'Environ-
mental.' It's just a
ENVIRONMENTAL
gate activation. It

doesn't bring about
definition. It's just
something that is add-
ed.

Environmental: Gate Activation
Now, Environmental is something to pay attention to only in the sense of when
you're using the Nodes properly, and again you will see that the Nodes consistently
are one of the most essential guides you can have in doing cycle analysis, is that
these Environmental gates have a lot to do with conditioning or adding conditioning
to the environment that the Nodes establish. But it's still Environmental.
In other words, it's the background. And the background—if you took the example
of just that 7th gate, you would see there is a lot of role playing that is going to be
around in the environment. Interactive, logical role playing is going to be in the air.
But it's not Personal. So it isn't going to impact one in the way in which your client
is interested. I never talk about Environmental gates. One day, I guess I'll do a
deep intellectual course about the minutiae of cycles, but the fact is that my primary
concern with the client is that I reinforce their design and their Strategy and their in-
ner Authority. What I want to give them are those things I recognize are truly going
to have a deep impact.
Personal: Electromagnetic or a Compromise
The second thing is either an Electromagnetic or a Compromise. So you have a gate
and the program brings you the harmonic gate or you have a gate and the program
brings the whole channel. In weather impact, this does not make a difference,
whether it's Electromagnetic or Compromise. Truly, it does not make a difference.
And this is called 'Personal.'
Personal is very important because it is the thing that most people are interested in.
Basically what it tells you is the kind of people who are there in your future. In other
words, it tells you what you're going to have to interact with and it tells you what the
theme of that interaction with the other is going to be. So, the Personal, whether
Electromagnetic or Compromise, is something that is going to be very important to
the client.
Educational: Dominance
Finally, is the Dominance. Of course, the Dominance is simply that the program is
bringing a defined channel that you don't have and you can see that this is
'Educational.' Think about the joke. If you're operating as not-self, that education is
also deep conditioning. If you're operating correctly as yourself, it can be an ex-
traordinary learning opportunity, because truly you can recognize an aspect of being
something in the other, something in the program you don't have yourself and how
much that can teach you about what that thing is. Not what that thing does to you,
but what that thing actually is.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
So we have three basic keynotes: Environmental, Personal and Educational. Gate
activation—Environmental, background frequency; Electromagnetic or Compromise—
Personal and it matters most to the client; Educational—probably the most interest-
ing. I always like when there is Dominance. I find Dominance to be one of the ea-
siest ways to learn because
then you don't bring in any The Human Design System
preconditions. The moment WEATHER IMPACT
IHDS Cycles Analysis
you bring preconditions, it's
Personal. You can see that in
the way the Personal works.
But the moment there are no
EDUCATIONAL
preconditions, you can really
learn something. So if you're DOMINANCE
operating correctly as your-
self, those Educational Do-
PERSONAL
minances can be some of the
ELECTROMAGNETIC/COMPROMISE
deepest learning experiences.
By the way, you have differ-
ent levels of clients, obvious- ENVIRONMENTAL
ly. You'll have clients who GATE ACTIVATION
are real novices who really
don't know what they're
coming for, and you will have
those who are relatively experienced. I think the more experienced the client is, the
more your accent is looking for the Educational if the Educational exists because it
can be very important for them in their growth process. But for most clients in
terms of impact, the thing that is going to both be easiest for them to recognize
when it happens and thus reinforce their respect for what it is that you do, but also
the fact that these are the things most people want to have some preparation about
is knowing what's going to impact them personally.
Deepest Conditioning is in the Personal
You can see that the Personal impact is something that is very distorting. This is
where the deepest conditioning takes place. Those of you who have been involved
with my various partnership courses, we know that these two themes—
Electromagnetic, which is the basic dynamic of a relationship, and Compromise
where the problems of a relationship always arise—this stuff is deeply Personal and
people want to know when it's going to be around. That's the kind of preparation
that they are really going to appreciate.
Again, the moment you can illustrate the Personal impact to them, and at the same
time the responsibility to reinforce in them this fundamental understanding that they
have to operate correctly as themselves, the Personal can be of enormous value. It
doesn't mean that it's going to be a negative. What it does mean is that you will be

overwhelmed by the conditioning if you're operating correctly because the condition-
ing is so powerful.
The Weather Conditioning Themes: General Themes
When you go the weather conditioning themes, we have the other set of three key-
notes. These are generics. It is very possible given certain situations that the inner
planets are going to have a Developmental impact. There are often occasions where
the outer planets can actually represent beings but it's rare; it's possible, but it's
rare. These are general themes.

Nodes of the Moon: Direction
The first thing to see very clearly is to go to the middle, go to the Nodes of the
Moon. Now, it says here 'Direction.' What I really want you to understand is that it's
not so much direction in the sense of this is where you go, but this is what it's going
to look like as you're going along that way. That's why the Nodes are so important.
Let me digress for a moment. I think if you look at the way in which the database of
any calculation is worked out and you look at all the planetary objects and the Moon
and the Sun, it's very easy for us to forget that within that context the Nodes just
don't fit in. They're unlike anything else in the way we calculate our basic design.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
What we're dealing with with everything other than the Sun is the filtering of the
neutrino stream. We're dealing with objects that get in the way of the neutrino
stream and thus transform its information.
The great discovery in 1996 of the validity that neutrinos have mass—the way in
which they discovered that was they were able to see the oscillation of neutrinos as
they moved through the Earth. In other words, there was an interaction that takes
place. So when you're looking at all of the planets and the Moon, what you're look-
ing at are objects that filter the neutrino ocean.
It's very interesting to me that the "ancients" loved to say that all of the planets
were evil because they got in the way of the light, that they were all there to distort
the perfection of the information that we could all receive. In some sense, I sup-
pose, there is a truth in that. However, what makes the Nodes so special is that
they are positions. If you go back into ancient Hindu Brahman astrology, you will
see how important, even then in the deep awareness of their own revelation in their
own time, how significant the Nodes were. As a matter of fact, they had names.
They were really something very significant.
For me it's clear that, because they are positions, what we get through the Nodal
portals is a direct communication from the star field beyond wherever the Nodes
happens to be. In other words, this is trans-solar system or trans-cellular informa-
tion. So what you're looking at is the Nodes are bringing us the themes of the envi-
ronment from outside the box.
In other words, this is the environment that everything else has to play in. Whether
it's Mercury or Uranus, they're going to play in the environment of the Nodal neigh-
borhood. So, the Nodal themes, and your ability to read the gates and lines of the
Nodes is the deepest gift you can bring to cycle analysis, because it will tell you eve-
rything you need to know about the thematic in front of these beings.
The Inner Planets: People
If you go to the inner planets, this only relates to the Rave Return. In other words,
the keys that you're looking at here, if you're looking at a Saturn Return or you're
looking at a Uranus or a Kiron, everything except the Nodes is Development. All of it
could be People over time, but different People. It's very different. That's why I say
that doing a Solar Return is much complex than doing any of the longer cycle re-
turns. In doing the Solar Return, the inner planets are very significant. They really
bring People.
One of the most exciting things about doing a Solar is to be able to see, for example,
let's take a look at these four planets that are keynoted as People. For example,
those People could be Educational. In other words, the combination of that planet in
a Dominance, these People can be Educational, these People can be very Personal,

and that's what your clients are really interested in. Who are these People that are
going to be very Personal?
Again, remember the joke. It doesn't necessarily mean that. It depends. If you're
operating correctly and you're intended to have a very personal relationship, encoun-
ter, whatever it may be with one of those People then it will happen. But for the
not-self it's guaranteed. It's just that the outcome isn't necessarily going to be posi-
tive.
Obviously, your ability to be able to understand the nuances in terms of the differ-
ence between what it means to meet a Lunar person as compared to what it means
to meet a Mercurial one, at the very simplest level, if the Moon is a person that is
Educational for you, they can end up being a very deep driving force, driving you to
learn something, pushing you to learn
something, the drive that's inherent in
WEATHER
the Moon.

However, if you have Mercury that's
Personal, it just may end up being a lot THEMES

new in your life and you're sharing all of
this information. The Venusian envi- INNER PLANETS

course, there are Mars People with an
abundance of not necessarily well- OUTER PLANETS
coordinated energy, and whether that's DEVELOPMENT
Educational, Personal, or Environmental, c r f v t
it doesn't take a rocket scientist to begin
to intuit what Martian energy can bring
to that.
In other words, you get to a point where it's very simple to mix and match. You
have this combination of what is being conditioned, how it is it being conditioned—is
it Educational, Personal, or Environmental—who or what is conditioning it. Is it
People, is it the Direction, is it Development? And then you can begin very clearly to
be able to lay out the analysis. Now, I will over these days work with you in the ac-
tual analysis technique, but more important for me today is just to establish for you
the simple usage of these keys, just to be able to use these keys simply.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
Two Dominances: The 2/14 and the 3/60
Let's take a look at the very first thing, the fact that we have two Dominances.
They're very significant. We have the 2/14 which is the Dominance coming from the
Personality North Node of the Solar Return in the 2.6. The 14 is Saturn both con-
scious and unconscious, the Design Saturn in 14.4 and the Personality Saturn in
14.1. Here is somebody who doesn't have any of that. As a matter of fact, here's
somebody who had an undefined G Center, has a totally undefined Sacral Center and
there is the 2/14; there is the Dominance.
Dominance
Educational
Dominance
Developmental
Dominances
Now, we know right away that when we look to Dominance we can see the Domin-
ance is Educational. In other words, we know that the 2/14, which is the Keeper of
Keys, which is The Beat, which is the power skills to move towards your vision, that
this is going to be an Educational factor. He's going to learn something about this
movement, this direction in life. How is that going to come to him? We've already
seen that the 2 is the North Node. Right away we enter into the realm of direction.
This is really going to be the environment or an aspect of the environment. In other
words, this is somebody who is going to meet the potential of a direction in this life.
The other side of that if you go to the 14, you see that's Saturn; we know that the
Saturn is Developmental. So, the 14 aspect is Developmental. The 2 aspect in that

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

context is all about the direction and the whole thing is Educational. Now, it's not
Personal.
If you want to get Personal, what is going to feel more is the presence of the 5 be-
cause the moment you move into the 5/15, you move away from Educational and
you move into the Personal. This is an Electromagnetic. When you look for the 5th
gate, you see it is Uranus and again this is Personal but it's Developmental. So
we're going to see
when we do the analy-
sis what it is precisely
that the 5 is going to
bring. If you go to
Uranus in the 5.6 it's
about Yielding: Waiting
is never free from pres-
sure, physical or mental
and is often punctuated
by the unexpected.
Unfortunately, knowing
that he is going to die, I
think all of you can see
if you look at the Per-
Electromagnetic
sonality Moon in the
Solar Return, you'll see Personal / Developmental
that he has the 30th
gate 4th line which is the fates coming in with Burnout, burnout in his emotional sys-
tem. There are so many things that there is a tendency to interpret. After all, there
were other people who had a return on that same day who were not going to perish
and that burnout for them was going to represent a year where they simply had their
nose to the grindstone.
However, we know that the unexpected can be part of this year's Development.
We're able to see that Developmental aspect the way it's in the 14th gate. The 14.1
is Money isn't Everything: The recognition that wealth has its problems. And the
14.4 is about Security: Protection from assault. So, here is somebody who is going
to deal with these Sacral Developmental forces, but the only one that's going to be
Personal is the 5, the way in which that's going impact on his identity. In other
words, his not-self is going to assume a flow and a pattern based on that 5.6. And
it's going to do so unless he's operating correctly as himself.
The 3/60
The other Dominance we have is the 3 and the 60. We're dealing with Educational
and we have Mercury in the 3rd gate, the Personality of the Return. And we're look-
ing at Jupiter that's going to be in the 60th gate in the 6th line. The detriment is
brought out by Mercury. So, again, you have Uranian Development within the con-

text of Limitation. Then you have this Mercury that is going to bring a person into
your life.
In other words, there is a
person who is going to bring
confusion that is going to lead
to a not-self response of be-
ing dogmatic, principled and
carefully reasoned, and all the
stuff that goes with the de- People
triment. I'm briefly just
touching on themes. I'm not
trying to give you a reading. Development
What I'm trying to show you
is that if you take the planet
and the gate and the line and
the weather impact and then
you take the keynote for what Dominance
Educational
the configuration is in terms
of whether it is People, Direction or Development, you have the language you need.
You have the language you need to be able to describe the various patterns that are
going to be there.
Begin with the Nodes
Now, where you need to begin is with the Nodes, as always, because they're going to
set the whole condition. The other thing is here's somebody who is a 43/23. And
you have the Solar Return's Design Nodes in the 43/23, with the South Node in the
43, the North Node in the 23.
And they're in the 5th lines. At
the Personality level they're in
the 6th lines, the 2 and the 1.
Direction
When I'm looking at the
Nodes, the first thing I look
for is the thematic of the line.
In other words, an environ-
ment where being an example
is being demanded. This is
what the Personality is going
to be confronted with. The
moment you see that you
have 6th lines in your Nodes,
what that's telling you is that
you're going to have in the environment around a demand for you to be an example.
You're just going to. And you're going to be pressured into being that example.
Remember, everything about the 6th line is its potential to be trusted, its potential to

25
LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
be a leader. But all of that is determined by whether it's going to operate correctly;
in other words, whether it's going to be a proper example.
The South Node
Let's take a look at the South Node, the 1st gate. It's about Objectivity. And objec-
tivity is one of the themes of the 6. In other words, this is the ability to be able to
remove oneself from the pain of subjectivity and enter into the potential of objectivi-
ty; the potential from moving from pessimism to optimism. There is also a 2.6 and
the 2.6 is Fixation: Unable or unwilling to see the whole picture. Now, of course,
that fixation matches rather nicely with the 60th gate and its fixed Rigidity. In other
words, this is something in
which this is a very, very
tight narrow direction that is
being conditioned.
Think about it this way.
Nothing says he had to die.
Nothing says that this Solar
Return means he's going to
die. And yet, at the same
time, it can very easily mean
he's going to die. There are
certain configurations we
have—I've seen them in my
own designs over the years—
that show up. If you go the
not-self route, you can be pretty certain that it's going to lead you not necessarily to
death, but it's going to lead to you in many ways the kinds of circumstances and
events that you would really do anything to avoid.
At the deepest level—I don't think that Krishnamurti was awake; I think he was very
bright. I think that most of the representatives of knowledge that have preceded
Human Design lacked the potential to actually operate correctly as themselves. The
fact that he had the intellectual capacity to be able to discern what I think is remark-
able, that is, the choicelessness of being doesn't mean he was a master of his not-
self. I've read his diaries; I know he wasn't. If you read his diaries, despite the bril-
liance of this mind, you'll see a mind obsessed with dealing with his openness and
dealing with the not-self strategies that determined his nature.
The Pressure through His G Center Down to the Root Center
Now you can see that the pressure through this G Center down the center to the
Root Center, this mutation of direction can be many things. That's my point. My
point isn't that you say, aha, this could lead to death. In other words, yes, well, you

The Solar Return
don't have to go that way. You can learn about it. You can be educated by it. After
all, the beauty of what Dominance brings is that you can learn something about how
rigidity can survive confusion. You can learn about how you move in that direction of
the 2 in the 6th line. But it doesn't mean you do it. It doesn't mean you surrender to
it, after all.
That is only something that is there that you could, might enter into if it's correct for
you. And as long as you're maintaining your Authority and operating correctly, it
doesn't mean anything, any of them. That's the point. It does not mean that he
could not have been aware, conscious. He was coming to the end; accept the nar-
rowness of rigidity of its finality to do so with a deep emotional clarity and to enter
into it that way that would be fine and beautiful. It's very nice the way it jumps up
into awakening. It's great.
Transits are Options
However, I see over and over and over again when I look at configurations that you
can, for the not-self, read always the negative for everything. But that's not the
point. The point is that these are options. You do not have to buy them. That's the
wonderful thing. You don't have to buy into it. You don't. You don't have to buy in-
to any of it. You don't have to buy into any transit at all. You can go through every
single day ignoring the whole damn thing, just operating as you.
It's easier if you're an energy type, there's no question about that. But the fact of
the matter is in dealing with the transiting field in this kind of configuration, it's real-
ly easy for me to look at this and say that this was a Rave Return that really called
him. After all, he was 90 years old for this Solar. So, I guess it was time. I don't
imagine that he didn't realize that. After all, he had gone through three Saturn Re-
turns, which is a remarkable thing.
But anyway, my point in all of this is you can point to all of those things and you can
talk about the general pattern that's there. So let's not say it's Krishnamurti. Let's
say that it's Joe Blow, whoever it is. The fact is that you can say, “You're going to be
under a lot of pressure because there is going to be a lot of confusing energy around
and have to be very, very careful in that pressure to be really rigid. Don't get caught
in it.”
“The only way you're going to be able to handle that is not by thinking that this is
what you have to do, but simply being able to operate as yourself emotionally. You
have a great gift as a defined emotional being to be able to operate through clarity.
But you are going to be constrained; you are going to have to deal with constraint.”
“The other thing is that you're being pushed in a direction. You're being pushed to
take a direction and you're being pushed into a different kind of rhythm this year.
Now, that's the pushing that's out there. Remember, you don't have to go along
with it. Maybe that direction you're being educated to really isn't for you. Just be-

cause it's there, just because it hooks into you doesn't mean you have to go along
for the ride. It doesn't.”
When you begin to bring that perspective to your reading—here's a pattern but this
isn't you—this is the most important thing. It's amazing to me that there are people
who sit down beside you and they see the composite chart with the Solar and they
assume that's them. They assume that's what they've become. This is the not-self
in all of its glory: ―Oh, good, I'm going to be conditioned this way permanently for
this year; how terrific.‖
They have to see it in the context that these are options. You can enter into some of
it. You can ignore some of it. You can take it all. You can ignore it all. But the cri-
teria is you operating correctly. We have to make sure they understand that we're
giving them a generic pattern. And within that generic pattern is this opportunity for
them in operating correctly to take what is right for them.
Resistance Grows
I've talked for years about the problem of resistance. One of the ways in which re-
sistance builds up so powerfully is when one enters into things that aren't correct.
Of course, the resistance just grows. It gets worse and worse and worse. So the
whole thing about any kind of cycle analysis is it must begin with: “Please under-
stand that these are the patterns that are going to be there. Now, you're not really
going to know which those of those patterns are really for you until you get there
and then you'll see. And they're either going to overwhelm you and then you're
going to be able to say, gee, you really saw that thing coming. Or you're going to be
able to integrate with it.”
I loved all the retros who wanted to go back and reconnect to nature, people who
have a shaman trip, all this kind of stuff. And at the same time they don't under-
stand that the greatest living magic is our ability to operate in the environment and
to operate perfectly within ourselves as ourselves as the only judge. We're the ones
who decide. And that selection process, based on our inner Authority, allows us to
be properly fed.
For me, it's almost like the neutrino ocean is a kind of umbilical. It's a feeding
ocean. It's full of information. It is the consciousness field. And this tapping into
the consciousness field, each of us are intended by our very nature and our design,
by the imprinting we have, by our genetic determination to be ―this or that,‖ we're
here to be enriched by certain information, certain consciousness feeds. Every single
day as I go through the program, it's so obvious to me that most of the things that
are there in the daily program have no impact on me. Then I notice the little things
that do. And those things are really interesting and I learn something.
But, the vast majority of it I just see in the world around me. I see it in the world
around me because I've had a long, long, long ride of dumping my mind as my inner

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
Authority. It's very easy for me to see that there is actually very little for me to tap
into. But what is there for me to tap into is so important.
The other side is the temptation it always brings in the black magician in me. It's so
clear that everybody is locked into the program. And of course, there are advantag-
es. There are often things that I do in terms of my business life, timings of things,
when to introduce things that take advantage of the not-self and take advantage of
prevailing conditioning. After all, it's one of the things about understanding the way
it works and being disconnected from it as a direct conditioning field.
Some Conditioning is Interesting
You have to help your clients understand that when they come for this kind of a
reading, what you're really doing is putting them under even more pressure; isn't
that nice? You put them under more pressure. You put them under pressure be-
cause what you're really saying to them is: “Excuse me, this is life. And here is
what's going to be out there. Now, you have to realize that not all of that is for you.
If all of that is for you, you're going to be a mess. That's a lot of stuff to deal with
from every angle. You have this person doing this and this Development here and
this direction over there and this thing and that thing and the next.”
Really what you're saying is: “All of that stuff is going to be there; think about it.
Some of it might be really interesting. It might. Now, you're not going to be able to
avoid all of that being around you. You're not going to be able to avoid those people
coming into your life; but, whether or not you have anything to do with them, that's
something else. That has to do with you and just you operating correctly.”
Life is about Geometry and Movement
The other thing is life is about geometry. It's all about movement. And one of the
most profound things to think about is that if you're operating correctly as yourself,
you're moving in precisely the right direction which means you're going to meet the
fractals that are there for you and those beings who are there to meet you can find
you. But if you're not operating correctly, then your geometry isn't correct and then
you end up in situations in which there are no allies and you're connecting with the
wrong forces.
Everything about any kind of relationship we have with the larger imprint field—
remember something, the primary responsibility of the program is the imprinting of
new life. It's my joke that when I was born everybody on the planet greeted me be-
cause they had to live my design for however long it existed in the moving of all
things. Each and every one of you, as you came into the world, we all experienced
you. The baby that's being born now, we experience that as the daily transit.

The primary function of the program is pumping this world full of its genetic diversi-
ty. Its secondary impact is the fact that all of that stuff that is incarnating we
process at a secondary level. In this processing of it at a secondary level, you have
to see that you don't want to be the baby that's being born now, you're not a damn
clone. You're here to just take advantage of what aspects are there for you.
So, I think you need to reevaluate your philosophical approach to doing this kind of a
reading. And take the pressure off yourself of being a soothsayer. What you're
going to lay out are the generic patterns that are there and you're going to offer the
advice of what the option is. The option is, operate correctly as yourself; otherwise,
you're going to be stuck with trying to deal with all of it.
Q & A
Do We Pay Attention to the Sun/Earth in a Solar Return?
I was asked a question and I think it's worth repeating to all of you: Does that mean
within the context of the Solar Return that the Sun/Earth is not something we pay
attention to?
Well, in fact, that's true. But that doesn't mean that it's not there. Obviously, that
is the Cross that is the nature of the Profile and the way in which this being, in the
larger sense, is going to operate. But remember as I stated in the beginning, every-
thing about the Rave Return is about characteristics. In other words, it's not about
purpose because you can't even get to there until you deal with the characteristics
and understanding that the chart we're looking at now, that's the bucket of paint
splashed all over. The moment you think all of that is going to happen to that per-
son, that's the moment you're giving up on that person every being awake and oper-
ating correctly as themselves. So that really is the key.
Obviously, the Solar really says quite clearly that because the Profile and the Cross
never change, that over and over and over again the real challenge in this life, year
in and year, out is to deal with one's characteristics. By the way, tomorrow we will
do the reading technique and I will use a Generator as an example. I won't get to
the long-term returns until the last two lessons.
The Nodes Bring Osmosis
Question: Let me start, please. With my nonexistent background of astrology, the
Nodes have been an absolute puzzle to me. What I still cannot understand techni-
cally, you said the Nodes present the portal for the outer neutrinos. What is the dif-
ference between the stream of neutrinos going through this Node point and going a
couple of million kilometers next to it? Where does the quality come from?

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
Ra: Ok, basically what's interesting about it is perhaps the most interesting thing to
see in the Nodes is that they bring osmosis. If you have two cells and they're next
to each other, the cells are deeply involved inside in their own process. And yet,
through the process of osmosis, those cells can be informed by the larger body,
whether through hormones, or whatever the case may be.
So, one of the things that makes us interesting as beings, because Nodes are part of
our imprinting, is that the Nodes simply represent information that is not interfered
with. After all, that's what they represent. If you're looking at Mercury, as an ex-
ample, Mercury is filtering the stream that's coming from the Sun. Now, 70% of our
neutrinos come from the Sun. So, when we get what we call Mercury, what we're
actually getting is Mercury changing in some way the sunlight, changing the way in
which the neutrino information from source eventually gets to us, because something
got in the way.
Now, the thing about the Nodes, other than in those configurations where you have a
conjunction of a planet with the Nodes, if your Nodes have no conjunction to them,
what your Nodes represent is this information that comes in from outside the solar
system that's not conditioned by the rules of the solar system. In other words, the
moment that the neutrinos are going through any of the planets, the planets are all
part of one solar cell. This is all internal business.
In many ways, the only way we get to communicate in from a larger perspective is
through the Nodal portal because it brings us information that's not conditioned by
what is our little provincial concerns in this particular domain. It's why the Nodes
are actually so important because they represent a continuity of information that is
the larger information of the larger purpose of the whole. And it's really our only
contact with the larger whole, at least the limitation of that larger whole, whatever
that star field in whatever area your open Node happens to be is taking in.
What is significant in terms of the analysis, what that brings to analysis, is that it
gives you the framework that the solar cell doesn't recognize. In other words, the
Nodes give you the environment that the characteristics operate in. So, when you're
looking at the Nodes, you're looking at this larger information field that is not con-
nected to the local solar system thing, but connects our solar system to the rest of
our galaxy, to the rest of our universe. So when you look at the Nodes within the
design, what you're seeing is a continuity that began before your life and continues
after your life because in many ways it is the environmental fractal of your being.
Question: Ok, but wouldn't every single empty gate be such a gateway? Do you
see what I mean?
Ra: Oh, yes, I do see what you mean. But remember, we are programmed specifi-
cally by these objects and these positions. For example, let's take the neutrino
ocean. We know that there are three trillion neutrinos that penetrate every square
inch everywhere all over the surface of the planet all of the time which means that
our bodies are penetrated by zillions and zillions of neutrinos, and yet all of those zil-
lions of neutrinos penetrating through our body all do not program us.

We are programmed through our consciousness crystals and our consciousness crys-
tals take in one neutrino at a time. So our crystals in the way in which we are im-
printed is based on this specific configuration. So yes, there is neutrino information
that comes from everywhere but it doesn't program us. But the neutrinos that go
through the gate, they program us.
Question: Okay, thank you.
Ra: My pleasure, Ilse, I always like your questions. They're always good ones.
The Correct Time to Give a Solar Return Reading
Question: Is there a correct time for giving a Solar Return to a client? I'm assum-
ing it's around their birthday, but that might be wrong.
Ra: Oh, yes there's very much a correct time and it really is not their birthday. This
is something we will do tomorrow because we will look at the analytical process. The
best time to do somebody's return is before they have the Design date, in other
words, 88° of the Sun before their birthday.
The thing that's so interesting and so complex about the Rave Return is that basical-
ly you get to see that there are two returns and that they're really never, truly in
sync with each other. This is the great dilemma of the relationship of the Design
with the Personality. The ultimate challenge of being awake is to deal with the fact
that Personality and Design are enormously different and live uncomfortably being
held together by the magnetism of the Monopole in what becomes the quantum field,
the person that is larger than the sum of their parts.
So, when we're looking at a return you have to begin with the unconscious. That is,
my birthday is the 9th of April, but the 11th of January is when I have my Design. So
when I do my return, I always do my return at the beginning of January so I can see
first what the unconscious themes are going to be, and very important. The first
three months before the birthday, this is where most human beings really mess up
every year. And it's because there is a changing of the themes and it's changing at
the unconscious level.
You'll see tomorrow to really begin with the Design birth date because this is the
time. The other thing is that this takes some educating of your clients because your
clients’ tendency is to call you up three days before their birthday and ask for a read-
ing. In terms of your work, by the way, that's often very helpful because in fact the
moment you start discussing what's taking place at the unconscious level, they're al-
ready attuned to it because it's already happening to them, and of course they are
not-self.

LECTURE ONE
The Solar Return
But you really need to educate your clients that this is something that they have
done three months before their birthday. This is the best way to introduce them
each year. It will make things so much healthier for them. It's one of my oldest
recommendations that people do not make major decisions between their Design and
their birth time simply because there is this inconsistency and if you're not operating
correctly as yourself, you're bound to be swayed by the conditioning at the uncons-
cious level which is very deceptive and can pull you into things that really are un-
healthy. So you have to start with the unconscious.
Tomorrow we're going to work with a Generator and take a look at the analysis tech-
nique. We're going to take a look at the timing and we're going to see how we can
integrate all that together.
I want to thank you all. This is an exciting adventure that I'm launching myself into.
I think it's terrific. I hope you're enjoying it as well. I think this is really the future
of international teaching. It's wonderful that you're all participating. I think you're
going to find that this way of being able to teach gives you time to digest every day
and process the material. I'm enjoying it. Wherever you are, have a good day, have
a good night. We'll see you tomorrow.

Lecture Two
The Solar Return: Introduction to Analysis Techniques
Carl Jung’s Natal Chart
The Single Split Generator
Today we're going to be looking at the overview of the approach to doing the Solar
Return. How important it is when somebody calls you up after they've had a reading
with you and they want to have their Incarnation Cross reading or they want to have
this kind of reading or whatever. One of the things to really recommend to them is
that they have a return chart done, particularly for those people who have more than
just a casual relationship to the knowledge but are really taken by it and are inter-
ested. When you're offering a return, it really is an opportunity for them not only to
learn some more, but to learn about how they need to deal with the environment
and how important it is to have reinforced in them the fact that what's really going to
work for them is their Strategy and Authority. And it gives you an opportunity to
realign them. [Jung’s Birth Data for this lecture: July 26, 1875, 19:19, Kesswil,
Switzerland]
I think it's one of the things we forget because the knowledge is delicious. You can
have so much fun with all this information and yet the tendency is that we want to
tell people much more, much, much more than they need to hear. It really is some-
thing that I hope by the end of these days I will really have hammered in is how im-
portant it is to use the return as a way to remind
them what their design is.
It's so difficult for beings to accept that what they
are and they are alone is really the thing and how
easy it is for them to gain access to that, but it's
very difficult for them to find the confidence to do
that. We live in a world of deep conditioning and
there is nothing but fear in the design of a human
being. It's everywhere. You can see that the mind
and the way the mind is attached to the maya, that
the moment they're just feeding on information, all of that information being
processed with their mind ends up reinforcing their mental determination to control
their life. We really have a responsibility to realign them to what is their nature, and
what is really their Authority.

The First Key is Understanding the Clients Vulnerability
Yesterday we began by looking at a single definition Manifestor in which the very
first key is the theme of the type, which in the case of the Manifestor is anger. Here
obviously, we are dealing with a Generator and the theme of frustration. But more
in the sense that yesterday when we were looking at understanding the not-self, re-
member your clients are not-self; they really are. The only way you can even begin
to understand how they're going to be impacted by any imprint at any time in any
cycle is to understand their vulnerability at the not-self level. In other words, where
are they conditioned? Where have they developed long-term strategies to deal with
the conditioning of those Centers?
Split Definition
We saw yesterday in looking at the open Manifestor chart that all we had to do was
simply organize the not-self strategies of the open Centers and you add them all up
and what you have is a way in which the mind is going to frame its decision making.
But of course, we have something very different today in the sense that we have a
split definition. If you go to the Human Design Resources tab in the JAM Player,
you'll find a global survey. Quite frankly, it is something that I look at quite literally
every morning because I find it so fascinating. And it grows rapidly. It's actually
based on people who are coming to the Jovian site to simply download a free chart.
There are anywhere from 150 to 200 people who do that every single day. The sur-
vey now is somewhere around 52,000 entries [in 2005]. So, we're dealing with a
statistical base that is very legiti-
mate in terms of our ability to be
able to interpret statistics from
that base reliably.
One of the more interesting things
is to see the ratios of the way in
which types are built. In other
words, for example, approximately
41% of humanity are single defini-
tions. I've talked to enough
people about this subject in De-
sign; they're often surprised that
there are so many beings who are
single definitions. It is a fact;
41%. 45% are splits, splits like
Jung's chart here. In other words,
this is a basic split definition. About 11% are triple-splits and .6%, actually the
smallest percentage, smaller than even the percentage of Reflectors as a percentage
of type, are the quadruple-splits. So the quadruple-splits are very, very rare indeed.

LECTURE TWO
Solar Return
So, when we're looking at yesterday's single definition, we're looking at approx-
imately 41% of the people you're going to meet, the main theme that drives their
not-self is going to evidenced in their open Centers. This will be the key of under-
standing their not-self.
But you cannot look at this chart and use the open Centers of the Head, Ajna and
Ego in terms of trying to understand the way in which the not-self works in this de-
sign in the same way you can do with somebody who is a single definition because
the game has changed. The game has completely changed. When you're dealing
with a split definition, you're dealing with a human being that's divided. It's an ob-
vious division. And it's not a division that carries any connotation of this or that. It's
simply a fact. In other words, there are two very distinct aspects.
Jung’s Simple-Split
So when you're looking at this chart, what you're looking at is a fundamental binary.
My first reaction to anybody who is a split definition—by the way, tomorrow I will do
what I can to find a good triple-split Projector to give you that side of the movie.
The triple-split is very different from the split—these are very, very different formats
to work with.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
So, when you're dealing with the basic binary, there's something to grasp. The sole
pressure in the life is not whether or not Jung was going to get his Ego defined or
not. The sole pressure in the life was: How do you bring the two parts together?
Because it's always about that. In other words, everything about the way the genet-
ics works in a split definition—and again, when I say split I'm only speaking in this
context. If I was going to refer to all split definitions, I would say so. This is just for
the simple-split; two parts. When you're dealing with this two-part phenomenon,
you have to see that the not-self strategy, the primary, if I can use that terminology,
the primary not-self strategy is not in the Center, but it's in the potential bridging
gates.
For example, here when you're looking at Jung's chart, and this is a very complex
variation of this, you can see there are number of ways in which this split definition
can be brought together. For example, you can start with the Root Center and the
38th gate and the 54th gate. They will bring the two parts of the split together. You
also have the 2nd gate going down to the 14. So, if the 14 was there it would bring
the split together.
You also have the 50th gate, the harmonic gate to the 27, if that was there it would
bring the split together. Then finally on the far side, if you look over to the 36th gate
in the emotional system, The Darkening of the Light, the gate of crisis, unconsciously

pointing upwards to the Throat, whenever the 35 would show up, like on a day like
today with the Sun in 35, then you would also have the ability to bring that split to-
gether.
So, let's think about that for a moment. You have five variations; you have five dif-
ferent things that genetically carry the deepest conditioning force in this being's life.
There's something else to consider and something quite important to consider.
There are different kinds of simple-splits. In all of the cases here, the split definition
can be linked by the simple activation of a single gate. There is a difference in psy-
chology if you need a gate to join your split or you need a whole channel or more to
join your split.
Simple-Split Bridged by a Single Gate
If you need a gate to join your split, you always assume that the fact that the thing
that you don't have, because of your inconsistency with it, is your problem. In other
words, take a look at the 50th gate pointed at the 27th gate. Here is somebody who
is not able consistently to take responsibility. So, what do they do? They force
themselves in this life to take responsibility and suffer because they cannot consis-
tently do it. So, it becomes part of the way in which their not-self mind operates.
The way in which it operates is I'll say yes to this because it will make me look like I
am being responsible.
In other words, the way one is going to respond and make decisions in the life, the
primary conditioning isn't going to come out of the open Centers but it's going to
come out of these deeply condi-
tioned gates where this person, be-
cause it's just a single step, sees
the missing gate at the other end as
their problem and they try to com-
pensate for it.
So if you don't have the 54th gate,
you're always trying to be more
ambitious because you think you
have to be more ambitious. And if
you don't have the 38th gate, you
really think you have to struggle
with things because if you don't
struggle with things you won't find
your purpose. And if you don't have
the 14th gate then you're missing
the resources you need and you become greedy for the resources that will help you
move in your direction, and on and on.
In other words, what you have to see is that the primary conditioning forces in a split
definition's chart begins with the harmonic gates they don't have. It also makes it

much easier to be able to read fairly precisely where the impact is going to be be-
cause you get to see the impact not spread out over a Center, but you see it specifi-
cally operating through a gate that is going to be part of the conditioning force.
Simple-Split Bridged by a Channel or More
So, when we're dealing with a split definition that can only be joined if it's a channel
or more, then you have something difficult. What's so difficult about that is that this
is somebody who assumes everybody else has the problem, not them. And of
course, this is something that can be very difficult. This is when the way in which
the not-self mind is going to make decisions is based on trying to figure out how to
deal with the other person who has the problem.
Single Gate Bridging: Analyze the Gate Implications
Split definitions make it more complex, and yet at the same time, it makes it in
many ways easier to be able to read. The first thing you have to see is that if you
are looking at a split, then you have to begin to analyze the gate implications. For
example in Partnership, understanding the way charts come together. It’s always
important to see that there is a basic continuity within the framework of the circuitry
that dominates in the design that gives you a hint as to what is going to be more at-
tractive as a conditioning force.
For example, Jung with his 10/57 has a very strong, unconscious definition in inte-
gration with a natural relationship to the 28, because it's the 28 that opens him up to
being concerned about the survival of others. That 28 is going to be very attracted
to the 38. In other words,
it's going to be more at-
tracted to that than it is to
the 54. The pressure to be
ambitious is going to be less
comfortable as a condition-
ing force. He's going to feel
less guilty about his failures
to be ambitious enough con-
sistently than he will be
about not having that 38th
gate.
The same thing is true for
the other side of the split.
For example, where the ab-
stract process is so deep in
his Sacral, the format ener-
gy is there and running

LECTURE TWO
Solar Return
through almost the entire human experiential way—the 41, the 30, the 36. So you
can see that the 35 is also something that is deeply going to pull him. On one side,
he's going to be pulled deeply into the abstract experiential process and also the
sexuality and all of the things that go with that side and that stream. And on the
other side, the deeper side, the survival side, the perfection of the form that leads to
him being a potential leader, this is going to be strengthened by the relationship that
comes with the conditioning of the 38. In other words, he's going to want to look
like a fighter when in fact he's not.
You end up, again, in a situation where the not-self mind is going to take that and
use that as the basis of making a decision. This is the decision that says: ―No, I'm
not going to let this pass; I'm going to fight about this. I'm not going to let it pass;
I'm going to fight about it.‖ When in fact, that isn't necessarily what is correct, but it
is the way the conditioning pressure of not having that gate impacts on the way that
mind is going to make decisions.
The other thing is that you have somebody who has an unusual configuration men-
tally. That is, there are no activations whatsoever in the Head Center or the Ajna
Center. So, you do have a mind that is very much trying to really pretend that it's
certain about things all the time and certain about things that really don't matter.
That's quite something to deal with as a not-self mind.
A Verbal Gunslinger
To get to the basis is, for me in looking at this chart—and again, I don't want to do
this chart in the sense that I'm doing a Jung analysis. I'm just looking at it from its
generic perspective. If you look at this design, you see right away there is a funda-
mental dilemma for the be-
ing. It's a dilemma that
they're either going to over-
come or there's really no
point in doing any kind of
analysis for them. Here you
have somebody who is a
verbal gunslinger. You have
somebody who has a de-
fined Throat, it's not moto-
rized; it goes to the G to the
Spleen. There is all this
pressure on this Throat, the
leadership to be able to ex-
press itself and this is a
Throat that is going to say
things that it can't neces-
sarily do. In other words,
this is a Throat that is not
connected to the source of

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
power in this being or to its Authority.
Of course, when you move to the other side of the split you can see the dilemma.
The dilemma is that one side of this being wants to operate out of its Throat as if it
were a verbal Manifestor and the other part of the being is buried deep underneath.
This is a very, very powerful emotional Sacral being who does not have a voice. This
is somebody who has to come to grips with the fact that—the 31/7, the 10/57,
whenever you see a split definition, look at the split as if it were a type by itself.
Now, I don't mean for you to use that as some kind of a law. It's just a way to give
you a reference point.
What I mean by that is that this being has a projected element and it has a deep ge-
nerative quality. It is the projected element that rules. It's the projected element
that has the identity of self. It's the projected element that has the conscious recog-
nition. Look at this guy's
chart. So often when we go
back to the very basics of
Design, so much of the ba-
sics are forgotten. When
you go back to the basic
ABC's and Personality and
Design you can see that he
is not somebody whose pas-
senger, whose Personality, is
connected to their Sacral. It
isn't.
If you look at the 42/53
you'll see the entry point in-
to the Sacral is unconscious
in the same way that the en-
try point that defines the
emotional system is uncons-
cious. He has no access to
the fates in his life. He has no access to that clinging fire consciously. All he has is
the conscious 41. And the only truly conscious aspect in terms of definition that op-
erates in his design is the 31/7. This is who this person thinks they are. They think
they are this leader, this leader of some kind of magical, intuitional resource, the 57
and the very powerful Spleen there; this is who this person thinks they are. They're
not connected to their emotional Sacral and every time they see their emotional Sa-
cral in the other, it can be very frightening to them.
Unconscious Emotional Center
Think about what it's like for somebody like this to meet somebody who is unemo-
tional. They're not consciously aware of impacting that other person at an emotional
level. They're not. They can end up assuming that somebody else is hysterical

Solar Return
when in fact they are. They're just not in tune with their hysteria. They can't even
feel their own wave. This is the dilemma that somebody like this comes to you for a
reading and you know the only way they're going to operate correctly is if they oper-
ate as an emotional Generator. To be an emotional Generator is really an ordeal.
Ask any of them. It is.
It is in the sense that if you're going from not-self consciousness to embracing the
experiment of being yourself as an emotional Generator, that's quite a trip. It is
very difficult to begin with for the Generator to surrender to response. They think it
is death; it isn't. Most of them think that waiting means that you stop and hold your
breath, which it's not. Everything is moving and everything is going and everything
is travelling. The fact is that the Sacral is there. The Generator is here to make de-
cisions in response; not to live their life in response, but to make decisions in re-
sponse.
This human being has to be put in touch with their response mechanism, and more
than that, the understanding that even if they get to a point where they can hear
their Sacral, they cannot trust it. This is an emotional being. This is an emotional
being in a very dynamic emotional wave of the abstract process. This is somebody,
when you get to the end of any of their emotional experiences, you always end up
unconsciously in a gate of crisis. You have to put this person in touch with that,
what it means to play hard to get. I don't know any better advice to give an emo-
tional Generator than the extraordinary power of playing hard to get. If they don't,
nothing works.
Splits Don’t Want to be Whole
You can see right away with this kind of a design, with this kind of split definition
that the Personality is going to be attuned to those aspects of conditioning in any
cycle that hook into that Personality element. The great joke about split definitions
is that they don't want to be whole. Get that. After all, if you understand at a really
deep level, you realize they're not supposed to be whole, otherwise they would have
been born that way. They are splits. They're here to experience consciousness in
that way.
More than that, if it were not for split definitions, we would not have the potential re-
ally, to finally find a way to integrate correctly with the other. Because the deep ge-
netic pull in the split definition is to bond one way or another with the other. All of
this with the not-self believing that every time they fill one of those harmonic gates
that link the split, everything suddenly is right. Not because the other person is
right, but because finally they can have something consistently that they thought
they didn't have.
Remember the joke; it's a black joke. You look at a split definition and the single
missing gate that will join that split; you will see that this is the center of those be-
ing's lives. It just is. And it creates the decision making strategy of their minds. So
in dealing with somebody like this who comes in and has a reading with you and they

want to have a return, you really have to go back and remind them that they're an
emotional Generator, that there is no truth in the now.
“You can never afford to allow anyone at anytime to have instant gratification at your
expense. You're not here to be available on somebody else's demand at any time;
period. Play hard to get, take your time, and listen to your feelings.” Well, yeah,
that's tough. This person doesn't listen to their feelings. What they're hearing is
what their identity is sprouting all the time and what floats around in that open mind
of theirs and they're far, far away from their emotionality.
This is somebody who would have a lot of trouble with their sexuality because quite
frankly, you can just see it. You have this stream of desire that is mostly uncons-
cious with very, very physical gates. You have a deep physical Sacral here. At the
same time, it's totally disconnected from this projected element that's running this
person's life.
Nodes Paint the Neighborhood of Your Experience
Ok, so look, let's take a look at a couple of things. Yesterday I began in trying to fo-
cus you on how to look at the Nodes. I think this is something that really needs
reinforcing to really understand how to use them. I've tried a number of ways over
the years to create a metaphor for this. My most recent metaphor is that this is a
neighborhood because it's
very physical. It's like the
background in a scene in a
film and the background
tells you everything, actual-
ly. The background frames
what to expect. There are
certain backgrounds that
you immediately think, aha,
something is going to hap-
pen here that's not good.
There are other back-
grounds that tell you right
away that this is interest-
ing; this looks very kind of
intellectual, nouveau riche,
―this or that,‖ blah, blah,
blah.
In other words, when you're
looking at the Nodes, they are painting the environment in the background of your
experience. It is that set, it's a set. It's even better to understand it as a set and
even more than that to understand that set is not just the physical buildings but the
people who live there. You want to make a movie and you want to show a street
where your character is going to go down that street to somebody's house. Now, it's

Solar Return
not enough that you simply have the street there and you have some parked cars.
What you're going to stick into that background is people, but they're just decora-
tion. But they're decoration that adds to the quality of the environment.
For example, if the decoration looks like a gang of young hoodlums who are out to
find a victim, you're going to feel very different about that environment no matter
what the neighborhood looks like. In other words, what the Nodes really bring you;
because again this is a much larger, and when I say larger it is a transpersonal im-
print. It is coming from beyond what is the solar cell structure. So what we have is
an environment that is more than just the physical environment. It's the people who
give the environment its quality.
Also, just to complete that analogy for a moment, we move from the South Node to
the North Node. This is a timing that's based on the Uranian cycle of 84 years. The
halfway point in the Uranian cycle, and it depends because it's a different kind of or-
bit, your Uranian opposition is any time between the age of 38 and 44, approximate-
ly. This basically cuts the life in half in terms of the Uranian life.
So, what we're looking at is, I don't want you to see the South Node and the North
Node as really being different from each other. After all, look at the gates. If you
look at the gate and you look at their chops, you'll see they are exact mirrors of each
other. They're so deeply related to each other that it's something to really under-
stand about the Nodes. After all, the Nodes are in opposition and if you look at an
opposition within the context of the hexagrams, you'll see that you're dealing with
mirrors. So you're dealing with the same structure mirrored. Now, in this process
you have what I like to call a long street that divides between north/south or
east/west and it changes its name. Many big cities have these kinds of streets
where at the south end it has one name and the north end of the street has another
name, and that's basically what you're looking at with the Nodes.
But you're also looking at something else. It is only on the surface that the Magnetic
Monopole holds us together in the illusion of our separateness. But in fact, we are a
binary. Our Design and our Personality are very different. Our Design return begins
88° of Sun before the Personality return begins. They're very different from each
other. The Personality environment, the environment that the Personality is attuned
to is very different from the environment for the unconscious.
Jung's Personality South Node: 48th Gate
So, let's take a look for a moment at just the surface of the Personality of Jung's
natal chart [next page]. If we look at the South Node, you'll see it's the 48th gate.
It's the gate of Depth. Think about that as an Environmental thing. Also think about
something else. We could go into the line and the line is interesting because it's the
line of Degeneracy so it's often the destruction of real depth by associating with the
wrong people.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
But if the South Node is the 48, what it's telling
you is that his Personality in the first half of his
life is always going to be within the kind of envi-
ronment in which depth is something that is part
of what it's about. In other words, if this was
going to be a scene in a movie, it would be shot in
the library because the library is there. Or it
would be shot in the intellectual café where the
intellectuals are all sitting and chatting away.
That depth is going to be what the environment is
offering. It's the backdrop of what the first part
of the Personality's process is about. When you see that movement into the second
half of the life into the 21, then what you're seeing is this movement away from in-
creasing one's depth, because that's the environment one's in, to using that depth to
establish one's power and control and to be able to provide one's power and control
for the benefit of the community.
This is a Personality trip. This is the background, the framework for this Personality
in its life to go through this process of developing depth to get to a point of control.
It's a 2nd line theme. As a 2nd line theme, it also waits for the call. It waits for the
call for its natural gifts to be called forward. The thing about this design is that you
have somebody who has a very, very spooky unconscious intuition; very deep, very
profound unconscious intuition. You can see that in the Design South Node, the
57.3, which is the line of Acuteness, there is no detriment. This is an extraordinary
intuition in the channel of Perfected Form rooted in the root of intuition, which is the
28th gate and accompanying this totally open mind so you have somebody who can
really filter at a very, very deep level.
The Design Nodes
But if you go over to the Design side
you'll see that the Design has a 3rd
line theme. In other words, the un-
conscious environment is full of trial
and error, it's full of pit falls, and it's
full of pessimism. In other words, his
unconscious world, this world that his
body deals with, is a totally different
kind of phenomena. Please under-
stand that the Personality and Design
really do deal separately with their
aspects of the binary and only the
Monopole brings it together into an
illusion that you have the whole.
What I want you to grasp is that from

Solar Return
that intuition comes the potential for initiation; in other words, this movement from
the 57 to the 51. And you can see that at the unconscious level while the intuition is
being developed through trial and error, that is, strategies for survival through trial
and error, the depth is being developed, and both of them, by the way, being splenic
gates. You can also see that fear is a deep aspect of the environment. It's just
there because it is splenic.
So that 48th gate represents an environment where people feel inadequate, where
inadequacy is a threat. You can see in terms of the 57th gate that the unconscious is
simply concerned about its survival—can it survive into the future, will it be able to
survive in the world of tomorrow, can it even get to tomorrow.
So I want you to really grasp how important it is to really pay attention to the Nodes
and to see that for a cycle reading, the Nodes really tell you the story because they
set the scene. I guess that's the best way I can describe it for you. They really just
set the scene. It gives you that quality that frames everything that is going to take
place in the process itself.
Carl Jung’s Solar Return Chart
Start with Three Basics Keys
So the moment that we go from this natal chart and move over to the Solar Return,
we're going to be able to have keys to look at very basic things. We want to see if
there are any gates that are going to—these single gates—join the split, because
that is going to give us a deep insight. We want to see if there are in fact definitions
that are going to define the open Centers because they still remain a force of condi-
tioning and a secondary
force in the way in which
the not-self mind is going
to operate.
But then I want to focus
on the Nodes to give you
this sense of how you
frame the background of
the reading. This is the
environment that you're
going to have to deal with
and therefore within this
environment, these are
the forces. Then we can
go and look at our weath-
er conditioning themes,
our weather impact themes and we can begin to piece together the story of how that
scene that is being set, the characters that are going to play in part in that scene.

Are the characters there for a Personal relationship? Are they just part of the Envi-
ronment? Are they Educational, in that sense? These various themes that we
touched on yesterday, we see then how those themes apply first dealing with the
Nodes because the Nodes are going to give us our framework.
This is the Solar Return for the year 1960. I don’t mean to be getting into any kind
of death trip here; again, I just thought I might as well take one before he died. It
makes more sense. He died about a month before his birthday in 1961. So this was
actually the last full Rave Return. What's also interesting is that in terms of actually
when he died, he was already starting the Design side of his 1961 return and was fi-
nishing off only on the Personality side his 1960 return. This brings us to this very
important point about the timing of the reading.
Timing for the Solar Return
As a professional, if you produce any literature that you give out to people and if you
list the kind of things that you do, one of the things to remind people is for the Solar
Return, it's very important that they understand this is something they need to have
three months before their birthday. Three months is a lot easier for them to digest
than 88° of the Sun. But nonetheless, three months before their birthday is really
the best time to do that.

LECTURE TWO
Solar Return
The first thing we need to take a look at is in the left-hand column of MMI, the Solar
Return, the weather impact themes of Educational and Personal, are always listed so
that you can see right away where the connections are and what kind of connections
they are. [In MMAI, the list is on the right-hand side.]
MMI MMAI
Educational Channels: The 59/6 and the 63/4
So for example, the Educational, we know that this is Dominance and you can see
immediately that we have the Dominance in the 59/6 and the 63/4. So this very
strong activation of the mind through the 63/4, and of course we know that we're
dealing with somebody who has an undefined Head and Ajna so we have the defining
of these two Centers. Also, in
terms of the Dominance of the
59/6, again, this whole lack of
the tribal stream on the right-
hand side in this design, so
you have someone who has no
activations in the 40/37 or the
59/6. Of course, here you get
the 59/6.
We're dealing with the theme
of Education and it's very clear
that you can be very simple in
terms of just looking at that
and understanding something.
This is a background field. The
Educational channels are what they get to learn through what they see around them.
So this is somebody who is going to learn something about intimacy in this particular
cycle.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

This is also somebody who is going to learn something about the resolution of doubt
through formula, about the possibility of really dealing with doubt in a fixed way to
come up with a fixed theory, which is basically what the 63/4 is all about. So, im-
mediately you can see that you have two Dominances.
The Keys: The Missing Single Gates
Our keys are going to be the single gates that are missing; we can see that three of
them are being activated. The three gates that are being activated: two are out of
the Root Center, the 38th
gate, the gate of Opposi-
tion; the 54th gate, the
Marrying Maiden; and
then again out of the
Splenic Center the 44th
gate going to its har-
monic gate, the 26 and
defining the Ego that is
undefined.
We have a Personal con-
nection that is creating a
definition in an entirely
new area. So we only
actually have two gates,
the 38 and the 54, that
are going to be the
theme because these are the only two gates that are being activated thematically in
this whole construct of the way in which the split can be connected.
Let's take a look at that for a moment. Let's begin with looking at the 38th gate in
the Solar Return. The Saturn of this return is fascinating because both the 38 and
the 54, the two gates that are activated, are part of this deep conditioning in this be-
ing that are going to affect the way the not-self mind is going to operate; both of
these gates are being activated by Saturn.
At the Design side, the 54.4 is the activation. That's rather special because that's a
very unusual line. That is the line of Enlightenment/Endarkenment. It's all about
the potential of being recognized by forces beyond what we would consider the real;
the potential of being in touch with those forces, a transformation that can have a
mystical quality to that.
Remember, those two channels for this design represent two things. They represent
transformation that is going to benefit the whole and transformation as struggle that
is going to benefit the individual. In other words, to be able to find one's purpose,
but also to have the strength to be able to transform the tribe, because the whole

purpose of the 32/54 is to provide the basic ingredients for the continuation of the
success of the tribe.
Saturn: Personal/Developmental
Let's deconstruct for a moment and go back. Let's take
a look at what that means in WEATHER
terms of the way in which the CONDITIONING
mind is going to react to this and THEMES
where these things are coming
INNER PLANETS
from. They're coming from Sa-
PEOPLE
turn. If they're coming from Sa- z x e d
turn, this is Personal but it's De-
velopmental. In other words, THE NODES OF THE MOON
this is not coming from people. DIRECTION
This is not an ambitious person with the 54th gate enter- Ê Ë
ing into this person's life. It's not about somebody who
OUTER PLANETS
is a fighter who is in the opposition game who's carrying
DEVELOPMENT
the 38th gate stepping into this person's life. It's not, c r f v t
it's Saturn. It's just Saturn. This is Developmental.
So what is there to be developed, after all? What is this all about? From one level—
and again the disadvantage of hindsight because it's so obvious that we're dealing
with the last Solar Return—there is pressure on transformation in the life. Now, if I
was doing this design
and this wasn't Jung and
this wasn't 1960, I was
just looking at this con-
figuration, what I would
really see is that this is a
year where there is
going to be a real
change for that being.
This is the point. There
is going to be a change.
There's going to be a
real transformation.
And yet, that transfor-
mation is going to bring
struggle. It's not going
to be easy. And it's
going to require the being to be steadfast. In other words, just on the very surface,
this is a year where there is going to be a tremendous amount of pressure for
change, for transformation that leads to material potential and success, for trans-
formation that leads to the discovery of individual purpose, to find one's purpose.

Death and Failure Themes
We know that the 28th gate is the fear of death; the 32nd gate is the fear of failure,
so death and failure are going to be themes for this person through the year. They
have to develop in relationship to those themes. How are they going to deal with
death? If it wasn't this chart, it would be that you may have to deal with death
around you this year. You may have to deal with the fact that you're getting older
and this and that's beginning to break down, whatever the case may be. And you
also have to deal with this potential theme of failure.
Now, we can go into the details. You can go down into the line and all of that stuff.
But the thing that's really important is just to be able to deal with the surface be-
cause if you can get them to operate correctly as themselves, if you can, if this can
inspire them, this reaffirmation of what is the priority for this emotional Generator,
then these are themes that can be very exciting. In other words, there is the oppor-
tunity for transformation that is guided by a higher force because there is this un-
usual 54.4.
Saturn in the 38.5
But it's also Saturn. Saturn can be very rigid and very difficult. You look at the
38.5, Saturn is exalted: A stage in opposition when one is totally isolated. The ambi-
tion—that's interesting
because that combines
with the 54 theme—and
concentration to endure.
The energy to stubbornly
fight alone. So, here's
somebody who is going
to have a struggle in
which they're going to
have to fight alone. Well,
what does that tell you?
It tells you nobody is
going to fight with him.
You're going to have to
fight alone this year.
Oh, boy, will that reso-
nate in that person. This
is a year where you're going to have to fight alone to find your purpose; you're going
to have to fight alone. When it comes for transformation, wait for the gods to speak
to you because the gods will speak to you as long as you're operating correctly as
yourself.

Solar Return
The 44.1 and the Ego Center
Let's take a look for a moment and step away and look at the Centers for just a
second and specifically take a look at the Ego because the Ego is very much tied into
all of this. It's tied into all of this because the 54/32, which is a primary conditioning
force for this being, that the whole stream gets completed with the activation of the
44th gate and it's Neptune in the 44.1. It's all about the mastery of the collective
that can establish restrictive conditions for inferior components and with the ability
to enforce them. Alertness to patterns. Or, the failure of the instinct out of the need
for harmony. So here is somebody who is going to be driven by the need for harmo-
ny when, in fact, they have to fight alone.
Think about that. I talked to you yesterday about how any cycle is a pallet of things.
It doesn't mean that he's either going to get his 54 trip or his 38 trip or his 44 trip.
They are possibilities in the weather. They are possibilities in the imprint. The fact
is, the further the way he is from his nature, the more all of these forces, particularly
the 38 and 54, are going to impact on this being.
But remember, if this is somebody who is operating correctly as themselves, there is
discernment in that. In other words, it may not be the season for them to go
through the 38/28 process. It may not be the key Developmental area for them. As
a matter of fact, if they're really operating as themselves, this is not a conditioning
force; this is something
that they're there to
learn about. And the
moment you move away
from that force being
something that you take
personally, it only then
becomes something that
you see in the other.
You also have to see
something about the 32
for this being. They
have the 32.6; this is a
very, very depressive
line. But it's also the
Cross of the Unexpected
so you have somebody
who in terms of what the 54 could mean for this being, how important it is for them
to understand the possibilities of transformation in this year, the possibility of real
Development. But what is that real Development going to be based on? It's going
to be based on them operating correctly, because if they don't make decisions cor-
rectly as themselves, it's not going to work. It's just something that is so obvious.

Always Bring Client Back to the Basics
Everything about doing anybody's reading is just bringing them back over and over
and over and over and over again to the basics: You have to operate correctly as
yourself; otherwise, you don't know what track to take. You're not going to be cor-
rect. This is an energy being. This is a deep, powerful energy being who needs to
operate out of their emotional awareness, their emotional clarity. And it's only out of
that emotional clarity that they're going to be able to enter into the right Develop-
mental process through the 54 or the 38, but it is going to be there.
This is a year where you will have a chance, is the way that I would phrase it. This
is a year where you can end up in an important struggle to find your purpose in this
life. This is a year where you can finally find a way to be transformed in terms of the
way in which you can reach out and impact the community, and so forth and so on.
The various abilities that exist in being able to use any of the keynotes that are in
the design.
But this is the real thing, the pressure that's there; it's just all pressure. Now, it
joins the split and in joining the split it means that that pressure, in and of itself, can
only be resolved by the being as a whole. And of course, this being as a whole has
to operate through their emotional Sacral. There isn't any other way.
The Personality Nodes: The 63rd and the 64th Gates
Let's take a look at the environment. If we're going to take a look at the set that
has been laid out, we're going to look at
the Nodes. Let's begin by looking at the
Personality. Remember, the Personality
Nodes are what your client is going to
be attuned to. We're all connected to
the Personality; we're all connected to
what's there on the surface.
So, when you look at it you see the 63-
64 combination. We know already that
the 63, the South Node phase, is going
to have an impact because it's going to
form a definition and again, this is an
Educational channel. It's a weather im-
pact, it's Educational, it's Dominance.
It's going to hook up with the 4th gate.
Together they're going to form this definition in the logic system.

LECTURE TWO
Solar Return
The Environment is Full of Doubt and Confusion
That whole connection—what is the 63? The 63 is doubt. What's the 64? It's confu-
sion. So what is the set we have and how does it work? Everybody wants to time
things. It's like is the 63 the first six months and the 64 the next six months? Re-
member, they're a mirror. They're really both there. But it is a movement from the
63 to the 64. It is a movement. And in that movement, the 63 means that literally
the environment is going to be filled with doubt. That means the beings who are
around, this is a world where there are not a lot of people in the background who
look like they understand what's going on. This is a lot of people who don't know
what's going on, the doubt is there in the environment.
There can be times that are full of doubt, times that are threatening to a specific set
of formulas. The times will bring its own mechanism and will bring its own evolution
which will lead to the potential to look at things that were once considered solid and
to assume perhaps they're not that solid. In other words, an era of doubt; but an
era of doubt condensed into an environment around this being that they're going to
move through. And worse than that, the doubt leads to confusion. It leads to a con-
fused environment. It leads to people who are confused. It doesn't sound very nice.
There are many opportunities in that, though. It depends on the being; it depends
on the time of life. If he was somebody who had the 4th gate, that would be a totally
different value. In having the 4th gate himself, this would be a situation where he
would be able to come up with formulas for those who have the doubts and he would
be meeting all these beings who have the doubts and this would be very successful.
It could be.
But the fact of the matter is that it's all there in the background. It's something to
understand. It's Educational. The world is filled with doubt. It's filled with confu-
sion. And here is somebody who is going to be surrounded by the evidence of it.
That doesn't mean that you're in doubt and you're confused, which is the tendency
of most people when they do this kind of a reading. It isn't. It's the environment
that's like that. It's weather forecasting, after all. And that means that you have to
be prepared for that kind of environment.
It's like in the old days when I would get up on a stage and nobody had ever heard
of Human Design. And it's the first time I would be in the city and there would be a
few people out there. You're dealing with a world of doubt. It's just an environ-
ment. And how you deal with that doubt, you either put your hands up in the air
and walk away and surrender to the fact that you're not going to be able to take that
doubt away, that you don't have the formula, or you go about your business.

Deal with the Environment through Strategy and Authority
So, one of the things to see very clearly is that with the environment that is brought
by the Nodes is not there to either bring punishment or reward. It simply sets the
stage. How you're going to move through a conscious environment that is going to
be filled with doubt and confusion, we know what the answer is. You're not going to
be able to deal with that by relying on your mind which is being impacted by this
pressure. That is not your true inner Authority. You're only going to be able to deal
with that by operating correctly through your emotional Sacral process. It is the on-
ly way.
So, the first thing to look at is that the Personality has to deal with what appears to
be an environment in which nothing is reliable. Remember something. Here is
somebody who has the 32nd gate and doesn't have the 54. And if you have the 32nd
gate and it stands alone, continuity is always a theme. There is always this fear of
failure. And then to end up in a situation where you're dealing with an environment
where it's obvious to you that people are in doubt and confused, there does not
seem to be an answer available.
The Design Nodes: The 36th and 6th Gates
More than that, if you
look at the Design side
of this, you see the
South Node is in the 36th
gate, The Darkening of
the Light, this gate of
Crisis. This is all about
times of decline. It's
about feelings that can
benefit others in times of
crisis. It really is about
assistance to others in
times of decline. So,
you're dealing with an
environment in which on
one side, the neighbor-
hood is filled with doubt
and on the other side,
you're dealing with physical decline. This was somebody who was 85 years old in
1960. So, obviously he was dealing with a world of decline around him. It's quite a
natural thing to see; and somebody that he would have seconded, in that sense.

Solar Return
The Moon in the 59.2
The other thing is what it's pointed towards. Again, what it's pointed towards is so
interesting because it's the 6th gate, the North Node, the gate of Conflict. Everything
about this is interesting in the sense that you have the 59th gate, the Personality
Moon, of the Solar Return that's in the 2nd line. Here you have the 6.2 so you have
this deep theme that reinforces the natural retreat in this being. It's a deep theme.
But also see very clearly that the real intimacy is lunar. It's the only real intimacy
that is here. It's the only real person who is somebody that is going to be there.
When I say somebody, it doesn't have to be just one person. It can be a number of
people and it can be simply the various transiting aspects. But the Moon in the 59.2
is quite significant.
When we're dealing with
the Moon, it's an inner
planet. We’re dealing
with people and we're
dealing with somebody
who's going to bring
what is Education. In
other words, this is
somebody who is going
to be able to move
through the barriers.
By the way, this is the
detriment so it's a deep
psychological barrier.
The word "psychology"
only appears I think in 3
lines in the 384. It's interesting it would be here. That even in dynamic individuals
will always restrict interaction; infertility rooted psychologically or biologically that
conditions the drive for separateness. One of the things he's going to be educated to
is to separateness.
Remember, there was this other theme where the risk for him—I think it was in the
44—the whole pressure on him to try to find harmony with others, and at the same
time, the fact that he has to go it alone, the fact that the real teaching he's going to
get from a person or from people is that he's on his own; he's going to have to deal
with things on his own. This is the environment. You can see that when somebody
is going to enter into a Nodal environment like this, how dense that becomes the
moment you begin to accentuate it.
The Importance of the Nodal Environment
I want you to begin as professionals to think this way about the Nodes, deeper and
deeper. I think it was Alok who mentioned to me about a year ago that the deeper I

go, the more I return to essential themes. At the very beginning, I began with what
I call the Cross of Life: the Sun/Earth, this vertical force and the horizontal force of
the Nodes. And to really see that when you understand that the setting sets the
stage for the process, you begin to see that the work you have to do to understand
somebody's cycle return, any kind of cycle analysis, is all you have to do is be able
to understand the stage that's being set.
If you see the environment, then you can see that everything that's going to go on in
the characteristics of this chart—and remember when we're dealing with a Rave Re-
turn, we're dealing with characteristics. And we're dealing with the threat that the
conditioning of our characteristics brings to us by pulling us away from the potential
of our true self.
You can see if we go back to our deep themes of conditioning in the 38th gate and
the 54th gate—let's take a look at the 38th gate. We have the Personality Saturn in
the 38.5, this is the exaltation. This is the stage where one is totally alone. So here
is where the struggle is a struggle where he has to be totally alone. Now, this is not
alien to this person. This is a hermit on the Cross of the Unexpected. It's a 2/4.
But here when you're looking at this 38, think about this 38 of going it alone within
the context of a stage that's been set and you can see it's a damn good idea to go it
alone. Do you understand? In other words, here is this environment that is full of
doubt and crisis and there is all this confusion around. It's not possible to be able to
get the support from the outside. It's not.
Accept the Environmental Themes Only through Authority
If one is going to find one's purpose in this, one is going to have to fight alone; one
is going to have to go through it alone. Think about it. That's not necessarily cor-
rect. Surprised? Because it isn't; because whether that person is going to enter into
the 38 conditioning voluntarily is determined by whether or not they're responding to
this correctly as an emotional Gene-
rator. As an emotional Generator,
they can end up rejecting the pull of
this conditioning, because after all
it's not them. None of that green
stuff you see in the illustration is
them. It has nothing to do with
them. It's just the environment, it's
just the background, it's just the
frequency.
Whether or not this aspect or that
aspect of the frequency or what
combination of them can only be
determined by their Authority because only their Authority knows; nothing else does.
It's not an intellectual decision—I'll take the 38 but not the 54. I'll take the 44, sur-

Solar Return
prise everybody and forget the 54-38. Or maybe I just want to have some fun,
whatever the case may be, the reality is—and I'm playing now—but it's so important
to grasp: the decision has to come from the Authority. Otherwise, think about
what's really going to happen. It's really going to get confusing, very confusing.
There is going to be all this pull towards, "But I have to try to find harmony. And
even though I feel I should do it alone." There's all this stuff that's going to be in
there that gets all mixed up because everything is being there, doing its work, bring-
ing its conditioning, losing that person in the homogenization of the background
field. You become an aspect of the set.
Furniture
I used to make this joke about furniture. I had this experience many years ago as a
magazine publisher. I was doing a shoot. The photographer was doing some scene
and he called to his assistant that he needed more furniture. I couldn't imagine what
he was talking about. In came a couple of models and he placed them in the scene,
and I thought how horrendous, what a term.
But to really understand something, the moment you're not differentiating or dis-
cerning based on your Authority, how you connect to the world around you, that's
the moment you're automatically furniture. You're the stage set. You become the
background stage set because you're doing all those things that are set up for it.
You don't have to be engaged in the confusion and doubt at all. You don't. You'll
see it. It's all around.
Lay Out a Selection and Combination of Possibilities
But after all, it is only going to impact on you if it becomes a source of what you
would do in terms of the decisions you're going to make in terms of what's there in
front of you to do in this life. It's so important to grasp this. When you're doing a
reading for somebody, what you're doing is laying out a selection of possibilities and
combinations of possibilities. Yes, the themes are there and it's obvious. All you
have to do is pinpoint those places.
But again, you have to see that for them, it's not clear. They're ready to take all of
that. They'll take the 38, the 54, the 44, they'll take the Educational channels,
they'll take the whole thing and they'll muddle their way through with a defined Ego
thematic in which they're trying to prove something and all that stuff. Of course,
they'll come back and tell you how terrific you were. "Oh, yeah, that thing you said,
yes that happened, and that thing and that thing and that thing." That's not what
it's all about. We're not being of service in that sense.

The Anti-Soothsayer
They need to understand that this is a selection process based on their ability to dis-
cern what is correct for them. The pressure goes back on them. Don't let them put
the pressure on you. The pressure is on them. And the pressure on them is not to
understand how you get to the point of seeing it. It's not about educating them in
that. And it's not about: I'm a soothsayer and I'm going to tell you precisely what's
going to happen. Because what you really are is the anti-soothsayer: ―I'm going to
tell you precisely all the things that may not happen. It's up to you. Or I'll tell you
all the things that may happen, but it's up to you. I'll tell you what the themes are,
but how you deal with them, how you operate within that set, this stage set, how
powerful it is."
If you go into a movie theater expecting to see a movie and what you get to see is
actors standing on a blank stage set reading their lines from a script, you would not
do that. You wouldn't pay any money, you wouldn't go. It wouldn't be interesting.
The background is everything. It sets the stage. You read so much into it. If there
is one theme that is consistent throughout the life it's the Nodal theme. And if
there's one theme that is consistent, deeply consistent in these long cycles, it is the
Nodal theme. It is pointing you clearly to an environment, a stage that you have to
operate on.
A Cycle Return Points the Client towards their Purpose
And everything is going to exist within the characteristics of your design and later
you will see within the Profile—remember something, to do somebody's Rave Return
is try to take somebody out of not-self consciousness. To do somebody's cycle re-
turn is try to point them towards their purpose. But you can't move towards your
purpose unless you've mastered your characteristics, unless you've mastered the
pressure on your split, the pressure on your open Centers, unless you've mastered
the ability to operate correctly as yourself, you're always stuck in the characteristics.
Why do you think I'm pushing the doing of Rave Returns? It's because we all know
how long it takes and we know how difficult it is for human beings to go through this
process. This is the essential reinforcement because it reinforces the pressure on the
characteristics, what keeps you—because of our genetics and the way our genetics
work—away from your purpose. It's there in every Solar Return, because it shows
you so clearly: ―Ok, here's a signpost. This is the neighborhood you're going to be
in. If you go through this year, referring to this chart, at the end of this year if
you're all confused and messed up, if you've had a terrible crisis, if you're dead, you
didn't have a good time, you did not do this correctly.‖ It's not about that.
It's about simply saying, “This is the stage and upon this stage you do your perfor-
mance and then you leave this stage and you enter into another one, another back-
drop. Another backdrop that brings you closer and closer to the fulfillment of your
own Nodal process because, remember, these are thematics along the way. These
are the things that you're here to learn. This is a learning process.”

LECTURE TWO
Solar Return
Everything we talk about in cycle analysis is about what happens to us when things
get lit up that we do not have. It's all conditioning. At the core is the fundamental
basis of your own Nodes as the theme of the whole life. This is the environment that
you're going to work throughout your life; this is always going to be the backdrop.
But there are all these mini-scenes. There are all these tiny little cutaways that hap-
pen along the way. All of that is part of a growth process of being able to integrate
with the rest of humanity, the way other people operate.
Tuning into What Other People Have to Deal With
For me, every Solar Return is an opportunity to really tune into what other people
have to deal with. It's not what I have to deal with. I only have to deal with me. I
don't have to deal with the Sun and the Earth and the Planets and the Nodes. I only
have to deal with me. I have enormous respect for the forces. I've been there. I
understand all of that.
But the fact is that I can only be me and I can only be correct in that. As long as I'm
correct in being me, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it's this neighborhood, or
that neighborhood. I've seen a lot of them in my 57 years. They're there. You go
through these processes. And as you go through them year after year and you rec-
ognize what the themes are, you see how much Development comes from these
processes, how important it is for us to see these other backgrounds and to deal with
them and to deal with the forces that are there.
It's like what we're dealing with now with the 32-42 Nodes. Everybody is dealing
with this. It's so important to understand this is the background. It's just the back-
ground. This fear engendered because there is pressure to grow, and it's just there
and it's everywhere. But you can't spend your time being concerned with it. You
can only be concerned with being correct because what you will see in that being
correct, you eliminate resistance and you move down that road very smoothly as
yourself and you learn.
Return the Responsibility to the Client
So, for the client, we need to change the language. It's the language, the way in
which the consciousness of the client operates in terms of these kinds of readings.
After all, Solar Return is synonymous with an astrological reading. I tried for years
to call it Rave Return but nobody paid any attention. I have nothing against astrolo-
gy; it's simply that the astrological process and astrological knowledge is an entirely
different system. One of the things that is so important in dealing with the mechan-
ics of Human Design is for us to be absolutely clear with our client what we're giving
them as information.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
There is a tremendous power trip in telling somebody, supposedly, about the future.
One of the ways you eliminate the potential of that being negative, and I don't mean
so much for the analyst, but I mean for the client because people are sheep. You tell
them that this is going to burn and they'll be there burning. So one of the things
you have to see is that you have to return the responsibility to them. What you're
saying to them is: “I'm giving you a general picture of what you are going to have to
deal with one way or another, themes that you will have to deal with. But, which
themes that I describe to you and how you deal with them, all of that is up to you.”
It goes back to the being.
It goes back to them understanding—because this is the point that needs to be rein-
forced—that if you don't follow your Strategy, if you don't honor your Authority, what
do you have? You're not you. That means all that conditioning is going to take a
hold on you. It means that you're simply going to be dragged into the background.
You lose your life. And you lose the opportunities in that life and there are so many
that are there.
A Split at the Head/Ajna
The other thing that's interesting, by the way, because I like to stay with the surface,
but one of the things to know is that when you look at the Solar Return, you can also
see that despite the fact that the Head Center is defined to the Ajna, that's a split.
And it means that there
is a real disconnection.
There's a tremendous
amount of pressure that
can be there from that
63-64 with no outlet for
it.
So, all the doubts and
all the confusion and all
of these things, if this
person doesn't under-
stand that this is not
them—it's like the
people walking around
now who are afraid of
failure. For most of
them it's not them; it's
not. It's the Node. Wherever they look they see people who are in some kind of
turmoil because it's in the environment. It's just there. But it doesn't mean it's for
them to respond to. It doesn’t mean they have a problem, it doesn't mean they
have to worry about it. It doesn't mean it is correct for them to be haunted by the
potential of the 42 and find that growth.

Human Design is Not Fatalistic; It's Mutative
There is no "this is it." There is "you are it." As long as we keep on bringing back to
the client that there is all this possibility here, it could be very interesting. There is
this potential for you to really find your purpose, the transformation, whatever the
themes happen to be. You can give them the advice that there is a lot of pressure
on you to have to do things alone. But it doesn't mean that that has to happen.
I remember in the early years people used to say things about Design that were re-
ally so far from the truth. One of the things they would love to say is that this is de-
terministic or fatalistic. It really isn't. It's so deeply mutative. The reality is that the
moment you truly enter into what it is to do this kind of a reading, you can see how
open this is to only one possibly correctness, that correctness that comes from that
unique being operating as themselves. When they operate as themselves, the way
in which they are going to incorporate the configuration, the chart is going to be
unique and it's going to have nothing to do with all of those things being taken in. It
is only going to be that aspect that is there truly for them to work with.
Even when you see an incredible aspect and you think this is wonderful, it doesn't
mean it's time for them. Every year it brings something. Every year it brings anoth-
er pallet full of all kinds of stuff. I've been looking now for a very, very long time—
18 years now I've been looking at my Rave Returns. Not only have I been looking at
my Rave Returns for 18 years, but I went back as far as my memory could handle.
As a matter of fact, I have a collection from birth and I've looked at everything. It's
fascinating.
It's fascinating to see there is always—for me anyway—one theme that stands out.
Sometimes it's nothing. I call them flat years. Nothing, nothing inside of me, noth-
ing in my true Authority needed to learn anything from whatever those conditioning
elements are. And when I say that, I don't know that intellectually, I simply know
that as a logical consequence of my Authority ignoring it.
Remember it's all Education. It's all learning. It's nice to be able to say that there
are people in your life who are going to bring this and that. These are learning
processes and it doesn't mean you have to deal with those people. It doesn't at all.
They're not being forced on you. The program is not being forced on you. It's a vast
ocean of information, and it's a streaming ocean of information. We're only intended
to take in what is correct for us.
Normally People Choose Only One Learning Focus
So, when you're laying out the analysis for someone, that part of it is easy. The
hard part is to get them to understand: “All of this stuff that I describe to you that's
a potential is just that. Why don't you experiment with being yourself? And then
next year you can tell me what aspect was really it for you, because in the end, it's
usually like that.” The fact is that human beings—and usually like that on both the
conscious and unconscious side—human beings rarely have the focus for more in

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

terms of a learning process. If you're operating correctly, you're going to take in a
theme very, very deeply if that is your Authority to do so. That is a real deep learn-
ing process.
What Your Receptors are Open to in the General Program
It's what I love about doing Rave Returns. It's the one thing consistently that I do
for myself. I looked at one the other day, because it's always interesting to remind
myself of what the framework is around me. Not what's happening to me. I don't
see these charts as this is happening to me. This is what my receptors are open to
in the general program at the moment. That's all; what they're open to. It doesn't
mean that I have to take it in. It doesn't mean I have to integrate with it. It doesn't
mean I have to learn from it. It doesn’t mean any of that. It's all about Authority.
So, when you finally get to that point where you look at what is the simple basis of
doing a Rave Return, what you come to is seeing that this is a minimum projection of
pattern with a huge dose of reminder, because that's what it's about. And take the
advantage of every activation to an area that's not activated to be able to indicate
the dilemma of that situation in that person as a whole so they begin to really see
there is no other way: I have to try an experiment with my design. That's the point.
You don't want them going out the door waiting for all these things to happen. You
want them going out the door wondering which one of them is for them. What was
that thing in the States years ago—Monty Hall, Let's Make a Deal, a television show.
It was a funny thing. They would give away all these prizes and they had these
three big, giant doors where people could choose behind this door or that door or the
other. One door would have nothing, another door would have a terrible prize and
the last one would have some kind of fantastic thing. You'd have all these screaming
people excited.
Well, that's really what you want to do in one of these readings, honestly. You really
want to do is say: “Here's door number one. Now door number one could bring you
the struggle that can transform your process so that you can understand your pur-
pose. Door number two, on the other hand, is a door that will really challenge you in
terms of trying to come to grips with your basic fears, and so forth and so on. In
other words, which door?”
When they leave the reading, the thing is that if you set that up properly, their mind
can't give them the answer. It's wonderful. Mind doesn't know which one. It can
decide this one. But then it already knows that it could be the other one. The mind
doesn't know. You are focusing them on their Authority. So there is this beauty in
the experience.
By the way, everything you describe they will see, because it will be there and it will
be all around them. They will get to see what they integrate with or not. And that
will be their surprise. That will be their treat. And in that, you’ve really done a good
service. You've given them a way over the coming year that they have something

Solar Return
interesting for their mind to be occupied with while they wait to operate correctly as
themselves to get the future that's been predicted for them. It's an interesting
process.
Q & A
Is the Split Created by the Solar Return Important?
Question: You were talking about the splits. Now the Solar Return creates another
split. Does this have the same quality or is this gate 56 or 43 that would bridge the
split here, is this an important theme in this coming year as well?
Ra: Yes, it's a good point. It's a good question. No, it's not a theme at all. As a
matter of fact, what it's an indication of is that the very defining of the mind is ac-
tually going to bring very uncomfortable pressure because it's simply not going to
move easily. You can
see that in the environ-
ment because the Per-
sonality Nodal environ-
ment is right there in
the Head Center. That's
really what all the pres-
sure is heading towards,
the 4. There is no way
out and it's not, of
course, a true split be-
cause it's just a themat-
ic.
So, what it really indi-
cates is that mentally,
the mental pressure is
going to be very uncom-
fortable because there really isn't going to be an outlet for it. This is somebody very
much having to pull into what is their basic hermit nature, this fighting it alone, have
to deal with things on their own. It's not going to be easy. It's something that
would have to be very physical. They would really have to ignore their mind a lot.
One of the themes here is how much pressure would be there. But just to be me-
chanical in answering your question, no. If you have a split that is being generated
by the program itself, it does not act in that way. And the 56th gate or the 43rd gate
does not, in fact, have any real significance in this design.
It's really cute. For years I've been accused that I don't ask my students questions
and listen to their questions and answer them. The virtual environment has seemed
to have changed my personality. Someone made a comment the other day that I'm
a much warmer being in the virtual environment than I am live, which I think is ra-
ther cute. But I'm certainly much more open to questions, I notice that myself,

which is not really my style. You all know that I'm a lecturer. But again, don't be
uncomfortable with asking questions. It really is important that if there is something
you don't understand, you make sure that you understand.
Duality of Choicelessness
Question: Ra, I have a question. You had said earlier that this selection process is
based on the ability to discern what's going to be correct for your client. You're not
going to try to educate them, teach them Human Design or be a kind of soothsayer,
fortuneteller. In that role of being an anti-soothsayer, you want them to learn how
to respond from their inner Authority with correct decision making process. And yet,
part of it is there is no choice. That is the paradoxical nature of Human Design that I
am still trying to work with the understanding of how do you reconcile no choice in
teaching people how to move with their inner Authority to make correct decisions.
Ra: It's a wonderful question. It is the great duality of all of this. It is choiceless.
It's deeply choiceless. As a matter of fact, whether they're going to do this or that,
or get to this or that, in fact, that is what it is. However, we are in a movie and it's a
maya movie. In the maya movie, it looks like we have all these choices. We have to
play out the game.
Basically, what we're doing when we align somebody to their inner Authority is that
we take them out of the choice game of the mind. The choice game of the mind is
very different than the decision making of the actual Authority. The choice-making
of the mind is caught up with all of the rules of the maya and with all of the illusions
of the maya. What we're trying to do is guide them to a place where they have no
idea how the decision or the discernment process actually works.
But whether they get to that point or not, yes, it's true, it's choiceless. My assump-
tion is that whenever I'm working with anyone or teaching anyone or doing a reading
for somebody, what I look at is that they are helpless in being here. I'm helpless in
being here doing this, and you're helpless in being there receiving it. And yet, at the
same time, in the maya we come up with all of these reasons, we come up with all of
these concepts about why we are all here. My assumption is that if somebody comes
to you for a reading that the fractal is right. The fact that you can elaborate on that
and open that up in terms of what is their choiceless, their relationship to you in that
fractal, it is something that can align them to what is already happening. It's so ob-
vious.
It's very clear to me that Human Design, at its mundane level, is here to be a part of
the maya. It is the mechanics of the maya. It's helping align beings to what will re-
duce pressure in their lives and make their lives easier and something more comfort-
able to live with. But at a deeper level, it's very difficult. It's one of those deep,
deep ironic situations for somebody like me and I don't shy away from saying it, but
what to do? On one side I teach that there is a way to get to being correct. And on
the other side it's all choiceless anyway. Those who get to the correctness, this is
the line of geometry that was laid out.

Solar Return
But we don't live that way. We don't see that way. Like a man who breaks his head
through the sky, you can't stay there. If you stay there, somebody will come up be-
hind you and you'll be in trouble. You just can't stay there. You don't see any more.
So in the illusion we do the best we can to make the illusion work well for others.
After all, we're adjusting the way in which they operate within the maya, whether or
not there is a true satori in all of that. It's very hard for me to work that all out.
I have enormous respect for my students because they have done what I did not do.
I didn't learn Human Design in that sense. It was done to me. The whole awakening
process and all of these things was an event. Everything since then has been a way
to understand the nature of the input. Clearly there is this deep binary of what exis-
tence is. Within the maya to tell somebody that operating correctly means honoring
their Authority and their Strategy will help them in the maya to live a life of less re-
sistance. Whether or not they can ever grasp that that was there for them anyway is
another story.
But it's like anyone I have ever done a reading for. I could never see that just be-
cause they came to me that they were going to be awake. It is the irony of all of
this. What I like, what I enjoy, is that because the knowledge provides us with such
a deep understanding of the mechanics, we can help people and we can make a dif-
ference in their lives that nothing else can actually do. And that there is a way to
align human consciousness to a form that operates correctly. But it doesn't mean
that the consciousness is liberated. It doesn't mean the consciousness awakens. It
simply means that the form can live in this life correctly.
I'm the Mother's son. I'm here for the form. If, as a by-product to the correctness
of the form, there is a transformation in the spirit, then that's a bonus. But the work
of Design is the work of the form principle. We're just trying to align consciousness
to the right kind of form. We're trying to teach the Personality consciousness how to
surrender to the form. Perhaps then the Personality can be reached at a deeper lev-
el. It's a good question, though. I like it.
Differentiation between the Design and the Personality
Question: Ra, I have a question in terms of the Solar Return. The red and the
black on the chart just all becomes green. So does that mean there's no differentia-
tion between the Design and the Personality in terms of how you look at it?
Ra: There is. Again, if you get into the nuance—I don't mean to start anything
burning here, but if you really want to be able to look at somebody's Rave Return—
you'll have more success dealing at the Color level in terms of what the underlying
motivational forces are going to be and what health forces are going to impact on
the vehicle. There are so many nuances of information that are possible. Yes, ob-
viously, there is a difference between the way in which the unconscious and con-
scious works in terms of the Solar.

Where it makes a difference is where you have the conscious to conscious connec-
tions, or the unconscious to unconscious definitions. But even in that sense it really
is subtle and the only way in which that is really something worthy of explanation is
with somebody who is really not only operating correctly themselves but has gone
through the experience.
One of the most interesting things about returns, they're fascinating to look back.
Some of the most interesting things I have learned about myself is being able to
have memories of certain periods in my life and being able to see them within the
context of the return and to understand the forces and the pressures that were
there. But in terms of subtleties, there are so many nuances to this.
Again, for me these kinds of readings, I don't see readings as anything even remote-
ly close to education. For me, a reading is a kind of surface service and it's very
much on the surface. The real responsibility is aligning the client to operating cor-
rectly. That's the real responsibility. What I'm interested in any of these readings—
when I do somebody's cycle analysis, I spend maybe 10 or 15% of the reading on
the actual cycle. The rest of it is about them. Because I know damn well they're not
living their design. I know that they need to have why it's important to experiment
with their Authority so their form works properly. It's all about the form principle.
So for me, I don't want to get into all of these endless nuances because I think in the
end, it just adds to the confusion. I think it's very important to look at the surface.
To see the surface, in and of itself, only represents the possibilities that are there
and for the individual to understand that their selection process is one that they de-
termine. It makes them feel good to think that way, that they determine through
their inner Authority.
Jung's Education in Intimacy
Question: So, on the surface can
you just tell this person that this
year you're going to have a real
education in what it means to be in-
timate with people? Is that some-
thing you can just tell them flat out?
Ra: Yes, you could tell them flat
out, but you're going to tell him that
he's going to learn about intimacy
because the fact of the matter is, if
you look at the line, you're going to
see that intimacy is something that's
going to be rejected, that he's going
to have to deal with rejected intimacy. He is going to have to deal with problems in
intimacy.

But at the same time, you're also saying to him, by the way, you don't have to get
caught in that. It's there. So problems with intimacy are going to be around. You
can see his counterpoint in the part of him that is Ego dominated, what the 44
brings, which is this need to have some kind of harmony with others. That it is
through the harmony that things are going to work. And then at the same time, you
have to fight alone pressure that's there.
So you have a very basic dynamic at work. And then you have the 2nd lines in both
the 6 and in the 59. And the 59 is the Moon. The Moon is always a very strong
presence as a being. So this is difficulty in intimacy and that, yes, you can say to
him that difficulty with intimacy is going to be around you this year. It is either
going to touch you personally or not depending on what you enter into and who
you're dealing with.
Shifting of the Nodes
Question: Now, in terms of the Nodes, the South and North Nodes, is it broken
down in half a year so the South Node is the first half, the North Node is the second
half?
Ra: As I mentioned earlier, it is not about being so rigid, but it is understanding that
it is a general movement from the south to the north. But again, realize that they
are mirrors of each other. So there are aspects of doubt that are confusion, and as-
pects of confusion that are doubt. In other words, it is a moving process. But it's
not as rigid as one would like: Ok, this is going to last exactly six months. No, it is
one stream of information but the tendency, the dynamic, is to move from the south
to the north.
The shift is somewhere around the middle of the time frame. By the way, that does
not work when you're talking about long-term cycles like the ones that we're going
to begin looking at tomorrow when you're looking at Saturns or oppositions of Ura-
nus or Kiron. It only really is something you can work with within the dynamic of a
Rave Return. But even then, it really is just to see it as a movement. And as a
movement, is going to have aspects from both sides at any given time. But it is a
general movement.
Question: But would it be safe to say that, for example, they probably would have
more issues of intimacy in the second half of the year?
Ra: Absolutely. There's no question. In the same way that doubt is going to en-
gender more crisis than confusion will, if you know what I mean. In other words,
yes, you can use that within that context. But again, it's not saying that there won't
be aspects of the other side of the Nodal force that aren't there in the beginning of
the process because of the fact that these are mirrors. The thing that makes opposi-
tion so fascinating is that this energy is flowing back and forth in both directions so
there is this cross-fertilization of information. It's one large set. But yes, there is
that general trend.

Could the Moon Represent an Actual Person?
Question: Pardon me for dominating here, but I have a question in terms of just
the keynotes. Let's say for example this 59/6 which is about being educated in inti-
macy. In this case, the barriers of that. The 59 is the Moon, so that's about people.
So could that be somebody who literally comes and is an educational force in terms
of intimacy issues, like a real person?
Ra: Yes, absolutely. The moment you're looking at the inner planets in this kind of
configuration, you're looking at people. You're looking at people who are going to
bring different qualities whether it's the Lunar or the Mercurial, whatever those quali-
ties happen to be. But they tend to be embodied in actual people. So yes, it is
somebody.
But the story is more complex in this Solar Return because, of course, in 1960 you
had Pluto in the 59th gate. So, you do have the 4th line and the 5th line there from
the Pluto, so you have a real complexity in terms of the way in which the intimacy is
going to operate. The real dynamic is that you have this resonance between the
59.2 and the 6.2. And of course, this pulls it into the whole environment. In other
words, intimacy and the problems with intimacy are going to be very much around in
the second half of the year, or that part of the year and working towards that part of
the year. That's going to be much more powerful, but it's also going to have this
Plutonic undertone.
So, it's more complex than just the person in the 59.2. The Pluto is out there as a
Developmental force. And all of that together is strictly Educational. So it doesn't
even have to be a person that you really have—let's take for example that it's a
nurse. Do you know what I mean? In other words, he's an old man and he's dying
and he's sick and let's say that it's a nurse. It's a different kind of intimacy. It's not
necessarily the kind of intimacy that one would imagine at first. Ah, the 59/6, you're
going to have a lover, you're going to make children. That intimacy can operate at
many levels, and particularly in this way where it's really in the background because
it's Educational. After all, it's a Dominance.
What about Splits?
Question: What about splits? For example, could you say to him you're really
going to be cut off from the doubts in your life because it is a split?
Ra: Yeah, well, he is going to be cut off from it in a way, but that just means there
is just going to be all this pressure from it. And again, because it is the 64-63 and
because that is the Personality Nodal environment, he's not going to be able to es-
cape it at all. He's just not going to be able to do anything about it.

In other words, he's not going to be able to use his mind, the way he was born with
this incredible openness that has no judgmentation whatsoever. He's going to get
locked into the problems of doubt. So in fact, he may end up with a great deal of
self-doubt and have no way to resolve it or express it because thematically, it is cut
off.
Ok, it's been a pleasure. Tomorrow we're going to take a look at long-term cycles
and we're going to look at the three variations. I'm going to give you basic tech-
niques in dealing with them. I hope you enjoyed it. I certainly enjoyed myself. For
me it's been a nice evening. I hope wherever you are that you have a good day or
night and I will see you tomorrow. Bye now.

Long-Term Cycle Analysis: Part 1
The Triple-Split Projector: Malcolm X and Karl Marx
There were many of you who sent me suggestions and charts for our Projector. As I
wrote to you in the email, it's amazing that there are 145 million triple-split Projec-
tors. Just the idea that there are 145 million triple-split Projectors is really some-
thing to give you pause and to think about it. I do love, by the way, the statistics in
Design. It has taken so many years to finally get to a point where we have the kind
of statistics that not only are informing, but they're also quite inspiring.
Weather Conditioning: Themes No Value for Long-Term Cycles
You can see that tonight we're beginning with Malcolm X. I'm going to take at look
at the themes that we're going to use in doing long-term cycle analysis. I want to
take you away from the themes
that we have been looking at
when dealing with the Rave Re-
turn alone. Remember that the
Rave Return is by far the most
complex because you really get
into the weather conditioning
themes.
Something to understand is
that, as a whole, these weather
conditioning themes have no
value the moment you step into
either the Saturn or the Uranus
or the Kiron. In other words,
they are really specific in their
value to doing analysis for the
Rave Return. Remember, the
Rave Return is really so important. It's much more important for the average client
than any other kind of reading. But obviously, there is also value in any kind of
reading, for that matter.

Maintain the Weather Impacting Themes
One of the things I want you to stay with, though, are the weather impacting
themes. When we're talking about the weather impacting themes, what we're talk-
ing about are these themes of Dominance, which is Educational, and the Electro-
magnetic and the Compromise which is Personal. These are the themes that are
going to be important for us to take a look at when we want to see the nuances that
are going to be there.

Difference between the Triple-Split and the Split
However, before we get into all of that, and obviously there is a lot for us to look at
today, I want to begin with the theme of how different the triple-split is from the
split. Statistically, when we're dealing with split definitions, they're 45% of the
population. So the dynamic we were looking at yesterday, the dynamic of the deep
conditioning impact of the bridging gates, how important that is to be able to under-
stand the not-self.
However, when we're dealing with the triple-split, we're dealing with a different phe-
nomenon. It's a very different phenomenon. To begin with statistically, they're ap-
proximately 11% of the population. So, it's not like there are not many of them.
That's about 660 million of them, just to be able to keep that in perspective. After
all, we have a planet of 6 billion plus human beings.

LECTURE THREE
Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
So, when you're thinking about the triple-split, despite the fact that you're looking at
what appears to be a small number statistically, they are not. It means that, techni-
cally, in terms of your work, obviously you're going to meet a lot of them. It's very
important to understand something fundamental about them. Where the split defini-
tion is addicted to its wholeness or the potential of wholeness in the sense that the
harmonic gates that will link the splits becomes the deepest conditioning source in
their lives, when you're dealing with a triple-split the last thing they want is to be
whole. Now, that's very different.
In other words, they do not—and when I say the last thing ―they want is to be
whole,‖ it's not like this is a conscious whatever you want to call it. It's not like
they're processing that. What it really means is that they have a very different tim-
ing system. And their timing system is not blamed on anything.
Let me back step for you and see if I can make that clearer. Let's take a look at the
split definition. If you're looking at the simple-split definition, everything for them is
conditioned by the bridge—the potential in their life—in terms of the way in which
their not-self operates. And the timing is always established by other forces, the
timing that is going to be established by the planets moving into a certain gate, a
line, at a certain time, or somebody stepping into their life at a certain moment that
carries that energy.
Triple-Split's Timing is about Movement in Space
But the moment you're looking at the triple-split, the triple-split does not require nor
do they want the other to establish their timing. Their timing is different. The real
dilemma for the triple-split is that, like all characteristics, they're all conditioned to
the Manifestor process. And as such, there is an inherent inferiority that is always a
potential in triple-splits because of the speed at which they feel they should be acting
at and they're not. The basic process of the triple-split is that they have a timing,
but their timing is about their movement in space.
Malcolm X's Natal Chart
Think about it this way. You're this particular configuration and again, I'm not refer-
ring specifically to Malcolm X, but let's take a look at this [see his chart on the next
page]. Here you have somebody whose Authority is emotional Authority. And you
have emotional Authority that is operating an emotional system in which the entry
point to the definition is unconscious. It means there is very little access to that.
[Birth Data for this lecture: May 19, 1925, 22:25, Omaha, Nebraska USA]
Now, let's imagine a decision making process for this being, despite the fact that we
talk about the time that's required when we're dealing with the emotional system, in
many ways these are the most Einsteinian people in that they are time/space people.
That is, in this reference to the emotional ones. Basically what I'm saying is that a

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
triple-split does not seek conditioned bridging. But what it does is as it moves
through its life process, it gets temporary bridges that carry no heavy conditioning
qualities to it.
Triple-Splits and the Public Aura
In other words, it's easier for a triple-split to process something by spending the
morning shopping and simply moving through auras that will do the bridging without
the aura being a person they know telling them something. In other words, to take
advantage of the aura of the environment. You will see that when you're dealing
with triple-splits, they're very connected to their Nodal neighborhood. In other
words, the potential of their neighborhood is the potential of how their splits are lit-
erally going to be impacted, how that timing process, which is very much their own,
is going to operate.
Think about something. It's one of my basic teachings—it's not mine, it's just simple
physics that everything is moving. The reality is that this is all about fractal lines.
Think about the triple-split that doesn't operate correctly. If you don't operate cor-
rectly, you don't operate along the line of geometry that will provide you with the
least resistance. What it does mean is that you're not ending up with being in an
environment that is conductive for you to be able to process what you need to
process.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Triple-splits take their time. They have to take their time. It's one of the keys. But
it's not the same thing as being emotional despite the fact we have an emotional
chart here. It's about recognizing that movement is an essential quality in their life.
Now, many of the things I want to share with you tonight about triple-splits are
things I have not discussed. These are things that I have been watching now for a
number of years. It has been a very interesting process to see the—when I first be-
gan teaching about splits and doing readings for people with split definitions, I did
not differentiate very much between the split and the triple-split. One of the com-
mon things I would tell splits was how important it was for them to go out and take
advantage of the public aura.
Particularly if you're a split definition, you can see that the simple-split can be so
easily dominated by a single being, or any single being at a given time. That single
being acting as the fixing bridge that brings about the wholeness that the simple-
split seeks. Now, I would advise them to go out into public because it wouldn't have
the same hold over them. They would have a chance to process the potential of
their wholeness, to deal with the inconsistency that's driving their not-self mind
without that being something they're stuck with. They can walk out of the restau-
rant; they can walk out of the café, whatever the case may be.
I gave that advice across the line. But the reality is that for the triple-split, the pub-
lic aura, the world itself, is something that is so essential for them. One of the
things that I began to see in terms of my own analysis of triple-splits, of the triple-
splits I have personally in my life who I get to see on a regular basis and I get to
watch the movie with, my perspective is that I began to see the pressure on them to
be out in the physical world in the sense that they really need to be mobile in their
life process. They need to integrate in their life process. They need to live a great
deal of their life in an open and public realm.
The moment they do that, there is this transformation that takes place in them. It is
a process that's fascinating. The whole key is that if you're operating according to
your Strategy and your Authority as a triple-split, what you're doing is perfecting
your geometry. It is that very geometry, that movement through the geometry that
is the only process that's really healthy.
The Triple-Split is Here to Experience its Diverse Potential
For example, triple-splits are not comfortable with a partner who hooks them all up.
They're not. You take a simple-split definition and you give them their partner,
that's it, everything is fine. Everything is fine unless there are problems in the rela-
tionship that arise and so forth. That's fine in and of itself. But the moment you
take a triple-split and put them into a relationship—don't put them into a 9 and 0—
this is not paradise for them. This is not heaven. No triple-split is looking for a
prince or princess charming. The concept of it is frightening, because the moment
that it's there, it is very uncomfortable because the triple-split is not here to find its
wholeness. It's here to experience its diverse potential.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

Each of these areas become in many ways their own life, each of them most isolated
in their process. And yet, through the continuity of movement—this is the thing
that's so interesting—they get integrated together. It is about as magical a process
as you're going to find in any of the descriptions I give.
So, it's fascinating to think about the nature of the triple-split and begin to see the
way in which the direction we offer them, this direction is not about ―You’re here to
hook all that up.‖ You're not. And it goes back to the basic rule of Human Design:
you operate correctly as yourself. You operate correctly as yourself, you align your
geometry, you will naturally move in space. And in that natural movement, you're
going to find the continuity you need between the aspects of your nature.
By the way, think about it this way. If you're a simple-split and you're bridged,
you're forced—the two parts of the split—to deal with each other. You're forced. Not
only forced to deal with each other, but forced to become something that's greater
than what those two things alone are. When you're a triple-split, you don't have to
go through that.
Malcolm's emotional system does not have to like what the identity says. What his
identity says isn't necessarily what is inspiring him conceptually. And they don't all
have to get along. They don't have to be permanently bridged in any way through a
relationship. All this being needs to do is operate correctly out their emotional Au-
thority and there will be this—I'm not a triple-split so I can only speak technically.
What it brings is what I see
more like the making of a
necklace, the stringing of
beads. The beads are very
different from each other.
But the moment you string
them together there is a
continuity to them being jux-
taposed. There is something
that happens. And there is
an inherent communication
between them.
This is what's really happen-
ing. If you can see the
triple-split moving in space
and you can see it the way
the kind of blur cartoon cha-
racters so they show you
what they look like going fast and you have this whole blur going behind them.
What you would really see as the triple-split as it moves is that this blur is actually
what's bringing everything together. In that blur, they make contact with each other
and it's fleeting.

LECTURE THREE
Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Triple-Split Dilemma: Getting Locked into Wholeness
The real dilemmas for triple-splits are when they get locked into wholeness relation-
ships. One of the things, though this isn't the subject matter for this course, but it is
something to keep in mind about triple-splits is that they're often much better off
when only two of their three aspects are actually linked by somebody who is fixed in
their lives. It's a lot easier for them.
Remember, they're really very different from the simple-split. They're not here
seeking the bridges. That means when you're looking at the interpretation of their
not-self, you're not going to go to these gates, whether they are harmonic gates or
whole channels. For example, here you can see that to bridge the Throat/identity
with the emotional Root, the 12 or the 35 will do that. But you can also see that be-
tween the Ajna Center and the Throat there are no channels, no gate activations
whatsoever.
Remember the psychology of those things. It doesn't mean that this triple-split
won't think that without the 12 or the 35 there isn't something missing in their life.
They will. It's normal. It's just conditioning. But it also means that when it comes
to the way people think, this is a person who thinks everybody else has a problem.
When it comes to the way in which people express their thoughts, this is somebody
who thinks that everybody else has a problem, not them.
Return to the Open Centers Conditioning
This is the fact, to bridge that split
you would require a whole channel to
be put into place. And this brings a
different relationship to it being miss-
ing. The real key here is that you re-
turn—it's very similar to the single de-
finition—to the basic core of not-self
conditioning which is the open Cen-
ters. You can see here is somebody
with the open Ego who needed to
prove themselves. This is somebody
with an open Spleen, very insecure,
very concerned about their survival.
He was assassinated, so I guess he
had something to worry about. But
dealing with the open splenic system,
you're dealing with holding on to
things that aren’t good for them. Of course, not knowing when enough is enough in
terms of the open Sacral Center.

79
LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
You can see here is somebody who will hold on to something that is not good for
them. By the way, think about that within the context of Malcolm X. That holding
on to something that isn't good for you, well, may people consider him a hero for
that. The Spleen is only concerned about your health, it's not concerned about your
politics. So if you take the stance that your Spleen knows ―it‖ is going to kill you and
you hold on to it, so it goes. In other words, here was somebody who to prove him-
self would not know when enough is enough and would hold on to the very thing that
could end up hurting him because that's simply the way his not-self mind was driven.
So, when you're dealing with the basic conditioning, the basic way the not-self oper-
ates, you're going to use the same technique you would use with a single definition.
You’re going to look at the open Centers.
I hope in understanding the fact that the triple-split does not seek—remember that
this is all genetic. In other words, it's not an advantage to the triple-split definition
to be locked in, because the moment they're locked in they don't get what they're
here for. They're here for a diverse way in which their aspects are connected. In
other words, they're really designed to have those bridges done by strangers.
They're samplers in a way. This is their great educational field. This is where they
really learn in this life. The moment they have those forces in their life that are fix-
ing it, obviously that brings a limitation. And the limitation is that they don't get to
process in a very, very open and very indiscriminate way the bridgings between their
various aspects.
Focus on Profile, the Cross and the Nodes
I talked about how when you move away from the Rave Return and you begin to go
into deeper cycles, the Nodal configuration is something that takes on enormous im-
portance. Now, before I get into that, there are two things you have to focus on
when you're looking at some-
body's larger cycle. Again, just
referring to any of these cycles,
please recognize that there is ab-
solutely no difference between
doing a Saturn, Uranus or a Kiron
other than when it's recommend-
ed, you do it for people in their
lives. I'll talk about that later.
But the fact is that the technique
for the analysis is precisely the
same.
So, here looking at the Saturn,
the only thing that changes, by
the way, is simply the fact that you're dealing with a different time frame and you're
dealing with it through a different perspective. But the fact is that the basic tech-

80
LECTURE THREE
Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
nique is the same. And the technique is rooted in the Profile, that is, the Cross, the
Profile and the Nodes. If you can clearly see the thematic through the Cross, Profile
and the Nodes, then you're going to be able to clearly lay out the pattern that's
going to be there in the return.
Angle Tells How the Cycle Process Unfolds
There are things to consider, by the way, when you're looking at long-term
processes. One of the things to recognize about long-term processes is Angle is
going to tell you a lot about the way in which the cycle is going to unfold. For exam-
ple, here you're dealing with somebody who is a Left Angle. It's interesting that this
is the Left Angle Cross of Uncertainty. If, for example, you have a Left Angle that
gets a Right Angle return, you know there is going to be a real limitation on being
helped by allies in that cycle.
If you get a Right Angle that has a Left Angle return, there is a lot of potential that
there are forces that are going to come to their aid, but they never expect it. If
you're Right going Right, then you're staying within your thematic. The same is with
Left with Left. But again, it's something to consider in terms of looking at the larger
cycle as a whole. We're going to focus on these two themes. In other words, we're
going to focus on the Profile and we're going to focus on the Nodes.
Malcolm X’s Saturn Return Chart
Cycle Returns are about Purpose
You notice that this is very, very different from the Rave Return. We're not really
paying attention in the Rave Return to the Sun/Earth. Yes, it's obvious, we're not
really paying attention to it be-
cause it's always consistent.
It's just consistent. So the mo-
ment you move over here into
the cycle, the Cross configura-
tion, the Sun/Earth configura-
tions, are normally different.
There are those times you might
get the same Cross in a differ-
ent way. You might get the
same thing, it does happen. But
generally speaking, it's differ-
ent.
Because we're focusing on the
Sun/Earth and the Profile, what we're getting to is something that is very different
from the Rave Return. The Rave Return is about characteristics. Cycles are about

purpose. This is the fundamental difference in the analysis. The analysis for a Rave
Return, because we're dealing with characteristics, is that you're aligning somebody
constantly to what their Strategy and Authority is because they have to deal with the
characteristics. If they do not transcend the characteristics, they're not going to get
to their purpose. Their purpose is given no challenge and it remains the same. That
is, it's the same Profile, it's the same Cross.
Here, the moment you move into a cycle, what you have is the accent on the pur-
pose. Now, this has always been my dilemma with doing a cycle reading. What's
the point of telling somebody about the potential for them to work on their purpose
program if they haven't dealt with their characteristics? This is one of the most diffi-
cult things. If you're not operating correctly as yourself, a cycle return is, in many
ways, like the child with his nose to the glass window of a candy shop. You're not
going to get to it and it's going to be very painful not to be able to get to it.
Laying Out a Long-Term Process for the Fulfillment of Purpose
After all, the whole point about cycle analysis is that you're laying out a long-term
process for the fulfillment of your purpose and it's how you fulfill your purpose. It's
not what happens to your characteristics. It is extremely rare. When I'm looking at
somebody's cycle analysis I'm only concerned with, ―Look, this is the role that you
have to develop. This is a theme that you have to learn. And here's the environ-
ment you have to learn it in. You're only going to do a good job if you're operating
correctly as yourself.” I'm not getting into the nuance.
Anybody who really wants nuance in Human Design should get an education from
the qualified teachers that teach Human Design in the various programs that are
available. It's always so important to differentiate between the responsibility of be-
ing a teacher and an educator and the responsibility of being a professional analyst.
The professional analyst is providing a
very precise service. And the service
for somebody in terms of any cycle
analysis is truly limited to your ability
to be able to lay out the role, the learn-
ing process, the way purpose can be
achieved in that cycle and the envi-
ronment that acts as the stage upon
which it can be achieved.
In this way you really lay out what the
general frame of the cycle is. And
again, place back into the hands of
your client the essential truth. All we
can do is describe the general pattern.
Only you can live the differentiated life.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
That's the truth. It's like what I mentioned earlier about this extraordinary graphic
drawing of Mary Ann Winiger's [previous page]. You can see so clearly this incredi-
ble diversity that is there. Yes, we can read the pattern. Yes, you can say that you
have the 41st gate. Well, that's interesting. But there are 1,096 variations of that
gate. That's really something to think about. When you say to somebody, ―Oh I
have that, too,‖ do you really?
So what we can do is lay out the pattern. Here's the pattern. This is what the cycle
is going to present you. But in laying out the pattern then the beauty is, “But look,
this is not determined. It's not. If your form is correct, if you're operating correctly
then you're going to get a very, very specific differentiated experience out of that
pattern.”
Of course, here in this configuration, because I've been dealing with different types
every day, in dealing with a triple-split, how important it is for them to see that this
cycle is truly a physi-
cal journey. It's
what makes them so
interesting as beings.
They're very physical
beings. And the
journey is so impor-
tant for them. The
cycle is a journey.
The fact of the mat-
ter is, like anyone, if
you're going to go
from A to B and you
don't have a map,
you're going to waste
a lot of time, energy,
fuel, all of those
things. It's a guide.
It says this is the environment and this is the role that this environment is going to
teach you about. It's out of that learning process that you expand, that you develop
your potential as a being.
At a mystical level, any cycle analysis is really something very beautiful. The mo-
ment you can lay out what is the pattern is the moment you provide a human being
with what I call signposts and signposts are everything. We constantly need affirma-
tion. It's not enough that there may be someone in your life, or others who can af-
firm what they see in your process, but how important it is for you to have these
signposts along the way that say, ―I am doing just fine. This is working the way it's
supposed to work.‖ And the beauty of a cycle is that it opens up that frame.

Learn the Cycle Profile, Not Become the Profile
What you want to be able to see is the neighborhood, the environment you're de-
scribing. Because this is what's going to give them a sense of "I don't have a map,
but I know I'm in the right place now. I know this is the right environment." It's the
environment and then for them to begin—when you have a cycle Profile, it's not like
you become that. That's not what it's about. But you learn that. You have to learn
that, because if you don't learn that, you're not going to do well in that environment.
So, slowly but surely, if you're operating correctly, that's what you get to see. You
get to learn that. The interesting thing about it is that in recognizing it and in sur-
rendering to it, you get to see what that cycle and what that phase in your life is all
about. My Kiron is the Right Angle Cross of Contagion. It's a 2/4 Profile. So here I
am, the virtual opportunistic hermit learning how to deal with this role, because it's a
role. I'm still a 5/1 Clarion. But I'm a 5/1 Clarion, because of the neighborhood this
cycle has brought me and it's the final major cycle of my life, it’s my learning how to
take on the skills and the possibilities of another role in order to be able to succeed
within my own purpose, which is that of a Clarion.
It becomes something that is very beautiful. I've been watching my Kiron at work
now for six years. It's fascinating. It's just fascinating, because once you have a
glimpse of what the environment is and you see what the demand is in terms of
what you must learn, it's something you have to learn. It is a role you have to take
on, in one way or another, as a skill watching how that happens. You can't just go
out and do it because you don't know the framework for it.
I did not know, I truly did not know at the time of my Kiron how I would take on that
role, how I would take on that costume of the 2/4, how that would impact my life, or
how that would change the way I operate as a Clarion. It's a fascinating thing to
see. And all of a sudden I noticed, as an example, that when I've gone into this
hermit opportunistic role, I also end up, instead of being a 1 unconsciously as a the-
matic, my 1 is learning how to be a 4. Great Ra, you have all this depth, but learn
how to be nice and friendly. It's just all there. And it's magical.
So, I don’t want you to get bogged down in this gate and that gate and oh look there
is this bridge here and that bridge there and this thing and that thing. Yeah, later,
maybe, if you have clients who want more depth and you want to go deeper into it,
maybe sometime down the road as they start moving through the process there are
opportunities, or they do become students and they can dig into these things them-
selves. But the responsibility is very, very fixed and it will make your work much
easier. When your work is easier, you're going to be more effective. You're going to
be less burdened by all the detail and you're going to be able to get down to the nit-
ty-gritty which is the Profile and the Cross and the Nodes.

LECTURE THREE
Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Malcolm X's Right Angle Cross of Maya
I want to begin by taking a look at the Cross and looking at the Profile and discuss-
ing that. Remember something. It's very important to understand that Malcolm is
always going to be a 5/1 and nothing is going to stop him from being a 5/1. He's
always going to be the on Cross of Uncertainty. But remember, what the cycle is
going to point out is how that uncertainty, what depth it needs, what it needs to add
to enrich its own process and its own potential purpose, what is the frame upon
which what it has to go through. In that sense what we're looking at is the Cross of
Maya. That is, the 32/42/62/61. This is a Right Angle configuration.
Remember, here is somebody who is a Left Angle who is going to go into a Right An-
gle phase. The first thing you know about that is that in going in that Right Angle
phase, there are not going to be those allies there to help him. It's the first thing to
understand. It's a cycle where he's really going to have to be on his own because
he's not going to get the assistance that he would expect as a 5/1.
Think about this. He was assassinated before his Uranus Opposition. So basically,
this was the major cycle and the major pattern for him from the point of his Saturn
Return in October, 1954, until his death. He was 29 years old when this particular
return was done. So think about the fact that here he was entering into what was
going to be a very powerful stage in his life, but it was the Cross of Maya. He was
going to have to deal with illusion and deal with illusion in a very deep way. He was
going to have to deal with the world. He was going to deal in the world.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

Remember as a triple-split, there's nothing wrong with that. That is, nothing wrong
with being called out into the world and here was somebody who was going to do a
lot of moving around. You can see that in the theme that connects the Solar Plexus
Center to the Throat is the 35, so you have the channel Transitoriness and the chan-
nel of Change. In other words, there is going to be this movement. The 11/56 is
there. Whenever you see the 56 show up in a cycle chart, you know that there is
going to be the need for movement one way or another. It is the Wanderer, after
all.
The 2/4 Theme
But we're dealing with a 2/4 theme. In other words, we're dealing with the theme of
the hermit opportunist. Now, there are some advantages in this. You can see that
there is a harmony between his natal Personality, the 5th lines, and the 2nd line Per-
sonality of the cycle. The same thing is true for the 1 to the 4. So there is a natural
movement. But you can see that the Personality is going to be more withdrawn dur-
ing this cycle theme
and the emphasis is
going to be on the
unconscious. In oth-
er words, the un-
conscious is what's
going to be calling
him. His form is
what's going to be
calling to others.
So the first thing we
have to see is that if
we're looking at this
maya and we're see-
ing the maya from
the 2/4, we have to
realize that he is
going to be called in
this period in his life, there is opportunity he is going to be called to. In other words,
if you're just going to be doing a simple surface and you're going to look at this Sa-
turn cycle, what you're really saying to somebody is that the next whatever—I look
at the Saturn cycle as something that stands on its own. In many ways, the amount
of time that this Saturn cycle will take will be another complete Saturn return until
the second Saturn return which is slightly beyond when the Kiron is.
In other words, this is a cycle that's going to bridge the Uranus Opposition; this is a
cycle that's going to beyond the Kiron. This is an underlying Saturnian theme. In
looking at this and being clear about it, for this whole period, and it's a long period,
and of course it will begin to change at the Uranus, because we're dealing with a
fundamental prana in the life. So it's going to begin to lose its power as an influen-

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
cing theme the moment you get to the Uranus Opposition because the prana goes
from taking in to going out. Then of course, it's really going to fall into the back-
ground with the Kiron. But nonetheless, the whole material direction, the whole Sa-
turnian direction is something that is very, very significant.
The Timing of a Saturn Return: Mid-Thirties
Now, I have a dilemma with the Saturn. I've had many people close to me and I
have refused to do their Saturns when they got to their return. I think the timing of
a Saturn is something that is very important. And I don't think that a Saturn Return
should be given until you have somebody who is at least into or close to the middle
of their 30s. In other words, this return is of much greater value once somebody has
actually gotten into it.
It's not like you're going to help them by telling them about it before their Saturn
Return. It's not like it's going to give them any advantage. In fact, I think that it's a
disadvantage. My concern with anyone who is reaching the age of a Saturn Return is
that they're focused deeply on their own process, that they're just focused on their
process of following their Strategy and honoring their inner Authority.
The advantage of doing the Saturn Return three or four years after the actual date is
that they can begin to sense the dynamics you're going to talk about. And that's
very important. It's very important for them because they're young, after all. It is
very important for them to not just see this as a kind of, ―You're 28 years old and
you get your Saturn and you get told about all this stuff. You're still dealing with the
closing of the Saturnian cycle; you're not ready to really understand what kind of
transition can take place because you don't really understand what's actually going
to happen to you.‖
Theme of Optimism
I think it's much more important—everybody who goes through their Saturn who's
had any kind of introduction to Human Design is always surprised how powerful it is
to go across that Saturnian line. It's very powerful. Obviously much more so for 6th
line Profile beings and they are a special case where the Saturn Return is something
very important for them to look at because it is the theme of optimism. I want you
to grasp that about the Saturn because for me, when I do somebody's Saturn Re-
turn, I do not do darkness, I do light.
The whole thing about the 6th line being is that the 6th line being is demonstrating to
us in the flesh the mutation of the life span and the quality of life and the way in
which the program of life operates. We know that we have now entered into a time
in which life is truly a tripartite process. And though it is specific to the 6th line that
they will intensely experience the pessimism of the first Saturn cycle, the optimism

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
of the second cycle, the fact of the matter, is that it impacts everyone. We're all in
the same neutrino ocean; we're all taking in the information.
Saturn Return is the Necessary Optimism to Realign the Life
And for me when I look at somebody's Saturn Return, what I see in the cycle is
through not so much rose-colored glasses, but I see it as the necessary optimism to
realign the life. And I think the reason for me that I like to wait until they get close
to their mid-thirties is that they're not going to accept the optimism unless they've
had some time to get over the first cycle. Again, whether you're a 6th line being or
not, this is quite a line to cross and one way or another you have to deal with the
consequences of that shift. It is often difficult.
For most human beings, the first 29 years are the most difficult. And if you go back,
if you ask all kinds of human beings in a survey, "Would you like to go back and do
that cycle again?" invariably the answer is, "No, I don't want to have anything to do
with it." I certainly don't ever want to be in my 20s again. I don't want to go
through all of that. So, we have to recognize that the enthusiasm of somebody—and
it's always a pleasure for me when young people are connected to Human Design,
this is the future. I know that it can be very uncomfortable.
I denied my own daughter. I didn't give someone else his Saturn for the same rea-
son. I don't agree with that because I see very clearly that it takes time to recover
from the return itself and for many people, because human beings are not very
aware, I guess that's not a surprise, for most human beings they don't even know
they've had a crisis. They don't even know that they've crossed from this to that.
And they don't even recognize at any level that they're actually in recovery mode.
Purpose is Perfection
So, when I do a Saturn, what I'm trying to offer is, "Here are the possibilities for
you," in the most light because if you're going to do somebody's Rave Return every-
thing is a negative. It really is; all of it, because if you're not operating correctly,
everything is a problem. The moment you go to a cycle, because you're dealing with
long-term themes of purpose, purpose is perfection. Purpose is about as optimistic
as one can get. It's very important simply to align them to the potential of the ful-
fillment of that purpose in the cycle, and to align them in the sense that there is a
necessary optimism.
Signposts for Malcolm X
Now, I don't mean that you snow people. I'm not good at that. I think for me the
Saturn Return is something that needs to be uplifting. It needs to be something that

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
moves away from the nitty-gritty of the characteristics and moves into the higher
realm of purpose. Now, signposts, you can say to this person, “You're going to no-
tice something. By the way, this is something that can bring you great possibilities
in your work of trying to make your contribution—after all, this is somebody who's an
8.5—to make your contribution in this life. One of the things you're going to have to
learn is about restricting access to you. You're going to see that less and less people
are going to have access to you. If you see that, you know you're in the right direc-
tion.”
“The moment you're moving towards withdrawal, the moment you find yourself in
situations where you're being pulled into withdrawal, that's the moment you know
you're operating in the right direction because that is one of the themes. This is a
role you have to begin to understand.”
“The other thing is you have to go from exploring what it means to call people, being
a 5th line Personality, and to learn the power of how much you can offer those who
call you and to learn how to be called and to learn how to discern the call. Here's
your opportunity. This is a cycle where there is going to be many, many opportuni-
ties for you.” And if
you want you can
dabble in a line, you
can say, ―You have
inner truth. There is
this possibility for
you, opportunities
that will arise for you
out of inner truth.”
―Also the fact that
collaboration is
something you're
going to find very in-
spiring, but you have
to be very careful
who you collaborate
with. And you have
to see that the per-
fect ascetic withdrawal is everything for you—the 62.4.” And all of a sudden what
you're saying to somebody who is a 5/1 transpersonal being is, “You have to learn
something. You have to learn how to put up barriers. You have to learn how to pro-
tect yourself. If you learn how to protect yourself, you're going to be able to sur-
vive. If you learn how to protect yourself, you're going to be able to grow.”
“You have to learn the power of withdrawal. You have to learn the power of forcing
people to call you because it will give you more power to do your job of being a 5th
line being. You have to recognize the opportunities that are there in networking.
This is going to be a cycle for you where all kinds of possibilities are going to be
there through those you know. It's a deeply important cycle in your life, and one
that can be so productive.”

I'm not lying when I say all those things. I'm not making it up. It's there in the
lines. I can do the negative side, of course. You can always do the negative side.
But you're trying to point a human being towards the potential of their purpose.
Remember, the only true reading in terms of weather is the one you do for the mo-
ment that you're in. You have to understand that.
When you're doing a Rave Return, that's the closest you come to being generally ac-
curate about just about all of it, because it's a limited cycle. This is a huge cycle.
The point of this cycle is not to talk about all these little things that can pull the be-
ing away from their correctness. That's not the point. The point is to open up the
potential of the fulfillment of their purpose, to learn the role that they've been given
in the cycle to deal with that and to deal with that not through some kind of intellec-
tual strategy, but to recognize it and experience it as it happens as they are operat-
ing correctly. Then as the world shifts around them, there is no confusion about why
is this suddenly happening. Why is it all working this way? Why suddenly is this like
this now. Why have I become this way? All of these things that go along with not
understanding how a mechanism works.
So, when you're dealing with the Cross and the Profile, what you're really talking
about is a learning process that enriches their purpose through their Cross. They're
not going to stop. Here is somebody, in the game of the 2/4, will take the opportu-
nity to play 5/1. And through the 2/4, it will have a great opportunity to be the 5/1.
This is what it's all about. But you have to be taken by the process. In other words,
in operating correctly you have to enter into that thematic, see that thematic unfold
and in seeing that thematic unfold, this is the assurance that you can have.
The Nodes
The second thing is the
Nodes. I've been talking to
you about the Nodes as an
environment, as the neigh-
borhood, as the stage upon
which everything is set. Of
course, when you're talking
about a Saturn cycle, you're
talking about a 28-29 year
cycle. There is no point in
saying that the South Node
operates for the first 15
years and the North Node
operates for the second 15
years.
Again, I really want to get you away from that kind of linear process and just see
this as what it is. It is an opposition in the sky. What goes in one goes out the oth-

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
er; and what goes in the other goes out the other. These are magical polarities.
These are magical mirrors that are there.
All Four Nodes are 6th Line
Yes, thematically you're always moving in terms of the Personality from the 52 to the
58. But again, the qualities of each are always present in the time of the other. It's
not like these are things that simply disappear. It's one thematic environment.
Now, before I get into the gates, let's take a look at the lines. Again, Nodes are in-
teresting because they don't give you this sense of regularity that you get from your
Profile knowledge. Here's a classic example of the four Nodes, they’re all 6th line.
Obviously, the fact that they're all 6th line says something very strongly about all of
this. When we come to the 6th line, we come to themes of trust and leadership. We
come to the example, the role model, all of these various aspects that are bundled
up into the 6th line.
In other words, this is an environment where being an example is going to be de-
manded. So, this example that has to learn to wait for the opportunity to be called
to do their work, what they're going to be called to is an environment that is going to
demand that they are an example. Of course, if they're operating correctly, they're
going to be very comfortable moving through that environment. But it's a demand-
ing environment.
No matter who it would be that would have this kind of configuration—and by the
way, nodally it's not alien, or wasn't alien to him. His Personality Nodes were al-
ready 6th line in his natal chart. But if you were to see this configuration in some-

body's design, you would know that they would be under enormous pressure to be
an example.
Undefined Ego and Sacral
Look at this guy's chart and see the undefined Ego which remains an undefined Ego
in the Saturn. You can look at the open Sacral Center that remains that, so not
knowing when enough is enough, always trying to prove oneself to others. Here's
somebody who’s
going to be caught in
a staged environment
where they have to
be the example and
are going to be under
great not-self pres-
sure to fulfill the re-
sponsibility of being
that example. That’s
what's out there.
If they're operating
correctly as them-
selves, which comes
down to the Authority
of their emotional
system, if they are
waiting for the invita-
tion, how nice for the 5/1 who has to wait for an invitation where they get a 2/4
theme. They have to learn to wait for those things to call. They have to learn to
take their time to be able to discern what kind of response to make.
But again, all those 6th lines are saying there is going to be an enormous pressure to
be an example. If you have somebody who's entering into a cycle where they're
going to be under pressure for years and years and years to be an example, boy if
they don't have it together they're really going to suffer. They're just going to suf-
fer. And they're going to suffer in the depth of that open Ego.
The South Node: The 52nd Gate
If you're going to take in the values of the gates, and again if you're looking at the
South Node you have the 52nd gate which is all about the capacity to be still and to
focus. You can see that this movement into learning how to wait and learning how
to wait for the call to take your opportunity, that being focused, being able to be still
and to wait for those things is something that's very important.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
It's also going to be an environment where one has to deal with various things. That
is, the lack of pressure in times of stillness. You can see that it's not always going to
be very exciting. There are going to be times where one is going to be confined, one
is going to not be able to really do things. There's a possibility for real delusion.
And it's a possibility in the sense of the environment. Imagine what that's like, to be
in an environment where there are a lot of people who are stuck and a lot of people
who are sprouting and living and postulating delusion. Well, that's going to be in the
neighborhood. Good thing he has to withdrawal from that because it's going to be
around there.
The Design Nodes: The 38th and 39th Gates
If you look at the un-
conscious Design side,
you have this 38-39
combination so you have
a lot of provocation that's
there. The 39th gate of
Obstruction is a gate of
provoking. It's the line of
The Troubleshooter. It's
all about solving prob-
lems. So here he is in an
environment that is full of
people who don't have
anything to do other than
to feed on delusion and
the need for problem
solving, the need to work
it out. So all this thinking
and postulating and theorizing about what can be done to move out of this environ-
ment or change the environment. What does it lead to?
The Personality North Node: The 58th Gate
The 58th gate is deep energy to correct. It is the essential energy to correct. Of
course, this whole movement from the stillness and the focus eventually moving to
the need, the energy to fuel independent integrity, the energy to fuel one's identity,
all of this becomes the background. Here is somebody who is going to be in an envi-
ronment that can pull them out of stillness and pull them into some kind of activity.
And if you look at the 38.6, you will see that all this is ultimately going to bring is a
lot of misunderstanding and opposition. In other words, it's not going to be easy.
So, here's somebody who has a theme of dealing with the maya. Dealing with the
maya means dealing with the ignorance of an unaware world and the mechanics of

an unaware world. Being forced to withdraw, being pulled away from their natural
tendency to call, to go into retreat, to look for opportunities, to be in an environment
that is going to be full of beings who are in trouble, beings who are confused, those
who really don't know and the deep need, as an example, to try to do something
about it. And all of this leading to confrontation, all of this leading to the potential of
a fight.
It's his cycle. At the moment you begin to work with the Profile, the Cross and the
Nodes, you have a story to tell. You notice that that story is the theme for the be-
ing. Our teaching is that there is one way to deal with this in the best possible way,
and that is as yourself, only as yourself operating as yourself. That means that the
heart and core of what everything about, this design has to be referenced to. It has
to be referenced to the emotional Authority in this being and what it means. And
what it means to be an emotional being who is a triple-split. What it means about
time and place, movement and the journey. The journey is truth for the triple-split
definition. So, that is an example of Malcolm and his Saturn.
Karl Marx’s Natal Chart
Let me take you to Karl Marx. You can see in terms of Marx's design, again, we have
a very interesting triple-split Projector with the obviousness of his very, very open
motors: the Sacral, not knowing when enough is enough; the pressure in the open
Root Center, trying to get
things over with when
they're under pressure; and
of course, the open emo-
tional system, so somebody
who would be conditioned
in the not-self with avoiding
confrontation and truth.

Like all triple-split defini-
tions, again, to be able to
see clearly the advice they
need in this life, about the
care they have to take with
who they're locked into and
the importance of the jour-
ney as a process for them.
I always thought it was amusing that Marx spent so many years in the public library
in London surrounded by all of these various auras. None of them had any relation-
ship to him, just the casual moving through them back and forth. Of course, this is
one of the things that's so essential for the triple-split is this movement. The move-
ment, in and of itself, is very, very healthy for them.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Let's take a look at our example here. We're looking at a very interesting configura-
tion and we have ourselves a Sphinx, a 1/4. We're going to take a look at the Kiron.
Here in the Kiron, interestingly enough I just noticed that so it's kind of cute. Here is
somebody else cursed with Maya—I don't really mean that. But anyway, here is
another example of the Cross of Maya as a theme. Now, we're dealing with the Ki-
ron theme.
Karl Marx’s Kiron Return Chart
Timing can be 3½ Years before Kiron Return
First of all, the timing for Kiron. Kiron is something I feel if you're dealing with any-
body who has a reasonable background in the knowledge, that a Kiron Return as
early as 3½ years before the actual date is something that can be very helpful. You
can see how different this is from dealing with somebody who is going through the
Saturn process. So much of it is simply about maturity. The sooner you can get to
somebody, be-
cause Kiron is
pretty much of an
end game marker,
you really should
have it together
by then and if you
don't have it to-
gether by then,
it's really a risky
factor, particularly
for beings who are
6th line beings.
So, when it comes
to the Kiron, and I
say 3½ years be-
cause basically
whenever we're
looking at these
kinds of cycle points, we're basically dealing with a process of 3½ years into it and
3½ across it. The 7-year cycle with the point in the middle gives you a kind of going
in and getting in as a way of timing. I think anyone who gets a Kiron return any-
where within that window, this is something that's healthy. But I personally would
recommend, particularly for people you know who might have an interest in Design,
but they're really not living out their nature, this is a chance to give them this one
last chance, one last chance for the dance, see it right and take the opportunity to
experiment in time.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
We have a Very Long Maturing Process Now
The new life cycle is very beautiful. There are so many people who complain about
the level of consciousness on the planet and talk about the evolutionary process and
what it really has delivered. It has delivered the age of Uranus for us. The Uranian
cycle is a comment on our own evolution. We have become so sophisticated that we
are basically immature until we're nearly 40 years on the planet. This is a whole
new world. The Uranus Opposition is exactly equal to what the Saturn Opposition
used to be, and the Saturn Opposition took place when you were 14½ years old.
The fact is that we have a very long maturing process now and one that I don't think
we're paying enough attention to because it has to do with the way in which we deal
with our children and condition our children. The institutions we have and the basic
morality of the societies we live in insist that our children face the future in the same
way that their ancestors did who lived in the Saturn cycle. It's insane in this modern
cycle to take 15-year-old children and say to them, ―What do you want to be in this
life? And let's point you in that direction.‖ This is not what it's about.
I think it's going to take many generations before it's deeply understood that we are
living in a totally new cycle. So, the Kiron is very important because it is really in-
tended to mark that place where we have everything we need to live out our pur-
pose, because that's really what it's about. What I call the flowering stage. In other
words, here is the opportunity, truly, to live out the purpose. It's a complex cycle
we go through. Until you get past the Uranian point, because the Uranian Opposition
represents this change from prana in to prana out, the period between your Uranus
Opposition and your Kiron is where you're really there to master the presentation
that you're going to make when you reach your Kiron.
The Kiron is the Last Marker on the Road
The Kiron is the last marker on the road. Oh yes, you can look at the second Saturn.
If you live long enough you can look at three of them. But the fact is that this is the
last major marker and it's the marker of the new age in terms of our life cycle. So,
when you're looking at somebody's Kiron, how important the theme for this is.
Again, in dealing with the Saturn, the Uranus or the Kiron, you're always dealing
with the same thematic. You're dealing with the Sun/Earth configuration and what
that represents in relationship to the natal chart and the Nodal environment and
what the Nodal environment is going to bring. You can see his Nodal environment—
crisis leads to conflict [chart next page]. You can see the environment that he was
in. He was in a crisis/conflict environment.
This guy was hanging around Europe at the time where there was incredible turmoil
and there were revolutions in the streets every–where. All that turmoil was there.
That was going to be his environment, and how was he going to operate in that envi-
ronment; then you get to see the nature of the maya. Again, here's somebody who
has to go through this whole maya process and deal with the lack of awareness in

the world. It's dealing with the lack of awareness in the world, and the way in which
the configuration is going to operate through the lines.
Providing a Larger Thematic Road Map
It's not difficult. This is something that I want you to understand. You're providing
a larger thematic road map. That's all. The knowledge you have of their design is
what really matters. Because what you're really describing—after all, the planetary
configuration you have here for his Kiron, within three years all of that, because it
will take that long for the Pluto to move along, but the fact of the matter is within
moments that's gone. Thirty years, that's a long, long time for a pattern. It's not
about the nuances. It's about the large general themes. As long as you can present
these large general themes—this is the Cross of Life, the Sun/Earth, the South and
North Nodes, you present this as the stage, the environment and the process that's
there and you relate that directly to that person's design—then you're going to do a
really good job.
The 4/6 Profile
Here is somebody who is going to be a voyeur. It's their time to be a voyeur. It's
their time to sit at the edge of crisis and conflict. It's so interesting that the theme
of the 32.4 is Right is Might. This is somebody who is going to find their opportuni-
ties. They're going to find
their opportunities and are
going to be able to live out
their role as an example.
They're going to be the mid-
dleman. And yet, at the
same time, they're going to
be on the edge; they're going
to be on the outside.
People are always bitching
that Karl Marx was never a
revolutionary. Well, he
wasn't. He was in his voyeur
phase. He was out there at
the edge in an environment
of crisis and conflict. So,
when you're dealing with these themes, they're basic. Of course, it goes back to my
old story about analysts and teachers: It's always about 10% knowledge and 90%
talent. To give somebody a reading is a gift. It's a very special gift. It's something
I still love to do. It's a wonderful thing to do. I love the dropping of the veil. I love
being about to offer somebody the possibility to put their head through the sky for a
moment and to come back with an opportunity to live life as it's intended to be lived.

It's your talent that matters here: How well can you weave the story of what you see
in that Cross and Profile and in those Nodes. The richer you can weave that story,
the more profound the reading you're going to be able to offer. The knowledge it-
self, the technique itself, it's all very simple. In the end, it goes to your depth, your
skills, and the level of preparation you have.
See the Nodes as a Stage
But the most important thing is experiment with seeing the Nodes as a stage and
looking at those stages. Look at your own. Look at those people around you that
you've seen over many years. Really begin to see how the environment is shaping
their process and learn to see that this environment is absolutely necessary if they're
going to learn what they need to learn to enrich their own purpose. That's what the
Profile and Cross give you, where the lesson is, what they really have to learn.
And not simply what they have to learn, but what they have to take on from time to
time as a costume to be able to work with it, to be able to grasp it and understand it
so as they move through it and progress through that cycle, they enrich their own
process. All of that is dependent on whether they're going to be able to operate cor-
rectly as themselves.
It's like anything in Human Design. Every reading for me is an opportunity to ham-
mer somebody. It doesn't matter what kind of a reading you have from me, and
most of you have had them, you will end up hearing me bang away at you about
your design and about your Authority and your Strategy because that is what it's all
about.
The beauty is that when you're deep into the knowledge and you live your design,
you get to see how incredible it is that it's all there. All this stuff you can describe
for somebody is there; it's really there. That's the magic. When you begin to look at
your own cycles in this way, when you begin to see the way in which you literally are
taken in your geometry in this life into a specific environment for a specific learning
process, you begin to see clearly that it is there, and how you, yourself, are operat-
ing in it.
It is one of the most rewarding of the signposts because this is the program; this is
what we're here to do. This is our growth process. This is the way we develop; this
is how our consciousness develops. Unfortunately, most human beings don't get
this. They're always back in their Rave Return. For me to give somebody a cycle re-
turn should be a privilege that you earn through years and years of working at being
yourself, years and years of dealing with the characteristics of your annual cycle, be-
cause for most human beings, this is the challenge. It's very nice that you can lay
out these larger themes and open them up.
But the fact of the matter is they're not going to get the benefits of it if they're still
stuck in the characteristics. They're not going to get the benefit of it at all. As a

matter of fact, it's simply going to lead to discomfort and confusion. They're going
to feel uncomfortable in the environment that they find themselves in. They're going
to wonder what went wrong with their life. It can be devastating for the not-self.
So, the important thing is to be able to make sure you constantly recognize that you
can never take for granted that anyone sitting with you truly sits there as them-
selves. And you always have to make sure they understand that that's the key, not
the knowledge that you offer. That's only interesting, as everybody knows. The real
key is that they operate as themselves. As they operate as themselves, those cycles
will be things that are deeply rewarding for them.
Q & A
Allies When Moving from a Right Angle to a Left Angle
Question: You mentioned about the finding of allies when you move from a Right
Angle to a Left Angle. Is this because going from looking inward to being transper-
sonal so that transpersonal involves others and this is how you arrive at angles be-
cause this is exactly what's happening to me. I go from a 4/6 to a 5/1, so will there
be more allies than I have now?
Ra: Well, the dilemma with it is that there are so many allies that may show up that
you don't really know who the real allies are and who aren't. But the moment you
move from a Right Angle to a Left Angle, all of a sudden there are these forces that
are intercepting with your fractal. So, it's a very different experience. Of course, it's
not you, after all. You remained Right Angle. But it's there to teach you. In other
words, part of the learning process is to understand that not only are allies there,
they have always been there and in many ways you didn't see them.
Question: I'm looking forward to that. Thank you.
Relocation and the Triple-Split’s Movement
Question: I have a question when you're speaking about the triple-split in that their
timing is all through their movement is space, the trajectory that they follow. Histor-
ically in astrology they have these relocation charts saying that if an individual
moves from their natal place of birth and moves cross country and relocate, the
energies that they receive from the neutrino stream ultimately impact their life more
favorably, hopefully, than if they're in one place. Now, is the triple-split someone
who just constantly is not only moving in time to be in other people's auras, but also
within the earth's auric field?
Ra: The whole relocation thing is fascinating. For example, Ra Uru Hu was born in
Ibiza. If I do an astrological chart for the birth of Ra Uru Hu, I end up as a double
Aries, which is interesting for somebody who brings something new. In astrology,

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

I'm an Aries with a Sagittarius ascendant, and a double rat, so it was interesting for
my Ibiza experience where obviously my life was changed, in terms of drawing the
chart that way I actually would have been a double Aries which would have been in-
teresting.
Use Design Birth Data for Astrocartography
There is, obviously, something deeply important in that, but I think it's very specific
to people who have undefined G Centers. I think it's very difficult for undefined G
Centers, particularly non-energy types, to figure out how to find out what is the right
place for them. The Astrocartography that was developed in Switzerland is fascinat-
ing. One of the things that I've recommended to people is that the problem with As-
trocartography is that it's based on the Personality. If you really want to find out
where your body is really aligned, send them your Design data as if that was your
birth chart, just your design date and time. Then you will actually get your Astrocar-
tography for your physical vehicle and that is much more significant.
Everything about the nature of success in this life has to do with the physical form
and the way in which the physical form fits into its environment. But to answer the
other part of your question, which is important, the thing about triple-splits is that
it's not about whether or not they're in the right place. Again, that would be condi-
tioned whether they have an open G or not. The real thing for them is simply this
journey process that is just very mundane. It can be very difficult, for example, to
be a 2/4 and be a triple-split because it is important for them to get out, it is impor-
tant for them to move around, it is important for them to journey.
It is this movement that's so essential for them. These are the kind of people who
will do repetitive sports, will go to places to do activities, all this kind of stuff in order
to just go through the journey because the journey is the way in which they live their
version of wholeness. It's also through the journey, because it has to do with the
auras that they meet. This is the whole thing about the right geometry. If you're
not in the right geometry, you don't meet the right auras so you don't meet the right
configurations that are essential for the triple-split in its journey.
Again, it goes back to whether they're going to operate correctly. But your point is
well taken about location. I just think to see it from the perspective of the design
and to see that's something just about every open G Center is asking for, somebody
to help them find the right place.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Quadruple-Splits in the Long-Term Cycle Return
Written Question: (about the return’s quadruple-split)
Ra: Obviously, there is this change to the quadruple-split, but as you've noticed, I
didn't pay any attention to it. This is not a quadruple-split because it's not some-
thing that is going to last. It has nothing to do in detail with what the general cycle
is. That is, the general cycle can only be framed accurately, because it's so large,
through the Sun/Earth and the Nodes.
There is a subtlety in being able to look at these other aspects. By the way, it
wouldn't mean that he operated as a quad. There is a subtlety in all of that so you
can look at certain aspects of it and you can begin to talk about minor themes that
are going to be present. And those minor themes are going to be there. However, I
don't think it's to anybody's advantage who is having a cycle reading to get anything
other than the large painted frame. They have to fill in the detail. If 5 or 10 years
later they are able to see all the details from their experience, that is of much great-
er value.
Again, my real concern is that when we're dealing with a cycle analysis, you don't
get stuck in the characteristics, because if you get stuck in the characteristics, you're
really in the wrong place. We're here to talk about purpose and the fulfillment of
purpose because that's what any cycle presents us.
Characteristics Verses Purpose
Question: Ra, could you elaborate more on what you mean about characteristics
verses purpose and the fulfillment of that?
Ra: Well, it's my old adage about the movie set. In a movie set you have two kinds
of actors. You have those actors who have a role and everybody knows their role,
they have a speaking part and they get a certain amount of attention from the au-
dience. Then you have those actors who are furniture, who are background. When
those actors come in for the job, to get the job, for example, you're going to have
the stars sitting a café talking to each other about something. They can't be sitting
alone in that café, unless it's part of the story. But anyway, they're not sitting alone
in that café; there are all kinds of other people in that café.
Those people in the café are given characteristics. You're a businessman having
lunch. Look at your watch every once in a while, blah, blah, blah. This is characte-
ristics. But if you're the star, you have role. Not only that, when the film is over and
they run the credits and your name comes up first, and whoever it was, Harry or
Jane who was standing at the counter in the background, you see their names in tiny
little print somewhere down in the rest of the scroll.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
So, this is the fundamental difference. When you're talking about Profile you're talk-
ing about purpose. You're talking about purpose that can only be fulfilled through
the correctness of role. You can't get to the correctness of your role until you oper-
ate through your characteristics. Your characteristics are what your design is. That
design that's in that matrix with all of its dilemmas, its open Centers and its splits
and its 'this' and its 'that,' whatever the case may be. The only way you can deal
with the characteristics is you transcend the limitation, the characteristics, by oper-
ating correctly. You eliminate the resistance. You move through this life correctly.
The moment you eliminate the conditioning elements that arise out of the characte-
ristics of your design, that's the moment you begin to fit into your role and you begin
to expand your capacity within that role until ultimately, you fulfill the potential of
that role. Along the way, if you look at cycle analyses, basically what you're looking
at are two kinds of analysis that are going on in the binary. The one is the year-by-
year, the day-by-day, characteristic battle dealing with conditioning, dealing with the
conditioning of this force, that person to the limitation in your openness.
The other side of that, the larger picture, is the potential that if you're operating cor-
rectly, you can leave the characteristic dilemma behind. Most people use up all their
energy dealing with the problems that arise out of being conditioned. The moment
you can leave that behind, you can begin to enter into the realm of purpose. That's
the moment you move from being in the background and being nothing more than a
cartoon of a life, and suddenly you have a role and suddenly you have things to say
and suddenly there are people paying attention to you. This is the process.
So, when I talk about characteristics, I'm talking about dealing with your design,
dealing with what it is to be a triple-split emotional Projector, whatever the case may
be. Deal with your design. And once you've dealt with your design, then you can
enter into the realm of purpose. It's what cycles are for.
I would much rather see professional analysts doing regular Rave Returns and inte-
grating that into people's lives. I think that's much more important for them in rela-
tionship to the larger themes that are in the cycles, but these are larger themes that
are dependent on you operating correctly. If you're not operating correctly, you're
not going to get this long-term patterned process. It's going to be there, but it's not
like you're going to be in it because you're going to be stuck in your characteristics.
If your not-self is making the decisions, you're not entering into what is correct for
you, so you're certainly not going to be able to learn the lessons that are there to be
learned. We know that in the very nature of the duality, if for what you do there is a
price to be paid. If you don't do it correctly, you're going to pay that price. For
most human beings, that's the way in which they operate.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Kiron Return Timing, and the Switch in the Nodal Environment
Question: Ra, with the Kiron Return, what is the timing that the frequency of the
imprint affects the individual. That's the first part of the question. The second part
is, with the Nodal environment, you have the South Node and the North Node, if you
look at the natal chart there is a 41-year South Node experience and then it switches
and the environment changes, we go to the North Node. Is there that kind of switch
within the Nodal environment with the Kiron imprint? Or is it a simultaneity that the
individual is constantly working through for the length of that frequency?
Ra: In terms of the frequency, it's really hard to tell. It's a safe bet that it's certain-
ly something that is going to be very powerful between the Kiron and the Uranus Re-
turn which happens when you’re around 84 years old. So, I look upon it as a kind of
30-year process basically. I think beyond that I don't really know. We have this
phenomenon now of extended life that is really extraordinary. It may be that ulti-
mately the third Saturn Return may be something that is actually interesting.
My mother who is 93—and bless her, she has all her marbles and she's still fine—
she's gone through three Saturns. I don't know how accurate her Kiron is. Maybe
the third Saturn is actually an expression in a way that we have never been able to
see Saturn in terms of the closing of the life cycle. That I don't really know.
In terms of your Nodal question, when you're looking at the Nodes in the Kiron
they're there and they're not, both of them. As I said, there is a movement, but you
can't really time it. In the
Karl Marx's configuration,
just looking at the right-
hand side of the return,
there tends to be more 36 in
the beginning than the 6,
but the 6 is there. In other
words, they are mirrors, so
there are aspects of each.
There is a kind of frequency
in which the future is always
present in the present and
the past is never separated
from the future's present. I
don't know if any of that
makes sense, because that's
quite convoluted. But nonetheless, it's more of a continuity between the 36-6.
My friend, my long time associate in Design, Alok, has done some wonderful things.
He ran it for years in the Spanish language update, his analysis of the polarities. I
think it's very important that we get to a point where these polarities are synthe-
sized. The beginning of that process is working with them nodally, to find ways to

really see what the quantum is, because the quantum really represents the whole
movement of the Nodal environment.
My first step, though, is really to try to enrich the professional perspective on the
Nodes and get you to be able to see them for as rich as they are, because I think
that they're very, very rich and I think they're very, very deep. One of the most fas-
cinating things, I have a star graph that relates about 170 of the most famous stars
from eastern/western mythologies and pseudo-astronomies, particularly Arabic star
studies. To be able to have them laid out in the various gates, it's fascinating to
think about the traditions of those particular stars and their impact in operating
through those portals and being able to get their energy to come in here and impact
us. So, there are many fascinating areas for me about the Nodes.
Weathering Impact Chart
Question: I guess I'm a little confused then. I'm not sure what to say then during
a Saturn or a Kiron Return reading. Do I not look at, for example, that weathering
impact chart, do I not look at those keynotes?
Ra: Only if you want to. For me, personally, my approach is very simple. I'm con-
cerned with the person's design and I'm concerned with the larger themes. It's the
larger themes. If you focus on those larger themes, that's something that for 30
years will never, ever, ever lose its resonance with that person. You dabble with the
little nuances that may show up once every 5 or 6 years, it is not worth the trouble,
nor is it worth the focus that anybody is going to give such things.
Again, you can analyze anything to death. There is so much stuff to analyze. But
the fact is that a cycle return is a vast swath of time. What matters is that you give
an accurate image of the larger themes because that's what the person is going to
live through.
The Larger Theme is the Cross, Profile and Nodes
Question: And the larger themes are the Cross and the Nodes?
Ra: Precisely; Cross, Profile and Nodes.
Dissonant Profile Change is Uncomfortable
Question: So, would the Profile, if there is dissonance, let's say you go from a 2/4
to a 6/3 and there is no resonance there, how do you guide the client in terms of
that energy overlay or frequency impact?

LECTURE THREE
Long-Term Cycles: Part 1
Ra: These are the beings who are much more shocked by the changes that impact
them. One of the most interesting things about harmony and resonance and disson-
ance is that when you're dealing with resonance, you barely notice it. And when
you're dealing with harmony, you sort of notice it. But when you're dealing with dis-
sonance, it's really loud.
So, one of the things about moving into a dissonant Profile is that you end up being
very uncomfortable with the change. Again, that's the whole thing about really un-
derstanding how we use Profile in this context because the Profile and the Cross, the
gates themselves, are really telling you what has to be learned. That's the most fas-
cinating thing. This is what has to be dealt with, this is what you have to deal with,
this is what you're going to have to learn in order to be able to fulfill your own
process.
Now, if it's resonance or it's harmony, this is a much easier thing because it seems
like a natural evolution. It seems very natural. You take a 1/4 and suddenly they're
a 2/5 they're going to feel everything is fine. This is a natural movement because
there are no jagged edges. There's change, but there's no jagged edges.
But the moment you have dissonance, you're going to have the jagged edges. So,
these are people who are often—this is particularly true for Saturn Returns. This is
one of those places where you can really be shocked if you're crossing over into a
dissonant Profile.
Can Shock Affect the Person Physically?
Question: Can the shock affect the individual physically in the open Centers, let's
say, in terms of let's say the Heart?
Ra: Yes, the shock can be physical but it will depend very much on the person's de-
sign. The tradition of the cutting of the umbilical cord, the tradition of a form of
death that really is associated with the Saturn Return. I think when you're dealing
with a movement to a dissonant Profile, it really does seem like something has radi-
cally come to an end.
Of course, it's common knowledge that many people on their Saturn Return confront
death for the first time or they see death. There are often these kinds of very deep
crises in that sense. But I think that's more likely to happen for somebody who is
moving into a kind of dissonant Profile where there is this real shift.
The same thing can be true of the Uranus Opposition. I've always had a belief that
the Uranus Opposition has a stronger impact on men and the Saturn Return has a
stronger impact on women. But this is just something I've noticed from my own ex-
perience over the years.

Dissonance and the Nodal Environment
Question: So if someone has this dissonance in the Crosses, then would you look to
the environment of the Nodes to see how that would sort of bridge over?
Ra: Yes, I think the moment—because it speaks for itself within the dissonance—
you see dissonance, you know you have a lot to learn. In other words, you're really
going to have to deal with something that isn't necessarily comfortable on your skin.
The moment you're dealing with a shift, harmonic or it resonates, again you don't
have this same kind of feeling.
So, I think it's more about seeing it in the nature of the dissonance itself. What are
you moving from? From what to what, and then deal with that. If somebody is
moving from a 1st line Personality into a 3rd line Personality, to have to learn about
trial and error, to have to learn about failure and not understanding that this is just a
learning process but is something you have to go through, that can be very, very dif-
ficult.
The real advantage is that we're offering people a framework upon which they can
see the things they have to deal with in that phase in their life. It's what they have
to deal with, not how. Again, the ―how‖ goes back their uniqueness and the way in
which they operate.
Those were good questions, thank you.
Ok, folks, that's it for tonight. I want to thank you. I will have some exercises for us
to do together tomorrow so I can get you to be more interactive with me and we can
see what we can do in analyzing some of these charts in practical ways. So, I look
forward to tomorrow. Have a good day wherever you are. Talk to you then.

Long-Term Cycle Analysis: Part 2
Long-Term Cycles are for 6th Line Beings
Today I wanted to spend our time together looking at the phenomena of the 6th line
being. When I look at the work of aligning people to their nature and getting them
on the road of experimentation, I think for most of them these larger cycles, particu-
larly the Saturn and the Kiron, are not very significant. It's not like doing an analysis
of it is anything that is a negative, but the reality is that their real dilemma is the di-
lemma of characteristics.
Again, if this was the kind of deeply controlled, old fashioned thousands of years ago
process of step-by-step, how the novice is brought to a point of masterhood, then it
would be very clear that nobody would get a cycle return at all for the first 30 years
of their life. And then all they would get is the regular analysis each year to realign
them to the ordeal and the confrontation with their characteristics and their open-
ness and the power of their not-self mind to rule their lives. This is the reality.
Cycle returns, like Incarnation Crosses, is a sexy topic. It's the kind of thing that at-
tracts the part of a person that wants to have something to believe in. There is a
certain magic in these larger themes. And that is a magic, that in many ways, is
more soothing for someone. When you give somebody a Saturn Return, you'll dis-
cover it's a hell of a lot more soothing even if you said the worse possible things than
having their design done, because it is oriented towards the higher purpose of the
being.
For me, it's very clear that the real battle is to deal with the mundane dilemma of
the characteristics because this is the thing that stands in the way. Purpose is not
something that gets fulfilled by skipping the essential steps of what it is to decondi-
tion oneself, what it is to enter into a proper relationship with one's Authority and
one's Strategy.
But when it comes to the 6th line being, then it's absolutely essential, at least from
my own perspective. The Saturn and the Kiron are part of the process of opening up
and understanding about the nature of their life because it's absolutely essential.
It's essential in the sense that as 6th line beings, they're the only ones who are really
living these corners of the process.

You take somebody like me who's a 5/1 and you do my Saturn and it's sort of like,
ok. But if I were a 6/2 and you do my Saturn, there is an alignment between the
basic design of the being who is a mutative being, who is here to live out a tripartite
life, who needs to know what each of these edges are in that tripartite process, and
what it means to go from stage one to stage two to stage three.
The 6th Line Being has Three Different Kinds of Lives
So, in essence, when you're looking at a 6th line being coming into the world, you're
already looking at three different kinds of lives. I think this is a new mutative genet-
ic standard for humanity and something for us to really pay attention to; in other
words, this tripartite process. And yet, the only way in which to concretize our un-
derstanding of it, the only way in which we're going to be of value to the beings who
are 6th line beings is if we explore very deeply doing the Saturns and Kirons with 6th
line beings and doing it with clients over time.
I think that's one of the most important things that will come with—I'm already at a
point where I have people in my life who I have worked with for 10 or 11 years. As
that process extends further and further, I begin to have people in my life where
their cycle readings begin to show up, when I did one way back then, whatever the
case may be. And I think this is one of the things that would really add to a deep,
experiential understanding of the relationship and the importance of the Saturn and
the Kiron in being of value to a 6th line being.
The Cycle Readings are for Learning the Positive
There is timing in all of these things. It is clear to me, as I mentioned the other day,
the Saturn Return is not something that should be delivered immediately at the Sa-
turn. I don't think it's healthy. Again, it is clear to me that the roof phase—I have a
different way of looking at these two readings. For me when I think Saturn Return, I
think this is the design of going on the roof. That's how I see it.
Even though, for example, if I do a Saturn Return for somebody who doesn't have a
6th line in their Profile, this is still a ―going on a roof‖ reading. Now, the person who
doesn't have the 6th line Profile, who isn't a part of the mutative process themselves,
it doesn't mean they're not impacted in the neutrino ocean of conditioning of all of
these mutative 6th line beings who are around. After all, there are a lot of them;
there is an impact in this.
But for the 6th line being, it's specific. And this is why the reading is so important for
them, because that Saturn is what the going on the roof phase means for the devel-
opment of your purpose, or the fulfillment or the potential to fulfill what is your pur-
pose. The essential thing is that you're here to learn the positive.

LECTURE FOUR
Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
The going on the roof phase is a phase that we have no relationship to whatsoever
historically. If you think about the traditional life span that we had for millennia, we
were dealing with a Saturnian cycle. We were dealing with the Saturnian cycle
where the mortality rate for human beings was very, very young. And everything
had to be done in an enormous hurry. Basically, you went from being a child to be-
ing an adult in one breath. You can go from being a 9-year-old boy to being a 9-
year-old apprentice overnight. These were beings who had children when they were
all in their teens. This is a totally different kind of generation.
Yet, the Saturnian cycle is so powerful because it is an inherited, cultural cycle that
we still have the same problems today and nobody notices. The 15-year-old child-
ren, the so-called teenagers who become so depressed when they're 15 because
they want to be adults and they're still treated as children. Well, of course, they
want to be adults. In the old Saturn cycle where there is all this pressure on them
when they're 15 to know what they want to be, you have to go out there and earn a
living and you have to look after yourself, and all this stuff. The fact of the matter is
we're trapping them in the old Saturnian cycle. We're in a different realm.
The Uranian Cycle: Childhood
The thing about the Uranian cycle and what the 6th line being brings us is a new ma-
nual on the process. There is this child process. And the child process has been ex-
tended to the full Saturn cycle. In other words, by the time you get to the Saturn
Return, this is when you stop being a child. I know, I look around me and I see it.
But it's a child. Oh yes, it looks adult, it acts adult, it can function adult, it seems
that way. But in terms of the way in which our consciousness is developing now in
terms of the patterns for the development of our consciousness, it's very helpful—I
don't want to insult any of those beings—but it's very helpful to look at that and see
that as the new child.
Think about what childhood is. Childhood is the opportunity, without pressure, to
begin to grasp the world you have to live in, the opportunity without pressure. Now,
look at the enormous amount of pressure we put on children and young people be-
tween that age of 15 and 30. This is an enormous amount of pressure that is placed
on them, when, in fact, we're denying them their true childhood.
The Roof Phase: Living Your Own Life
And what is the roof phase? This going up on the roof, all of this is about the oppor-
tunity to begin to experiment with living your own life. This is where the optimism
has to come from, the power and the ability to be able to begin your own life. It
says that until you get to the roof stage, you don't have your own life. One of the
most fascinating statistics, and I love to follow all kinds of stuff, there is a whole set
of statistics now that were just released in Spain. I think it was 8% of males be-
tween the age of 25 and 40 are still living at home. Yes, there are some factors that

have to do with the high cost of real estate, and that people aren't getting married
and having children, all these kinds of things. There are many, many things involved
in all of that.
But one of the things that is so interesting is that the natural childhood for anyone
who was born after 1781, the time of protection from pressure, that's supposed to
go for 28 years. And then you begin this process on the roof, very positive, the libe-
ration, the liberation from the pain of being a child and not having your own life.
You're on the roof and there is this potential optimism, this beauty of what can be
possible for you. After all, we describe the roof stage as an aloof stage.
The Kiron Phase: The True Maturity of Life
Then finally at the Kiron, this magical coming off the roof, the new flowering, the real
maturity. Not this business that you're 30 years old and you're mature, because it's
not true. You just got over childhood. You still haven't found an identity. You've
still not found your role. And in the case of a vast majority of humanity, all of that is
messed up because it's not-self, it's operating psychologically in the old Saturn cycle.
Most human beings will decide that their life is a failure or not when they're in their
20s. ―Well, I couldn't finish this and get what I wanted here, I'm stuck with this, I'm
stuck with that and this is the way it's going to be.‖ Then they get bogged down in
the way in which the systems of all of our societies find ways to bog them down.
And they're stuck. They never get to live out their childhood, which is why most
human beings are so immature in their adulthood. One of the most remarkable
things for me to see is the obvious. They didn't get to live out their childhood.
So, when you enter into this stage where you go up on to the roof, here is this pos-
sibility of discovering self, the value of self, the beauty of self, the potential that is
there in all 6th line beings to be wise, to be a leader, to be trusted, to be the exam-
ple; but then the truth, because the roof is like a bubble. And in that bubble, by the
way, most 6th line beings are the most successful they will be in their whole life. My
recommendation to all 6th line beings is: Do well when you're on the roof and save
and invest because it's not going to be the same when you come off the roof, be-
cause it's another life. It’s another process. So, when we're looking at the Kiron, it
is describing the true maturity of life, the theme of the mature being. The theme of
the mature being is where the fulfillment of purpose takes place.
The Saturn Return: The Theme of the Roof
The Saturn Return is going to show us what the theme of the roof is and point us to-
wards where the optimism of self can be enriched. I love Saturn. I have a deep,
deep respect for this force and I enjoy it. I enjoy it because it seems to me, of all
the forces we deal with, it is the one with the least guile. It's very straightforward.
It's right there in your face.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
The beauty for me, or the irony because I like the irony, is that the reputation of Sa-
turn, the heaviness, this lumping together of Saturn with Cronus so you get this
frightful kind of image, is not really what Saturn is about. You can see that in the
opening, the first 28 years, that cycle is a painful trial and error cycle. This is deal-
ing with Saturn's world. It's dealing with meeting the truth of the world, the material
world, the mundane plane. It's about understanding that human beings cheat and
lie. That love is not necessarily something that is pure and innocent. It is all the
things that need to be seen in order for the world to be embraced for what it is, and
not for a being to live in a delusion and have their illusion about life shattered be-
cause it turns out to be such a horror.
The fact of the matter is that for a 6th line being, the first Saturn cycle is the temper-
ing of their mettle. It is placing them in the harshest possible light to see the world
clearly. And yet, the moment you get to the so-called Saturn Return, which for me,
as I said, this is the theme of going on the roof and it's the way I prefer to see it.
When you get to the theme of going on the roof, you get the optimism; you survived
it. Oh, I love to say that to 6th line beings when I meet them and they're on the
roof. “Good for you, you got it, you survived it.”
There are great rewards for surviving the trials of Saturn. The reward is within one-
self. And the experience one gains in that harsh light is the very foundation of what
can be a true optimism about their potential, the potential of their self. And of
course, that potential is only something that is going to be discovered at a certain
level of withdrawal and isolation from the forces that held it so deeply. But the
theme of going up on the roof is where you give courage and strength to those who
have to go through this process. After all, the one thing about the Saturn phase for
a 6th line being is that it's always better, the roof phase is always better than what it
was to go through the first part of that cycle.
Sigmund Freud’s Natal Chart
Ok, let's take a look at some of the examples I set for today. I have a 3/6 and a
6/3. I'm going to start with the Right Angle. Let's begin with just the basics for a
moment. Remember that when we're going to be doing a cycle analysis, any cycle
analysis is going to be rooted in the analysis of the Cross and its Profile, and it's
going to be about the Nodes of the Moon because the Nodes of the Moon are going
to set the stage for the cycle itself. [Birth Data for this lecture: May 6, 1856, 9:17
AM in Freiberg, Germany.]
But it's also essential that we grasp those areas that are going to be under pressure
in the being's design, and more than that, to understand the dilemma of the being.
Obviously, if you're looking at Freud you're dealing with basic dilemmas, the basic
dilemma of the conflict between the manifesting emotional system and the almost
unconscious Sacral system going into the Spleen. Here is somebody that is two
people. And here is somebody who is always trying to deal with his own problems.

Bridging Gates: The 48th, 14th, 29th Gates
By the way, this design is very curious. In the early years doing Jung and Freud was
always a favorite of mine because it was fascinating. You can see that here when
you're dealing with a basic split definition, you know that the deepest conditioning is
in those gates that will join the split together. We have three that are specific here.
That is, the 48th gate, if that was activated would bring the split together through the
channel of Talent.
But it also tells you here is somebody who suffered from a deep sense of inadequacy,
the 48th gate being the fear of inadequacy and always trying to find adequacy. Of
course, the joke about harmonics: If you have the 16 and you don't have the 48, you
want to be deep, and if you have the 48 and you don't have the 16, you want to be
able to do all the skills. So, here is somebody who felt they had to be deep and, of
course, the fact is that not even natural for them; there was a great deal of inade-
quacy rooted in that.
The other two gates, the 14th gate and the 29th gate, are having problems with mak-
ing commitments and keeping commitments, having problems with really energizing
his vision and really putting his energy into his vision. So he ends up being really
controlled in the not-self by these three open gates. Literally, his mind is forcing de-
cisions in order to fulfill a vision that may end the inadequacy, and so forth.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
Open Centers
You also have somebody with an undefined Ego so they're always trying to prove
something; they're always trying to prove themselves. This is somebody who has
very little patience; you have an open Root Center. The moment they're given some
kind of responsibility, they're always trying to get rid of it as quickly as possible.
Like Jung, with the exception that there is one gate here, the open Head and the
open Ajna Center so you have somebody who has a very open mind. There is no
consistency in the certainty.
3/6 Right Angle Sphinx
When you look at this being, the first thing you have to see is that this is somebody
who is a 3/6, Right Angle Sphinx. They're very much involved in their own process.
They have a Personality that is fundamentally pessimistic. This is a Personality that
does not see the bright side of
anything. It's the whole basis of
the 3rd line Personality which
gives it a very powerful capacity
to fight through the dilemmas of
the material plane, to live in the
world and deal with the world. It
is a line of discovery. It is a line
of materialism.
And yet, the trial and error nature
of it is something that is very dif-
ficult unless you're properly
raised. I live with this. I have
two young 1/3 sons. It's so clear
to me that their well-being and
their psychological well-being,
and they are healthy beings, is
that whenever they have problems when things don't work, that's not something
that is ever treated as: You have a problem, why didn't that work. It's always: Well,
what happened and why did it happen? And the intelligence of the children is
pointed towards the problem solving rather than pointed towards themselves as be-
ing the problem because they're not the problem. Most human beings who carry the
3rd line in their Profile are beings that so often see themselves as having the prob-
lem, being inadequate.
If you add to the fact that the majority of humans have an open Ego Center, to have
a 3rd line Personality in an open Ego is to really be uncomfortable about your worth
and your value. Of course, what happens is that it's not like there is a one-way
street as a reaction to that kind of structure. You will have some people who will
just wallow in the fact that they're useless, and you'll have other people who try to
impress everybody with how terrific they are in order to try to compensate for that

sense of inadequacy. So many times you see people with open Egos who display a
quality of Ego that not only is it false, but in the end will be detrimental to them.
The 6th Line and its 3rd Line Process
Here you have somebody with the dilemma of the 3/6 and the 6/3; here you have a
6th line Profile in which the 6th line in the first Saturn cycle is going to go through its
3rd line process. So when you're looking at the 6th line, the first thing to understand
about it is that built into this process of being a 6th line being is that you must go
through the dark end of the street first; no escape.
The beauty of the 3rd line is that there is no false innocence. The magic of the 6th
line process is that there is no other Profile that must go through such an intense
process where they don't actually get to live out what is their real nature, but they
have to learn their harmonic first. After all, you're dealing with a transpersonal qual-
ity of the 6th line. And at the very basis of what the 6th line can be is how they deal
with the 3rd line experience.
Guiding Mothers with 6th Line Children
When you're looking at this configuration of a 3/6, you have to see that this is a 3/3
for 28 years. Now, most of us know some of them. We know what they've gone
through. It's very, very difficult. And we have to see that some of the most impor-
tant work we will ever do professionally is the guides we can give to mothers about
their children and about the Profiles of their children. It is so important to under-
stand. Yes, there is the obvious of your child's type and treating your child according
its nature. Obviously, that's going to make a big difference.
But understanding their Profile—when I had an opportunity to work with doctors ra-
ther than teach them Human Design and health, I was much more concerned with
their bedside manner or their ability to be able to handle people according to their
Profile, and in treating them relative to their Profile, being able to get their imme-
diate cooperation. It was my joke about a 3rd line Personality who comes in to see
the doctor and the first thing the doctor does is look at them and say, ―I don't really
know if I can help you.‖ Whether that's true or not doesn't matter. For the 3rd line
being, it's the best thing they could hear. This is the doctor I'm going to trust. This
is the one that is as pessimistic as me.
You have to see that for each configuration there is a way of dealing with the being.
A child that is going to have a 3/3 phase, both at the Personality level and at the
deep unconscious level, there is going to be a discomfort with the world; things just
don't work right. And of course, because they have to deal with the structures that
we have all around us, the moralities of various families, their psychologies, the way
in which institutions are run, schools and so forth, the way error is dealt with, the
way mistakes are dealt with, these are children who can be, at a very early age, in

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
life deeply, deeply handicapped. Because the first thing that is going to happen is
that the pessimism becomes martyrdom. After all, this is one of the themes of the
3rd line, from the 10.3, The Martyr.
The fact of the matter is, to be a 3rd being doesn't mean you have to be a martyr but
you'll never get rid of your pessimism. But the pessimism can be based on what is
legitimate. It's not about a general, generic pessimism. The beauty for a 3rd line be-
ing who is raised correctly is that they begin to see problems and the situations in
which mistakes arise to be fascinating. They're interesting. They stop being uncom-
fortable. As a matter of fact, they get to a point where they don't want to be without
them because this is where they learn the most interesting stuff. And it's true.
So here you have somebody who is going to go through a 3/3 phase as a Sphinx.
Here you're going to have somebody where the direction is something where there
are going to be problems, there are going to be mistakes and there are going to be
all of these things. And here is somebody who is desperately trying to prove them-
selves, who is running around as a verbal emotional Manifestor and totally ignoring
their Splenic/Sacral system, being guided by this not-self.
The Need to Meet and Understand Characteristics First
Now, the job with this being—and I'm not speaking specifically of Freud because
there is nothing we can do for him now—this is somebody who needs to meet and
understand his characteristics first. This is one of those complex configurations, and
it's one you're going to see a lot.
That is, the emotional system de-
fined and split off from the Sacral
defined. So you have this double
Authority; and yet, at the same
time, they're separate from each
other. So here is somebody who
is a Generator, who is here to re-
spond, but they have emotional
Authority which happens to have
a manifesting element in this
case.
You can bet your bottom dollar
that that emotional power going
directly to that Throat and all of
that is conscious—you have the
8/1 so you have a conscious definition, the identity to the Throat. You have a con-
scious 22/12 along with an unconscious 12, but still it's all conscious. So here is
somebody that deeply identifies with being an emotional role model. That's their
trip; a social role model, an open social role model. Somebody who is a mutative
role model, somebody who has the 22nd gate. He has the grace to listen to you.
Somebody who has the 12th gate who has the capacity to transform you and mutate

you in the way in which he articulates. Somebody who is here to be an example, to
be an individual example through the 8/1.
This is not an emotional Manifestor, after all. But this is the way this being would
operate in its life with that power being guided by the not-self. And what's hidden
away is the real key. That is, the
Sacral/Splenic awareness combi-
nation and the fact that this is
somebody who would find it ex-
ceedingly difficult to wait. It's so
difficult with the open Root, with
the manifesting emotional capaci-
ty, somebody where it's just so
difficult to wait for anything.
So, think about the process. Here
is somebody who is very open
mentally so the open mind is the
intellectual mind. It’s the mind
that can really take in things, ex-
amine them and speculate upon
them. It is the open mind that can
be the judge of whether or not a concept is really of value or not. So here is some-
body under this 3/3 power that is going to see the dark side, is going to see the
problems, is going to see the difficulties both related to mind and also within their
own context. In other words, they themselves are going through a process where
things don't seem to work. That's very difficult.
Sigmund Freud’s Saturn Return Chart
The 6 Process
And then, like magic, and it is like magic, all of a sudden they get to a point, and
when they get to that point, the Saturn Return, there is an exorcism, if I can use
such a quaint description. It's not so much that the 3/3 climbs up onto the roof. It’s
pretty much that the 3/6 is sort of pulled out of it, almost like a ghost, almost like
the inside of a shell that the shell breaks off. Yeah, we could say it's pretty. We
could call it the chrysalis and out of that comes a little butterfly; however you want
to look at it.
For me, it's very clear that there is a metamorphic process because the one thing
that is absolutely guaranteed about the Saturn Return as a date that is marked, like
this one where it says it was June 16, 1885 at 8:30:20 PM, is that it is only the core
of a spiral of a process. It's a guideline. But it's clear to me that from the time you
get to around your 26th or 27th birthday until you're around 33 years of age, there is
this metamorphic process taking place.

It's not like overnight you go from being a 3/3 to being a 3/6. This process of the 6
taking on its nature—how can I describe it? I tried to explain to you as best I could
this concept of the first Saturn cycle being the child. So imagine if we take the ex-
ample of the process that we see, the change between child and young adult, all of
that is hormonal. It's the oncoming of the sexual potential. One of the things to see
about this metamorphosis out of the 3 into the 6 is that it doesn't happen in a mo-
ment. But it's the same kind of thing.
All of a sudden—it's like with my son—all of a sudden his voice changed. But it's not
all of a sudden. This is a process. And this is one of the major reasons why I don't
do a Saturn for somebody on their Saturn. Wait until they go through that meta-
morphic process, wait until you're dealing with their 6 and not still dealing with their
3. That's really what it's all about. It's not a construct in the sense that we're say-
ing thematically this person is going to live out a 3rd line unconscious. They are
going to live out a 3rd line unconscious. It's part of the metamorphic potential within
them.
After all, if you think about it, they were born a 3/3. And slowly that 3 that's the as-
pect of the 6, when it's born it has not completed its process. In other words, it
doesn't complete the process in the womb. It’s sort of like one of these out-of-the-
womb kinds of things like the little kangaroo, the joey that climbs up into the pouch.
This is really a process in which that 3 over that 30-year period is slowly moving to-
wards what is its destiny, its 6-ness. In that phase just before the Saturn and
through the Saturn, this is when the transition takes place. It's a movement. You

don't want to talk to somebody who is still in their 3rd line because they're not going
to get the possibility of the optimism.
The optimism is the counterpoint that is necessary to balance their process. The 6th
line being is the true quantum being. They go from ―this and that‖ to something
beyond. It's so important to establish the counterpoint of the roof and you can only
begin to do that when you have that person leave behind the actual physicalness,
because it's physical, of their 3rd line phase and then enter completely into their 6th
line process.
The Roof Stage of a 6th Line Being
Let's take a look at this Saturn, it's really beautiful [images on previous and next
pages.]. One of the things to keep in mind about my comments about the roof stage
being positive it's more than being positive, in many ways when you're dealing with
a 6th line being this is also the design or the themes of success for them in life. Re-
member that this is the most dynamic phase of a 6th line being's life. This is a phase
where they are still dealing with the 'this and that' of a process. In other words,
they've been through the 3rd line side, now they're going to go through the 6th line
side and being accentuated or being moved over to the other extreme, this is the
side where they gain the benefits of example, leadership, and trust, all of those
things. And for so many 6th line beings, this is the core of where they build their
success in life.
It's very different when they come off the roof because they come off the roof they
are not—by the way in which the mutation operates—they can't lean to this or that.
It isn't going to work. I'll talk about that in a moment. But let's take a look here at
the Saturn and let's take a look at the potential of this in its positive and in terms of
as a success theme.
The Incarnation Cross of Eden
The first thing that you're going to look at is the Incarnation Cross and we're dealing
with the Right Angle Cross of Eden. So the Cross of Eden is all about ―go forth and
gain knowledge and multiply‖ and so forth and so on. Eden is very much about
going out into the world and literally that. In other words, leaving what is secure,
leaving what is potentially secure in terms of a pattern for life and being thrust out
into the world.
Often Eden people are thrown out. In other words, here is somebody at that age
who can really be pushed out into the world and forced to deal with the conse-
quences of being in the world. But this is a very special configuration. He has the
Sun in the 12.4 which is The Prophet. He has the Earth in the 11.4 and this is the
line of The Teacher and it is the aspect of the Sage. So here is somebody who had

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
extraordinary potential in his roof phase to really be a teaching prophet, to be some-
body who could truly change and impact and influence his society.
It's interesting, for example, the 36.6 is all about Justice and the inevitable survival
of right. It's all about dealing with the powers of darkness, interestingly enough, and
that they can be destroyed. And dealing with the 6.6, which is The Peacemaker, is
the discipline and integrity of a superior force to unilaterally cease conflict to permit
surrender and survival of its foe. Here is what has to be learned by this Sphinx.
Remember, he's a Sphinx. He's here to give people direction. He's here to warn
them where not to go. He's here to clarify for them. That's the very nature of his
design.
In order for him to fulfill his nature as this 3rd line Sphinx in terms of his Personality,
he is going to have to be a teacher and he is going to have to call out to others.
That's the possibility that is there for him as a being. And that the potential for him
to be an example is that he brings what is correct and he brings it regardless of the
circumstances. He is the one who has the power to instill that. So, the role that's
there for him—and it's interesting, it is a 4/6, it is a voyeur, it is on the edge while at
the same time you can see how the teacher, how the prophet can be on the outside
where everybody else impacted is on the inside.

The Environment: The Personality South Node in the 25.3
If we look at the Nodal configuration, I'm fascinated by the 25.3 that began with the
fact that's where my Mercury is and the 25.3 fascinates me because I think it is one
of seven or nine gates that is activated by Pluto. This line, the 3rd line, the detriment
is activated by Pluto. It's
a terrible detriment. But
Pluto hasn't been here
hundreds of years and
isn't going to be here for
another 80 or 90 years.
The fact of the matter is
that there is nobody alive
on this planet who carries
the detriment of the 25.3.
So, if you get the 25.3,
after all the 25th gate is a
gate of Innocence, that 3rd
line Sensibility, the only
thing that operates is the
exaltation which is: The
power of the Ego to withstand failure and still maintain its nature. The power of the
spirit to withstand failure and shock. And the recognition that innocent action does
not in itself guarantee success. Think about this Environmentally. He's in an envi-
ronment where basically he cannot fail. Think about that. This is the environment.
The environment is going to be very supportive. It is 3rd line; it's really going to re-
sonate with his Personality. This is an environment where you can withstand failure.
When you think about it that way, remember that the environment is simply not the
buildings, but it's the characters that populate that movement in life. Those charac-
ters are going to be very supportive in that sense. In other words, it's an environ-
ment where around him are going to be these people who can withstand failure, are
able to pick themselves up and keep on working. Of course, all of this is about the
potential of initiation.
The Design South Node in the 17.1
On the other side, on the unconscious side you have the 17.1. The 17 is the gate of
Opinions. It is about Openness. It is: The energy to sustain a broad spectrum of
stimuli. The possibility of having many opinions. It also means that's going to be his
environment, an environment that is full of all kinds of opinions, full of people who
are trying to organize things, full of environments where people are trying to be or-
ganized and so forth. The fact that he's going to be in that kind of opinionated,
won't accept failure environment, the potential for him to operate as a teacher and a
prophet in order to fulfill his role of being a Sphinx, all of that is being laid out.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
The Personality North Node in the 46.3
When you go to the other side of the 25 to the 46.3, this is a tendency to think about
the future as if it already exists. In other words, he's also going to be impacted by
those people who tell him where all this is going to go and often that can lead to a
lot of problems. In other words, one can lose one's focus on what one has to deal
with.
The tendency of the 46 as a Nodal point in a cycle is that it invariably brings some
level of success. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the success is reward-
ing or satisfying or that the success itself is something that is recognized in the way
one would wish it to be recognized.
The Design North Node in the 18.1
The other side, the unconscious side, is the 18th gate Conservatism and the adhe-
rence to traditional patterns despite and/or in spite of changing circumstances. Gra-
dual modification to avoid eventual upheaval. The way in which his opinions are
going to develop are going to change, but they're going to change slowly. This is not
somebody who is going to
be in an environment that
is going to accept radical
changes in his opinion.
He's going to be in an en-
vironment that's relative–
ly conservative and ob-
viously he is going to
have to break through
that relatively conserva-
tive environment.
All of that sets the stage
for him living out his
process as an emotional
Manifesting Generator
who is a Sphinx. And of
course, the way in which
he will operate in that environment, the way he will take on the tasks of the Cross of
Eden and the 4th line theme, for him to go from the 3 to the 4 is quite a trip. I’m
talking about the Personality shift. We talked about dissonance yesterday.
Here is a classic example of an abrupt shift and it’s quite a learning process to go
from the: I’m here on my own and I just banged into the wall and I’m going to fix it
and get myself going in the right direction. And on the other side is this: I have a
network, I have to be connected to other people, this is the only way I’m going to be
able to influence them. You can see that this becomes a social dynamic. In other
words, it becomes a whole social process that he has to go through.

The other thing is he probably did more study and more research in this phase than
any other phase in his process. When you look at his design, if it weren’t for the
openness of his Ajna and Head Center, this is not somebody who would be naturally
studious. This is simply somebody who had this very, very deep openness and hav-
ing the serendipity of being raised in an intellectual environment, this became his
métier.
But the fact of the matter is that the Nodes here—this is what’s wonderful—the
Nodes at the unconscious level, is you have this 1st line theme of introspection, in-
vestigation, study. It’s not just about the fact that opinions would be in the envi-
ronment, but there’s a lot of studying going on. There are a lot of very bright people
who are interacting in that kind of environment.
The Beginning of Adulthood
The being who would have this reading from me, I would really point them towards
this whole change in the environment that’s coming. Remember, think about it, this
is the child now who is giving up their childhood and beginning their young adult-
hood. Think about it that way. And here is the phase where here is the opportunity
to move to the other side, to move to the other extreme.
Let’s imagine that there is a line we can draw between the 3 pessimism and the 6
optimism. You can be on either side, close to the middle; and you can be on either
side, far from the middle; you can be on either side of the extreme from the middle.
It will simply depend on the kind of 3rd line process you go through. But the fact is,
whatever you’ve gone through in the 3rd line phase, you have to go to the other side.
Truly, the other side in the 6th line phase.
The Saturn Return: The Possibilities for the Client
So, in the introduction of the Saturn cycle, what you really bring to them is: Here is
where all your possibilities are. This is what really lies ahead for you and how impor-
tant it is for you. You can see that the unconscious Nodal 1st lines operate in harmo-
ny with the Personality and how the Personality 3rd lines of the Saturn, they harmon-
ize with the unconscious 6th lines. This is a very strongly connected Cross within that
stage. Here are really the possibilities for this being to fulfill that potential to be the
prophet, to be the sage, to be the one who brings justice, to be the peacemaker, to
be all the things that are there.
Now, if you do a reading like that for somebody who hasn’t gone through at least
some of their process, it’s really hokey. And don’t think it’s just because it’s Freud
and somebody who is well-known. I guarantee you, you look clearly, cleanly without
prejudice at anyone’s Saturn and what you’re really going to see is that this is the

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
phase where you really find your self worth. And within that context on the mun-
dane plane, this is where you find your success and well-being and all this things.
Fulfillment of Purpose
So, whenever you’re looking at and describing the thematics of the Saturn, you’re
always describing something that is a very powerful positive, but there is a condition
and it is a condition that Saturn would appreciate. The condition is: Isn’t that all
very nice; isn’t that nice. However, to get there, we’re talking about purpose. We’re
talking about fulfillment of purpose.
Remember something about the way in which the process operates. The moment
you’re lost in your characteristics, you have no opportunity to fulfill your purpose.
You just don’t. If you’re not operating correctly as yourself, if you’re not operating
correctly through your Authority or your Strategy, there is no way this kind of pur-
pose is going to be fulfilled in a way that is correct.
It doesn’t mean you don’t get the bits and pieces that are there as a frame, because
the frame is very real. But what you’re able to interact with, what you can interact
with, all of this is determined by the decisions you make and who you enter into any
relationship with, the work you do, the people you work with. Every single one of
these aspects of your life are determining factors. It all goes back to the decision
making process. The real dilemma with somebody like this is to get them to under-
stand that in order for them to really fulfill that process, they can only do that
through their respect for responding and the clarity that comes with not making de-
cisions spontaneously but waiting, waiting for the emotional system to be clear. This
is the key process for this human being.
No Talk of Characteristics in the Saturn Return
The rest of it, the fact that there are all these nice things hanging out there, what
am I not talking about folks? What I’m not talking about are all the characteristics.
It was like a question yesterday, what about this thing and this thing gets defined
and what about that aspect and do we talk about the weather impact? You notice
I’m not talking about any of that because that is characteristics. You want to get
down into that story, forget about the mythology of what the Cross of Eden brings.
Forget about the fact that this is something that has an opportunity to really to find
knowledge of value; he did by the way.

The Daily Transits
It’s very important to see that it’s not the characteristics that are the focus of this
kind of reading. For characteristics, we go back to their design in time. My favorite
analysis, because it's not even an analysis, is what happens to me because of my
work on Jovian Radio. I do the Incarnating Today segment and I get to talk about
the transits. Frankly I wouldn’t pay any attention to day-to-day transits unless
something very unusual would happen. But because it’s work I do, I’m there every
day and I deal with it. It’s fantastic. And what’s so wonderful about it is that it re-
minds you of all of those forces at work. It reminds you how these forces, how insi-
dious they can be, how conniving they are the way they sneak in. [Note: Dharmen is
now providing the weekday transit forecast in JAM.]
Think about all of us who have defined Ajna’s. Can you really discern the difference
that Pluto brings day to day, how Pluto has changed your thinking since it entered
into the 11th gate, because it’s there? It's being reminded over and over again about
the power of the conditioning field and the fact that the conditioning field is some-
thing that we are here to take advantage of, not to be overwhelmed with. This takes
you back to the basics. It’s moment-by-moment, breath-by-breath who you are.
That’s the real field of work.
Until you get beyond the characteristics, yes, you’re going to have people where you
describe their Cross and you describe the environment they will have aspects of it.
He had aspects of it. But the reality is to fulfill your purpose, to be fulfilled as a be-
ing, to be correct, to be awake, to be exactly what you’re intended to be as the ful-
fillment of purpose of your uniqueness and its contribution to everyone else. You
have to operate correctly to get there, otherwise, it’s going to be all kinds of things.
He’s a Manifesting Generator. He skipped over so much stuff, he missed so much
stuff. He wouldn’t have done that if he was operating correctly, not at all.
Edgar Cayce’s Natal Chart
I want to take a change and get out of the Freudian space and bring us to an inter-
esting configuration here. This is Edgar Cayce [Chart on the next page. Birth Data
for this lecture: March 18, 1877, 15:03 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky]. He’s somebody
that many find interesting. He showed up in my search, by the way, for triples, but I
didn’t get him in there. Obviously, this is a very interesting triple-split, particularly
the Throat. How interesting that is, because of course he was basically a channeler,
or whatever you want to call it. But he spoke in trances and things like that. So,
this very open Throat with only the 23rd gate, only this explaining gate is something
very interesting.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
Difference between a 3/6 and a 6/3
There’s a big difference between a 3/6 and being a 6/3. When you’re a 3/6, that Sa-
turn reading can be so important to you because it’s very difficult to recognize the
transition that is taking place when it takes place at the unconscious. It’s the same
thing for the 4/6. The fact is that this metamorphosis that takes place in the 3rd line,
as it moves is something that when it’s unconscious, you don’t have any access to it.
But when you’re a 6th line Personality consciously, the participating consciousness is
going to go through the process. So, it’s the Personality that is really going to suf-
fer. It’s the Personality
that’s really going to
have a dilemma. Re-
member something
about the 3/6. Their
Personality is always
going to be a 3. So
their transition on the
roof is something that
comes despite the pes-
simism of their Perso-
nality.
But here when you’re
dealing with a 6th line
Personality, you have
to see that this meta-
morphosis is very, very
interesting for them,
this process. This is a
real change that they
consciously participate in, that they’re consciously aware of. And in many ways,
they’re the ones who understand the desert island syndrome of the roof stage better
than anyone else because it really pulls them.
But of course, it’s natural for them ultimately to come to the roof because remem-
ber, only when you get to the Saturn as a 6th line being do you finally get your Pro-
file. Think about that. You’re not born that way. You grow into it. You have to ma-
ture into it. You have to leave your childhood behind and ultimately you get this
process that arises, this metamorphosis that opens up the 6th line theme.
So this is really the beginning of your process. That’s why it’s positive in that sense.
That’s why it opens up all the possibilities of optimism. It’s like getting a fresh start.
It’s wonderful, particularly for the Personality because for the Personality, it’s this in-
credible relief. It’s not as intense a relief for the 3rd line Personality in this process.

Triple-Split and the Open Throat Center
So here we're dealing with a 6/3, but again, we're going to deal with the same di-
lemma. Remember, we're dealing with a triple-split definition and we know they
have their own frequency, the movement, the so-called journey which is something
very significant for them. Here is somebody who has an open Throat Center. Having
an open Throat Center is not a great commonality and having such a vulnerable
Throat Center, this is somebody who is going to have problems with metabolism.
This is somebody who is going to have thyroid difficulties. This is a very vulnerable
Throat and at the same time, the not-self strategy of the open Throat Center is to at-
tract attention. So here is somebody who is always trying, in one way or another, to
attract attention.
The Cross of the Plane
This is the Cross of the Plane. It's interesting that we have the Cross of the Plane
because the Right Angle is the Cross of Eden. And the interesting thing about this
Left Angle is that it's all
about dealing with the
harshness of life. It's
the Cross of the Plane.
It's being in the world.
It's what makes him so
interesting. He was not
exactly in the world.
But nonetheless, here
is somebody who is
meant to be very much
in the world.
It's the Cross of Plane
people who get to see
both the beauty and
the ugliness. They get
to see things most
people don't want to
see. I guess in that
seeing, there's also
something else. There is a seeing that for him, perhaps nobody else can see. It's
very interesting, by the way, to think about that. He has no activation in the 17/62
or the 11/56. The 17 and the 11 are the gates of the eyes, which is very interesting.
So there is no activation there.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
Totally Open Spleen and Open Root
He has a totally open Splenic system. Of course we know the not-self, holding on to
things that aren't good for you. But you also have to see that this is a very, very
vulnerable immune system, and all I mean by that is that this is somebody who is
inherently very insecure. At the very bottom, the open Root. Again we have the
impatience; we have this being uncomfortable with responsibility.
The joining of the splits—I talked about the fact that for triple-splits it's not comfort-
able for them to have their splits always locked together. I guarantee you if you look
at his relationships, you'll see that the two lower splits always manage to find each
other, but it's very difficult to bridge that identity to the Ajna Center with that open
Throat that way. It's just an interesting configuration.
Edgar Cayce’s Kiron Return Chart
So, we have a 6/3. What I want to do in this case is take you to the Kiron. You can
look at the Saturn on your own—here's an example of going Left/Left Angle. In oth-
er words, this is a very, very transpersonal process. When we get to the Kiron Re-
turn itself, this is the flowering stage. This is where all the work leading up to the
Kiron is meant to pay its dividends.

Vulnerability Coming Off the Roof
For a 6th line being, this is the great challenge. And as I watch 6th line beings in my
life and people who have been part of my life for years now who are in Design, it's
fascinating for me—I'm not a 6th line person—to hear their stories, to hear the kinds
of things that are happening to them. And to really get this sense that the real
change is about vulnerability. There is a protection of the roof phase that disappears
when one comes off the roof. It's the protection that comes with the imbalance to-
wards the 6 and the fact that its trustworthiness, its leadership potential, the wis-
dom, all of these things that go with a 6th line themes, it gives it many advantages.
But just as a 6th line being is not born a 6th being, they don't go off the roof as one
either. What I really mean by that is that it's almost pointless to talk about the—it's
a synthesis, it's more than a synthesis. It's the kind of thing that, theoretically, you
can describe but you can only know what it is through somebody's telling of the ex-
perience of it. In other words, this is this quantum of what happens when the first
part of your life and the middle part of your life meet each other and become some-
thing else. This is basically what it is. There is a demand for the 6th line being to
operate as an example of their purpose.
Most Important in the Kiron: Nodes, Cross and Profile
So, when you're looking at the Kiron Return, the most important thing in the Kiron is
the Cross and the Profile. This is the most important aspect in the Kiron. Now, ob-
viously the Nodes, as I've told you all along, are very significant and they're very im-
portant. This was a very important phase for this being. This is a phase that in-
cludes Jupiter being in the
54.4, the South Node in the
41.4, the beginning of a new
experiential process, the
beginning of a new way of
dealing with things. The 19.5
is self-restraint, somebody
who is always trying to help
others in an environment
where people need help.
There are all kinds of things
that are there in terms of the
Nodal configuration and the
influence that it can be at-
tained. And at the same
time, the fact that people will
gossip and say things, this and that. I make my own comments about people like
this. All of that is going to be part of that being's later life and at the same time, the
retreat, being secretive, being in an environment where he has to be secretive,

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
where he can't tell everybody everything, where he's told things, supposedly that are
secret. All of that is in the Nodes.
The 52.6 Personality Sun and the 21.3 Design Sun
But the real key is there in the Cross configuration. This, by the way, is the Left An-
gle Cross of Demands. The Sun in the 52.6: A harmonic and balanced attunement
that is at ease regardless of
the situation. So here is
somebody who is really
going to go into a kind of
very smooth plateau in this
process; but, somebody who
has the ability to be deeply,
deeply focused.
One of the most interesting
things about this Cross is
that there are these three
very strong collective as-
pects, and then there is this
controlling aspect of the
21.3. In other words, this is
the line of where the just are condemned to futile confrontation with superior forces.
This whole thing about the need for this being to struggle, you can see his struggle,
this is a 6/3 configuration for his Kiron.
The Earths in 48.3 and the 58.6
So, he is dealing with, in so many ways, his own ghosts. And at the same time, not
being able to really share—this is the Incommunicado of the 48.3 Earth—not really
being able to share what he needs to share. And the 58.6 is all about drawing back.
It's about getting Carried Away, the potential to get carried away.
The Left Angle Cross of Demands
Everything about the Left Angle Cross of Demands is that it literally makes demands
on others. What it is demanding of others is that they expand their depth. They find
the capacity to have the energy to really enter in and see things correctly, see the
program correctly. That 21.3, the Powerlessness, the acceptance of powerlessness,
this is all about the potential for transcendence. And yet, all of this is about making
demands on others.

So, for this being entering into this Kiron, he never entered into this Kiron. I don't
think most people have the ability or whatever you want to call it, the fractal or the
good fortune to really live out their Kiron phase. What they tend to live out is simply
the line structure of it. In other words, that tends to be the framework. And of
course, in his case, it certainly isn't something that would make much difference.
The reality is that the Kiron is never, in any way, like the Saturn. I guess that's just
an obvious. It has nothing to do with being or discovering that you're a 6th line be-
ing. It's also about remembering that you've been a 3rd line being. It's about seeing
that there is something beyond being ―this or that,‖ that you're neither ―this nor
that.‖ The only way he can get to that place is through the fulfillment of that pro-
gram that's provided in the Kiron Profile. If he can take that on, in other words, if
that becomes natural for him, that's the way in which he's going to find this balance
between his 3 side and his 6 side.
The 48.3 Incommunicado and the 58.6 Carried Away
Think about the Incommunicado. It's saying to him, ―Now you shut up; don't tell
anybody anything. Don't tell them anything. Don't say a word. As a matter of fact,
this is the only way you're going to be stable. Don't tell anybody anything. Not
now.‖ Of course, that's not what he was going to do. It's totally different than his
process.
If you look at the 58.6,
the being carried
away: The tendency to
practicality that while
thoroughly enjoying
external stimulation
has the instinct to draw
back when its indepen-
dent integrity is
threatened. The ener-
gy to fuel independent
integrity that will main-
tain its identity in
times of stimulation.
It's just about: ―I'm
going to hold on to my
thing. I'm going to hold on to my trip. It doesn't matter what's going on around
me. It doesn't matter that these people think they should have access to me. It
doesn't matter. Right now I'm incommunicado. I don't have anything to say. What
I have to do is live out my life. I live out my life through a harmonic and balanced
attunement that is at ease regardless of the situation; a lack of pressure in times of
stillness.‖ And to enter into a phase of stillness and a phase of powerlessness; giv-
ing up control, not being able to apply control, not wanting to apply control. Now,
that's him.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
The Kiron Represents No Continuity to the Past
The Kiron represents no continuity to the past. Think about that: No continuity to
the past. It's not intended to. It is like, all right, you've done course A and course
B, now we're going to have a whole new process, because that's what it is. It's this
whole new process.
I hope, particularly with the advent of the Biversity, to be able to do some—because
I'm sure you've noticed that the Biversity operates just during the week. There are
certain specials I'm planning to do that will be weekend events once in awhile. One
of the themes I'm really interested in providing for the general public, and I'm start-
ing here by talking to professionals about it, is really a much more in-depth under-
standing of what it means to come off the roof. I've been talking about it and work-
ing with people now for many, many years. And it's only now in my own process of
digesting it and seeing it and looking at it carefully that I begin to understand how it
all works.
Of course, the joke is that whatever your Kiron is going to be, it's not like the de-
mand of this coming off the roof stage is a threat if you're operating correctly. I
think it's very clear that the whole concept of the Uranian lifecycle, the Kironian
process, is all connected to the advent of the nine-centered being, the Rave, Human
Design. It's obvious to me that coincidental with the understanding of this tripartite
cycle is the recognition that if you get to your Kiron and you're not operating correct-
ly as yourself, then you are at risk because you're supposed to be operating yourself.
Because only as yourself can you operate within the confines of what the program
gives you as your flowering stage.
You have to be surrendered in order for you to take advantage of that stage in your
life. Remember, it's something you must learn. He was never going to stop being
the natal chart he was. He's always going to be that. There are always going to be
those opportunities for whatever his skills are, in whatever manner to arise. And
yet, there is a great deal to learn. That learning process, how to live out the perfec-
tion of what it is to be off the roof has new rules. The rules are being provided by
the Profile and Cross of the Kiron Return.
The Long Term Cycles Theme is about Purpose
So, in our progression as we've moved through, the Rave Return is the essential
work. It's the most complex, it's where the keynotes and thematics are of value,
and it's where you can really align a client to the real process of honoring their
Strategy and Authority. This is the key in terms of our work. You can see that re-
gardless of where you're looking, whether you're looking to Saturn or this or that, or
Kiron, the fact is that when you're looking at these larger cycles, the theme is about
purpose.

LIFE CYCLES ANALYSIS

Characteristics is not the theme. Characteristics are only the theme when you're
dealing with the Rave Return because that's what it's all about—the day to day, week
to week, month to month, year to year battle with the not-self so you finally get to
the point where your client has been able to experiment long enough that they begin
to leave the conditioning behind and begin to enter into processes correctly as them-
selves.
The 6th Line Being and the Mystical Death
If they're going through that process and if we're lucky enough to get to them rea-
sonably along before their Kiron, there is every possibility that as they enter into
their Kironian experience, they are going to be able to come off the roof and they're
going to be able to come off the roof successfully. I've talked about it many times,
there are risks to not being correct when you come off the roof. There are dangers
to your well-being, both psychic and physical. There is no question that mutative
beings being mutative are much more vulnerable than others. But the fact is that if
you're operating correctly, this is the most exciting thing that can happen to you. It
really is.
When I first disappeared, I was a disappeared person, I ended up on this little island.
I began to realize, at least it appeared to me, that I seemed to be going mad. Sud-
denly I had a different name. I dressed very differently. I was a different person.
One evening I was sort of contemplating that, thinking about it. There was a very
interesting reaction that I've always enjoyed about what it is to be me. That's not an
Ego statement, because I really see Mr. Hu from the perspective of a passenger.
What was so interesting was that I enjoyed it because it was so different from any-
thing that I had ever experienced or expected. Of course, there was this rational
something in there, always holding me together as I watched that movie, the movie
of deconstruction and madness.
I think one of the things to recognize about coming off the roof is there is this tradi-
tion of the mystical death. For me, there is a real connection between this concept
of the mystical death and the potential for any 6th line being in coming off the roof.
In other words, to leave behind the constraints of both the 3 and the 6, and to allow
oneself beyond conditioning simply to enter into the process. And to enter into the
process purely as oneself with no preconditions, just go in and see what happens.
I think this is where the real miracle is and none of us have lived long enough yet
with this knowledge to have seen it emerge yet. But I'm convinced that this era of
the Kiron phase, from Kiron to the Uranus Return, this 30 odd years, I think this is
going to produce some of the most remarkable examples that humanity has ever had
in all kinds of things. It is a wonderful, wonderful evolutionary step for us as hu-
mans. It improves us as humans.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
A Return Reading Should be Earned
I think it's very important that you see in your work, because you're the ones who
meet these people who are coming into the knowledge, you meet them directly and
you have an impact on their lives, that they understand when they ask about Return
readings, put it in perspective for them. It's something that should be earned. I
don't mean you have to deny anybody. I know what it is to be entrepreneurial. You
need to make a living and all of these things, and why not tell them and so forth.
But the real story—I had an online reading not too long ago and it was obvious to me
that this person had very little knowledge and they wanted to have an Incarnation
Cross reading, which doesn't really do much good. So, I gave them a 40 minute
reading on themselves and a 5 minute reading on their Cross, because that's what
the story is about.
Until you can deal with the characteristics, until your clients understand that it is
these little things that must be conquered first before the great things can ever be
achieved. It's the day-to-day process of dealing with open Centers and split defini-
tions and all of the things that we have to deal with, with Sacrals and Solar Plexus
and Egos and Spleens and all of this stuff, we have to deal with it.
Until we have mastered it, until we have found our true inner Authority, yes, cycle
readings don't mean anything. But the moment that one is really in the process,
then they can mean so much because they can be wonderful ways of providing a
larger framework, a larger guidance in terms of what to expect, but what to expect
as a generic.
Again, always returning to the same thing, you have to get there as yourself. You
can only deal with it as yourself. And as yourself, ultimately, you're the only one
who is going to be able to tell us what it's all about. You're the only one who is
going to be able to tell us what it's about to be you in that. Of course, that's what
we want. We want finally to have differentiation as something substantiated in the
life, not just the theory that each and every human being as their own Authority can
operate correctly and can fulfill the potential of their purpose.
The Need to Have a Good Background in the Crosses
I just wanted to mention something. I think it's obvious from what we've looked at,
particularly the last several days, if you're going to get involved and do a lot of cycle
work, it's very important that you have a good background in the Crosses. There is
good material that exists through various organizations in Human Design. There is
also going to be quite a few courses that are going to be offered. I know that Ilse is
going to be offering a general introduction to the Crosses and she's certainly is
somebody who drove me crazy for years to get Cross information out of me before
anybody else.

There are also Incarnation Cross teachers. Inga and Cathy are going to be providing
live introductions to Crosses. But I really think it's important that you get as much
Cross information as you can. I think it will be very helpful for you. It will give you
a better idea of how to understand the kind of task that is given to somebody in a
cycle and the kind of rules they have to deal with. [Note: The series of four digital

Q & A
Is the Second Saturn Return a Continuation of the First?
Question: A question about the second Saturn Return cycle. Is that a different im-
printing or it is simply a continuation of the first Saturn cycle?
Ra: It's interesting. Obviously when we're doing a Saturn Return, in many ways
what we're really doing is a Saturn imprint that, theoretically, is going to last another
28 years. The advent of Kiron is so interesting because we didn't think there was
anything between Saturn and Uranus, in terms of space out there. The fact that Ki-
ron really shows up is an indication for me that there is no real second Saturn. As a
matter of fact, I think there may be a third. I mentioned that yesterday.
I'm very aware of the fact the second Saturn is something that has impact. And I
think it has a lot of impact on people who have never really entered into the Uranian
process. I think that is something that's really significant. I think that, in many
ways, the second Saturn tends to be a killer for those people. It tends to be—pardon
my Arnold Schwarzenegger—a terminator. I see a lot of people who are having diffi-
culties around the time of their second Saturn and it's clear to me they could not ful-
ly embrace the Uranian process. Basically, I'm saying live their nature as them-
selves.
So, like all things, evolution is never clean cut and I think that's really the point. The
transition in 1781 from the seven-centered to the nine-centered being, it's only these
hundreds of years later that we begin to even realize that such a thing took place
and that there is this transition taking place.
When I grew up, it was obvious that everybody was living in the Saturn world. When
my father was in his 50s, he acted like a man who was getting ready to leave this
plane, the weight of the Saturn process. And yet, it's also obvious, particularly the
much maligned now but in many ways very significant baby boom generation really
broke with the Saturnian trip. As a generation, no generation has been called more
irresponsible and immature and childlike, and mostly because these were not compe-
tent adults in their first 40 years, at least in many cases.
So, I think we have overlapping influences. We have some that are fading. We have
some that are gaining in power. I think the Uranian cycle is really gaining in power.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
Kiron was discovered in the 70s. I think any emphasis on the second Saturn is
something I don't particularly think is healthy because it's realigning one to what is,
in fact, a fading influence.
Question: So, if someone comes to you who is 56 or 56 with an astrological back-
ground and wants to have a "Saturn cycle reading through the lens of Human De-
sign," what would the appropriate or correct response be to that request?
Ra: I'd given them a Kiron. I would bypass that entirely. As I said, we are in muta-
tive times. It's the way it always goes. We still have societies on this planet that
are living in the Stone Age. There are always these remnants that are hanging
around. I think it's more important to realign them to the real potential that is there
for them in that part of their life. I don't think doing a Saturn is going to do anything
for them.
However, from an astrological point of view—because again, remember these are dif-
ferent things—there isn't any knowledge that isn't of value in certain situations. To
understand that somebody is in their Saturn and has functioned as not-self, you
know that they're under a tremendous amount of pressure. And you know it's a very
difficult time for them. My direction would then be: “Let me show you what your Ki-
ron is because this is going to indicate what you need to work with in order to make
this a worthwhile period in your life. Not to see it as an end game where Saturn is
literally going to judge you at the end of that process.”
Profiles in Cycle Returns
Question: Thank you. One more question. If you look at Edgar Cayce, you started
with a 6/3 and it became a 4/6 and then back to the 6/3. What if you're looking
back historically and you've someone who is a 2/4, no 6th lines in the chart, then a
Saturn Return you notice they are a 4/6 on a particular Cross and then the Kiron
they're a 6/3. So, in the cycles you notice that they're moving to that 6th line fre-
quency. Does that put any kind of on the roof or off the roof sequencing in their life?
Or is it just how they're fulfilling their Cross?
Ra: It's certainly something I look at. It's clear to me that there are certain themes
that simply emerge and it's obvious that you can see these themes growing stage af-
ter stage. There is a continuity in the process. It's like Einstein postulated that it's
not a crap shoot. There is a vast pattern logic to it. So, I think it's important to fol-
low those trends. I think it's important to see that there is a theme that emerges.
Obviously, if you're dealing with somebody where the 6th line theme is very strong
and it's something that's there and let's say they start off with, I think you said a
2/4, you can see right away that they're really going to be under pressure to be an
example. It's the pressure. Everything about the 6th line, it doesn't matter where it
comes from, the fact is they're going to have to learn that process. They’re going to
have to learn how to take on that 6th line role.

It doesn't mean they're going to be that. As a 2/4, they'll have to be called for it.
And it will have to come from somebody who’s part of their network that influences
them. They will have to be brought out in it. But if you see it as a continuity and
they're operating correctly, then you see that that's something they really grow into.
In other words, it adds that additional dimension to whatever it is that their actual
Cross is.
Cycle Reading for a 6th Line vs. a Non-6th Line Being
Question: Ra, how should I treat a reading with a 6th line being verses a reading
with somebody else who doesn't have 6th lines, if I'm giving them a Kiron or a Sa-
turn?
Ra: Well, I think it's very clear. With a 6th line being, whatever you're talking about
in terms of the thematics is very precise. It's much more generalized. Again, the
longer I'm in this—I've been through so many different things. Remember that so
many of these concepts are borrowed from earlier sciences, whether it's Eastern or
Western Astrology, as an example, these concepts of returns and these cycles and all
of them. In other disciplines, they take on different value.
It is very clear to me, mechanically, the Saturn and the Kiron go hand in hand with a
reading for a 6th line being. This is really the roadmap for them. I'm not suggesting,
by the way, that you do their Saturn and Kiron right away. But it's something that,
when this person comes through the door, this is somebody who those readings are
really going to be essential down the road. They're going to be very important for
them.
The Rave Return is for the Non-6th Line Being
When you have somebody who is not a 6th line being who comes in for a reading, I
never think about giving them a cycle return other than their Rave Return. Yes, it's
interesting. As I said, I'm a 5/1; I see what the impact of my Kiron is. But it's not
the same as what it means for a 6th line being. It's kind of like I'm picking up on the
residual mutation. And in fact, I'm feeling it very strongly because I'm so individual
and mutative myself. But it's very clear to me, for example, that my Saturn—yeah,
ok, but it doesn't have the same impact because it doesn't have the same alignment.
For me, the Saturn and the Kiron were made for 6th line beings. For everybody else,
what they deserve is a Rave Return.
I hope at the end of this, you really understand that this is the reading. If you're
going to be a cycle analyst, this is the reading that matters because this is the one
where you're going to be the most effective, where you're going to do the most im-
portant job. The toughest thing in Human Design is to get somebody to experiment
long enough to be able to realize the value of what it means to operate as them-
selves. And then and only then you have this tremendous potential that is there be-

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
cause everybody has it. Everybody has the magic of their Profile and their Cross.
Everybody has the potential through the program to fulfill that process.
The guideline of a Saturn or a Uranus or a Kiron for somebody who is not operating
correctly as themselves doesn't mean anything. It really doesn't. I find those kinds
of exercises—it's the kind of thing that's like reading tea leaves. It's not important.
Even though it can be truthful and accurate and this and that, because the basis of
all of this knowledge is on operating correctly, the moment you go beyond—the Rave
Return is therapy. The closest I come to any therapeutic work is the Rave Return.
To me this is the great work.
The thing about the Rave Return, you'll notice that I do not offer them online, is that
this is something that is very powerful personally. I mean directly, in somebody's
aura. If you're an analyst or teacher and you are working with a client and you give
that client their original reading and they come back to have a return, whatever it is,
seven months, eight months later, whatever the case may be, you can feel what's
going on in their process.
The Saturn and Kiron are for the 6th Line Being
Not only that, you can again bring to them the importance that: “Look, this is what's
there, you have to deal with this. If you deal with this everything changes. If you
deal with the reality of what it is to be this kind of a mechanism, what it is to be this
kind of form, if you operate this form correctly, your life gets transformed.” This is
the real work. The rest of it—for me the only essential readings, the Saturn and the
Kiron for a 6th line being are the only essential cycle readings. I think the rest of it is
a lot of curiosity.
The Incarnation Cross Analysis is for Non-6th Line Being
I think it's much more important, what equals for me the cycle analysis for a 6th line
being is the Incarnation Cross for anybody else. Because the Incarnation Cross
analysis is the real job you have to do for somebody who is not a 6th line being. This
is the roadmap for them. They're not going to go through this metamorphic process
because they're not mutative.
So to accentuate the importance of their Cross and their Nodes, to talk about the
stage for their life and the way in which they're meant to live out the role of their
life, this is the reward for me for somebody who is really working on their process
and who is not a 6th line being. The reward is that you take them in depth into their
Incarnation Cross and into the Nodes as the stage for their life and you talk about
this movement.
For me, this is the place where the Uranus Opposition belongs, but not as an analysis
of the moment of the Uranus, but as an analysis of the transition from the South

Node to the North Node. This is really what it's all about. It's this transition from
the South Node to the North Node. The moment you take somebody who is not a 6th
line being and introduce them deeply to their Incarnation Cross and their Nodes as
the real transcendent theme, the background for their life, you give them the same
advantage that the 6th line being can only get from having its cycle analyses done at
the right time.
Remember, the 6th line being is not born 6th line. So, the Rave Returns you do for
them in that first cycle and all of that is only relative to that phase of their life. Yes,
it will help them like it does for anyone to teach them about honoring what is their
nature. But in fact, they're going to go through a new process the moment they en-
ter into the next stage. They need that guidance. And those readings, then, are
very important for them.
Timing Recommendations
So, my recommendation is that if you're dealing with 6th line beings as clients, it's
good to remind them that these are readings that are important. If they come to
you and they're in between 35 and 45, make sure you do their Saturn for them as
soon as possible after their original reading. Give them some months to settle in,
see if they're truly taken in by it and are interested. But I would give them the
framework of the Saturn they're in and then let them know that there is a Kiron
waiting for them. It's very important with the 6th line being.
But if you have somebody who is not a 6th line being, then what is there as the next
step for them once they've gone through this process of beginning to work on their
design is that you take them through their Incarnation Cross analysis.
Cross to Cross, Nodes to Nodes Comparison
Question: I have a practical question. It was very interesting to see this direct
comparison from Cross to Cross and from the Nodes to the Nodes. If we go back to
Freud, you had on the Personality side the 3rd line Cross and 4th line Nodes, and then
in the cycle you had the 4th line Cross and the 3rd line Nodes. So, if we just look at
this in general, could you say that his development went from being a person who
had to try things out and had some support and some friends in his surroundings to
becoming or developing to being a person who is the friend, who really is the one
who supports others and watches the other people bumping into the wall and trying
things out. Could you put it this way?
Ra: Yes, you can, exactly. The most important thing is to realize that what's mak-
ing that happen is the environment he's in. That's what's so interesting. One of the
things I find so fascinating about the Nodes in this way is that it's such a mystery
that somehow they seem to know what's going to be all around us. To me, that's
really the magic of them.

Long-Term Cycles: Part 2
I'm a great fan of the stars. The mystery of the imprints that are coming to us from
way, way far beyond our solar system, there is a real magic that's there. And yes,
you can track it that way and just simply move along. The deeper you are into the
depth of line understanding and the deeper understanding of Profile and Cross is
something that becomes something quite comfortable and easy to be able to do.
Question: Yes, thank you, because I'm really getting to be good friends with the
Nodes. So far they've always been a bit strange to me, but now I think I can really
incorporate them much better. Thanks.
Ra: I've been talking about them for a very long time. I think when we first met I
was still in the Cross of Life. I think that slowly—it takes time. It takes time as an
individual to find the language to really bring the differentiation to this theme. I
have never had any difficulty with the planets because it's self-evident. They are fil-
tering agents and you can figure them out quite quickly because they are consistent
in the way in which they filter. The Sun is the Sun.
But when you're dealing with the Nodes, you're not dealing with something that is
really consistent in the sense that you can pinpoint it. Even when I talk about stars,
you have to see that the Nodal arc is going to open up to not just one star, but
many, many stars. There are going to be combinations of feeds that are coming in
from some arc of line of space. It's taken me a long time to finally get to a place
where I'm comfortable with the language. As soon as we get comfortable with the
descriptive language, it makes it easier for everyone to begin to work with it as a
Human Design tool.
Uranus Opposition Reading for a 6th Line Being?
Question: Ra, is there any use in giving a Uranus Opposition reading to a person
with a 6th line Profile?
Ra: From my perspective, no, not at all. I think when you do a reading for some-
body, I think Nodes are often ignored in readings. I think there has to be a return to
in the very basic reading being able to bring more depth to the Nodes and taken out
of context. In other words, taken out of the bodygraph and just seen as a frame-
work for the life. When that job is done properly, I don't think any Uranus Opposi-
tion reading is essential because I don't think it's a key.
For me, it's clear where the keys are. If you want to bring somebody to purpose in
their life who is not a 6th line being, you do that through their Incarnation Cross
analysis, and if you want to do that for a 6th line being, you take them through the
three phases of their life. I think these are the readings that are very important.
However, the Uranus Opposition is something that is deeply important. When I look
at my Nodes, they tell the whole story of my life. It's absolutely extraordinary what
your own Nodes represent as a framework for what your life is going to be. So, I

think that more than a focus on doing some kind of pinpoint of that moment of Ura-
nus, which I've never liked, the point is important, but the traditional way of analyz-
ing that, I don’t think it is. I think that seeing the Uranus Opposition through this
transition of the ―prana in‖ to the ―prana out‖ through the Nodes and then being able
to understand and describe the Nodes within this context, I think this is the most
important job to be done and it has to be done early.
Instill in Your Clients the Importance of the Rave Return
Ok, I want to thank all of you. It's been a pleasure for me. I hope you've also en-
joyed this experience. It's going to be the future of my teaching, anyway. I certain-
ly like it. It's interesting; we're getting wonderful numbers. When I start the Part-
nership Course next week, I think we have 25 analysts who are going to be partici-
pating in that one. So, this environment is attracting people at a rate that is even
better than when I was doing them live here in Ibiza. It's so nice for me that you
can all participate in the comfort of your homes and you don't have to go through all
the traveling and the expense. Here we are able to do the job together and quite
successfully communicate with each other. For me that's a win-win-win all the way
around.
So, thanks for your participation and we will have all of this registered in the registry
and I wish you well. Try to remember how important it is to give people the right
readings. Keep in mind, most importantly, the Rave Return and how that's some-
thing you really need to instill in your clients as something that they want to have
done, expect to have done and need to have done.
Again, thank you. Wherever you are, have a good day. That's it for now.
Question: Ra, before you go, just one word, something completely different. On
Tuesday we have Radio number 200. I suppose you know that, too. We put on
completely new setup. Martin Grassinger composed some music for every one of us,
so please do listen to our Radio on Tuesday.
Ra: Isn't it amazing how time goes by. 200 shows; it's really terrific. And it's inter-
esting because I don't think enough people understand what kind of fabulous value
that is. For very little money, you get a whole year of half-hour daily shows of Hu-
man Design, the contributions are interesting, and whatever. But I noticed—I put a
tagline under the bodygraph on the front page of Jovian to the fact that people could
listen to my analysis of the daily returns. It's been interesting because we've had a
lot people subscribing since then. [Note: the Jovian Archive Radio program is now
free with Dharmen Swann-Herbert providing the Daily Forecast.]
By the way, German subscriptions are up. Slowly but surely we'll win our audience
for the best value in Human Design. Anyway, folks, enjoy yourselves.
