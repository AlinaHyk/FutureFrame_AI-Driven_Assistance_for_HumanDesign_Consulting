THE FOUR VIEWS INTRODUCTION
This course was designed for newcomers to Human Design and was originally
presented in the Fall of 2007. Over these 11 Lectures Ra looks at Type, Definition,
Authority and Profile. Armed with these basics of Human Design you have all you
need to know for correct decision making.
Although this is a basic course, it is comprehensive and Ra goes into depth on the
minor authorities which are less well understood. It is a wonderful resource for HD
Professionals.
The course begins with the three Views on Type, Definition and Authority which are
derived from what is seen in the BodyGraph. The fourth View is about Profile and is
different from the others because it is a view that we get from the database. Profile
is the beginning of establishing a style for life and is often described as a basic
costume that we wear. Profile structure and the generics of the 12 Profiles are
discussed.
The original course illustrations are included in this 199 page book.

Lecture One
An Introduction to Definition
Okay, good morning to all of you. Before I start I‘d like to say hello to all of those
that are in the United States who are downloading this and also to the group in
Russia that is receiving this through translation and particularly to all of you that are
here live, it‘s a much more enjoyable process. Every semester in the IHDS program
I like to go back to basics. It is really in the basics where the real story of the value
of Human Design can be found. For me it is essential that anyone regardless of the
level of their education in the knowledge that the only way that you can really be of
value to someone else or that you can really be able to benefit in this life is by
following where your definition points you.
When I first began transferring the knowledge, that is, beginning the process of
training people to become analysts—Human Design is very visual. And it really is
the magic of being able to work with a design to understand the design. The
BodyGraph is something that provides you with all the information that you need.
When I began looking at developing an analytical approach in terms of training
people to see the BodyGraph, for me it was all a matter of how you looked at it,
these views, the Four Views that we‘re going to take a look at over the course of the
semester.
Definition is the Life Force
First and foremost at the very basis of
everything is definition. Definition is so
profound in that sense. When I was given
the knowledge I was given the design of
forms of which human happened to be one
of them. And the design of forms began
with the inanimate. When you look at the
design of the inanimate all you get to see is
the potential of a gate. One gate, as a
matter of fact, nothing more nothing less.
In other words, when you're looking at a
gate in a design that's just sort of hanging
around, when you're looking at one of
those gates you're looking at, in a sense
and only in the sense, so don't take this too

literally, you're looking at something that is inanimate, it's waiting to be animated.
It's waiting to take on a life of its own.
One of the things to grasp about the nature of definition is that when you're moving
along the design of forms and you take this leap from the inanimate to the animate,
when you move from the inanimate object to the single cell, because there is a
design for the single cell, that the single cell itself, which is the potential of the 15th
gate and the 5th gate and the hanging 3rd gate, that everything about the design of
that single cell is rooted in the potential of definition. In other words, the moment
we go from the inanimate to the animate, the moment that we have life as we
understand it, there has to be definition. Without definition there is no life force.
That‘s really something to grasp. Definition is the life force.
Definition is the Result of an Activation
To begin with, the first thing that you get to see about definition is that definition is
the result of an activation at one end of a channel and an activation at the other end
of the channel. The fact of the matter is that the gates that are on either end are
very different from each other. The assumption of many people when they first look
at Design is that their focus is on the
fact that there are these gates and
with these gates come lines and the
lines have explanation. But the fact
is that when those gates are in
connection with each other a life
force emerges, which is neither of
the gates. It is a quantum
phenomenon; it is a whole that is
greater than the sum of its parts.
That definition is something that is
unique in and of itself and it carries
the life force.
When we‘re looking at somebody's
design, what are we actually looking
at? I mean to go back to the basics.
When you‘re looking at this design,
what in fact are you seeing? There
is a lot of confusion, for example, about the relationship of Human Design and
genetics. You know when you look at the Human Design mandala, when you look at
the wheel every single aspect of the genetic code is strung out on that wheel, all of
it. And every single one of those potential aspects is there in 64 gates that are there
in the construct of the BodyGraph.
When you look at this person‘s Splenic Center, they have a very open Splenic Center
with one hanging gate, you look at this open Splenic Center and the moment that
you're looking at this what you are seeing is not somebody that doesn't have the

An Introduction to Definition
particular codon amino acid construct that is related to the 48 or the 57 or the 44,
they would not be alive. We have everything within our body. If you go into the
cell, in the genome of the cell, everything is there. It‘s why we have the potential of
the principle of cloning, that from a single cell you have all the information, all of it is
there.
Everything is a Binary: Imprints and Receptors
The thing to recognize about the nature of the BodyGraph is that the BodyGraph is
looking at two things, always, because everything about Human Design is a binary.
Everything is a binary. And basically you're looking at two things. You're looking at
imprints and receptors. The imprints are obvious because we have them all marked
down. These are the imprints. But the receptors aren't marked down at all. There,
here in the openness, all these places where there is the openness, every single one
of those is in fact a receptor. This is the great trap of being in form.
If we were just our imprint everything would be rosy, but that's not the way it works.
It isn't. It‘s not the way it works at all. The moment that you're in a bio-form you‘re
caught in the genetic imperative and the genetic imperative ultimately lives out
through attraction. And we are attracted to what we are not. So it is our receptors
that are open to conditioning in this life. It is all those receptors that move us away
from the possibility of what we might or could be in this life.

The Imprint: Everything That is Possible for You
Everything about what's possible for you is in the imprint, everything. These are the
highlights. You take two cells in the body, one is a bone cell and one is a muscle
cell, and they're a bone cell and a muscle cell in the same body. And if you go into
their genetic information you see that the genetic string that is there is identical.
After all, it‘s the same DNA in both of those cells and yet, one is a muscle cell and
one is a bone cell. They do different things, they have a different function and why?
Because along that genetic code there are certain points that are imprinted, they‘re
highlighted. It becomes the focus of the function. It‘s what we‘re like. It is what we
are—humans—all of these cells, and each of us with the possibility to differentiate.
Human Design is the science of differentiation, it is what makes us different. Not
what makes us the same. It‘s the receptors that draw us to sameness. We live in a
homogenized conditioned world, a world of the not-self. But where differentiation
begins it begins in definition because definition leads you directly to the key in this
life. It is definition, or in the rare case as in the Reflector, the lack of definition that
leads to what is the strategy in the life. And it is the definition that leads to the
Strategy and the Authority. It starts with the definition.
Definition is Hardwiring
This is why when you look at somebody's design, and you see that they're this Type
or that Type and there is their Strategy and Authority and this is what can make
their life correct, it is rooted back here at the very beginning of the process in the
definition itself. This is hardwiring. It is what definition is, hardwiring. And in that
lies security, consistency. In a sense it is our perfection. It does not waver. It
remains the same with every breath throughout the life. The muscle cell doesn't
suddenly decide that it's going to become a heart cell, or whatever.
We are caught in this duality. Human Design is a very, very surface thing. It‘s the
mechanics of the maia. Oh yes, it can be very deep, very deep in the sense of how
all the knowledge fits together into a holistic whole. But everything about it is what
goes on, on the surface, because it's here on the surface that the difference in the
life is achieved. And it is achieved through something very, very fundamental. This
pointless question about what is the nature of life.
Life is about decision-making. It isn't about anything else. It's never been about
anything else. It is about decision-making. You see, we live in a binary. We are
always navigating between a ―this‖ and a ―that.‖ And yet when we navigate with our
minds truly we are lost, because it is not the key to our navigation. But this is what
we do in this life, decision after decision. This is how we steer.
I'm never far away from the metaphysics of understanding our nature, and it begins
with something so fundamental and basic to grasp. We are moving. And I don't just

An Introduction to Definition
mean in the obvious sense that we have a locomotive system as a creature. No, I
mean that everything is moving. Everything has always been moving and fast. We
are all objects moving in space. And if we are objects that are moving then the
trajectory, the angle, the geometry, whatever label you want place on it, our
alignment within that movement is everything.
Getting Lost in the Receptors
Human Design is about steering with the driver behind the wheel and not steering
with the passenger trying to take control of the wheel. The driver is there in all of
us, the magnetic monopole. When you operate according to your Strategy and
Authority you align yourself to what is the correct movement. It‘s what it's all about.
And in order to get there you start with, and all in fact you will ever need, is to
understand the definition, because it's the definition that gives you the key to how to
drive in this life. One decision at a time as yourself, not decisions that are
conditioned by the receptors.
And of course this is what human beings live. They don‘t live who they are or they
don't live the potential of what they might be. But they are lost in the receptor
world, always looking for that receptor, and in always looking for that receptor,
always looking for something that is not who they are, and a mind that is only
interested in supporting the not-self. And these receptors become powerful because
they operate in unison. The open Spleen becoming a strategy of holding onto things
that are not good for you, the open Sacral not knowing when enough is enough, the
open Root always under pressure in a hurry. And then the gaps, the gaps that are
there between the splits, and the pressure that‘s there on those gates, those
receptor gates.
How easy it is for a human being to get
lost in their receptors. It's the muscle
cell wanting to be a bone cell. Not such
a good idea. And oh, what a mess that
leads to, it‘s a mess. It‘s not the
imprint. It‘s not the job or in terms of
the mysticism of it, the purpose. To me
it is just clear that it is a role. It is a
potential role that is there. We live in a
world of not-self roles and not-self
purpose and not-self fantasy. But there
is a true possibility for us, but it is
rooted in what we are given genetically
as a distinct role, our imprint. And in
that imprint you get the whole story,
instantly.
You look at this definition. We strip it
away of all of the other things, all the

hanging gates, just leaving the definitions themselves. We have these three
definitions here, you can clearly see that this is a triple split and of course today is
an introduction, over the next couple weeks we‘re going to look at the four basic
variations of definition and lack of definition. But here I want to focus simply on the
power of what is there in terms of the definition itself. What is it really saying? It
actually is describing your life force. Remember that, it's your life force.
A Defined Solar Plexus Center
Now where does the life force begin in this design? The first thing that we have to
come to grips with is that we have a defined Solar Plexus Center. That immediately
distinguishes this being right away. Around just under 51% of humanity are
emotionally defined. So, just over half
are emotionally defined. And when it
comes to inner authority, that is, that
inner authority is anything other than
mind, that when it comes to inner
authority the emotional system is
automatically, when it‘s present, when
it's defined the emotional system is
automatically the authority in the life,
automatically.
So, right away, we know something
about this being and the way in which
their life force operates, the way in
which they are going to be able to steer.
They‘re only going to be able to steer
over time. They're not going to be able
to make spontaneous decisions about
which direction they're going to go in as
a driver. They‘re an emotional being.
And it means as an emotional being they are going to operate in the movement of
the emotional system, what is referred to as a wave.
Definition Brings out Your Uniqueness
This is who they are. And more than that, what‘s defined isn‘t just the life force. As
the life force is the only thing that you can trust that‘s you, that's really you. It‘s
what definition brings you. It brings you your uniqueness, your difference. This
being can only live out their difference if they follow their emotional authority. There
is no other way. It is going to be the root of who they are. And through the
definition instantly we get to see what the authority is. We get to see as well that
authority rooted in the Type. This is a Projector, a triple split emotional Projector.
And we know that the strategy of a Projector is to wait for the invitation.

LECTURE ONE
An Introduction to Definition
This definition, what it is saying is not only can you trust this because it's consistent
so that you can learn to rely on it, you can learn to recognize its integrity and
validity, but you also have to see that it is the only way through your definition that
you get to live out your life, because your life is a nuance. It is a difference from the
other. We're not here to be lost in the receptors, we‘re not here for that. And all of
this is about learning how to steer.
This is the surface. If somebody had told me I‘m a Manifestor, somebody had told
me in my 20s that all I had to do was inform and I would unload so much pressure in
my life, I can't imagine what an enormous different track my life would have taken.
I never would've needed to know anything whatsoever about this knowledge. It is
like a Generator. You say to them, look it‘s just about response. Make decisions in
response, only in response. You don‘t need to know anything else. Not to change
your life, not to transform it, not to discover what is there for yourself.
This movement of ours, it‘s not about vast shifts in movement, it really isn't. These
are minor adjustments that you make in your correctness that opens up your ability
to be able to see what is there for you to see. And it all goes back to the definition.
And it's not just that the definition establishes what is your Strategy and Authority,
but it establishes in so many ways a blueprint of how you are going to be
experienced in the world.
The Aura
Think about definition another way. Think about somebody who doesn't have a
defined G Center or Throat. When this person steps into another aura they put their
definition into the other. When you put your definition into the other, not only is it
amplified by the other, and of course it will depend on the configurations, but it is
the way in which they most profoundly receive you in the sense of how they identify
you. This is your consistency. It's your consistency. It means that this is the
consistent way in which the outside world feels you, takes you in, and recognizes
you.
It‘s something to grasp about the aura. The aura is an amazing thing. We are in an
energy shell. We are after all nothing but frequency and the fact that we think we
are solid is just the illusion we live with. And the auric frequency of a human being
can be quite large. Stretch your arms out on either side as far as they can stretch
and then add another arm's length and move it all the way around you in a sphere
and you have an idea of the range of the human aura.
And when you walk into the aura of somebody else, when somebody else enters into
your aura you exchange definitions, in a way. But this is how you see each other.
And think of the irony that what you're putting into the other is your definition, and
yet what you're trying to live is not. The tragic irony of the not-self, never living out
the full potential of its nature because it is lost in the conditioning patterns, lost in
the conditioning field. And each of these definitions has an expression, an
expression that emerges out of that being through their aura.

A Projector Aura
A Projector aura is very unusual. It is a focusing aura. It is a focusing aura that
literally just focuses in on the other. As a matter of fact, the healthiest meetings of
Projector are with one person at a time because of this power of their aura to focus.
But it also means that in their focusing
their aura outward, in their probing with
their aura, they‘re also very open. And
here their definition can be taken in
deeply by the other.
So what does somebody take in from
someone like this? Here is somebody
with a consistently logical mind. This is
a question-and-answer mind. This is a
busy thinking mind, a logically thinking
mind. And when this person steps into
the other person‘s aura they
immediately turn on that system. They
can be inspiring, or they can be a
headache; but nonetheless, this is who
they are. They‘re a 31/7, the channel of
the Alpha, a design of leadership for
good or bad. And this is an aspect that
is felt particularly when they speak,
because it is reliably who they are. They are here, in one way or another depending
on the nuances, here to display their alpha potential. And they‘re a 40/37, and
they‘re a 40/37 twice, and this, of course, is the channel of Community and the
channel of the bargain, and one of the deepest channels of the tribe, the only
connection between the Ego and the emotional system.
A Triple Split
These three definitions become the bedrock of this being‘s process. It‘s who they
are. And in the case of them being a triple split definition as you'll see when we look
at the various definition constructs, they have the dilemma in terms of always trying
to find a way, to find a balance between the three different ways in which they
operate. Definition becomes something that can be very complex, after all. We
have single definitions and pure split definitions and triple split definitions and
quadruple split definitions and Reflectors. So there are many, many subtleties to the
way in which this operates.
But think about what that definition brings. It brings the life force. This is a logical
community leader life force. It is just what it is, this logical mind, this logical ability

An Introduction to Definition
to be able to direct and guide others, a natural thing for a Projector. But all of it
determined upon whether or not they are going to be able to steer correctly. If
they're able to align their life correctly they're going to be able to integrate these
three aspects of themselves in a way in which the holistic result is their ability to be
able to live out their purpose. But it's going to mean something very, very important
for them. It's going to mean that they need to be able to recognize the right forces
to be associated with, the right beings to be associated with. And that's not a
judgment call from their mind, but it has to come from their authority. And the
decisions have to be rooted in that Strategy and Authority.
When I look at anybody's definition I can see a wonderful story or I can see a horror
story, because again we are living with a binary. We‘re living with the ―this‖ and
―that.‖ One of the things to understand about the mechanics of the maia is that
basically it provides you with the way of finding your point in the spectrum in terms
of the way in which you move in this life. So, there is no longer the torment that the
mind brings, because of course for the mind every decision is something that can be
speculated upon in any possible way. And the results of any decision can be
speculated on—could've, should've, might of, all the things that go on with the mind.
The mind is always involved in ―this‖ and ―that‖ and is never completely committed
to either, it can't. So, when your mind tells you to do something and you do it and it
doesn't work your mind says, well, let's try this then. It‘s not the point for the mind
to be correct.
But the moment that you're following Strategy and Authority, you‘re following a fixed
way of decision making, and one, of course, that bypasses the mind. It just does.
The dilemma for this being, the dilemma for all emotional beings is learning to
embrace the power of what can be a very discomforting system. The emotional
center, the Solar Plexus Center is so deeply complex. It is more complex than the
mind. That is, the brain-mind system. It is under extraordinary mutative pressure.
It is the very source of our human process, that is, the human experiential way that
moves from the 41st gate to the 30, and the 36 to the 35. This is a basic instrument
of the human process.
The World is Dominated by the Solar Plexus
And then by understanding that just over half of humanity is defined emotionally,
which means that the other half of humanity is open to emotional inflation and
emotional amplification, that we live in a world that is dominated by the Solar
Plexus, much more so than one would think in the sense that we are brain-mind
dominated. This is a plane that is dominated by the emotional frequency. So, it has
an enormous impact in our lives. And yet at the same time, it is not well
understood, which is one of the great dilemmas that we live with. And in not being
well understood it means that there is very little being offered to the billions of
human beings who are emotional in terms of being able to come to grips with what
their emotionality signifies, and more than that, being able to grasp the awareness
potential that is there.

The dilemma of the Solar Plexus is that it is a motor. When you look at the
development of the awareness process in human evolution what you get to see is
that the first major steps are non-motorized. We have a Spleen that is not a motor;
we have an Ajna Center that is not a motor. That is very different from the
emotional system, which is a deeply powerful system. The fact is that if the Ajna
gets to the Throat, nothing happens but the potential of speech. If the Spleen gets
to the Throat, nothing happens but the potential of speech. But oh boy, when the
emotional system gets to the Throat all hell can break loose, because of course it can
manifest as action.
It is a motor, and it is the motor principle of the Solar Plexus that is so distorting,
because the dilemma of that motor system is that it operates in a way in which it is
interpreted as up and down, hope and pain, a frequency of good to bad and bad to
worse and back again. And obviously when we think about a planet that is unaware,
living in the thrall of the emotional frequency, that life is just what the emotions
deliver in the raw sense of this life seen as nothing but either pain or those in pain,
and then suddenly being hopeful and it goes on and on and on. The level of
suffering on this planet is enormous. Not that I blame that on the emotional system,
by the way, but nonetheless the emotional system certainly dramatizes clearly the
suffering that is here on this plane.
Something to grasp is that underneath this disruptive motor potential is an
extraordinary sensitivity. And it is an extraordinary sensitivity that is rooted in
experiential depth. This is something that is unique to the Solar Plexus as an
awareness process. In other words, there is this movement in the emotional flow
that allows for differing perspectives on the same thing. And of course this is the
great gift of emotionality. That is, by going through a process of, simply put, up and
down, one is able to look at the same thing from different perspectives along the
way.
Timing and Waiting
Not everybody's in touch with their emotions. I know so many designs in which the
emotions are only activated unconsciously in which the being themselves as a
personality is unable to really identify with them. But the fact of the matter is that
when you look at emotionality and you look at the nature of a life that the question
becomes a question of time. Timing becomes everything. It's what waiting is about
as an emotional being.
We talk about clarity. The thing about the emotional being is that the emotional
being can never be absolutely certain about anything ever, ever. It doesn't work
that way. What they can be is clear. That is, have a level of clarity. The kind of
feeling that says to you, yeah this is probably all okay. But it's not—this is
completely and absolutely and positively, because it doesn't work that way. It's the
great curse of the abstract process.

LECTURE ONE
An Introduction to Definition
The Abstract and the Logic
When you look at the logical process, the logical process says 1 and 1 is 2, and
therefore, if I do this and that, I'm going to get to there. And because it's based on
patterns and because it is logical, one can actually achieve that. So, there is always
the possibility in identification in logic for satisfaction. But on the abstract side it is
very, very different. The abstract would love to be logical—if I do this and this I‘m
going to get that. But it doesn't work that way. It doesn't, and never can.
One of the things to recognize about the emotional system is that the emotional
system explores the world in a unique way. So different from anything else that we
have. The very embodiment of the unique life is the unique experience and the
profundity of the emotions when they can wait. The story of this person's life is in all
the planets and the lines, the ―this‖ and ―that.‖ And I can go on and on and on and
on in describing any design. There's so much information that is available.
But again, the fact that there is all that information isn't the point. What makes this
a science is that this isn't just a superficial belief system, that there is a legitimate
scientific construct behind all of this. But that's not what the story is about. The
story is lived out on the surface in the definition, because if you can live the
definition you are living your life. You will get your life and these forces. This life
force that is here in you gets to emerge. And you can see that every time that you
look at a definition as a life force and you look at, as we will, the different variations
of definitions and the different variations of splits, to begin to understand the
dilemma, for example, of this triple split in trying to find a way to bring out one life
force, to bring this all together into one force. This is movement in their life. As a
matter of fact, the triple split is the ideal example of this, the need for movement,
the need to go out the door and to mingle and to take advantage of the auric field.
No Connection between the G Center and the Emotional System
The story of this person is here in the definition. And
we have a dilemma. That dilemma is that their
identity is not connected to their authority. It isn‘t.
There is no connection here between the G Center
and the emotional system. And this identity is
connected to the Throat. And the moment that you
have Throat definition you have the way in which the
life force in this being is articulated. The 31st gate is:
I think I can lead or not. That is basically what this
voice says.
Now, think about it. Here is the dilemma of a split
definition. Because this Throat isn‘t connected and
its identity is not connected to the emotional Ego,
there is no control over this Throat. This can be a terrible babbler. This is somebody
that can always shout out that they are the ones that can lead and nobody pays any

attention to them. As a matter of fact, they can have a very, very uncomfortable
time, because of course they are a Projector. They're here to be invited. If you are
a Projector and you have a defined Throat and you‘re starting conversations,
ultimately it's going to lead to problems for you. It‘s true also if you have an
undefined Throat and you‘re a
Projector. But I mean, it is simply
something to grasp, that inherent
in the definition is the need for this
to be the expressed life force. So,
if this person cannot express, ―I
think I can lead‖ to those who ask
it, it‘s never going to get to live
out the beauty of its life.
And remember it's a Projector.
And as a Projector it is designed to
be recognized. That Projector
aura is like the light on a
lighthouse. When that light shines
on you, you notice it, whether it's
across the room or not you notice
it. Projectors get their notice.
And until you begin to trust in your
mechanics, only then are you
going to be able to live out with
grace the life force that is there in
you. There is a bargain that has
to be struck here before this
person will lead. And it's only when that bargain is made, only when it is clear
emotionally, that the power of this Throat then can take on its full significance.
In the hierarchy, in the way in which the Types are constructed, the world that we
live in is dominated by Generators and Projectors. And it is the role as a Type for
Projectors to ultimately be guides, and to be guides of Generators. And I don't mean
the leaders of Generators, bosses of Generators, or anything else. I'm just talking
about the fact that the great gift of the Projector, ultimately its wisdom, is to
understand how to use energy effectively.
Definition: The Student / Openness: Courses One Takes in Life
One of the things to understand about what you are not is that when it stops being
the conditioning force that controls your life it becomes the gateway to wisdom for
you in your life. What is defined in you is the student. What are open in you are
literally the courses that you take in life. This being is going to need to find out
about how to look after themselves. They've got an undefined immune system.
They have to look after themselves and have to learn how to love themselves in

LECTURE ONE
An Introduction to Definition
order not to be dependent on others to help them feel good. This is where they go
to school in this life.
They have to understand that they are not an energy type, that they have to know
when enough is enough, because if they don't find out when enough is enough
they're going to live a life of physical exhaustion that will lead to mental exhaustion.
They have to learn how to use energy efficiently, effectively, because this is the
potential of their wisdom in this open Sacral, to understand life.
The Root Center
And here to understand the whole pressure system; oh, the Root is so powerful.
Here is somebody all their life that it's so easy for them to be placed under pressure.
And for them to recognize that because that force is there, it has driven them in their
life to move at a speed through things that denies
them their potential. They‘re courses. And there
are all the gates, all those things to learn about, but
to learn about it from a position of integrity and
inner power.
Think about decision making. Think about what
happened to you when you came into the world.
You come into the world, you come into a family.
You're automatically controlled. Decisions are made
for you. They begin with what you will eat, what
you will wear, where you will live, who you have to
deal with all the time, who you cannot deal with.
And then the authority is given over to your
schoolteacher and it's given over to all the other authorities that are there in your
life. And until you are somewhere between 15, 20 just about every major decision in
your life has been made for you. You have had no authority, none. And then you‘re
thrown out into the world and everybody says okay, you're on your own now. You
don't know how to live by your own authority, you don't know what that is, and you
don't know what that brings into your life.
You’re Never Free with the Mind
The mind, even when it makes a good decision is still chewing on how bad it could
have gone. You‘re never free with the mind. You‘re never free to just deal with
what is there now in front of you. And you can only do that when you're secure in
where you are going as a being in this life. And that security is one thing and one
thing only—who is driving? Is it your mind? Your mind is going to make decisions
based on the open Spleen or that open Sacral or that open Root, or this or that or
the other thing that has nothing to do with you. Are you going to trust that driver?
The driver that's never really sure where to go, even when it tells you it is.

This is the whole point. It‘s why definition is such a magical thing, because it is the
key. It takes you directly to the key. It says, here, look, this is how you make
decisions as yourself. And in doing so, this is how you release your unique life force
in whatever its potential may be. And when you make decisions as yourself
according to your Strategy and Authority, over time what you begin to see that this
is something that you can trust. Oh, how important that inner trust is for somebody
like this who will have to go through many years, because it is a learning curve for
the Projector. How important it is to get to that place of trust in your own authority
and not that of somebody else. Not your lover, not your friend, not your dog, not
anything; your authority, not God, not government, your authority.
Authority is Rooted in Definition
And your authority does not come out of this openness. It is rooted in your
definition. It tells you literally here you are, this is your whole story, and this is your
whole potential. This is a thinking leader for the community. There are so many
ways that I can move around the keynotes of this definition and all they have to do
is follow where the definition points them. This is what it means to differentiate. To
differentiate literally means that you live out the possibility of your unique role on
this plane. We all have one.
And oh, yes, there's an enormous amount of information in all of this. There are all
the other views as you'll see. And each view brings its own perspective. It brings
another layer to looking at the holistic design and seeing what's there in that being.
All these points of activation, all of them
get realized in only one way. This is the
point. Everything about the basics of
Human Design is that once you grasp the
basic mechanics you get to see that
that's the point. It isn't anything else. I
know that there are people in Design
who keep on studying Design to sort of
constantly reaffirm things. But the fact
of the matter is that the moment that in
the mechanics your Type and your
strategy is revealed everything else you
need to know about yourself you can
experience by watching it, and what a
lovely thing to do for your mind.
There is a great struggle in the holistic
transformation of a life. It is very easy
from the perspective of this knowledge
to be able to transform the body. It‘s very easy. All you have to do is follow your
Strategy and Authority; your vehicle will be aligned to its correct direction, and in
such your life changes. It just changes and everything about it in terms of the way

LECTURE ONE
An Introduction to Definition
in which you perceive it, experience it, and so forth and so on. But that is something
that is physical. It doesn't necessarily mean that there is a transformation that is
taking place with mind. Mind is the last thing to surrender.
And yet, one of the things to recognize about coming to grips with who you are or
the potential of who you are, that it is something that only you can discover. I
mean, I can read your design. Any good analyst can read your design, but in
essence they‘re reading a generic interpretation of it. You are after all, a unique
being in a unique space and time. The potential that is there in your design is only
one that you can realize. Not one that somebody else can see. In fact, it is the
great beauty of this. We're not looking to create a homogenized result. Human
Design isn't about everybody who follows their Strategy and Authority acts the same.
This is not Catholicism or Islam or any of these old religions. It‘s not about that. It‘s
about that every human being has the possibility to be unlike anything anywhere
else, or unlike anything that has ever been.
In Uniqueness There is No Measurement
This is what the point is, this is what it's all about, about fulfilling the potential of
your uniqueness and in uniqueness there is no measurement. It‘s not about whether
you‘re better or worse or good or bad or best or least or all of that stuff. There is no
comparison. The moment we‘re controlled by the authority of others we are always
in the comparison game, always. And all your life you‘ve been forced into that
game. This is not what this is about. Definition is something that is incredibly
profound. It is the very basis of how the binary system operates. It is the basis
upon which all bio-forms function. No life form can operate without definition as a
potential.
So it is essential to see that in order for us to live our life that we need to not only
live out these life forces within us, but we have the great good fortune of having a
technique by which we can do so. The fact that Strategy and Authority appears to
be simple is that we're not as, on the surface, complex as humans would like to
imagine. And it is this very simple mechanical differentiation between this Type and
that Type, and this authority and that authority that frees one from the dilemmas of
the not-self life. That's the thing to grasp.
If you take in this knowledge only from the mental plane and you do not operate in
the experiment of living out this knowledge you really truly are not gaining anything.
There is no way that this person understanding what I‘ve just described is going to
be able to deal with the conditioning of those open centers. They have no way of
handling that, because their very mind is based on it. It won‘t help them. It isn't
going to change anything.

The Imprint and the Receptor
We have this struggle between the imprint and the receptor. And when we‘re correct
they both operate as they should. Through the imprint we have our uniqueness, and
we fulfill our potential. And through the receptor we learn and potentially become
wise. This is the beauty that is there in the binary of this construct. But in the end,
to be able to live your life correctly, to be able fulfill your potential, to do the most
simple of things, to take the burden off your shoulders that you‘ve been carrying, all
you need to do is follow Strategy and Authority, follow where the definition leads and
at the moment that you're doing that you are for the first time in your life truly
releasing what is your life force and beginning to see where that leads to.
I like the simple. I don't trust complexities; never have and never will. If there is a
universal truth it can only be simple, because only then can it be grasped by anyone.
This is what is so special about this knowledge. Strategy and Authority is something
that is so perfectly simple and yet universal. It‘s over 20 years now of watching it at
work in the lives of human beings, it‘s a great gift, and to see from the beginning
where it comes from. There are so many levels of the knowledge in Human Design
now that it's easy to search for the deeper and deeper and deeper analytical insight.
But, I remind all of you and I remind students all the time the story is on the
surface. And by grasping definition you've grasped the essential knowledge of
Human Design.
Okay, that was a pleasure. I‘m glad you are all here. I hope you enjoyed that. I
look forward to being with you next week; bye for now.

Lecture Two
Single and Split Definitions
Hello and good morning to all of you here. We continue our exploration into
definition and we‘re going to look at the four different types of a definition. That is,
there's actually a fifth, that is, the lack of definition. I‘ll talk about that as well. But
here you can see we are looking at single and split definition. The first thing to
recognize in that is that between single and split definition you have approximately
somewhere around 88% of humanity. Triple split definitions are round 11% and the
quadruple split definition is very rare. It is much less than a single percentage. So
in fact, when we're looking at single and split definition in the same way that in
looking at Type as you'll see when you're looking at Generators and Projectors you‘re
really looking at the dominant theme of the way in which we operate. In other
words, single and split definition by representing around 87 or 88% of the human
population, these are the two basic definition dynamics.

Single Definition
We‘re going to begin with looking at a single definition. Again the construct is very
simple. That is, a definition is always when you have a gate activated at one end of
the channel and a gate activated at the other end. Automatically this brings about a
definition and of course it turns on the centers that are involved in that definition. In
order for a definition to be single definition, the aspects of definition, and here we
can see in this particular configuration that we have two different aspects of
definition that they are
continuously connected to
each other. So, this is what
we get as a single definition,
that is, a continuous
connection of definitions.
Now of course it can get
quite complex. I'm a single
definition and I have five
centers that are connected
continuously in that single
definition. I‘ve seen all kinds
of amazingly complex single
definitions and also a great
many simple definitions. In
other words, a design in
which there is only one
channel that is defined. And
yet, in all of those the
thematic or the general thematic remains the same. That is, in terms of the way in
which we use the terminology in Human Design they are a single definition.
Think about this knowledge and when you do think about it you always have to think
about it in terms of duality. Human Design is a dualistic system. Everything about
this knowledge is rooted in dualism. And the dualism is evident in the basic
construct that we use, that is, the BodyGraph. And the way in which the BodyGraph
is laid out for us in terms of as an analytical tool, as we see it here in this illustration,
the first thing you notice about the fact that this is a binary is that it's obvious that
we have two different sets of calculations; that is, we have the personality and
design calculations. Automatically we are dealing with this binary set of information.
And what we get to see in the BodyGraph, that is, the quantum of these two sets of
information, what happens when this information is brought together is that when
it's brought together it's still brought together into what is basically a visual duality,
something easy to see. And what I'm referring to of course is that you have these
systems that are colored in and you have this continuous definition. But then you
have something else. You have as a counterpoint to that the other side of the
duality of the construct of the way in which a BodyGraph is activated, is that you

Single and Split Definitions
have the openness. And every BodyGraph, with the exception of Reflectors and
again they are an exception, that 99% of humanity is defined in a sense, not to
confuse terminology, by this basic duality. That is, the counterpoint between what is
fixed in you, what is defined and reliable and what is open.
This is the great dilemma. I have a wonderful Tuesday in my life now in this
teaching year in this semester. Here I am in my morning and I'm at the very
beginning and surface of Design and looking at Human Design. And what for me is a
matter of six or seven hours later, I'm at the most complex level of looking at
Human Design. It is for me an extraordinary counterpoint, because my morning
always reminds me of the inherent truth in this knowledge, it's very simple. The gift
of the knowledge is that through its graphic quality it is really able to provide us with
a very simple clear way to look at things. And once we‘re able to see the way
something functions, the way something operates, the possibility then to be able to
learn from that what in Human Design, for example, is called Type and strategy.
That is, to see the way the mechanics operate and in seeing the way the mechanics
operate to be able to develop specific strategies to take advantage of that.
Openness Dominates Life
When you're looking at this basic configuration, boy, are you ever looking at the
whole story. And it's not about how deep you can go, because how deep you can go
just brings layers and layers of
additional information that in essence
is fascinating, but is not the key. The
key is always on the surface and the
key is in this counterpoint. It is
everything. And when I say this
counterpoint the counterpoint between
what is defined and what is open. And
you cannot talk about definition or
understand definition until you
understand what it is a counterpoint
to, because it is the openness that
dominates life. It is the openness that
is the problem. It is the openness that
traps most human beings in an endless
ordeal of the pain of trying to survive
on this plane. It's the counterpoint of the openness.
What we teach in Human Design, because we get to see the genetic imprint is we
say, look, here is what you're supposed to be; yeah, very nice and very easy. It's
easy to see what one is supposed to be, very easy. You look at their definition and
you look at their profile and you look at the basic themes that are there and you get
to see right away what they're all about. And you get to see most clearly how they
can navigate in this maia. It is all about navigation, really. I think it‘s why I'm so
deeply attached to the ancient mythical journeys, the travels of the Argonauts, Jason

and the Argonauts, Ulysses and his wanderings in the Mediterranean. Something to
realize about the nature of our karma, our fate, and our destiny is that it's all about
direction. It is all about our movement.
And it‘s something that is at the core of correctness in Human Design, what we talk
about as correctness in Human Design. Most people assume that correctness is
behavioral in the sense that it is an indication of a certain quality of behavior. It isn't
to say that there isn't some truth in that, there is. But correctness is actually
positional more than anything else. It is about being in the right place at the right
time. It is about being able to see where you are when you're in the right place at
the right time. It's about being able to get to and stay in the right place at the right
time. All of this is actually a function of the vehicle.
We are Mind Controlled
This is one of the great divides that is there in being able to transform
consciousness. The great dilemma of transforming consciousness is trying to reason
with the mind that though it may be interesting it shouldn't be in charge of guiding
the life. That is an enormous challenge. And as you'll see in any understanding of
the counterpoint of definition is an understanding that it is the openness in your
design. The design is your mind. And
that's really something profound to
grasp. We are mind controlled. It‘s
what we do, it‘s is what human beings
do. At the very surface of Human
Design we say you have to follow
where your definition takes you. Your
definition takes you to a Strategy and
Authority.
This is an emotional Manifesting
Generator, single definition emotional
Manifesting Generator, defined
emotional system, very powerful
emotional system and many
activations in it. And this emotional
system connected to the Sacral Center through the channel 59/6, the channel of
intimacy, a channel that is related to reproduction and fertility, is tribal. It's about
pulling people into your aura. It's a very, very powerful pull-people-into-your-aura
mechanism. It is a very powerful break-into-the-aura-of-other-people mechanism.
And this Sacral Center is connected directly to the Throat.
As a matter of fact, the 20/34, the channel of Charisma, that one of the things to
recognize about this channel and it is common because it is an opposition in the
wheel, you can see that in terms of the positioning of the Sun/Earth, the Sun and
Earth are always opposite each other in the wheel, here is an example of a definition
in the BodyGraph that results from an opposition. And there are two others, that is,

Single and Split Definitions
the 43/23 and the 40/37 all three of them are oppositions, which means that they
are common. That is, whether they're there through the Sun/Earth or the possibility
that they may be there through the opposition of the nodes they're very common
attributes. This is the only pure Manifesting Generator. This is the only true
connection, direct connection, that's possible between the Sacral and the Throat.
And it separates them, the pure
Manifesting Generators, from the other
kinds of Manifesting Generators who
happen to be Generators with a
manifesting capacity.
So, here we have a pure Manifesting
Generator who is emotional. And
everything about that is that here is
somebody who has a basic strategy.
They are a Generator and Generators
are here to respond. And they have
an emotional authority, they are here
to recognize that there is no truth in
the now, something that will be an
enormous challenge for them
considering that everything in their design is pointed towards the 20th gate, which is
a pure existential gate of ―I am now,‖ and the 20/34 has the language and power of
―I am busy now.‖ Here is an emotional authority that must wait to find its clarity.
And that in order for this being to operate correctly in this life, they are going to
have to wait for life to come to them. And not only are they going to have to wait
for it to come to them, but when it does show up they‘re going to say and have to
say, not right now. I have to sleep on it, I need some time.
Everything about what is defined in this being is going to be a huge challenge for
them. And it is going to be a huge challenge because the counterpoint to their
definition is their openness. Everybody who comes into the Human Design
knowledge one of the first things that you learned about is the so-called not-self.
And this so-called not-self is rooted in all of this openness. And the openness is
always the counterpoint to the definition and it is always more powerful and there is
always more of it. Even if you have nine centers defined, which is incredibly rare,
there is still going to be more openness than activation, because it is a 64 gate
matrix. And you can see that we have a limitation on either side, not just a
limitation but repetition that exists in outer planets or the serendipity of those
things, repetition that can be there in the nodal positioning and all kinds of other
things that are possible.
The Genetic Imperative
In other words, we are deeply limited in how much we can even activate in terms of
what can be activated as an imprint. Openness dominates us, and openness is a
dilemma. We are ruled by something that is called the genetic imperative. All bio-

forms, every living thing is ruled by this imperative. And the imperative is to make
more. And it isn't simply to make more, it is to make more that is going to be
viable. In other words, if a human being is going to be useful reproductively, as an
example, that who they are going to be reproductive with is very important. If it is
their sibling, their brother or their sister, we know from tradition, which is why it is a
taboo that this leads to genetic problems. In other words, it leads to a genetic dead
end. What the genes are interested in is variety. And so one of the dilemmas that
we have inherited in being a bio-form is that we are governed by a law, a profound
law that says we are only going to be attracted to what is different. And difference
attraction becomes the theme of conditioning in our lives. We are interested in what
we are not.
When you're looking at a BodyGraph you're looking at two things and it's very
important to understand this. What you were looking at are activations, which are
imprints, and you're looking at openness, whether it is a center or an open gate in a
center. And here what you're looking at are receptors. So, we are nothing but
imprints and receptors. And
there are many, many, many
more receptors than imprints.
So, all of these receptors that
we have, the receptor that's
there in the 18, and the 28,
and the 32, and the 50, and
the 44, and the 57, and the
48, this very open Spleen,
there are receptors here, and
they‘re waiting. They‘re
waiting, they want to become
active. But they're not
imprints.
What you have colored in, the
database that is integrated
into your design, this is the
imprint information that can
differentiate you from the other. Human Design is the science of differentiation. It's
all about finding our differences and seeing that each and everyone of us are not
simply deeply, deeply, deeply unique, but that we actually have the potential of
living out that uniqueness. And so what we have is, we have two themes that exist.
And again, to go back to the themes of duality and the binary, we have two themes.
We have the theme of operating as our own authority, which is rooted in our
definition, or we are homogenized. In other words, either we establish our
differentiation and our uniqueness, or we become homogenized into what is the
general malaise. And the way in which we are homogenized is through our
receptors, because it is our receptors that are naturally attracted to things that are
not us.

Single and Split Definitions
Now of course, we have a dilemma in that. The dilemma in that is that
psychologically rather than wanting to be what we all are which seems to have very
little interest to the not-self, what we want most of all is to be what we are not. So
here we have somebody whose authority says there's no truth in the now, wait out
the wave. And we have a receptor, seven of them, that say, do it now, do it now,
let's do it now, I want to do it
now, let's do it now, if we
don't do it now we‘re in
trouble, if we don't do it now
we‘re going to feel terrible.
We've got to do it now.
This being, this holistic being,
this is what they want; so,
instead of being that
emotional being that has an
opportunity to be able to
respond over time and
involve themselves in
something that is going to be
satisfying, they jump on the
wave, they jump on the high
end or the low end and they
can manifest that, generated
outwards in the now. And the not-self wins, because it's going to lead to the
dilemma of all moving objects, and we are a moving object. It leads to resistance. I
know so many 20/34s that have destroyed their thyroid system. The thyroid system
is directly related to the Throat Center. Here is somebody with an enormously
powerful Throat, enormously powerful Throat. And the drive that is there in this.
And all of this becomes the problem the moment that the counterpoint, the
openness, rules.
Not-Self Strategies of Open Centers
Every open center—it's interesting when you think about it when you look at
somebody's design and you look through the definition to their Strategy and
Authority you get to see that it gives you a singularity, that is, it gives you a single
strategy, it gives you a single authority. And all that is the mechanism that if you
follow that, that is correctness for you. But think of the complexity of the not-self, of
our receptors, and their impact on the way in which the mind system operates. Each
and every center has their own strategy as open centers, as receptors, the so-called
not-self strategies of the centers.
And when you're looking at somebody's design like this, and you see that they have
six open centers, there are six different not-self strategies. And these six different
not-self strategies are competing against one possible correct strategy. No surprise
who wins in that game. And when you begin to add up those open centers and their

23
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
not-self strategies you begin to build a framework for understanding the way in
which this person's mind is going to control its life.
Inner and Outer Authority
I want you to think about the general way in which humanity operates mentally. The
way in which they operate mentally, in Human Design we have two terms related to
the theme of authority. That is, we have what's called inner authority and outer
authority. Now, inner authority in terms of Human Design is that place within your
vehicle, that is, it has nothing to do with the mind, that place that you can rely on for
your decision-making process. And this is directly connected to the way in which
your vehicle operates. This is inner authority. Outer authority is the potential
expression of the mind to the other. In other words, the inner authority that guides
my life is my Spleen. My mind is expressed in terms of outer authority. It doesn't
run my life anymore; my
Spleen does, in that sense to
be simple, but my mind still
has a function and a value.
That is, you receive the
benefit, as an example, of
my outer authority.
Ideally, and again it is an
ideal, the correct being that
can in essence liberate the
passenger mind, what that
establishes is a pure unique
outer authority. And this is
what ultimately mind is all
about. However, to go back
to the mundane and the real
world, because that's really
what the story is, if you go
back into the mundane real world what you get to see is that the way in which this
person is going to think is going to be rooted in these open strategies, the not-self
strategies.
So for example, the not-self strategy of the splenic system when it's open, and
remember that it is one of those things about looking at a graph, these centers
aren't empty and they are not broken and they don't need to be fixed simply
because they're not colored in. They are what they are; they‘re receptors. It is
something simply to grasp about that. The open splenic system as an open receptor
system becomes holding onto things that aren‘t good for you. Now, think about that
expression: to hold onto things that aren‘t good for you. Now obviously, it can refer
to many, many different kinds of things—concepts that aren‘t good for you, people
that aren‘t good for you, jobs that aren‘t good for you, diets that aren‘t good for you,

Single and Split Definitions
places that aren‘t good for you—it goes on and on and on and on and on, holding
onto things that aren‘t good for you.
Now, think about what it means to have this not-self strategy of this open Spleen
impact the way in which the mind is going to work, because we have a dilemma in
humanity. In humanity, authority is not separated. In other words, authority in
humanity is not a duality. And herein lies the dilemma. Authority in humanity, that
is, humanity as we see it out there in the movie, authority in humanity is twofold.
That is, the mind is both inner authority and outer authority. And this of course, is
the great dilemma.
As long as the mind is inner authority and outer authority there are many
consequences that are very negative. The first thing is that this is a being that in
essence never really speaks the truth. Now, that's quite a thing to swallow. But, if
your mind is inner and outer authority it means that the way in which it's going to
communicate with others is going to be conditioned by the kinds of decisions it wants
to make, or the kinds of
decisions it wants other people
to make, that way in which the
child talks to its mother when it
wants a cookie, there is a way in
which we communicate based
on a track that the mind is
taking in terms of laying out its
decision-making pattern and
that you never really get true
communication.
Now, think about this human
mind with its combined inner
and outer authority being driven
by a receptor. And remember
these receptors are not
concepts, this is a genetic
impulse, this is a drive. All these beings want is to have a defined Splenic system
brought to them by whatever, normally people, and those people are what they're
going to hold onto. And think about the way their mind is going to work. They meet
somebody, for example, this person is easily, easily, easily, easily, easily seduced by
the 57th gate. The 57th gate becomes one of those gates that really has a huge
impact on this person. It is a natural connection into what is the integration
systems, this very unusual four-part system, and you can see that the moment the
57th gate is there obviously being a part of this system, it is something that this
being is going to be looking for.
And when they find that 57th gate, it is after all, only one gate. It's one of those
things when you‘ve got a little spot on the wall and you throw a bucket of paint at it.
That‘s basically what's going on here. You want that 57, but the package that comes
with the 57, the other person‘s design and everything about them and their life and
so forth and so on, you're taking that in as well. And because it is so important for
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

25
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
the not-self of this person to have this, because the splenic system brings a feel-
good, I want to feel good, they become addicted to it.
And even though this person may be terrible for them, and it doesn't necessarily
mean that they have to be physically, sexually abusive, or any of those things, and it
can be, you get the full spectrum of things, but they‘re simply not good for you.
They may not be good for your health, they may not be good for your state of mind,
they may not be good for the direction that you take in life, and on and on and on
and on. And yet, the mental system is going to say yes, but, I hold onto things that
are bad for me. Of course, it doesn't get the thought over in that way. It‘s just that
it's very, very difficult to let go of that feel-good, to let go of that spontaneous.
Now, there are many other areas that we can look at in this counterpoint to the
definition, because definition is the answer, or in the extreme of the Reflector, the
lack of it is the answer in the sense that we are overwhelmed by what we are not.
We are overwhelmed by it. You can see that—count all the open gates, the open
centers. This is the first thing to come
to grips with. If you really need the
mental shock to help you continue in
your experiment, then see the
overwhelming odds against you unless
you have a way to deal with it.
It's not like I could explain all of this
openness to this particular person and
they could say from the mental plane
I've got it, I know how to handle it, I
know how to handle my holding onto
things that aren‘t good for me, I‘m
going to stop doing that. Yeah, yeah it
isn‘t true. It's just not true. Here's
somebody that has an open Heart
Center, they have an open Ego system. They under value themselves. They‘re
always trying to prove themselves. It‘s one of the things that becomes the driving
force in the way in which their mind is going to operate, the way in which the mind is
going to make inner authority decisions.
The Mind Does Not Know How to Direct the Life
This is the great dilemma. The mind does not know how to direct the life. It
doesn't. And what I mean by that because it's not about denigrating the quality or
the potential of mind, the human mind is a fantastic thing. It isn't about that. It's
about understanding that your mind operates on what you're not, not on what you
are. This is the great irony in the BodyGraph. I talk about all this being dualities,
everything is a duality. The openness is a duality. The very receptors that torment
you when you're unaware are the very receptors that are the roots of your potential
wisdom when you stop making decisions with your mind.

LECTURE TWO
Single and Split Definitions
One of the most fundamental ways to understand the BodyGraph is to recognize that
what is defined in us is the student. And what is open in us, all the various
openness, these are the courses that we take in life. Of course, the thing is that you
only really begin to study and master the various courses. You take the example of
the open Ajna. The open Ajna is such a curse in the not-self, because it's always
trying to be certain and it never can be. So it's always trying to be certain that it
should hold onto that thing which is bad for it because it can prove that it can be
okay holding onto to what is bad for it because it likes it anyway, and this is where
they think their direction is, and they're in a hurry to get there. So, they have all
these ways through their openness to construct the way in which the mind frames
any decisions.
So, you come to this person, you say to this person, would you, could you, can you?
Their answer is from the openness. It's always from the openness. If I say yes is it
going to help me prove my worth? It's all these things. It‘s not about whether mind
is good mind, bad mind, smart mind, dumb mind, they‘re all not-self mind. And it
means that the way in which
you are being guided in your life
has nothing to do with you. You
are a homogenized soul; you're
a homogenized being on this
plane being manipulated by the
program, being manipulated by
the process. And that you have
lost all authority.
The arrogance and the vanity of
the not-self mind to assume
that it's in control of its life and
all it is doing is sacrificing itself
and sacrificing its possibilities to
homogenization in the program.
This is very powerful, this other
side. And yet, it's us. We are
all these things, we are a holistic being and that we are not here to be alone, we are
designed to be receptive, to have receptors to life, to experience, to the other. But
we're not here to be lost in that. We all have a way of being correct. We all have a
way of doing the most important thing—the navigating.
The Magnetic Monopole
In my simplest descriptions of the BodyGraph construct here in the G Center is the
magnetic monopole, and it holds us together in the illusion of our separateness, and
it drives us along in our line of geometry. And here in the Ajna Center we have the
design crystal. The design crystal is the filtering mechanism that ultimately
establishes what we call the body or the vehicle itself. And here in the Head Center,
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

27
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
actually outside of the physical body, is a personality crystal. And the personality
crystal filters what we could call the self-awareness or results in the self-awareness
consciousness field we experience as mind.
If you think about that, in my early illustrations this is all about a vehicle. So here is
the design crystal and the design crystal is the vehicle. And here is the monopole
and the monopole is the driver. And up here is the personality crystal and this is the
passenger. And the great dilemma is that when the mind is both inner and outer
authority, what that means is that the passenger is trying to be the driver, and it
can't be the driver. It does not know how to drive that vehicle. It has no idea how
to drive that vehicle; none whatsoever, none.
Everything about Human Design is putting the passenger back in its place, putting
the passenger back here in the observation deck in the backseat, to be able to sit
back and to be able to experience life, to be able to see it. As I paraphrase the Bard,
to be able to watch the movie, to be able to see the process because the body is the
life. And at the moment that you're handing responsibility, inner authority, to the
vehicle, which is what Human Design brings—again, at the very basis of all of this, is
what Human Design is for. It is not just simply some kind of esoteric knowledge
because it isn't. It is really a science and it has a function. And its primary function
is to teach human beings how mechanically they can make decisions as themselves,
that's all.
Strategy and Authority
Everything about us being an object moving in space, everything about this is
understanding that it's all about where we are. And in the context of what it is to be
human, where you are lays the platform of what you see. And what you see is the
foundation upon which you conceptualize as mind. And if you are moving in the
correct direction and you are adjusted in your navigation to the trajectory and angle
in geometry that is correct for you, and that means all the terminology for the
various ways these themes are expressed in Design, this is when you begin to
experience your life. The moment that you act according to your Strategy and
Authority you are aligning your vehicle for the first time to what is its true movement
and direction. This is the beginning of the process.
This alignment, as you move, begins to open up all kinds of new horizons. The first
thing it does is eliminate resistance. At the simplest level by being able to make
decisions according to the techniques in Type and strategy that what this does is it
immediately begins to remove certain fundamental burdens from the life. You begin
to see that you can trust a decision-making process within you. You begin to be
comfortable with your own authority, something that human beings have been
robbed of from the time they came into the world. We are dominated by the
authorities of others. And you can see in this struggle that if you depend on your
mind to help you it is going to be overwhelmed by the openness.

Single and Split Definitions
There is no other way but to turn over inner authority to take the mind and
deconstruct it back into a duality, to take away this hodgepodge singularity of the
mind being inner and outer authority and a not-self human being who can never
really communicate the truth. That's humanity. We don't need that actually. It
would be nice to do without that. And it is simply a matter of dividing those
responsibilities. Let the mind keep its great power; but, let it use it as outer
authority, as an expression of one's difference, as a unique expression of your
differentiation and allow the inner authority, the decision-making to be made by the
vehicle, so that you can move correctly in this life and to begin to experience the
possibilities that are there for you.
The Split Definition
About 41% of humanity are single definition and you can check by the way. In the
Jam Player in the free access area we have a global survey and every once in awhile
it's always a nice thing to take a peek at. We actually passed a milestone the other
day, we have over a quarter of a million charts calculated in the database now and it
allows us to see many different things in terms of percentages relative to all the
various aspects in Design. If you look at the definition layout you'll see that
approximately 41% of humanity are single definition, what we were just looking at,
and here in this particular case we are looking at what is the largest grouping in
definition and that is the split definition. About 45% of humanity is a split in
definition.
In looking at a split definition again the basic construct of it is—we've already seen
what continuous definition
is, so you see here from
the Throat Center to the
emotional system and
down to the Root Center
you have one single
continuous definition.
And then over here on the
other side, that is, from
the splenic system over to
the G Center and again
through integration, you
see that there is a
definition over here. And
you also get to see that
between these two areas
of definition, the 10/57
and the other side, the
12/22, 55/39 that when
you're looking at these
two you can see that they do not connect to each other. So, what you have is
you've got two areas of continuous definition, and you have those two areas of

29
THE FOUR VIEWS

definition, actually one is continuous, one is simply a channel and they do not
connect to each other, this is a split.
If, as an example, there would be an activation here in the 24th gate and this would
be colored in, the Head Center and the Ajna, but there would be no further
connection downward, then we would have a triple split definition. In other words,
we would have three areas of definition disconnected from each other. So, here
we‘re looking at the split definition and again, this is the majority.
It‘s interesting about large generic groupings. If you look at single definition the fact
that somebody is a single definition means that their actual need for the other isn't
as strong, as an example, as a split definition. It doesn't mean that they're not
pulled by their receptors in the same way that everybody else is, but obviously
because somebody has a
single definition they‘re
more self-contained. And
in being more self-
contained they can be,
again, there's all kinds of
nuances in that and how
complex their single
definition happens to be,
but they're much more
comfortable in their own
skin alone.
If you put a single
definition into solitary
confinement and a split
definition into solitary
confinement the split
definition would go crazy
first without question. It
is very, very difficult for split definitions to be alone in this life. And because they‘re
45% of humanity, I'm not trying to establish a thematic of neediness as much as I'm
pointing to the fact that it is the split definition that keeps the pair bonding system
alive. And of course this is very, very important for the whole genetic bio-form
program, obviously, because the fact is that to be reproductive doesn't necessarily
demand long-term bonding.
And one of the things about the presence of a majority of definitions being split is
that it becomes very clear that because the split definition is driven into the bond
that they are a key, in that sense, to understanding the pair bonding system. And if
anybody is designed for that kind of process, that is, the pair bonded process, it is
most naturally one that comes to the split definition.
By the way, there's something interesting in looking at singles and splits in the same
way that in Type we will look at the unique relationship between Projectors and
Generators, that is, single definitions and split definitions have a natural bonding

Single and Split Definitions
tendency, and a bonding tendency that is initiated by the drive of the split. But
because single definitions are singles they can be very stable in the way in which
they bring a split definition together and don't have their own dilemmas that they're
bringing with it, and so forth and so on.
Anyway, the real key in looking at a split definition is to understand right away that
they are unique in the way in which they are conditioned. When I say that I mean
they are unique in comparison to single definitions or to triple split definitions. There
is a similarity to quads, but we‘ll talk about that next week. But really they are very
different.
Bridging the Split
When we were looking at the single definition, what we got to see was that the open
centers, and again the power of the open centers, these receptor systems and the
not-self strategies that it would be the not-self strategies that would dominate the
way in which the mind of the single definition being would operate. But that is not
so in the case of the split definition. Now it isn't to say these open centers that their
strategies do not apply, they‘re there. But as you'll see the forces of conditioning are
very, very deep in the split definition and that in fact the actual not-self strategies of
the open centers are secondary to the impact of their basic conditioning drive. And
their basic conditioning drive is to bridge the split.
So, if you look at this split definition and the ways that it can be joined together, for
example, the presence of the 28th gate would join the splits together through the
lower part so that you
would have this
movement that would go
all the way around like
that. So we have one
area here in the 28th gate.
You can see as well that if
the 1st gate was activated
or the 7th gate was
activated or the 20th gate
was activated, then again,
the split would be
connected. So we have
four gates that are part of
this process that could
provide a bridging. We
have the 28th gate and
the 20th gate and the 1st
gate and the 7th gate.
In looking at these four

these four gates for their not-self and for the way in which their mind is going to
operate, that it is these four gates that are going to be the Holy Grail for them. This
is what they want to be. So, the 28th gate is about finding purpose. So these are
people that are going to be driven to find their purpose. This is going to be the most
important thing for them is to find their purpose. And they want to find their
purpose in the now because there's that 20th gate there, they want to be able to get
it in the now, they want to be able to show everybody that they've got it and they
want to be able to lead everybody with what they‘ve got. They want to be that
leader. They want to be that creative force. They want to be that awakened
awareness in the now. They want to have the fulfillment of purpose. These things
take on such an important ingredient in their life. How do I find my purpose?
It isn't that there's anything wrong with wanting to find your purpose, but that's not
what this being is all about. That's what the other can bring. And the dilemma of
somebody that is a split definition is that the gate that they're missing becomes their
own problem. So if you say to this person what's your problem, they'll say, well I
just don‘t know how to find my purpose, I just don't know how to find what's right
for me in this life. I don't know how to find a role. I don‘t know what to do. I don't
know how to express myself
creatively; I don't know how to do
that. I have a real problem with
that. I don't know how to be
spontaneous and really be out
there in the now; you know what I
mean. This is what becomes them.
And oh yes, there are these other
things that are piled up on top of it
and you can begin to see these
layers and layers and layers and
layers and layers of the not-self
mind. It has nothing to do with
what's right for this person;
nothing. They‘re over here. This is
a deeply individual emotional
Manifestor. And their real dilemma in life is coming to grips with what it is to be an
emotional Manifestor. Obviously, this is somebody, because this is a case of pure
individuality as definition in their design, who potentially is deeply, deeply, deeply
creative. But you can see that despite the presence of the potential of that creativity
and again, the dilemma of what it is to be a Manifestor, an emotional manifestor is
that here is somebody that is driven by all the wrong things. The mind is lost. And
remember that if your mind thinks that you've got a problem with finding the role,
you can be easily conditioned by anyone who gives you a role, and your mind will go
along with it. Ah, that's better.
Of course, the moment that you're with that being and the moment that your bridge
is made you're locked into whatever the movement of that relationship is going to
take you to. And if you didn‘t enter into it correctly it's just your not-self. And of
course, these are beings that are tormented. It was a subject in the question period

LECTURE TWO
Single and Split Definitions
earlier about melancholy in the individual. Here is somebody that is deeply, deeply,
deeply melancholic. It is going to be part of their nature. And you can see right
away that the way in which they're going to interpret is particularly emotionally
melancholic, through this whole stream of moods, the channel of moodiness. You
can see what will happen to this person.
If you are an emotional individual, to wake up in the morning and the world is dark,
this is something that is natural. It isn't a reason. I mean, you don't wake up in the
morning and everything is dark because of something. The tendency of the not-self
mind, of course, is to make up the reason. And this not-self mind will make up the
reason. They'll say that I'm in the dark because I don't know how to find my
purpose. I‘m in the dark because I don‘t know how to be spontaneous. I'm in the
dark because I haven't found a role. I‘m in the dark because I just cannot get my
creativity out and I'm angry as hell. The Manifestor anger just boils and boils and
boils. And this is somebody who has a split definition where the bridges are all
single gate aspects, this is somebody that can be so cruel to themselves.
The Challenge of the Not-Self
The openness in us is a horror. And as you move through the different kinds of
definition you get to see that the challenge is always that you have to find a way to
be able to honor your Strategy and Authority because it's the only mechanism that
can save you, because after all, as long as your mind is making your decisions you‘re
lost. It‘s just like that. There's no gray area out there. There really isn't. If your
mind is deciding you really have a problem, you‘re not-self.
This is the great challenge that's there. Despite the fact that this science is very
capable of being able to demonstrate the way things work and what people can do
and how easy it is as a Strategy and Authority, it doesn't mean that the actual
experience of entering into that experiment is easy. It isn't. And the difficulty is the
mind. It's not the body. The body yearns for correctness. After all, it's been denied
its natural rightful role to guide our forms. This is what it's all about. You're not
going to be able to see what it's really about until it's your vehicle that is guiding
you, that it‘s your vehicle that is the driver, that is the rightful—you know, the
combination of your design and the monopole moving this vehicle along precisely in
its correct geometry, it's correct direction; all of that.
Splits: Blaming Oneself or Blaming the Other
So, the split definition has a real dilemma, every split has that dilemma. And
something else to consider, here we‘re looking at an example in which the bridging is
simple, that is, one gate to make the bridge. And we see that there is a
psychological consequence of that one gate. That is, because it's only that one gate
that this person will blame themselves for not having whatever that aspect is it's
missing. But if the split is a broad split, in other words, if it takes more than a gate
to connect or bridge the split, if it takes a channel for example, if it takes more than

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
a channel then the problem is always the other people. And of course, you end up
with these two sides of the kind of general psychology of the way in which not-self
split definitions present themselves.
On one side you have the one that is always blaming themselves. And on the other
side you have those that are always blaming the other. And again both of them are
lost because both of them are putting the focus of their life on whether or not;
they're putting the focus of their life on a receptor to the other. Now, there is no
question that if you're split definition you do need other people in your life,
obviously. You're designed for it. As a matter of fact, it is a good thing for you, but
it has to be the right being, or beings. And it cannot be a decision that is made by
your mind. It cannot. Only then can you enter into a relationship with the other as
a split definition where you're going to have those bridges provided by the other,
only then can you enter into that and enter into it as yourself and not be negatively
conditioned by that bond.
Your Mind Represents Your Receptors
But you have to enter in correctly as yourself. You have to operate out of the
authority of your definition. This knowledge is all about giving us, human beings,
each and everyone of us, the authority to be in charge of our lives, and no one else.
And yet, the only way that you can begin to do that is by understanding that your
mind never represents your true authority. It's something really incredible to grasp.
Your mind doesn't represent your true inner authority, it does not. It represents
your receptors. It represents the way you take in the rest of the world. It doesn't
represent what is good for you or what is right for you. And what you have been
taking in isn't necessarily what has been correct for you to take in, because you
weren't in the right place at the right time as your own authority making decisions
correctly as yourself.
Okay, I hope you enjoyed that. Next week we take a look at triple splits and
quadruple splits; until next time; bye for now.

Lecture Three
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
Hello to you all that are here. We continue our look at different kinds of definition,
and as you can see the subject today is the triple and quadruple splits. My main
focus today is going to be proportional to their representation in the world. That is,
about 11.5% of humanity are triple splits. It is, by comparison to the single
definition, which is about 41% and the split definition, which is about 45% that you
can see already that the triple splits, it's not so much that it is a rarity, but one out
of every 10 people approximately is going to be a triple split and just about
everybody else is either going to be a single or split definition. So, they're a minority
in that sense.
When it comes to the quadruple split, the quadruple split is very rare. That is, it's
rarer than, for example, juxtaposition crosses. Somewhere around 1 out of every
200 people will be quadruple split, so they‘re much rarer. Now of course, when I say
something like that, that 1 out of every 200 people, when you consider that there's
nearly 7 billion of us, there are actually, in terms of brute numbers, there are an
awful lot of quadruple splits. But, it's not like you regularly meet them. As a matter
of fact, yesterday I asked my students to send me a couple of samples because I
honestly couldn't remember the names of the quads that I had done, and I would've
had to go through at least 200 charts to find that one quad. They‘re very rare.
The Triple Split
So my point anyway to begin with is that I'm really going to put the focus to start
with on the triple split. There is a tremendous amount of misunderstanding when it
comes to split definitions. When I say that I mean within the context of what people
usually consider splits. Quads, as I said, are very rare so most of the time when
people are talking about splits they‘re talking about the basic split definition, two
aspects separated from each other, but they lump together the triple split with it,
that is, three different aspects. And they lump it together in terms of given that the
pure split definition is 45% of the population, that the propaganda of split-ness is the
propaganda of ―you need another.‖
And of course this is very true when you're talking about the simple split definition.
Unfortunately that gets lumped together in terms of the triple split and you end up
with a triple split that has a totally different mechanical potential. And it's out of that
very different mechanical potential that lies the dilemma of trying to lump it together
with the basic split.

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
So, first of all let‘s see what we‘re talking about here. Obviously, the Head and Ajna
are certainly separated from the rest, but you can also see that here you're looking
at the 40/37 and you can see that the 40/37 is isolated as well. You can also see
that there is a continuous definition that runs from the G to the Sacral to the Spleen
and then down to
the root. So,
there is the third
aspect of this
triple split
definition. Again,
in the simplest of
terms you have
three areas that
are connected to
each other within
themselves, but
are separate from
the other areas.
When we were
looking at the
split definition we
were looking at
the dynamics of
bridging. In
other words, if
you discounted
this and this was the design, this function here, if you would just look at this we
would be talking about the gates that would make the difference, those conditioning
gates, those gates that are going to be the bridge gates. But it is not the same thing
when you're talking about a triple split definition, not at all.
The Triple Split Frequency
First of all, you have to grasp something about them. They have a very, very
different frequency. The split definition is always simply focused on the bridge. But
of course for the triple split definition no bridge in the end is really satisfying,
because there are endless possibilities of how to bring these three aspects together.
And I mean endless possibilities; there are all kinds of them. And the thing about a
triple split definition is that rather than being a split that becomes deeply dependent
on a single force to align it, to bring it together, that the most uncomfortable thing
for a split definition is that they get somebody who does this, but does nothing over
here as an example. Or they get somebody who does this and has a long way of
doing that.

LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
And then what happens to the triple split definition is that the way in which they can
integrate information that it gets locked in to one of many, many, many different
potentials and in that no decision they make under the influence of a single bridge is
ever a decision that can stand up for a long time, because they‘ll tear it to pieces at
a certain point, because it's not the way they're intended to work. They don't need
the bridge to fulfill their process. A split definition does. For the split definition it
needs that bridge to fulfill its process.
And of course the dilemma with that is that it does become what is an extraordinarily
deep conditioning factor in their lives, which is why it's so important that no matter
what you are, but particularly in this context, if you‘re a split definition and you're
operating according to your Strategy and Authority you're going to enter into the
right bond even though that bond is going to be a conditioning element, it is in your
nature to find the right conditioning element; in other words, the right bridge. And
this is something that you lean on.
So, when we look at the pair bonding system as an example. One of the things to
see is that the split definition is the
bedrock of our pair bonding. They‘re 45%
of humanity. Basically about half of
humanity is mechanically oriented towards
pair bonding, through finding the bridge.
So that becomes something that
overshadows and brings a
misunderstanding to the process of what it
is to be a triple split.
First of all, let's think about one of the
dilemmas about time. We have so many
different ways in which time operates
through the mechanism of our maia,
because it's integrated, like in the formula
for relativity, it is literally integrated into the fabric of what life is. There is an
illusion that we all operate on the same time, it is an illusion. We don't. It‘s like this
classroom, there is this illusion that we‘re in the same time, but we‘re not in the
same time, we are all in different places—mornings and nights. We operate in a
confluence of time themes. You can see that in the BodyGraph itself, with the logical
system always looking to the future, and the abstract process always looking to the
past and the individual process always trying to grasp the now. There are all these
different time processes that are involved.
The Different Frequencies in Awareness
Now, one of the things to understand is that we have different frequencies in terms
of awareness. That is, we know that the splenic system is a system that operates
existentially spontaneously and that it is non-repetitive. In other words, the instinct,
intuition, judgmentation—it releases its information in a moment and then it's gone.

So it has a very, very fast, super fast frequency. The immune system recognizes
something that isn't correct, it immediately makes its warning instantaneous;
otherwise, we would have trouble surviving, couldn't take time for that.
The mental system, in that sense, the Ajna is the conceptualizinG Center, that the
Ajna has a very different frequency. That is, the Ajna has a frequency that is literally
over all time. You know that mistake that you made when you were 12, that you
still remember it if you're lucky when you're 85. And you can still ponder what that
would've meant to you in your life. In other words, that you know when you're
looking at the time frequency of mind, it literally is endless.
And then you get to the Solar Plexus system. After all, 50% of humanity including
this particular example, they are ruled by what is emotional authority, the power of
the Solar Plexus system. And as we well know, the Solar Plexus operates in this
wave, and that it has a different frequency in terms of its ability to distill information.
So, to begin with, we've got three different frequencies. And as you can see in this
case, and by the way it is relatively common to see triple splits with the three
awareness centers defined and separated from each other. I mean I've seen a lot in
my career, so it's not an unusual thing that we‘re looking at, but it does make,
obviously, for a nice example. So, you're looking here at this being, so here it is
area number one: very powerful, identity to the Sacral, over to the Spleen, down to
the Root. And of course, all of this is
ready to operate in the now, spontaneous,
splenic, energized by the Sacral system,
right there, instantaneous criticisms. This
is somebody that has a very, very specific
spontaneous depth to them. But that's
only one aspect of their nature.
And then they have this basically logical
mind, very strong activation, three parts of
the logical stream, very strong logical
mind, working out the patterns over time
in a very different frequency. I mean,
there are things that bind it, the strength
of the 15/5 and the 18/58. This is
somebody who is a very, very logical being. So there are these potentials. By the
way, this is a Just Now chart, you can tell by the positioning here. I think it was last
week when I was preparing illustrations. So, it's some child that‘s recently born.
So you have already one frequency here that‘s spontaneous, another frequency here
that is going to assess the patterns over time and then you have a very strong
emotional system, and I mean a strong emotional system, the emotional Ego,
obviously through the nodal configuration of the 37/40 so that you have the
duplication in that. But of course, you also have a very strong 49th gate in terms of
the two Neptune's that are there, and the 22nd gate, which is coming from the design
Uranus. You‘ve got a very powerful emotional system that is in a ratcheting,

LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
because it's the definition that defines the main wave theme, in this ratcheting
emotional theme to get to a place of clarity.
No Single Bridge Can Link the Splits
So, what do we have? We have these three areas; we have three different
awareness processes. We have three different frequencies. And for these beings no
single bridge and no single moment is going to bring them a sense of wholeness.
And no single person can bring them back a sense of wholeness, even when that
single person is able to bring together the various aspects of their triple split and link
it into one.
The moment that any triple split has a linkage, it is only the beginning of a process
for them in their inner process to find a way to synthesize their frequencies. It‘s not
an easy thing to do. In other words, to bring together those three different ways of
processing information so that there is in fact a consensus within the being; most
triple splits are torn beings.
And what I mean by that is
that they are consistently
drawn to connections that
pull them either to one side
or one aspect or two
aspects, because the
moment that they have
somebody that locks them
into all three aspects they
cannot bear them for very
long.
The thing that separates the
triple split from the simple
split is that the triple split is
a transpersonal structure.
It‘s transpersonal. The
normal split, the pure split,
is very personal. It is about
that one other. It is about a very deep personal connection to the other. This
doesn't exist in triple splits. It impacts their psychology deeply, because they're
designed to have transpersonal connections. The advantage of this particular triple
is that they are a 40/37 and in that they have two advantages: A) they‘re communal
and B) they‘re emotional. And it‘s only an advantage obviously if they can be
correct. The advantage of the emotionality is the time that it demands for clarity,
because a triple split is nothing but something that waits in time, but they don't wait
idly in time. In other words, what is so important for the triple split is the quality of
auric connections that they have in the day, in their normal day.

The Need for Public Places
My standard recommendation to triple splits is that they move; that they go out into
their community. And it's not that they have to be social. It‘s not like they have to
go out there and talk to people and integrate with them or whatever, but they need
public places. Public places are very important for them.
Think about this triple split and think about what happens to this triple split. It has
this person in its life, let's make it even more attractive, they have this person in its
life that's got a 62 and has the 31/7, so there is this very logical linkup, which is
something that can be very, very interesting for this particular being. But it also
means that there's a part of them that is not involved. In other words, they're going
to be held away from the community, locked into the attractive configuration for as
long as it lasts. But there is a dilemma in this. The dilemma is that there are so
many ways that this triple split can connect, particularly when you're looking at the
relationship between the G Center and the Ajna and you've got this huge open
Throat. For a being that is so present, there are no hanging activations in open
centers, every single hanging gate is part of some definition. This is a being that‘s
going to be very, very present. And yet at the same time, here is their deep
vulnerability. This is the only open center.
The Pressure is Pointed at the Throat
This is another thing and it leads to another aspect of the confusion between split
definitions and triple splits. In split definitions the main theme is the bridge
conditioning, and bridge conditioning is more important than center conditioning. In
the triple split it's the other way around. In other words, the triple split is like the
single definition, that they are deeply conditioned by what is open. So this being
wanting to attract attention, wanting to get the pressure off, they‘re under enormous
mental pressure to get this load down, they're under all this pressure and all the
pressure is pointed at the Throat system.
So they're going to end up being attracted to all kinds of ways in which the Throat
system is going to be integrated. And sometimes it's going to be integrated from
above and sometimes it's going to be integrated from below, and sometimes it's
going to be connected that way, and sometimes it's going to be connected that way,
and sometimes all that will be ignored and it will be emotional. In other words, you
can see that there is this huge multiplicity of phenomena in terms of connectivity
that‘s at the bedrock of what it is to be a triple split.
The Public Environment
Think about the public environment. The public environment is one of the great anti-
conditioning environments. Now, not everybody is comfortable out there. I
understand that. But the public environment is almost like good medicine. Let me
give you some examples. You‘re a couple and you happen to have an open Throat
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

40
LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
and your partner defines your Throat and it defines your Throat through a specific
gate. Let's say it's about the 20th gate. So it means that all your conversations
together are all about existential things. You talk about what's going on now, but
you have an enormous problem talking about the past or the future.
In other words, the moment that you have within you a feeling that took place last
week that you need to clear up with your partner, and your partner connects your
Throat to the 20th gate, there's no way you can do that, even though you want to.
And depending on your Type, it could make you angry, bitter, frustrated,
disappointed, whatever the case may be. If you go into a public environment, the
moment you go to a public environment there are going to be other activations
available in the public aura. And it
means that your Throat rather than
being dominated by your partner's
20th gate, as an example, that you
may gain the advantage in that
public environment of many
different ways in which you could
express yourself and change the
damn subject—I want to talk about
what happened the other day—
suddenly it comes out.
So, one of the things to grasp
about the public environment is
that it provides a depth of aura
activation that can be utilized
positively, particularly for triple
splits. And remember in the case of the triple split, the transpersonal nature of what
it is to be a triple split to begin with, in other words, that seeking out the public
environment is something that is always going to be attractive, one way or another,
and it doesn't mean that it‘s consciously attractive. It may be the kind of thing
where you have to go through a very crowded area to get to your work, and you
may not like it, but at the same time, if you're triple split boy is that ever wonderful
for you. Because you see, first of all the public aura has no direct influence. If
you're a split definition and you've got a lover and they are your bridge, boy do they
have influence. And if you don't have the power of your own authority, they are
going to have enormous influence over you.
But the triple split isn't like that. No single being can ever have that kind of effect,
even if they're linking up the whole triple split on that being, because that's not what
they're about. They're not about being influenced by the single aura or the single
conditioning bridge. But in their way they're here to sample a broad spectrum of
ways in which bridging can take place. You put a triple split in the public aura and
their split is brought together not in one way, but in many different ways. It's these
many different ways that opens up the possibility in such a complex being to be able
to begin the process of integrating the information, aligning the three different
frequencies into not so much, what is a truth for them, but is let's call it the best
calculation.

I know there's a movie I saw, there was a wonderful line, some creature was asked if
it believed in a Creator and it said, no we don't believe in anything, we calculate.
This is what the triple split in the end actually does, it makes a calculation. It makes
a calculation based on being able to assess the values in the three areas of its split
and being able to bring those values together into some kind of construct. It‘s quite
a process. It‘s why that triple splits have a tendency not to be the kinds of beings
that are comfortable with instantaneous reactions. Now, obviously there's going to
be many differences. It‘s obviously going to be different for a triple split that‘s a
Manifestor, because of course a manifesting element is going to have a unique power
all on its own to distort the way in which the processing has to be done.
The Public Aura is Healthy for Triple Splits
There are all kinds of configurations, but on the whole what you're looking at is a
discomfort. No matter how fast the physical form seems to work, a discomfort with
rushing mentally, or holistically really, into any kind of real decision is a dilemma for
them. It‘s why it's so important that Strategy and Authority is something that is
deeply, deeply grasped by the triple split; and yet to recognize something about the
decision-making process in and of itself. One of my things that I've talked about
recently with triple splits is to really see that before you make any kind of decision,
go take advantage of the public aura. Just go take advantage of it.
And again, it's not like you have to go out and think, aha, now that I'm in the public
aura I'm going to think about all this stuff and I‘m going to work it out. It's not
about that at all, it isn't and it doesn't work that way. It is a deep, deep inner
process that's taking place within the split itself and integrating all of the different
information in the way in which it all comes through. In order for the triple split
ultimately to really get to a point in which their calculation is comfortable for them,
they had to have sampled every possibility of bringing together those aspects.
Think about that, it‘s quite something. It is why the public environment, the public
aura, is something that is so healthy for them. And by the way, it's not like they
have to spend their day there. We really have very little grasp of how unbelievably
absorbing we are in the way in which we both receive auric information and how
penetrating we are when we put our auric information into the other. It's not about
time. It‘s about contact. And the moment that you step into the public or even if it's
just stepping down to the corner store to do something and go over and get a
newspaper or buy some bread, or whatever the case may be, that that movement
through the public aura, that's enough. It's not like you have to be there all day, it‘s
not like you have to live in it all the time. It‘s not about that. It‘s simply about
understanding mechanically the limitation of what it is to be a triple split.

LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
Relationship Problems for the Triple Split
Psychologically the triple splits have to deal with a number of things, and physically
they need to deal with a number of things in order for them to be healthy. One is
that they have to get rid of the notion that they are a split, a simple split. That is,
they are so caught up in the propaganda of romance and the propaganda of the pair
bond. And because of that, it creates enormous problems for them in their
relationships, because there is this established propaganda that has come out of the
pair bonding tendencies of the split that leads the triple split to think that they have
a problem that the bond isn't in and of itself satisfying. And of course, it isn't,
because in the split, the bond is the bridge. That's what makes it so incredible, it is
the bridge, it is the way to find wholeness, this is the person for me, and all that
stuff. And the poor triple split grows up with all of this propaganda of the dominant
split world, 45%, the largest group on the planet.
So, the dilemma for the triple split is the way in which they approach their potential
in any kind of bond with the other. It isn't to say that they cannot find and have a
fulfilling relationship with the other, but the rules of that relationship, the way in
which it is going to operate, is going to by
its very nature have to be different. In
other words, that no triple split can ever
afford to have someone who tries to cling
to their aura, they cannot. They need to
have a great deal of independence.
Otherwise, they're going to reject the bond
anyway.
This is the great dilemma, the permanent
bridge that the pure split gets, this is the
be-all and the end-all, and that direct
connection of a split element in a triple
split by somebody who is consistently in
their aura ultimately becomes something
that is uncomfortable and annoying and it gets to a point where it can easily be
rejected, because the triple split is not designed to be oriented to one fixing. They're
just not. This is not their thing.
No one of the many, many ways in which the different aspects of this split can be
connected, it goes on and on and on, all the ways in which this can work out, this
triple split isn't going to be satisfied with any one person doing this or that or
whatever. They're not designed for that. They're not designed to consider that
somebody who gives them the bridge is the thing. But that's their conditioning, and
that ends up bringing a lot of suffering into their process.
So, psychologically there is a dilemma about one's fixed relationships with the other.
For the triple split this is an enormous dilemma for them. And again it goes back to
understanding the very nature of what it is to be correct within this knowledge. It
starts with Strategy and Authority. If you are a triple split, if you are correct, that
person that, given your Strategy and Authority that you embrace in this life, that if

THE FOUR VIEWS

it's all correct then they're going to accept what it is to be with you as a triple split
and to understand that they can never truly have a great deal of influence over you.
Partnership, which is part of the mythology of the split definition, partnership is full
of all of these compromises and the influencing of one partner over the other, the
domination of one partner over the other, the willingness of partners to both be
dominated and to do the dominating, and so forth and so on, all this kind of stuff.
This has nothing to do with the triple split definition; nothing. It makes them very
different.
The Need to Take Time
They need to begin to recognize their difference, which means they need to take the
burden off the psychological conditioning frame, which has nothing to do with them,
it's all okay for the split, but it's not okay for the triple split, and begin to see how
important it is, the advantages of what it means to be able to take your time and
allow the public aura to be your great ally. You can't be a triple split and be a shut-
in and expect that you're going to have any sense of well-being, wellness, in your
process. That's very difficult.
The triple split needs to have these opportunities in the public aura simply to be able
to run a test, run a pattern through all the multiplicity of the possibilities of the
connections at any given moment to be able to reassess at any given moment
synthetically where one's at. And again, it isn't something that is intended to be a
conscious process. It is simply something
that needs to be part of the nature of any
triple split definition, and for them to
understand that even in those triple splits
who are not emotional, and by the way the
vast majority of them are emotional, even
in those triple splits that aren‘t emotional
that the very nature of being a triple split
demands more time, demands waiting,
demands not jumping on things.
The fact is that if this were a non-
emotional triple split, if instead of this
being a 40/37 it happened to be the
21/45, the fact of the matter is that one
cannot get caught up in one aspect of it. Just because there would be this aspect
that would be deeply spontaneous doesn't mean that being spontaneous is going to
be the right thing for this being, because they cannot make the calculation. They
can‘t. You need all the elements in the formula to be able to make the calculation—A
plus B plus C equals—this is their big thing.
The moment that they begin to slow down, I don't mean their activity slowed down, I
mean their navigation slowed down. Life is about steering, it‘s about what direction

LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
you‘ve got to take. Every decision is navigation. This is the mystery of life. And to
navigate correctly is something that's extraordinary. It is the transforming element
in life, it is what Strategy and Authority is all about, navigating correctly. And you
see, for the triple split the navigating process isn't one that should ever be moment-
by-moment, but phase by phase, that they go through their process of building their
calculation.
Now, obviously this isn't about the minutiae of decision making in life, because there
is a lot of minutiae, whether you wear this color or that color today, there's all this
minutiae. I‘m talking about the decisions that are truly things that change your
navigation. And for the triple split to simply understand that they gain their
navigation perspective, the necessary navigation perspective, to be able to make the
right calculation by taking advantage of the public aura and taking advantage of
time. Easier, of course, and not, in that sense, to say that to someone who's
emotional. And I say, ―and not,‖ because the not-self emotional system is not going
to be helpful in this kind of a process, not something that necessarily is interested in
waiting.
These are very different beings, and I hope that you begin to see out of this that
when you're looking at splits that you see clearly that they do not in any way follow
the same rules. They're very, very different from each other. They‘re very different
from each other in their social context, they‘re very different from each other in the
way in which they process information; they‘re very, very different from each other.
The pure split always has a psychology in capturing the bridge that says, I got what I
wanted, even though it may or may not be good for them, I got what I wanted. And
of course, this is a disease in the triple split, because they don't get what they want.
That is, they don‘t get the same phenomena. But as long as they are conditioned to
believe that that's what it's all about for them, then you can see that they have a
very painful process. And not simply that they have a painful process, but they‘re
never really fully in any relationship.
So, the understanding of what it is to be a triple split, this is a big slice, it may only
be 11%, but still, that is about 700 million people. So that's a lot of people who are
triple splits. To understand what is correct for them and how to get there and what
the dilemmas are in their particular configuration is something that's very important
for them. And certainly very important for particularly newcomers that they aren't
given misleading information about the relationship between splits, that triple splits
are not like split definitions at all. I think you can well see that at this point.
The Quadruple Split
Let's take a look at a totally, totally different kettle of fish [image next page.] There
you have split number one, the Head and Ajna cut off. Here again we see our
familiar 40/37, but we see it attached to the 22/12 so we have this relationship of
the emotional Ego to the Throat, this is the second area. Then we have in the
center, running through the center the 2/14 is the key element in that, the third
aspect, that is, the defined Sacral to the G. And then finally aspect number four over

45
THE FOUR VIEWS

here we have this aspect and this obviously is rooted in the individual 28/38. So, we
have an extremely complex entity here. This is a quadruple split—four different
areas of definition and they're not connected to each other.
Now, first of all obviously they‘re very rare. As I said, approximately 1 out of every
200 people is going to be a quad, and again in numbers that doesn't mean that they
are that rare, there's quite a few of them out there in the world. But they represent
something that is actually very unusual, because it is an inherently unstable social
mechanism. And you can see that there is a progression here. That is, you have
two aspects of definition and you have pair bonding and you have the development
of partnership.
You get to the three different areas of definition and pair bonding loses its power, in
that sense, and the public aura becomes something that becomes a substitute.
When you get to the four parts, the assumption would be that this would be an
extension of the dilemma that is there in the triple split. But it's not, it isn't at all.
It‘s identical, in that sense, to the way in which the pure split functions. But then
there is a real problem.
Quadruple Splits Do Not Seek Wholeness
Let me put it to you this way. When you're looking at a quadruple split, basically
they are always divided up into two parts. For example, the split definition gains its
wholeness through union with the other, the bridge. The triple split finds its
wholeness in the group or public aura, and the quadruple split never finds

46
LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
wholeness. It never finds wholeness. What it's always looking for is that it‘s always
looking for what the split looks for; it's always looking for a bridge. And it's always
looking for two bridges. In other words, the thing about the quad is that it's always
looking for two different kinds of basic fixed bonds. It isn't looking at wholeness.
The only relationship that it has with the triple split is that they're both
uncomfortable with any
kind of aura that will link
up all their aspects
together and hold them in
that. They don't like that.
And one of the things that
you'll notice about
quadruple splits when you
see them as adults in
terms of their freedom to
select, or the illusion of
the freedom to select their
relationships, what you
will see is that they will
specialize in relationships
that will bridge one group
in their four, but not the
other two. This is what is
natural for them. Now,
it's very bizarre, in that sense. In other words, maybe bizarre is not a fair word. It
is very, very different, let me put it that way, than the split or the triple splits,
because in no way is it seeking wholeness.
Now, remember something about a quadruple split. Boy, are they fixed. You can
see that when you're looking here; they‘re incredibly fixed. There is no open center
here. And everything that is activated is part of definition. So they are very, very,
very fixed. Yet at the same time, there are all these gaps, there are all these places
where they don't come together and they're never looking for a holistic answer. It‘s
what makes them interesting.
And of course, it also leads to an understanding that they have their own dilemmas
when it comes to relationships. They're not ever fully comfortable in a relationship.
What I mean by that is that they're not comfortable in a relationship in which they
are fully bridged; they‘re not. Let's say that somebody comes and bridges this with
a 56 and links this together. This is an ideal for this person. They‘re going to treat
that 56 in the same way as if this didn't exist and they were just a split definition,
this is going to be the big deal in their life, even though the rest of this is not
connected and could be hanging off to the side. And because of that they end up
with lives that appear to be so very different to different people. How different they
connect to different people, what aspects of them actually emerge in their
relationship with different people.

They Do Not Like the Public Environment
But they're never intended, within the mechanics, to experience what I'm describing
as the wholeness that comes when you‘re a split and you get that bridge or you‘re a
triple split and you get that aha after your experience of integrating all of your stuff
in the public environment. This is very different. And of course, they don't like the
public environment. They‘re very much connected to the mythology of the split,
because that's what they feel like. This is how they think of themselves. If you‘re a
triple split and you have two
aspects connected and the
third aspect is hanging off the
edge, you really feel it. They
don't really feel it. They go
deep into the conditioning
element, deep into it. This is
going to be the thing.
I'm certain that if you look at
relationships in terms of
definition and you look at
divorce rates in terms of
definition, you'll see that the
divorce rates start climbing the
moment you move away from
the split definition and you
start moving to the triple split
and the quadruple split,
because these, as partners, can be very unsatisfying, because there are a lot of
them that just aren‘t there; and at the same time, the moment that they're on their
own, they have all of these various elements that are at work. It‘s very hard to
break into their processes. That‘s why they don't like anybody that literally locks
them in and locks in all of these various ways that they can create binaries.
And by the way, it doesn't matter how it works. For example, I illustrated that you
can have it connected this way (through the 56th gate), but again, you don't need
that. They would be just as satisfied if they get the link this way (through the 3rd
gate) and they bring these aspects (G-Sacral to Root-Spleen) together. Or perhaps
the link goes this way (through the 7th gate), and they bring these parts (Ego-
Solarplexus-Throat to G-Sacral) together and then leave these two (Head-Ajna and
Root-Spleen) stranded. They would function quite nicely with all of that, for a while
anyway. They‘re very different in that sense.
And so because they are caught in the bridge game that the various bridges that can
link together any of the splits, these become the conditioning story of their life. If
we look at single gate bridges, the 56th gate, the 7th gate, the 26th gate, the 59th
gate, the 42nd gate, the 3rd gate—those are the singles. So we've got six different
ways in which their different splits can be linked together. So, all of that becomes a
story. All of that becomes the story of their life. This is what they‘re really
interested in. This is what's going to move them. They want to find a role in life,

LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
they want stimulation, they want to be able to really take power, they want to be
able to find intimacy, they want to be able to handle the confusion, they want to be
able to get things done and finished. It goes on and on and on and on.
The Only Definition that is Polygamists
And all those things become their drama. And they never get to it with one person,
and they don't get to it through a crowd. They can get to it through children, having
children, and having different kinds of bonds with their children, through having
different partners. This is the only definition that is, without question, polygamists.
And of course, we have these things as not simply part of our history; we have a
great deal of polygamy that still exists in the world. It is not something that is
aberrant, even though our Western binary bonding system finds it so. The fact is
that it is a natural thing for a quad, to have more than one partner, of course it can
lead to dilemmas if you're part of Western society. That usually means they end up
with different partners over different periods of time in the make-the-bond, break-
the-bond kind of movie.
But it's something again to grasp about their difference. The world is dominated by
the single and the split. Let's not forget that 86% of humanity is either single
definition or a pure split. So, the conditioning of all that, the propaganda of all that,
the way in which it impacts both the triple splits and the quads is very, very
powerful. That is, they‘re really overwhelmed by the way in which it‘s lived out, the
way in which definition is lived out, and what bridges mean and what all that
openness means.
They Need Multiple Pair Bonds
And of course, what happens with
the triple split and the quad is that
they get caught in that whole
movie. It‘s not natural, obviously,
in our modern societies for people
to have multiple partners. Yet at
the same time, the moment the
quad understands that and the
moment that they can operate
correctly as themselves then there
are ways in which they can find
outlets for their need for different
kinds of pair bonds, because that's
what they need. They need
multiple pair bonds. And they need
consistent multiple pair bonds,
because again they have the same
kind of, well, addiction is too hard a word, but they have the same kind of connection

49
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
to the connection as the split, how important that is, that bridge and who brings that
bridge. The difference with the quad is that they want a number of bridges, and
they don't want them from the same people. They don't.
And again, the dilemma is that conditioning is designed to be attractive. And of
course, it can lead to problems in terms of the social dynamic. Only the triple split is
really designed to operate resistance free through the public environment. In other
words, it's really for them. They can take advantage of it whenever they like. But
the quad is like the split, they want that one other. And yet, in the quads case they
want those two others or three others, because there are many ways in which those
four elements can be brought together.
And again, one of the intriguing aspects of the quad‘s nature is that they are not
transpersonal or dynamically social. They're intended to be that, they‘re intended to
have very, very strong conditioning bonds with people, but always with a protection.
It‘s the interesting thing about them. They will let you deeply impact them with your
bridge, but they have the protection of this other aspect of them that‘s never really
in there. And if you have a relationship with the quad and you notice that you make
one of those bridges for them, you'll also notice that in your relationship with them is
that they're not really all there for you, nor can they be. And yet at the same time,
they‘re very dependent on the need for the bridge.
Families are Important
And obviously, the way this works in the not-self can be very chaotic. Again, the
way in which it's normalized is through family. In other words, there is a very
powerful dynamic, because of course, all of our reproduction is rooted in the genetic
imperative that is the attractiveness that we have in our hanging gates pointed to
things that we don't have. Where we can see that the pair bond is strong in the
split, just that single gate that creates that whole dynamic, you have to see that in
the quad it‘s even stronger. In other words, there are many, many different ways in
which it can be deeply attracted to ―the other‖ even though it‘s the other limited to
that split and they can end up with a lot of children. Children are an advantage for
them, because it does give them that opportunity to be able to have a deep
connection to another that can be different, if you know what I mean.
In other words, they really need a lot of very tightly bonded relationships with
different people. And this is their main mechanism; this is the thing that ultimately
will keep them healthy. And I assume that in most cases in the not-self what you're
going to have is that if we looked at the size of families, if we were looking at the
number of children produced by definition, I think we would find that the quads in
the end, despite the fact that they're very limited themselves, that my assumption is
that they probably produce more children than any other definition type. So, it‘s just
one of those interesting things that one day we might have some curious research on
all of that and see what that brings.

LECTURE THREE
Triple and Quadruple Split Definitions
Definition
Definition is an amazing thing, after all. I will move on to Type next week and we
will begin with the Generator. Definition is really the wonder in all of this, the way in
which the wheel is translated into the BodyGraph and in that way schematically for
us to be able to see the way in which energy flows within us. Definition is something
that is consistent and reliable. It is the essence of our imprint. We are here to live
out the possibility of our
definition. This quad, as an
example, is here to live out
the possibility of what it is
to be a quadruple split, to
find those deep bonds at
many levels in their life in
order to have a sense of
fulfillment in their process.
You get there only one way.
This is what definition leads
to, definition is the basis
upon which we find Strategy
and Authority, and it leads
to the mechanical key in
this life. How we deal with
the serendipity of having
this kind of definition or that
kind of definition is that we
simply learn how to make decisions correctly. If we make decisions correctly
regardless of the definition and regardless of the dilemmas of each definition, we will
have a way to move correctly in this life and to navigate the maia in a way that is
beneficial to us and beneficial to our potential.
So, definition may be at the very beginning of anyone's introduction to Human
Design, but it stays with you no matter how deep you go in the knowledge. It is the
framework of anything that we do with this knowledge analytically, and it is
something truly to grasp. What I hope I leave you with from this brief review over
the last couple of weeks of the various different kinds of definitions is to really to
recognize the true difference between the various kinds of splits, not to confuse
them and begin to see what their dilemma is and what are their processes in order to
be able to understand these beings better.
Anyway, to all of you, nice that you join me for my morning coffee and I look
forward to next week. We‘ll see then; bye for now.

Type: Generators
Hello to all of you that are here. We come to one of those classic places in the
knowledge of Human Design. It is in essence, the very foundation of what this
knowledge is about and what it's for. The understanding of Type is something that
over 20 years now has been explored in all kinds of different ways. Obviously, I
have taught many, many, many different courses about all this. But I would like to
keep it to a particular perspective. I would like to begin with a real understanding of
what this means, this Type. We're going to be looking today at pure Generators and
Manifesting Generators.
Type
When I was given the knowledge I was not given Type names—Generator,
Manifestor—I was simply told that there were four different configurations and there
were four different kinds of vehicles. Basically, General Motors, Mercedes, Ford, I
don‘t know, four different companies making certain kinds of vehicles, and without

sounding flip it's really, in a sense, the easiest way to grasp what Type leads to.
That is, we've already seen that there's no such thing as Type until we see the
nature of the definition, that the definition or lack of it in the case of the Reflector,
and we‘ll look at that, that the definition establishes what is the consistent imprint
and it‘s out of this consistent
imprint that we get a holistic
configuration, what we see in
this BodyGraph, a BodyGraph
rooted in a circuitry matrix
and we get to see a certain
configuration in that circuitry
matrix.
What you to get to notice
and it was an interesting
process for me because it
wasn't just simply that it was
new knowledge, it had never
been taught. At the same
time that I was trying to
digest on the surface what I
had been given, I was also at
the same time in the process
of trying to attract other people to the knowledge. When I first began teaching the
knowledge I just dealt with the basics of definition and what definition led to. And
when I began training people I trained them in, and those trainings were quite
limited, I trained them in as much detail as I was comfortable giving them.
Statistical Research
In those early years it was clear to me that nobody recognized that there was a
grouping of the graphics, and again not anybody's fault, after all this was new
knowledge and very limited in what I was actually able to share in those early years.
So I began what I consider to be the second step in developing the transferability of
Human Design. That is, to be able to point out very clearly these four different
vehicles and to begin to show a generic way in which they all operate. This is the
basis of Type, that is, the fact that there is a division of four is without question.
And when I say that it is without question-in the late 1990s Human Design and its
calculation system was placed through a whole statistical research process. And
basically that research was focused on the legitimacy of the differentiations of Type.
In other words, basically what was done was a statistician was given Type data
based on samples that were rooted in 5000 calculations each, four of those 5000
calculations—when I say 5000 we didn't use actual birth data, we invented it, if you
know what I mean. In other words, for statistical purposes so that we took 5000
dates spread out over one decade and then took 5000 dates spread out over another
decade. We covered four decades. All that information was crunched. In other

54
LECTURE FOUR
Type: Generators
words, the Type that was a by-product of all those particular dates was crunched into
the whole statistical program.
The results of that, and they were published many, many years ago, that not only
was there a clearer distinction between Types, but that the possibility that that was a
construct, in other words, the possibility that I, for example, had made it up and said
that these are the four different divisions, I remember being quite impressed by the
fact that the odds were 60 billion—60 million, million—to one against the possibility
that anybody could figure that one out.
So, it was interesting to see that that was one of the early scientific confirmations
that I received. The most astounding obviously was the discovery that indeed the
neutrino had mass. But for me the statistical evidence to substantiate Type was
something that was very important. It said that it was a genetic construct and only
as a genetic construct could it have held up.
The other thing that was very interesting about it statistically was that if you're
presenting, for example, what you think is—you‘re a pharmaceutical company and
you're presenting a new drug on the market that you think is going to heal or help
with some kind of disease. There are huge amounts of tests that need to be done,
that is, before the drug can be released on the market. All of those tests are
subjected to statistical analysis. And the statistical analysis is how stable the
evidence is of the validity of the medicine. And there is a quotient that's required for
that in order for that drug, whatever it is, to be released. And that quotient, I don't
remember how the numbers work, but anyway, it was a set figure.
The veracity of the differentiation between Types had a quotient that was over 300
times higher than what was required statistically to verify the validity of a particular
drug. So, one of the things that we‘re dealing with and we've all learned that, at
least those of us who are professionals who have worked with Design for a very long
time, Type is something that has no question marks attached to it. So, what are we
really looking at then? And of course, this is the real point of all this.
The Nature of the Vehicle is Expressed through its Aura
In other words, we‘re looking at different kinds of vehicles. And the extension of
looking at different kinds of vehicles is understanding that the vehicle is expressed
through its aura. The aura is a by-product, obviously, of the vehicle. But the nature
of the vehicle is expressed in the aura. And again, something really to grasp about
the understanding of Type is that it begins with not so much saying, okay here is a
Generator because we've got a defined Sacral, but in the moment that you're
thinking in terms of Generator that the first thing you need to understand is the kind
of frequency that this particular kind of vehicle puts off.
We only have four kinds of brands, you know. It's not like the automobile world that
we live in where there are hundreds of manufacturers, maybe thousands. Here we
have four different kinds of models. That‘s it. So it's very significant in that sense,
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

55
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
that is, that there is a unifying construct and four of these that cover all of our
species. And that these particular vehicles aren't just simply an arbitrary way in
which configuration is pulled together, but these frequencies have very, very specific
ways in which they operate because they all are vehicles.
In other words, this is a type of human bio-form. And what makes it a Type is not
so much what is in here, as an example, but it's how all of this operates. This is the
key; this is what Human Design brings. It brings an understanding that this is the
vehicle and the vehicle has a way of being operated correctly. We all learn that.
Any kind of vehicle from bicycles upwards, you learn that a vehicle can only operate
in a certain way. You learn how to operate the vehicle. You're not going to put
diesel in a gasoline engine, and so forth and so on.
So, the first thing to recognize about Type is that Type distinguishes us into four
different kinds of vehicles. Now, the vehicles are interesting because they are driven
differently. This is where you get into the magic of this knowledge. These are
vehicles and they are driven differently. It‘s what makes them different. What
defines their lives is the fact that they are driven differently. And of course herein
lies the dilemmas of homogenization and conditioning. What happens to the non-
energy Type when it‘s conditioned by the energy Type? What happens to the way in
which it is driven?
Generator: Open and Enveloping Aura
So, we have a vehicle and the vehicle has an expressed frequency, that aura. When
we‘re looking at a Generator we are looking at an open, an enveloping aura; open
and enveloping. No vehicle has a more powerful and more expansive aura than the
Generator vehicle. This is the
open aura, and enveloping. It
surrounds things; it takes them
in. And because it takes them in,
Generators are deeply susceptible
to conditioning. It's why of all the
Types only the Generator is here
to focus on themselves. They
need to find that focus on what is
consistent in them because that
open and enveloping aura is
going to bring things into them
very powerfully, because they pull
it in, this vehicle pulls things in.
When you first learn about your
design if you‘re a Generator you
have to deal with the big ―R‖
word, it makes them all nervous—the response word. What does it mean to
respond? What does it mean to not initiate? Now think about the vehicle. It‘s a

Type: Generators
Generator vehicle and the main principle of this vehicle is that it envelops and pulls
to itself. Now, think about its strategy and think about the dilemma that comes with
the madness of the not-self. I have done the readings of so many Generators,
thousands of them, and you say to them the best things in life, those things in life
that are really truly for you, good, bad and indifferent, you have to let them come to
you. You have to let them come to you, and it doesn't matter what it is. It makes
absolutely no difference what it is, the littlest to the biggest.
But think about what this vehicle does. It envelops and pulls things to it. One of the
things that I always try to remind Generators is that your aura is doing the talking,
the Generator that's always afraid that if I don't do it somebody else will, if I don't do
it now it's not going to happen. Yeah. But their aura is so incredibly powerful. It's
incredibly powerful. I‘m a Manifestor; I have an undefined Sacral Center. I live in a
house of Generators. Oh boy, are they powerful. Their auras literally fill every nook
and cranny of available space. This is their power, after all. It is the power
expressed by this kind of vehicle, open and enveloping.
My approach was Generators and Generator courses in general has always been to
try to get them to understand the magic and beauty of what it to be the generative
force on the planet, because that's what a Generator is. When we look statistically
at Generators, at the combination of the pure Generator and the Manifesting
Generator, we've got about 67- 68% of humanity. I mean, this is what keeps the
world alive. Everybody else is non-Sacral—Projectors, Manifestors, Reflectors. This
is not the world that we create. We live in a Generator-created world and a
Generator generated world is better as an expression.
Generator Not-Self Theme: Frustration
And we understand something very, very basic because the moment that you come
to Design and you find out that you're a Generator, the first thing you learn about is
your not-self theme—frustration. And when you think about the fact that 67 or 68%
of humanity are Generators and that nearly 100% of them are not-self, that you
know that we live in an enveloping world that envelops all of us in this dense field of
frustration, stagnation. It‘s a Generator world. In all the different approaches I've
had with Generators I tried to talk to them about the holiness, really, the
incredibleness of what it is to be a Generator. Generators are here to live out the
perfect existence in absolute harmony with the world around them. And like the
Druid said with no need to do, because it all gets done. And all of those ways of
describing the ―this‖ and the ―that‖ of the Generator; you know, the sign over Delphi
that said ―Know Thyself‖ is only for Generators, it‘s all that stuff.
Put it aside for a moment and see the vehicle. The machine, the mechanism; it‘s a
mechanism. It really is a mechanism. It's a bio-mechanism, it‘s sophisticated, and
it‘s interesting. But it happens to be part of a set type of mechanisms. And what is
the type, that grouping, what is it actually for? What does it point to, where does it
lead, who‘s the driver?

Type is about How to Drive the Vehicle
In the G Center is the monopole. The monopole is the key to everything. Within this
construct it is the monopole that holds us together in the illusion of our
separateness. And it gives us our direction, our movement in this line of geometry.
And that the way in which that movement is expressed is along the track of our
nodes in our design. Everything about us is that we do have a driver. And we don't
have a driver because we sit still, we have a driver because the vehicle is in
movement. These are not just simply different models these vehicles, they have
different ways in which they move, obviously.
And not only do they have a different way in which they move, but in order for each
and everyone of them to be able to express the nuance of what we are as a unique
being is that we have to know how to steer. It is the driver, the monopole that
steers. But the monopole is subject to the laws of the illusion, its frequency. And
this frequency is determined by one thing and one thing only. It is determined by
how we steer. And we steer in the sense that it becomes a concept for us. This is
the concept of making a decision. It's what Type is for. Type doesn't tell you who
you are. It can't. It doesn't tell you how you truly connect to the world around you.
Decision Making
That‘s not what Type is about. Type is about driving the vehicle. It's about how to
drive the vehicle. It's about how to steer the vehicle. It's the vehicle‘s guidance
manual. The nuance of that Type is so profound. There are so many variations that
are there within any possible model. It isn't about trying to find who you are
through your Type, it's about finding out how to become you through your Type by
knowing how to make decisions. We live in a binary. It‘s a deep thing, this binary,
this ―this‖ and ―that.‖ And we are always navigating between this and that, always.
This is what it is to be in a binary. And there are always these possibilities of ways
to go. We all know this from our minds. The ways to go are endless. But there's
only one way that‘s your way, and it isn't anybody else's way. But you can only get
there through being able to make decisions.
This is where the great struggle is in the knowledge. The difference between who we
think we are and the way in which our mental functions operate rooted in all the not-
self stuff and whatever else. And then of course on the other side, what is truly
hidden from us, what we have no conscious access to, what is really there in our
form principle. We‘ve had a great dilemma. The great dilemma is that it is here that
we have the ability to be able to move ourselves correctly in this life. This is all
about the vehicle. But you can't get to any of this by thinking about it. You don't
have access to it. You cannot integrate your design into your life because you think
you can. You cannot. They will always be two very separate things from each other.
It is held together here. It is held together by the frequency of this illusion. And this
illusion is moving in space, and it needs to make adjustments as it moves along, and

Type: Generators
historically who we think we are is also who thinks it's the driver. This is your mind.
Your mind says, I, I, I am going to be the driver in this life. I'm going to decide
where we go. This is the not-self. And of course, this leads to the chaos and the
emptiness of the not-self life.
Human Design is understanding that this is a vehicle and recognizing that it is the
vehicle that is literally the life, that everything about strategy is about giving the
authority over to the vehicle and the vehicle's cognitive potential. It's about taking it
away from the personality. It is about decision making, but not the decision making
of the mind, a decision making process that‘s actually very mysterious, because you
can't really get to the root of it because it is unconscious. But it reveals itself. And it
reveals itself through its ability within us to express its presence, if we know where it
is.
Generators Steers in Response
To be a Generator doesn't mean that you're standing around waiting for anything.
You are not. Generators are alive. They have all of this power in them. It's about
the decision, and only the decision that has to be made in response. This is what it‘s
all about. It's the decision making. It's not about, I will go there. There lies folly.
That‘s not the way you drive this
vehicle. This vehicle drives, steers in
response. This is what it does, this is
where it's at its best reacting to the
course in front of them, instead of trying
to plow their way blindly.
And when they're reacting to the course
that‘s in front of them they‘re brilliant,
making this adjustment and that
adjustment as they move along,
decisions in response. Not life—
decisions. It‘s what Type is for, so you
can know how to make a decision as
yourself, to make a decision that is the
decision of the vehicle implemented by
the driver. It‘s not about your mind getting in the way, getting lost, making up some
kind of story. It‘s a vehicle. It doesn‘t matter who you are if you‘ve got that big red
center there, smack in the middle, all lit up.
There is only one way to steer. It's not like you can reinvent the wheel. It's not like
you can change the way in which the navigation system works in the vehicle, you
cannot. You can just get lost. And it‘s nuances. It's in the nano world, these
slightly off and you miss everything. This is all about where you are. I can go on
and on and on about all of the various things about what it is to be a Generator and
this and that and the other thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah that‘s very interesting.

It was pointed out before the class—I've posted to the Jam Player my signature
series of lectures on Type as a free access for people. And by the way, if you
haven‘t heard them, certainly listen to your Type, because those are some of the
best example of any standing lectures that I‘ve done on Type. There are all kinds of
that kind of information. But, I want you to be simpler in the approach before you
get into the nuances of the way that Generators work and whether some can go
―aha‖ and ―uh-huh,‖ and others can‘t and this and that, and all the nuances of it—the
difference between the emotional Generators and the splenic Generators and the
Ego, and this and that. There are all these things and all these variations that are
used in order to build a character construct. But I want to get back to what this is
really about. Yes, Type does bring out similarities, these are similar vehicles. And
the not-self Generator is very obvious, perhaps the most obvious of Types.
But the key in all of this is just to see what this is. It's a vehicle and a mechanism of
how to steer the vehicle, how to drive it, how to guide it, how to move it correctly.
We don't have a deep love for the body on this plane. We really don't. And it's been
a very, very long time since the awe and wonder of consciousness has been focused
on our form and not on the vagaries of our minds. The mechanism is extraordinary.
We've been blessed in the last hundred years with scientific investigations that rather
than demystifying or making mundane the nature of these vehicles, it is just awe-
inspiring how sophisticated, how incredible these mechanisms really are.
We pay attention to our bodies only when we are suffering from them. And we do
not treat them as the intelligence that they are, because we don't see our bodies as
different from our personalities. We've been so busy owning our bodies and
dictating our folly in these lives that we have never had an opportunity to recognize
two very simple things. One is that we are a binary consciousness and the other is
that we have been ignoring the most important consciousness we have. This is what
Type brings us to. The Type gives you a technique to reach the correct authority to
be able to have a conscious relationship, a personality relationship to what is the
correct authority. After all, it is your mind that takes this in. It is the weakness of
the mind and how curious it is and its rationale that it can always deny what it takes
in.
The Vehicles Come with Their Own Consciousness
The secret is just an understanding that the vehicles come with their own
consciousness. This first thing that if you look at—there‘s been so many interesting
investigations in Human Design and one that was fascinating for me and contains a
treasure trove of information is the work I did on pregnancy, on the whole nine-
month process and particularly the first 88° of the process where the infrastructure
of the vehicle is built, where there is no personality, where the personality won't be
in the vehicle until 88° or 88-89 days approximately before birth. This vehicle is
intelligently guided through all of that process.

Type: Generators
And you see it so clearly in these early stages where the vehicle and the driver, that
is, the design crystal and the monopole are alone within the vehicle, that they don't
have any companion of the personality, that the personality doesn‘t come in there.
The arrogance of the personality, the Johnny-come-lately that gets to sit in the
backseat and thinks it is going to drive the whole show, when the show has been
built on this relationship.
When somebody is following their Strategy and Authority what they are doing is that
they are aligning themselves to what is, in fact, their deep intelligence within the
vehicle, their cognition. It is, in fact, the cognition rather than the Sacral itself, in a
sense, it is the cognition that is actually making the decisions that gets expressed in
this particular case through this splenic Sacral connection and it bypasses the mind.
And the decision is made between the driver and vehicle.
The dilemma is that the personality always wants to be the driver, always trying to
do away with the monopole, in the sense. It wants to select the direction. It wants
to be the one that's in charge. And of course it can't, it just doesn't work that way,
so you end up with the dilemmas of the not-self, the deep dilemmas of the not-self.
It's a vehicle. It's all about how it's driven. And the way in which we experience the
maia, this driving of the vehicle to steering, the navigating of the vehicle, this is
what Type gives us, these very, very simple, very, very simple keys—inform,
respond.
The Sacral Center
Let's briefly just look at the Generator configuration itself. The Sacral center is a
center that obviously has enormous power. It is the center fundamentally of our
fertility; it is the key to the way in which all life forms operate. To be a life form
without the Sacral just does not work. It
is life itself. And as such, it‘s very
powerful, which means that one of the
dilemmas of the Sacral is how it's
nourished. The way in which the body
has been ignored, one of the primary
ways in which the body has been ignored
is through diet.
Affluence, particularly affluence in
industrialized countries throughout the
world, whether in the east or the west,
leads to disarray in the way in which
food is taken in and the kinds of foods
that are taken in. The way people eat—
one of the most extraordinary things of
the last 60 or 70 years is the phenomenon of food service, that is, restaurants of all
kinds, of all natures anywhere in the world how extraordinarily abundant they are,
the way in which the eating process and the way in which food is provided and the

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
way in which we are trained in our relationship to food, one of the things to be clear
about in terms of honoring the vehicle is that ultimately honoring the vehicle is
something that is quite complex and takes great dedication in life. That is, you
honor the vehicle by sleeping in your own bed, you honor the vehicle by eating
correctly, and you honor the vehicle by operating correctly. There are many, many
stages to finally being able to embrace the temple that is our form.
After all, the mind, as brilliant as it is, it is only a passenger and can never be
anything more than a passenger. That is, it is the gift of mind to be able to find a
way, to be able to experience phenomena and to be able to digest the experience of
phenomena and to play with it, to play with it on the mental plane, to be a good
passenger, to be a good observer, to be a good watcher. That's very different than
the function of what appears to be, anyway, our lives. All of this all of this comes
from the vehicle itself. And it means that if you're operating correctly, in this case as
a Generator, that is, if you're making decisions out of response, there are many,
many levels of things that are slowly correcting in your system. But most important
is that you're beginning to change your geometry.
Manifestor Disease
Now, the dilemma for the Generator, of course, is that Generators suffer from
Manifestor disease. And Manifestor disease, which is even worse in Manifesting
Generators, is a real killer. That is, I'm going to do what I'm going to do. And that's
Manifestor disease. Obviously, everything about the Generator and its potential falls
apart the moment that the Generator is dictating what it is going to do. And again,
this is the business of who is going to be
the driver. Is the monopole going to be
allowed to do its job being properly
guided by the cognition of the vehicle,
or is the personality constantly
interfering and constantly trying to be
the driver?
The simple beauty of Human Design is
that these vehicles, which absolutely
exist within the context of the maia, that
each of these vehicular groups truly
have their own way to be driven, and
unless you drive them that way, they
don't work. You just get all the
dilemmas. If I look at this person's design it's obvious to me that their whole life is
caught up in looking for skills in the now. I don‘t even have to talk about them in
terms of what's possible for them, because I know how deeply conditioned they are.
And then there's all the openness that goes with all that, and there's enough of it,
and then you end up with a situation where you have somebody that has absolutely
no connection to what they are, and it is this mind and its unconscious ideas and its

Type: Generators
mouth that just won't stop that keeps on saying, I‘m going to do this, I‘m going to
do that and the other thing; frustration, just plain old-fashioned frustration.
And if you say to them that you have to wait until you have a chance to respond, all
of that. They say, no, it doesn‘t work. Who‘s going to ask me, who is going to come
to me, and then they forget what it is to be a Generator with a powerful, open and
enveloping aura. You're the Generator girl at the high school dance, and if you live
your Generator nature, you won‘t have to sit there very long, because you‘ve got an
open and enveloping aura and it pulls things toward you. Now, you may not be
happy about everything that it pulls towards you and you don't have to say ―yes‖ to
anything that approaches you just because it's correct, that they are operating
correctly just means they're respecting you for who you are. But, you don't want to
get up and go looking for somebody to dance with. It would be a horror. It‘s just
not going to work; you‘re just going to end up being frustrated.
Powerful Enveloping Aura
And it's not about saying, oh, woe is me I can't go and get it, it is about
understanding who you are and how powerful that is. I‘m non-Sacral; I know how
powerful the Sacral is in pulling you in. Boy, does it pull you in. It takes effort for a
non-Sacral being to get out of that
enveloping aura. Projectors can't. I
know all the stuff that Generators will
say about Projectors, but I want to tell
you something, to be a Projector in a
Generator‘s aura is no cup of tea either;
they can‘t get out. They have to be let
go. I‘m a Manifestor, I get out, but it
doesn‘t mean that there isn't friction and
dilemmas in getting out. It's a very
powerful aura pulling things into it.
You don‘t have to worry about not being
asked, you don‘t have to worry about not
being approached. It‘s inherent in you
to pull that towards you. All you have to do is let it come and then you can begin to
divine what your life is, because your life is a series of adjustments as you move.
It's the series of adjustments that are made through the decision making process,
decision by decision by decision.
One of the subjects that‘s always discussed about the pure Generator is the power of
or the potential power of the Generator voice; I know the dilemmas of that. I know
the dilemmas of doing readings for Generators and they don't even hear their own
Generators sounds they‘re so disconnected to it, they‘re so attached to the verbal.
Here would be a deep conflict in this person; they‘re deeply connected to their verbal
stuff. They want to express themselves verbally, they want to initiate verbally.

This is going to be a very, very limited Sacral. It will be a Sacral that will emerge
maybe while they‘re eating, maybe while they‘re having sex; it is a Sacral that is not
going to be powerful. One of the things about the Sacral is that not all Sacrals have
this deep tonal potential in it that it just jumps at you, but all Sacral beings have
these sounds if you listen to them. You'll hear them. They just have never been
given power or dominance.
Then again, one of the things that's very important for Generators when they first
begin the process is to really go through a question-and-answer session, several
actually and particularly if they‘re emotional. And not particularly for the answers; I
don't discount what the answers may be. But for me that exercise is an exercise
that empowers the Sacral Center. It gives it voice for the first time. And for most
people who are Generators their Sacrals are dysfunctional. That is, they‘re not
healthy. They are-in many ways the Sacral voice is repressed; they have been
frustrated too long. And they‘re deeply, deeply lost in their Manifestor disease.
Generator Sleep Pattern
So, the basic keys in what it is to be a Generator, one of those things that all
Generators have to come to grips with is to try to find a way to enliven the power of
their Sacral. Something very important for Generators to keep in mind is that
Generators need to have a very, very specific kind of sleeping pattern, that it's very
important for Generators to go to sleep exhausted. And I don‘t mean burnt out,
unless you‘re a particular burnout person, but I mean, when they've really had it. It
is not really healthy for Generators, and I have talked about this in relationship to
children, to have early bedtimes, for
example, as kids, because it is very
distressing for them and very unhealthy
for them. The healthiest Generators are
those that go to sleep when they can‘t
stay up anymore and in that way while
they were sleeping they get the full
regeneration of their Sacral system, and
obviously they have a healthier morning
when they wake up.
The other thing, of course, and this goes
without saying that the integrity of the
auras, everything, it is essential for
people to sleep in their own aura;
otherwise, there's very little you can do
to help somebody. If you don't wake up as yourself, it's practically impossible to get
you there. So, it's one of those things that are really very much a part of—you enter
into this experiment, you enter into an experiment of really transforming your life. It
is what it‘s about.

Type: Generators
I watched the other day, Alok, by the way, the television show, because you had a
nice piece in that Eye On Design. And your comments about Human Design being
heresy, and it is, and the heresy begins with how you sleep. Sleeping alone is not
something that has ever been a common practice, it goes against the genetic
imperative and it is one of the first steps in freeing yourself from the homogenized
rules of the way in which we‘re supposed to exist, and opens up the possibility slowly
for you to begin to define your own existence, your own reality, your own
possibilities. Humanity for most of its history has been just trapped in the deepest
possible conditioning, because nobody ever woke up as themselves. This was the
fantasy that you were going to spend your life curled around another body. So it‘s
something to keep in mind.
Manifesting Generators
My final comments here are about the Manifesting Generator, and obviously this, by
the way, is not a pure Manifesting Generator. There's only one. That is, those
people that have the 20/34. That is, the direct connection between the Sacral and
the Throat. That's actually a pure Manifesting Generator. All the others are
Generators who happen to
have a manifesting capacity.
And in this case that
capacity is through the
archetype and up here
through the channel of
talent.
When we‘re dealing with a
Manifesting Generator we
already have a problem.
That is, their parents raise
them to be Manifestors, and
they are Manifestors. So,
for all intents and purposes
they live a Manifestor life.
But, they live a Manifestor
life that has tremendous
handicaps, and it has
tremendous handicaps,
because if you look at, and we will, the Manifestor, we see that the Manifestor has a
closed aura that is repelling. Now, that's not what a Generator is, and this is a
Generator. It doesn't matter what kind of configurations are in there, a Generator is
a Generator is a Generator, which means their aura is open and enveloping; not
closed and repelling, which means that when they play the Manifestor role they get
more resistance than anybody else. They get more resistance than Manifestors, they
get more resistance than pure Generators trying to be Manifestors, they get
tremendous resistance.

THE FOUR VIEWS

The other thing is that the longer they are involved in their Manifestor trip, the more
problems they have in terms of their relationships with others. And what I mean by
that is that the tendency in the Manifesting Generator is to bypass things; in other
words, to try to eliminate frustration at light speed. When Manifesting Generators
enter into anything, they‘re always moving too fast. And it means that they overlook
things, and they forget things. And because they are caught in the Manifestor game,
they don't want to go back and fix them either. It brings back this distaste for
frustration. The pure Generator suffers from its frustration; the Manifesting
Generator fights it, and fights it and ends up even more frustrated.
So, one of the dilemmas for the Manifesting Generator is to realize that this is not a
unique model. It‘s the most important thing to grasp. I can remember people when
I was doing all this work and introducing Type and it came from certain people that
were part of my work at the time to try to establish the Manifesting Generator as a
fifth Type. Well, it‘s not. And it‘s not simply because first of all statistically that's
not valid. Second of all, the Voice was very clear that there were only four kinds of
vehicles. It is a Generator.
And the dilemma for Manifesting Generators is that they have to accept that they are
Generators. It's only when they come to grips with the fact that no matter what
they look like in here, it's all very nice, blah, blah, blah, but the vehicle expresses
itself exactly the same—open and enveloping aura. And that decision making has to
be made in response;
otherwise, they're not
going to have the right
direction. And of course
this open and enveloping
aura, when they're not
correct they are open and
bring in the resistance.
They pull it into
themselves.
Type is never going to tell
you who you are, but it
does tell you how to get
there. That‘s the thing.
That's what it's for. It‘s
not to be confused as a
personality construct, a
persona construct. We'll
see that in profile. That is,
we‘ll see that there are all kinds of characters who operate through all the various
different vehicles. But when you're looking at Type you are looking at the secret of
the knowledge, because when you're looking at Type you're simply looking at how,
first of all, that there are these four different vehicles and second how to operate
them correctly. That's all. If you only get that much, your life will be transformed,
just that, because this is the secret. It's so on the surface it's unbelievable. It's

right there on the surface. It's not deep, deep, deep down, because deep down
doesn't tell you how to drive.
It may tell you how to stay healthier. It may be able to awaken your mind. It may
be able to show you connections that transcend the obvious. But only this gets you
there. All those deep things don't matter if you're not correct in the way in which
you drive in this life. This is your vehicle. This is what it demands. And these
vehicles are only different by the way in which they are steered; nothing more,
nothing less. And the movement is decision making, that's what we call it, this
adjustment in the constant movement between this and that so we find our way
through that.
The secret to life, the secret to perfection, it's really an amazing thing. So when you
think about Type, there are two things to think about: what is the aura and how
does it steer. This is it. Everything else, it is all interesting. It's all interesting. It's
so interesting I've been teaching it over 20 years and I still have not lost interest. It
is interesting stuff. But what makes your life worthwhile is its correctness, and that's
about the driver. That's about the vehicle. Decision making, this is the secret. And
Type tells you very simply there are only four ways to steer. There are only four
kinds of decision making.
Okay, I‘m glad you were here to share my morning coffee with me; always nice to
do the basics. I hope you all enjoyed that, and until next time, bye for now.

Type: Projector
The Evolutionary Process
Good morning to all of you that are here. We continue our look at Type and today
we're going to focus on Projector. Before I get into looking at Projector per se, it‘s
interesting to just put things into context. Human Design is something that has a
unique perspective on the evolutionary process. That is, it‘s part of the general
cosmological knowledge associated with Design that at the time of the discovery of
Uranus in 1781 that we had a transition from what had been the seven-centered
vehicle, that is, the seven-centered vehicle best known through the Hindu Brahman
chakra system, that seven-centered vehicle that had been literally our vehicle since
the time of the Neanderthals, that is, a
huge span in terms of the development
of what we call modern human. In 1781
we had this transition to the nine-
centered form, that is, the form that is
called rave in terms of the way in which
we look at it as a classification, the Rave
BodyGraph, as an example. It's really
represented by the fact that we have this
nine-centered form.
There are no end to hierarchies. The
maia is built on them. And the division
that we understand as Type, this division
has had its hierarchical dimensions.
Something to recognize immediately when looking at the question of Type is to
recognize, like everything that you will see in Human Design, Human Design is a
binary system, it is dualistic. The moment that you look you're always going to see
that there are these two sides of things. One of the things that were dealing with in
this transition from the seven centered to the nine centered is that we‘re dealing
with the emergence of a new kind of being.
Eighty percent of humanity, just below 80% of humanity, are energy types.
Humanity is dominated by Generators and Manifestors. Manifestors are minor. They
are only about 8.3% of the population, but the Generators are about 67 or 68%.
Together they represent basically three quarters of humanity, and that means that
humans driven as energy types were something that fully dominated what was the
seven-centered era, an era that was fundamentally strategic.

The advent of the nine-centered being brought something new. That is, it brings the
emergence of the other side. That is, the passive to the active, the receptive to the
strategic, a very different way in which the orientation of our senses, a very different
way in which our evolution is moving. And we have these two sides of the coin.
That is, human beings are divided actually, in terms of the way in which we do
holistic analysis; human beings are divided according to their left-ness and their
right-ness or combinations thereof. And all of this is a preamble to beginning to
understand something about the Projector.
The Projector
The Projector is the largest—it is basically the vast majority of what we call the non-
energy types. That is, Projector and Reflector, but Reflectors are 1.4% of the
population and Projectors are somewhere between 22 and 23% of the population.
Projectors are in fact a very large group, the second largest group behind
Generators. In terms of the hierarchical way in which the pre-nine centered life
worked, it was basically ruled by Manifestors.
One of the things that I've talked about over the years as a way of trying to express
a fundamental change in the era that we live in now that began in 1781 is that this is
the time of the ascendancy of the Projector. Basically it is the ascendancy of a
different way of doing things. I‘m being very simple at that level. Energy types do
things in a certain way; get things done in a certain way. Non-energy types are very
different. One of the things about understanding dualism is to understand that

Type: Projectors
within the context of the way Human Design is laid out mechanically and graphically
what you don't have is where you can become wise. And of course, this is the first
thing to recognize about what it is to be a Projector, just to begin with.
What you don't have, and here's an archetypal example of it, what you don't have is
what you have a potential wisdom for. So here in looking at this particular Projector,
we are looking at not simply the standard, in other words, the moment that the
Sacral Center is defined you have a Generator so it is always the rule in trying to
define a Type, to begin with you look at the Sacral to see whether it's defined or not.
Obviously, if you're only looking at the Sacral level of this, this could be a Projector
and it could be a Manifestor, obviously, it can't be a Reflector, until you take a look
at the rest of the story. In other words, in this particular case it is obvious because
you have an undefined Throat. The Throat could, as an example, be defined up here
to the Ajna Center, and obviously this would still be a Manifestor because there's no
continuous connection.
But, the first thing to recognize is the generalization of this. In other words, instead
of just looking at this in the obvious way that we do when we look at the surface in
Human Design, look at conditioning, and obviously we'll talk about the conditioning
of Projector. The thing to recognize about them is the thing that they are most
naturally wise about is the use of energy. It doesn't mean, by the way, that they act
wisely, because of course they're not-self and as not-self there is no way for them to
live out the advantages of what it is for them to be a Projector.

The Projector’s Role as Leader
But to continue my cosmological line for a moment, with a Projector on the
ascendancy because the Projector is not a strategic entity, that it is a much more
receptive entity, that it is easy for us to imagine the leader that leads, like the
Manifestor. The Manifestor is the obvious example of what one would think of as the
leading Type. They stand up there and they say I am going this way, they let
everybody know, they inform, it‘s correct, I'm going this way, and if you want, follow
me. This is basically the Manifestor.
And one would think in the terms of leadership that that is what leadership is about.
The problem is that our concepts of leadership are rooted in our seven-centered
history. That seven-centered history that predates 1781 still is very much alive
today the way in which our consciousness works in which leadership is precisely that,
that every child is raised to be a little leader, because they're all propagandized to be
Manifestors, except the Manifestors, of course. So you end up with this dysfunction
in the way in which our society is led, all the little leaderships going from the family
outward into all the various directions.
We‘re entering into an age, we already did, it began in 1781, but in evolutionary
time that's nothing, it takes time for things to crystallize. The fact is that it is the
time for the Projector to take on its role as a leader, but not as a leader in the
manifesting sense, but as a guide in the inherent sense of what it used to be as
Projector. The name itself says so much about this Type. And remember something
when we're thinking about Type, it is very easy to end up characterizing human
beings according to their Type, be careful with that. That is, normally what you‘re
characterizing is the way in which that Type operates as not-self, not the way it
operates as true self, because as true self Type is simply a way that guides you to
the Strategy and Authority that is going to be correct for you that's going to allow
you to live out the life that is correct for you.
A Focusing Aura
Projectors have something interesting about them. And what is interesting about
them is the way in which their aura functions. We saw last week when we were
looking at Generators that we saw that they had these open and enveloping auras
taking everything in, very open, in that sense and pulling everything into it, pulling it
into their Generator bubble. But when you're dealing with a Projector a Projector is
very different. A Projector‘s aura literally focuses, and it focuses on the other. It
doesn't focus—the assumption about Projector is that they're after your energy,
which is not true, by the way. They‘re not after it; they don‘t have to be after it.
They were designed to be able to gain access to it. But in fact, what they are indeed
focusing on is your identity, this, the G Center. This is where the focus is of
Projector.

LECTURE FIVE
Type: Projectors
They‘re very different from Generators. Generators are very self-absorbed, because
they're meant to be. No other Type is designed to look and only look at themselves
to figure themselves out. They have to. And ―know thyself‖ is a Generator mantra,
a deep genetic Generator mantra, they have to do that. But, that's not what a
Projector is, nor a Manifestor or Reflector, for that matter. A Projector is not
interested in themselves. It is one of the dilemmas of the Projector, how long it
takes to wake a Projector up to the possibility that there is something that is them,
rather than what they get through the other.
Because they are designed as an aura to focus they have a unique capacity. It is a
capacity to recognize, that is the language we use. That recognition is not
necessarily mental. It is a capacity to hone in on what is, in fact, the essence of the
other being. This is what they do. And because their aura is focused in that way,
they themselves, given the nature of their design and all of its relative openness that
they become particularly open, but they don't become open like other people
become open. They invite
the openness. And their
openness is an open
invitation, because they're
designed that way, which
of course makes it very,
very difficult for Projector,
very difficult for them to
escape the influence of the
conditioning forces that
are around them from the
moment that they came
into the world.
You're a Generator and a
Projector and you're sitting
in a room with some
obnoxious people. And at
some point one of the
obnoxious people says
something that really is offensive to the Projector and the Projector really doesn't do
anything. They may make a comment or something, what they really want to do is
get up and get the hell out of there and they can't. When it is the Generator‘s turn
to be insulted, the Generator response, gets up and leaves and on their coat tail is
the Projector finally getting a chance to go out the door. That's not an easy thing. It
is the power of being conditioned, it is the power of being drawn into situations that
are not correct, and on and on and on.
But something to understand inherently about what it is to be a Projector is that
because you were focused on the other—I think it was Tim earlier who asked about
the Projector endowment. This is something that I instituted when we started the
Jam Player that it would be possible for Projectors to have a special discount; it‘s a
relatively large one, a 30% discount. It‘s not on everything, but it‘s on a lot of

73
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
things. The reason that‘s there is that I know how difficult it is for the Projector in
their process of transition to be able to live out the potential of who they are. They
cannot do that without an education, and that education is that they have to be able
to understand the other.
There is nothing more important for a Projector, nothing more important in their life,
than their ability through whatever mechanism, it doesn't have to be Human Design,
it can be whatever the hell it is, Projectors are the kinds of beings that need to study
systems, any kind of system. You can be an electrician, an architect, whatever the
case may be, but the thing is about Projectors is that this is their thing. And of
course, because they're focused on the other and because in so many ways the
quality of the other—one of my favorite metaphors for many years, it's a little dark,
is that Projectors have to imagine themselves as cannibals, I told you it was dark.
And if you‘re a Projector and you imagine yourself as a cannibal you really have to
begin to look at people and wonder whether or not you actually want to eat them,
because of course to be a Projector means that you do not simply take in
conditioning, you take in the conditioning that generates, motivates and moves your
process.
It's not that you're dependent on the other. I think this is one of the things that
Projectors misunderstand when they come into the knowledge and they begin to
understand that they‘re a non-energy type, is the assumption that they are
dependent on the other. It's an odd way of looking at it; it‘s sort of a guilty way of
looking at it, or a lack of self-worth way of looking at. They were not designed to be
dependent on anything. They were designed to be in a world in which it was
available. Now, that's very different. You're a Projector born into a world in which
there are a lot of Generators. Well, very good, it's not like you're dependent on
them, because again, the moment that you see it that way you're lost in it that way.
Recognition
There are two things that are so interesting about Projectors. It is a binary, after all,
the ―this‖ and ―that.‖ They have this gift of being able to look out and being able to
see something, recognize something in the other, this probing of their aura, this
digging in, in a sense, of their aura. And of course, at the same time that creates
often a backlash, it creates a reaction and the reaction is recognition.
Now, any of you here in this class, if you‘re a Projector there is a great experiment
for you to do. I assume you've done it before in your life and I assume that you
understand that it works, but nonetheless, if you haven't it's nice to do. When
you're in an environment, a neutral environment, sitting in a shop or a café or
something like that, focus your Projector attention on somebody's back, just on their
back. Don‘t be obvious about it, you don't have to, but just focus on it and see how
long it takes them to turn around. This is the Projector aura. It is a very, very
focused powerful aura.

LECTURE FIVE
Type: Projectors
Formal Invitations
And it's the thing to understand about it, so immediately you get the recognition.
And of course, most Projectors because they‘re not-self and they‘re not very aware,
this honing in on the back of others is a kind of swiveling lighthouse that is
constantly attracting what may be, not very effective, not very valued attention,
because Projectors will get their attention. I can remember when I first began to
introduce this, and it was one thing to tell these Generators that couldn‘t initiate,
that they had to respond, but it's another thing to say to a Projector, look, you have
to wait for a formal invitation. It seems like an ordeal. It seems almost like
impossibility. A Generator can be winked at and it can respond, if you know what I
mean.
If you‘re a Projector it really has to be a formal invitation. This is what the invitation
is all about. And of course, the thing is that Projectors really don't understand that
this would basically be the only way things would happen in their life if they just
trusted the power of their aura. The aura that pulls that attention, that pulls the
recognition, it pulls the invitation. It's the way their auras work, it‘s the way they
do. And it's really something to grasp about what it is to be a Projector. You've got
this very, very, very focused aura.
And yes, it does often disturb the other. There is an illusion that runs around about
the Projector-Generator relationship; because, I have many times talked about how
this is really the foundation for the viability of what we do as humans on this planet
is the relationship between these two. One of the things about the response of
Generators to the pinpointing of the Projector aura is that most Generators simply
resent the fact that they don't seem to get anything back.
67 or 68% of the planet are Generators and Generators have enveloping auras.
When Generator meets a Generator there is this mutual aura bubble that's created.
It can be, obviously, very enriching and very special, but there is always this—you're
getting something in the connection. And of course, when you're dealing with a
Projector as a Generator that's not what it feels like. It doesn't feel like that at all.
And of course, this leads to a misunderstanding of what is the inherent relationship. I
started my career with the focus, and my focus was to free the slaves. Basically the
slaves were the Generators.
The Need for Correct Communication between the Generator and the
Projector
But, it‘s something to understand about freeing the slaves is that they don't
necessarily know what to do when you free them. It is about freeing them from
being Manifestors. It's about freeing them to be able to respond in this life. But, the
gift of being able to know what is good for all in the doing is ultimately the
relationship that can be there between the Projector who is there to understand
deeply how, where energy should be used, its ability to guide, not lead. It's not
replacing the Manifestor. The way in which we relate to each other is changing. I'm

a Manifestor. It's my way or the highway. This is the way I lead. I don't have any
other way to do it. I‘m a Manifestor. This is not the way in which the movement
into the future is intended to be. This was a great change that came in 1781. And
until there is this correct communication that is going to be there between the
Generator and the Projector relative to their respective roles, only then are we really
going to see progress, real progress.
So it is an interesting subject, it's a sidebar to all this, but it is something that every
Projector has to deal with. One of my concerns in talking about Projectors is that
they don't have an inferiority complex because they‘re a non-energy type. That
would be a terrible distortion of what is the unique beauty of what it is to be a
Projector. As Types, I‘m a Manifestor, I‘m not a Generator, I don‘t have a defined
Sacral, we are not born deficient because we are not Generators. Again, that‘s
something really to grasp. Generators, yes, they are the cornerstone of life on the
planet and there's no question about it they are the great generative force. But we
all have a function in this process, and a necessary one in this process.
No Instant Gratification
So, to begin with, when you enter into the beginning of your own self-recognition as
being a Projector there's a number of things that you have to realize that you have
to do to lessen the burden of what your process is going to be. The first thing is to
dismiss any idea that you're about to get instant gratification because if you're after
instant gratification I suggest that you go see a guru, or something, I don‘t know
because there is absolutely no instant gratification in this. It is really a process for a
Projector. Remember, because you are not tuned to yourself, you‘re saved in that,
by the way, given that Projectors are open and with very vulnerable places,
traditionally the Sacral, the fact that you're not inward pointed, in that sense, saves
you from the heaviness of the conditioning that in fact that you do take in as a
Projector.
The bottom line of what it is to begin to come to grips with yourself is to begin to see
that only as you understand how it works to be human—this is the great gift of this
knowledge, we get to see how human beings function, you get to see the rules by
which they function, you get to see the whole process. And all of those human
beings in your life that mean so much to you at a mechanical level, and yet can be
so bad for you at a personality level, that ultimately you begin to open up a way in
which you can develop the most important thing that you need to develop. It‘s
called discernment.
One of the things that Generators have as an advantage is that because they are a
life force and self-absorbed, a generative force, that they can immediately get into
their process of experimenting with being themselves. As a Projector you cannot do
that. You can't, you can't because you are in fact a being that has been deeply,
deeply, deeply conditioned. And you have to come to grips with that.

LECTURE FIVE
Type: Projectors
Education
One of the things that education does for a Projector is that it allows it to grasp the
depth of its conditioning; this is when you begin to get very smart. And after,
Projectors are, in that sense, born students. If you have a Projector child it's very
important to encourage their studies, it's important to encourage particularly those
areas where they have special interests, because in fact, the Projector as a Type is
here to recognize and to master systems, whatever they happen to be. And with the
proper encouragement and the right conditioning, because of course they are so
susceptible to conditioning, that there's a great deal of potential in that for them.
But in terms of the awakening process, for the Projector it is so clear that unlike the
Generator they cannot do it alone, they can't. And they can't do it alone, and I'm
pointing to the nodes because this is what integrates us into the world and moves us
from place to place, we are not alone. And it is obvious and clear that all of us who
have open Sacrals—Reflectors, Manifestors and Projectors—we are dependent on
being in the world with others. We're dependent on the Generator world, we‘re
dependent on it. And that everything about the way in which life is designed, that is,
the genetic imperative, the way in which we move towards pair bonding in order to
be reproductive, all those things, they bind us to a social mechanism.
The Projector is deeply, deeply bound to a social mechanism and that social
mechanism is not-self. And the density of not-self in a Projector can be really
profound. And there is no way that suddenly you can turn that around, you can‘t.
Like the Projector that has to wait for the Generator to be insulted so it can leave the
room. Time and study—I started this sort of sidebar with the Projector endowment,
Manifestors rarely, rarely take to being educated in relationship to themselves.
Generators, all you have to say to them is respond and if they're lucky enough and
they get it, it's an incredible transformation.
But, it was clear to me from the beginning how long it would take Projectors. I
mean, in the end it takes everybody the same amount of time. Please understand
that. It takes seven years to decondition the vehicle of an adult, so it takes seven
years, whether you're this or that. That is, the ability to disengage from the
conditioned habits of your life, this is a process that until you fulfill the demands of
being educated, this is the key. You can always tell, by the way, as a Projector what
is really interesting for you in this life or not, because if you're not ready to study it,
it is not something that you should even dabble with, because in fact this is your gift,
your gift is to really look into things and get to the foundation of them.
Wait for the Formal Invitation
And of course, as a science of differentiation what Human Design brings to the
Projector is it brings the ideal human tool, the thing that can protect it in its process.
Waiting for the invitation, this theme of discernment to know how to select the right

THE FOUR VIEWS

beings in your life. And you have to understand something about being a Projector,
rather than seeing it in through the eyes of other Types and the way they would see
Projectors, to really see it through your own eyes and to understand that the very
strategy that you have is an indication of the natural demand for respect that you
deserve.
Think about that, because it's true. You are designed to be beings who are formally
invited. That is a real sign of a very specific kind of respect for what is your nature.
And it is a key. Any of you that have Projector children begin to invite them to do
things. You'll see that there is an enormous difference in the way in which they
respond and relate to what it is. Again, Projectors suffer deeply as children with
being influenced by being trained or raised to be Manifestors, it is something that is
really devastating for them. And being told what to do is something that is deeply
uncomfortable for a Projector.
Something to grasp is that one of the big dilemmas of Projectors is that like
Reflectors and Reflectors obviously have the most, but they‘re different because
they‘re all open, is that there's a very high level of open Egos that go along with
being a Projector and it isn't to say that there aren‘t Ego Projectors, there are. But
in a general sense, it really adds to this sense of lack of worth, this sense that we
don't have the energy to be able to do what we want to do and it seems obvious and
the whole exhaustion problem that comes into the life of Projectors when they
overdo things. And again, the dilemma of not understanding that you're putting the
hole in somebody's back and if you don't understand that power you end up paying a
price for it; you really pay a price for it.
A Seven-Year Educational Program
So, where I want you to begin with your process of coming to grips with what you
are as a Projector is to see that you‘re entering into an education program and
you're entering into a seven-year education program, the same kind of program you
would enter into as a doctor, as somebody learning to play an instrument, whatever,
they're all seven-year cycles, these things. It‘s a seven-year education process and
at the end of that process it is actually going to dawn on you who you are, because
it's all indirect. This Projector will really understand the open mind when it sees the
open mind at work in the other, not through its own experience of open mind.
Because it doesn‘t really know what it is, it doesn‘t. It needs a reference point on
the outside because it isn't looking inside.
This is one of the things for the Projector is that ultimately it becomes a projection
when they get to see it and it comes back on them and they begin to see in
themselves and begins to dawn on them, because it‘s secondary, after all. Slowly
but surely this whole thing begins to change the whole mechanism of the way in
which the Projector operates in the world. You have to surrender to demanding
respect. That‘s quite a thing; literally demanding it.

Type: Projectors
This is an example of an Ego
Projector so you know they do
exist. Projectors can be
incredibly complex, they really
can, they can be incredibly
complex. I've seen eight
centers defined and you still
have a Projector. So, you can
see incredible combinations of
the Projector. It‘s very
misleading, as a matter of fact,
because the very, very simple
Projector like I began with is
often the idea that students first
have when they come in, and
it's not the way it is. They often
have trouble even seeing
sometimes in certain
configurations, actually seeing that somebody is in fact a Projector.
Emotional Projector
This brings in a whole different element for the Projector. Fifty percent of humanity
has emotional definition, and to be an emotional anything changes the way in which
you operate in the world
because it brings the essential
formula, that formula that
there is no truth in the now.
The moment that that is the
law, and that is the rule for
50% of humanity, it means
that the awareness process is
laid out in a time frame and
that everything is about
waiting in terms of waiting for
feelings to be able to be the
guide. Here is somebody that
obviously has emotional
authority. Emotional Projector,
like emotional anything, but
particularly emotional
Projectors and Generators, I
think it is one of the most
difficult things to add on the emotional element to what is basically a responsive way
of dealing with life, or reactive way I should say of dealing with life.

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
It is one thing for the Generator to wait to respond, it's another thing that when
something delicious comes their way that because they're emotional they cannot in
that moment, even though their response is positive, they cannot make the move
and that's frustrating, obviously. The same thing is true for the Projector, but it's an
even greater extreme, particularly when you're talking to somebody that doesn't
understand this knowledge and is just meeting it for the first time and they happen
to be a Projector, and even though there's a deep resonance because all Projectors
when they have their initial reading it is quite an eye-opener for them, at the same
time it‘s really quite something to come to grips with and to begin to deal with.
And particularly when the idea that you have to wait to be formally asked to begin
with, this is something that seems life-threatening in the way in which their not-self
has run their life based on them being a non-energy type, instead of them literally
harmonizing with the flow of the plane they're living on and understanding that those
things that are meant for them are going to be there. That‘s a very hard thing to
grasp for most people anyway.
And then you tack on the fact that they're emotional and you say to them, well yes,
but you cannot really be sure that that invitation is the right invitation, you're going
to have to ask them to wait a little bit longer, and you‘re going to have to ask them
to come back again. Most people don't have the inner courage to be able to do that,
quite frankly. That‘s why there aren‘t millions and millions and millions and millions
of people doing this right now. This is really heretical and for the psychology is
deeply threatening. It‘s why I have great empathy for the Projector and a common
recognition with them because I am non-Sacral.
The Signature: Success
At the same time, I see very clearly that because they are here to study that, in fact,
that the way they have to go through that process is ideal for them. The Projector is
here to guide. You can't guide if you don't know how the game works. And the
moment that you understand how the game works is the moment that you find your
power. All Projectors, the signature—and by the way, those of you who missed that
or don't know, if you are a Projector in the Jam Player in the free access area you
can listen to my lecture on the Projector signature. The Projector signature is about
success. This is something to understand about the Projector.
And by the way, it‘s not a selfish success; it really isn't. It is a success that only can
arise out of correct bonds. It is, in many ways, a deeply shared success because the
non-Sacral beings have to have their transpersonal connections. And the nature of
this success, this is when the Projector is empowered by their system knowledge.
You see it in the not-self world. But again, you see it on the mundane plane—
Projectors in positions of power because of their educational depth and their
familiarity with the material, whatever it happens to be, whatever the subject or
whatever it is. This is ideal for Projector.

Type: Projectors
One of the things you get to see in this era is you get to see the advent of more and
more Projector politicians that are leading countries. And they tend to be the kind of
politicians that can answer questions in the minutiae, because they tend to do their
homework, they tend to make sure that they understand what is going on. They
tend to be very good politicians, because they have a grasp of the other. They get
recognized and all of that kind of stuff.
What it is to be a Projector is that when you enter into your process instead of
having this goal of, I found it, which is very nice by the way, but nonetheless, save
it. Instead of that ―I found it, this is it and my life is going to change,‖ it‘s ―I found
something that I can really be interested in. I found something that I can really
study and go deep in, so I‘m going to go there and I‘m going to see where it takes
me,‖ because it's the only way that you can approach it as a Projector.
And the dedication has to be there to explore the knowledge because the deeper you
go into the knowledge as a Projector the healthier you become and more empowered
you become in terms of the way in which your ability ultimately can be recognized.
And that when you're beginning this process you have to see that you need to have
a real focus on each and every invitation that comes your way, regardless of what it
is. And regardless of whether you take it or not, because you don't have to accept
it. Just because it‘s an invitation that in of itself doesn‘t mean it's good for you, it
simply means that it's correctly delivered and you're being recognized and there's
nothing more deeply, deeply, deeply satisfying than being recognized as a Projector
and being recognized for who you are. Being recognized in the sense that the
potential of your role is something that is recognized by the other and it‘s what you
get the moment that you really are living out your potential. Nobody is going to
invite you blindly, they don't.
A Time Frame of Deconditioning
But again, the dilemma of what it is
to be emotional and it's always
something to grasp about the nature
of the emotional system what it
means to wait for truth. And it's
always a timing mechanism. For
example, this person‘s design, here
is somebody that has what is a fairly
common element, that is, the nodal
polarity and you‘ve got the 40/37
and it forms a definition. And it's all
unconscious, so this is not somebody
who is aware of their emotional Ego.
I mean, the way they think about
themselves, if you look at this
mental system of theirs, they‘ve got
a fully unconscious abstract channel

between the Head Center and the Ajna, and if you just look at the Ajna Center where
conceptualizing takes place they have one conscious gate. That is the 43rd gate.
And the 43rd gate, this is who they think of, it‘s these black things, and this is who
they think they are. They
don't think they're an
emotional tribal person.
Everybody else knows
that, because everybody
else feels that and feels
that in their aura
particularly in the way
their aura gets focused.
And only over time will
this person understand
that this is the way they're
perceived by others and
slowly try to come to grips
with it. So, when you're
talking to this emotional
Projector about their
emotions, it‘s not about
saying to them tune into
your wave. They have a hanging gate, the 55, but it's individual, it‘s usually planing.
They don‘t really have a sense of their emotional system. But time is a different
thing.
This is the whole beginning of the mechanism of what I'm getting to in terms of the
approach of a Projector into their seven-year program, is to see all this in a time
frame so that you take the pressure off yourself, that you release yourself from
comparing yourself to the way in which Generators react to the knowledge, the way
they are able to enter into, because they are an energy type their experimentation in
an earlier stage, but they have much more to do, they have to discover themselves.
Your discovery of yourself is secondary. It's always going to be secondary.
Sleep Alone and Lie Down Before Exhaustion
And it really is only something that's going to be truly clear to you when you enter
into your next cycle, that is, once you go through the seven-year process of
deconditioning so that you all are not simply operating correctly, but you‘ve finally
gotten to a place where you have the right people around you. This is the most
difficult thing for Projectors, because of course when they enter into Design like all
not-self Projectors they are caught up in entanglements, in the webs of relationships
that have been there, perhaps, for years, they may have children, all kinds of things
are possible.

Type: Projectors
And obviously for a Projector, my cannibalism black joke, and obviously for a
Projector you‘re living off the fuel of others, that energy is energy that you have to
use. It's not like you take it. Again, change your perspective. It‘s like jeez, I have
to use that energy, I have to use that low-grade fuel, I have to use that
contaminated fuel, whatever the case may be. And you have to begin to see that it
is this discernment process that is being able to, first of all, understand how you can
disengage yourself. If you are a Projector, and you've just entered into this process,
and you are still sleeping in the same bed as a partner, a lover, whatever, stop,
because otherwise there is no point. And I mean it; there is no point. All you're
going to end up with is a lot of intellectual masturbation and nothing else.
You have to begin to understand something as a Projector, is that you have to be
able to clean your aura somehow, you have to. The eight or nine hours a day that
you're able to go into a secure environment where your aura is protected is
something that is so important for you. Just the whole business of Projectors going
to sleep and it's something that I caution all non-Sacral beings about how important
it is not to exhaust yourself. It is very dangerous and it's very unhealthy.
How important it is for Projectors that they get into bed or they get horizontal before
they‘re exhausted. This is something that is very, very important for them, to lie in
bed and read or something or just relax before you go off to sleep. But to be able to
do that before the exhaustion sets in and it's particularly important for Projectors,
exhaustion is one of their biggest problems. And the exhaustion is not just physical,
it is psychic exhaustion, it is auric exhaustion, it‘s all kinds of things. It‘s your Sacral
Center crying out for some relief, because it's not designed to be running like that all
the time.
Best Intimate Relationship is with Another Projector
And you have to see that one of the great dangers for a Projector is their
relationship, their personal intimate relationship with Generators. When I say that
the Projector and Generators have an important relationship with each other, I don't
mean that from the intimate point of view, I really don't. In all partnership programs
I have done over the years I've always told people that if I told you the ideal you
wouldn‘t be interested in it because your genes would react. The ideal is that
Projectors really, really have a destiny with other Projectors at the intimate level,
and at worst with another non-energy type, but certainly not with an energy type.
It‘s like with Generators.
I'm a Manifestor with a Generator and the only thing that preserves that is the
energy aspect of that, but these are not ideals. The fact is that as a Projector in a
Generator‘s aura and you‘ve got a Generator partner and the Generator partner can't
really go to sleep until they‘re exhausted, and they drag you along with them and
because you inflate in the aura you become even more energized, and when they
finally drop off exhausted you‘re so tired that you can‘t go to sleep and you can end
up with all kinds of problems with that. It‘s just so unhealthy.

The primary heresy in Human Design, heresy number one or heresy 101, however
you want to name that, is that you sleep in your own bed. I mean, it is just
something to grasp. Human beings can be very immature when it comes to topics
like this, particularly men, because it's not about sex, it is not about love, it‘s not
about any of those things. The fact that you've got an unconscious piece of meat
beside you doesn't mean that that is somehow important for you while you're
unconscious yourself. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the integrity
of who you are as a being. If you're a Projector and you're sleeping with somebody
you never wake up as yourself, ever. And this is imprisonment to a conditioned life.
So this is one of the essentials.
It‘s all right if you get up in the morning and you go back into the world of your
environment, your home, or whatever it is, the people that are there, whatever.
That's another story; you know precisely what you are taking in when you do that.
This is a basic fundamental step that has to be taken by the Projector, it has to. You
don't do this, you really have no way out, because you have no way of really getting
around the conditioning in your life, no way of ultimately separating yourself from
that conditioning, and you end up being its prisoner and you end up with what
Projectors get in life, which is bitterness, deep bitterness.
The Design of John F. Kennedy
It‘s something else to understand that what it is to be a Projector even at its
simplest level, and this is a very interesting example because this is an example in
which you only have—we just saw that, where is it coming from now, it‘s from the
Sun/Earth –you have this
configuration of an
unconscious emotional system,
it‘s the only thing that's there.
And basically you would think
that this person is really not
there. What is the potential in
something like this? One can
never underestimate the gift of
a Projector to be able to grasp
a system and take advantage
of it. It‘s actually the design
of John F. Kennedy, the
American president that was
assassinated.
Again, my comment earlier
about Projector leaders and
their emergence of—Tony Blair
for example, until recently the Prime Minister of England, another example of a
Projector leader. There are a lot of them, by the way, on the planet right now,
because of this capacity, this capacity to recognize, this capacity to be able to focus

on the other. It‘s very cute in my family, my eldest son is an emotional Generator
and he has Projector addiction. He‘s had it ever since he first started making
friends. There are no Projectors in this family. He has an open Throat, and he is a
15/5 and a 59/6 and he likes attention and he likes to pull people into his aura and
pull people into his intimacy and into his flow. But the people that get there are the
ones that give him the attention that he needs. Well, guess who gives him the
attention he needs. And of course, he's not ignorant of Human Design, and he has
some four male friends who are his closest male friends in varying degrees at
different times, they‘re all Projectors. His girlfriends, most of them, are Projectors.
I was talking to him one day about that because we joke about it and I keep
reminding him that he is energizing all of that. He says, yeah, I know, I like it that
way. One of the great powers of the Projector is that when a Projector gives you
their attention there's nothing like it. And of course it can be very special or it can
be awful, because of course again we have not-self Projectors who are the vast
majority of Projectors who are digging into somebody's back when in fact that's not
what they really wanted to do, but nonetheless that‘s what happens and they get the
results that come with that.
This gift that‘s there in the Projector, this gift to recognize, this gift to be recognized,
this is something that you need to hold onto and understand that this is the
protective sheath that is there for what it is to be a Projector. And to study, learn as
much as you can. The deeper that you go and the more that you figure it out, the
easier it is for you not simply to be a master of your own future and to really finally
have as a Projector, the integrity of your own authority. But you can really be of
service. That is, you can really be of value.
One-On-One is Important
For you to understand that when you give somebody your attention, and remember
that the worst situation for a Projector is to be in a room with two other people.
Don't ever put yourself in that situation, if you can avoid it, about anything that‘s
serious or anything that needs to be discussed or worked out or whatever the case
may be. You‘re at a terrible disadvantage as a Projector in those situations. One-
on-one is what you‘re all about. And remember that you have great power in that
situation, and it demands that you're correct. And if you are correct in those
situations, the very power of that recognition is something that is recognized and the
beginnings of what can be with whomever, a fruitful relationship, because after all,
Projectors are here to thrive, to be a success and to bring success to their
relationships.
Okay, well I hope you enjoyed that. Next week we‘ll take a look at, in the first half,
Manifestors and in the second half we will look at Reflectors. All of you, thanks for
joining me for my morning coffee, I do appreciate you‘re here in the mornings. Do
take care; bye for now.

Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
Good morning to all of you. We continue on our journey in the Four Views looking at
Type. Today we‘re going to look at a combination; we‘re going to look at Manifestors
and Reflectors. This is my chart by the way, obviously I am a Manifestor.
Auras
To begin the Manifestor story is to begin the story as I'm trying to introduce it to you
in terms of getting a feel for Type rather than just seeing the mechanical Type there
in the BodyGraph, by being able to get a feel of what the various Types are in terms
of interacting with people. One of the things that you need in that kind of
experiment is that you need a
sensitivity to aura, because it is aura
that expresses Type. We have
already looked at the Generator aura
which is open and enveloping so it's
the kind of aura that surrounds you,
that takes you in. When you meet
somebody who has that kind of aura
you're very aware of the fact, if
you're sensitive to aura, you're very
aware of the fact that you‘re being
surrounded, you‘re being pulled in.
I think the most common recognized
aura impact is that of the Projector.
When we looked at the Projector we
saw that the Projector has a focused
aura and it is a focused aura that really burrows into the other person. This is
something that is highly noticeable. And remember, one of the most fascinating
things about Type is that it is expressed through the aura and those auric qualities
lead to a certain way in which the being lives out their life. These are controlling
factors. If you‘ve got an open and enveloping aura like a Generator, it means that
you're pulling conditioning into you all the time. You just are.
And it means that you're also pulling all kinds of forces towards you, which means
that you have to have the best equipment in order to make decisions in this life
because there are so many things that are coming at you that you're pulling in with

your aura. That‘s very different than a Projector. And understand that the Projector
tends to alienate people in certain situations because they do focus their energy on
one person at a time. And of course it means that the way they relate to other
people is very different; the way they're perceived by other people is different. All
this is in the aura.
The Manifestor
So when you come to Manifestor and you come to one of the smaller Type
groupings, after all, we‘ve looked at the two largest, the approximately 67% of
humanity that are Generators and the 22 or 23% of humanity that are Projectors, we
come to Manifestors that are just over 8% of the population. Now, again 8% sounds
like a minority, but in fact, when you're talking about seven billion people always
keep in mind that there are a lot of them around. There's a lot of everything around
in terms of numbers, but as a percentage it is a minority. And it is obviously
because you can see that right away, it is a non-Sacral Type. We have three non-
Sacral Types: Projector, Manifestor and Reflector. And in my particular case, you
can see that's quite prominent because in fact, I don't have any activations
whatsoever in the Sacral Center.
What is it to be a Manifestor? Mechanically what it is to be a Manifestor is that one
of the body‘s three motors, and there are actually four motors in the body but of
course, this is a non-Sacral being so we don't include the Sacral. One of these three
motors in one way or another being connected directly in this case from the Ego
directly to the Throat. So the moment that you have a direct connection, for
example, if I happen to have the 22nd gate I would be an emotional Ego Manifestor.
Fortunately I‘m not, but nonetheless that's the possibility; any direct connection.

LECTURE SIX
Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
Now, of course the Root Center can never connect directly. So for example if we had
a definition that went this way, that through the continuous definition upwards to the
Throat, the motor getting to the Throat you have a Manifestor. It is why people get
very confused about Manifesting Generators. They can never be a Manifestor. They
can never be compared to
Manifestor. They are in no way
similar to Manifestors despite the
illusion. Remember, that
Manifesting Generators are raised to
be Manifestors. Manifestors don‘t
have a Sacral. And the difference
between having one and not having
one is enormous; literally enormous.
A Generator is a Generator.
So we know what the Manifestor is,
that the Manifestor has the ability to
be able to move its energy into
action. In other words, this is an
energy type. Here is the motor
going to the Throat. And the illusion
that everybody has about the Manifestor is that they can do whatever the hell they
want. Well, they can't. It‘s just an illusion. That is, Manifestors tend to operate on
their own, and in operating on their own they tend to look like they're taking their
own action. In fact, they‘re like everybody else. That is, we are all reactive; we are
all reacting to the impulse. None of us are in control of the process. However, it
certainly looks like they're able to take the initiative.
The Manifestor Aura: Closed and Repelling
Now, the thing to understand about the
Manifestor that will give you a very clear
understanding of the Manifestor is that it
has an aura that is closed, and it is an aura
that is repelling. Think about that. A
closed aura, it‘s the exact opposite in that
sense of the Generator. The Generator has
an open aura; the Manifestor has a closed
aura. The Generator has an enveloping
aura, and the Manifestor has a repelling
aura. As a matter of fact, as you approach
a Manifestor the impact of their aura on
your aura is that your aura compresses. In
other words, auras have a prana, they‘re
not fixed. They expand and contract; the moment that you meet a Manifestor your
aura contracts.

89
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
And of course there is a psychological quality to that. The fact that you don't feel
like you want to get near somebody, because that's often how it's translated, can be
interpreted as many things, that you‘re suspicious of the aura, which is one of the
most common things. The Manifestors come into the world, they come out of the
womb and their mothers look at them and the mother wants to take this child, this
baby in her arms and here's this little Manifestor with this closed and repelling aura.
And of course, it doesn't mean that the mother is going to drop it on the ground; but
nonetheless, the fact of the matter is that no matter how close that mother wants to
be to that child, that child is always going to be resistant and the resistance is there
in the aura.
The Manifestor Theme: Anger
One of the dilemmas of the Manifestor aura is that it leads to suspicion. And one of
the things to recognize about Manifestor children, because it is where the
fundamental problem of the Manifestor in the world begins, which is quite literally
true for all, but it's particularly true in the sense that Manifestors are controlled from
the moment that they get into the world because there is a suspicion about them. It
leads to the fundamental theme of what it is to be a Manifestor, and the fundamental
theme of what it is to be a Manifestor, that is, not-self Manifestor is to be angry.
And these are angry beings. These are angry beings that are closed off to others
and push them away.
You can imagine that that is something that is not an easy thing for a child. It's not
an easy thing to grow up with. I understand. Obviously, as a Manifestor myself I
understand the dilemmas of the Manifestor childhood. And it's only now at this point
in my process, years ago when I first
began to grasp the knowledge, that I
really began to understand why I had the
kind of upbringing and why I had the kind
of relationships I had with my parents.
These were good people and very loving,
but there was an enormous distance, if I
can put it that way, between myself and
them from as early a time as I can
remember.
And of course it is what it is to be a
Manifestor. The other side of that is that
I was, without question, deeply
controlled. And I was to notice that
throughout my whole process growing up, going to school. If punishment was going
to be meted out, somebody was going to point their finger at me. I understand the
Manifestor dilemma. So, the dilemma for the Manifestor child is that they don't
understand why they don't have what are basically warm and deeply connected

Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
relationships in their childhood, because this is something that is difficult for them.
And obviously they do not have the psychology to grasp what is going on.
The Manifestor child that goes to school—because I have sons that are still in school
and I regularly go there and pick them up and I know many people because they are
the people of the island, people that I know. And I know a number of Manifestor
children that are in school, young kids. I could hear the stories from their mothers.
It‘s quite something, the Manifestor child, what they go through, particularly in the
developing social environment. It is a burden for them. Somebody like me, by the
way, it was okay. That is, the dysfunction at the social level that happens to a
Manifestor child, that is, I'm somebody that carries integration and all my definition
is individual, so I was already pretty freaky anyway and very different and very
much a loner because integration is very much an alone kind of thing.
But when you think about the Manifestor child with this repelling aura and let's say
that they happen to be tribal, emotional, and collective and all kinds of things, you
can imagine how difficult that is. They want to be able to integrate. They want to be
able to really be a part of the group and whatever and they don't get in. There's a
surface to it, a surface patina of those are my friends, but they're not really, and
they know it. The Manifestor child functions in really what is their own little enclosed
shell. It‘s why there is all this potential anger and tension that builds up in the life of
the Manifestor child until it ultimately explodes.
Manifestor Strategy: Ask Permission and Inform
And, of course, in all of the descriptions that I've given of introductions to Type over
the years it is something to understand about strategy. Strategy is an incredible
thing. It really is when one begins to grasp how complex life is. Just for anyone in
their lifetime to grasp the full potential
of this knowledge as it‘s already been
presented, it is so profound. There is
so much, and yet this is the thing that
is so special about it, is that illusion
operates on the surface. This is where
illusion is. And dealing with illusion is
something that one always deals with
on the surface. This is what makes
strategy so special. It allows us
through seeing the mechanics to be
able to have a technique of being able
to navigate correctly in the illusion.
That is what strategy is about. And
strategy, when it comes to a Generator
or to a Projector or to a Reflector, the
strategy is pure mechanics.

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
In other words, the strategy to respond is derived directly from the mechanics. But
this is not true for a Manifestor. It isn't. A Manifestor, in that sense, has no
mechanical strategy. It has a political strategy, survivor‘s strategy based on its
mechanics, but it is not strategy in the way that response for a Generator is their
true strategy. And when I say their true strategy it really is a part of them, it is a
part of their genetic makeup. It is the way they are designed to work.
But we have to teach Manifestors their strategy, because it isn't natural for them. It
isn't natural to respond, it isn‘t natural to be invited, it isn‘t natural to wait on the
Moon, it isn‘t natural like that at all. It is a way to protect Manifestors from
themselves and to protect everybody else from them. After all, the strategy of a
Manifestor child, a strategy that must be imposed by its parents, that strategy is that
they have to ask permission. If you are lucky as a Manifestor child, you come into
an environment that is fairly rigid and disciplined in the sense that it's orderly and
that the behavioral cultural conditioning is something that is there, because in fact
the Manifestor that is basically ignored by parents that can't handle it, this is the
Manifestor that is always going to be a problem to itself and to others, always,
always.
We know from the construct itself that the Manifestor is able to initiate action. And
of course, this is what leads the Manifestor child into trouble in the first place
because—and I have a wonderful, my favorite story of what it is to be a Manifestor
child. It was a lovely day, we had a very pretty home that was on the edge of a
forest and I opened up the back door and went outside, I think that I was four years
old, and I went exploring. At some point I was very tired and fell asleep under a
tree. Of course, my mother went into complete panic. The Police Department, the
Fire Department, at some point I think
there was about 60 or 70 adults that were
lumbering through the forest looking for
me. And oh boy, did I get into trouble
when they found me, other than the relief
of my mother who thought that I had
gone forever or something horrendous
had happened to me.
But after that boy was I ever controlled.
I was very fortunate. For me as a
Manifestor I literally had to ask
permission for everything. And being
unemotional and avoiding confrontation
and truth, I eventually figured out a way
around all that, Manifestors will, but nonetheless, I learned good lessons. That is, I
learned how to play the game. I learned that if I asked for something that was
reasonable chances were that it was going to be okay and I‘d get it anyway. And so
I began to see how I could avoid being punished for being me. And obviously, that‘s
a process that as a child you take in quite deeply, you begin to learn the mechanics
of how you get along in your environment.

LECTURE SIX
Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
So one of the things for the Manifestor child, for the parents of the Manifestor child is
this necessity to be able to train the Manifestor to ask permission, train the
Manifestor to learn how to play the game, because this is the only thing ultimately
that will allow the Manifestor to be able to integrate with others. Otherwise, there is
no way. This is the impact of the closed and repelling aura that creates suspicion.
Informing
The adult strategy for a Manifestor is to inform, which is a great freedom for the
Manifestor who leaves the parental household and no longer will ever want to ask
anyone or anything for permission. Yet at the same time, if they are going to be
able to integrate into society, if they're going to be able to have any kind of social
dynamic in their lives, they‘re going to have to learn how to inform; otherwise, it is
going to be very difficult.
Informing, as a strategy for a Manifestor, is simply a way of removing suspicion,
because this is what gets in the way of their social life, it is suspicion. When you
meet a Manifestor you really do not have any idea what they're going to do. You
may project on this or that, but the fact of the matter is that you really don't. And
you don't at the psychological level, but at the physical level. At the physical level
there's uncertainty about what you're dealing with. That means that if the
Manifestor doesn't find a way to communicate effectively, then they are going to
alienate others. It's simply the way it works.
The dilemma for most Manifestors is that they cannot see that informing is not the
same as asking permission, because it's not. My illustration of that is that I'm a
Manifestor that informs and basically what that means is that I'm driving a truck
down the road and there's an old lady crossing the street down the road in front of
me carrying her groceries and I honk the horn. That's what it is to be a Manifestor.
You don't take your foot off the gas, you honk the horn. As long as you honk the
horn you‘re doing your job. I told her to get out of the way. This is what it is to be
a Manifestor.
The Signature: Peace
And of course, with that comes the consequences of the way in which that is going to
be perceived by others, and all the things that go along with that. It‘s not an easy
piece of business in that sense, but then again, it's like anything else; every single
Type has its drama and has its story. The signature for the Manifestor is a signature
of peace. The Manifestor seeks to be freed of its anger. It can never be freed of its
anger until it begins to inform so that it can reduce the resistance that it has on the
social plane, because the Manifestor is on the outside.

The non-Sacral beings are really on the outside. And the only ones that really aren't
are the Projectors because the Projector has a role to play in the life of the
Generator. And the two of them literally represent the world. They represent 90%
of humanity, and that other 10%-
Manifestors and Reflectors—are really out
in the cold. We‘re on the outside of the
whole process.
And so it's never easy to get in, which of
course that is not something that you
can easily explain to a child. And of
course as I say not all Manifestors are
blessed with my kind of serendipity in
which I'm so individual and integration.
The Manifestors that are collective, the
Manifestors that are tribal, the
Manifestors that need to connect in their
lives, that dynamic, how important it is
for them, and then having this barrier that is there, because of the very nature of
their aura that others don't want to approach them, because they don't trust them.
So, this informing for the adult Manifestor is a strategy that has political and social
value, because this is what it's about. Manifestors by their design are not negative
forces. They can make a valuable contribution. The dilemma for most Manifestors is
their isolation, and of course that isolation and the anger that they carry within
them. Everything about healing Manifestors, unfortunately, is not about adults, and
it isn't. Unless you are somebody whose geometry in this life is to deeply, deeply,
deeply transform and that it is meant to happen in your process, later in your
process, for a Manifestor to really transform as an adult, this is something that is
very difficult. There is an enormous sea of anger that is within them. And it has
been repressed for a very, very long time. Not an easy thing.
The real healing of the Manifestor Type is the responsibility of parents of Manifestors,
because this is where the whole story can change. This is where the real beauty is,
because the moment that a parent understands this dimension in their child, that
they recognize how this child has to be dealt with, what this child needs to learn,
they're going to have a totally different relationship, and they're not going to have
the negative relationship that usually comes with parents of Manifestor children.
Parents with Manifestor children invariably, this is their problem and they don't like
it. They feel that they have been burdened with a difficult child and it‘s not the
child's fault. It's not their personality, it's not the way in which they are as a being
in terms of their design, it's just that aura, closed and repelling.
Manifestor Parents
I see that from the other end of the spectrum. I am a Manifestor father and I see
the challenges that are there and I try to imagine what it's like to be a Manifestor

LECTURE SIX
Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
parent that is ignorant of what they are and doesn't understand their impact on the
other and doesn't understand why their relationship with their children appears to
have a distance to it that psychologically they would want to have. Again, trapped
inside of a Manifestor aura and having all kinds of nurturing tribal whatever
activations, and not really being able to demonstrate them, because of the limitation
of the aura. If you're not aware of this it becomes a problem. And it becomes a
problem not only for the Manifestor, because they do not understand it, but because
it's a problem for them it becomes an accentuated problem relative to their children
and the way their relationship is perceived. It‘s not healthy. It's not.
I am clearly a Manifestor father, I have three Generator children. They all know that
they cannot enclose and envelop me. And they all had to learn that in their own
way, but they didn't have to learn that in ignorance and it didn't have to be
translated into meaning that I did not care for them or love them, all the things that
go along with what happens in the relationship between parent and child. Well, think
about the same thing about the Manifestor child and its parent, the repelling aura in
which the parent really isn't interested in pulling the child in and the child knows
that, feels that, interprets it in the way in which the child interprets it.
The Knowledge is for Children
So, the real healing in any healing that's going to take place in terms of the
Manifestor, this is something that begins with parents, and it is one of the mainstays
of my educating of people in Human Design is always reminding them that this is for
children and that the knowledge has to be passed onto those who are parents,
particularly young parents and parents of young children, this is something that is
essential, save the children. And a Manifestor that is properly nurtured in this life,
treated according to their nature, they become productive and well-balanced human
beings rather than being these angry forces that bounce from one failed relationship
to the next.
Ignorance is a very painful thing. It really is. It creates so much discomfort and
pain on this planet, and it's not just about being a Manifestor, it‘s the Generators
that are raised as Manifestors, it's Projectors that are tormented into being energy
types and exhausted before they even reach sexual maturity. And all of this is
taking place in the home, all of this is taking place supposedly in environments in
which there is supposed to be love and concern and all that stuff. And of course,
there is. It‘s just that it‘s ignorant and they don't know what to do with it, they don't
know how to see their children. If you want to save a Manifestor, save their parents;
if you can save their parents you can save yourself a Manifestor.
The Reflector
Okay, I go from my chart to Alex‘s chart, a long term Reflector student and teacher
of Human Design. You have to see a lot of Reflector charts to tell them apart, by the
way. I could throw up any Reflector chart and you look at all the open centers and

go ok, this is a Reflector, but obviously they are different. I know quite a few of
them, so you begin to notice certain accents in the way in which the whole
configuration is laid out.
Whenever I come to dealing with Reflectors, for those of you who really want an in-
depth understanding of the Reflector please, here in the Jam Player go to the free
access area and in the drop-down list
go to lectures, these are all free and in
that group is the Reflector signature
lecture. That was probably the
deepest and most revealing lecture on
the nature of the Reflector that I've
ever given. So, any of you that are
interested it‘s a couple of hours, but
as I said it's free and it's something
worth listening to.
And by the way, if you know any
Reflectors, and that's true of any of
the Types, by the way, that's why it's
there in the Jam Player. Signature is
the positive, in that sense, of all
Types. It is really what their goal in life is all about, what's there to be achieved.
So, it‘s a perspective that isn't just simply about the not-self torments of being a
Type, but about the possibilities and the potential that‘s there. So, if you‘re
interested in any of the Types, but particularly as I say Reflector because it is a very
profound subject and they are very different. So anyway, they are there in the free
access area.
The Reflector Aura: The Teflon Aura
My understanding of the Reflector is through their aura. I don't separate Type from
aura. I see them as one thing. That is, I see Type as a way of describing what the
aura is, in a sense. It‘s sort of chicken-and-egg, though, you can play the game.
The aura is a by-product of the frequency, and so forth and so on. But nonetheless,
it is clear to me that the secret to understanding Type is by understanding its aura, if
I could put it that way. And so when we're dealing with a Reflector aura, we‘re
dealing with something very, very interesting because this is the Teflon aura. It's
the Teflon aura; you get to slide off of it. You do not penetrate it; you get to slide
off it. But there is a level of friction.
In other words, the Reflector doesn't have the repelling quality, as an example, of a
Manifestor, even though, in fact, its aura is quite closed. But it has this Teflon
quality in which when it meets other auras it filters it through. But it filters it
through in a very limited way. Those of you who regularly use the Jam know that we
have Dharmen Swann-Herbert who does the daily neutrino forecast. I think it‘s
something for anybody entering into Design it's a great way to develop your

Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
knowledge. I did the neutrino forecasts for I think 13 years and it took me a long
time to find somebody that I could pass that torch along to.
Manifestors and Reflectors share something in common. We‘re much more
connected, that is, we are much more sensitive is a better word, we‘re much more
sensitive to the neutrino program than we are to the impact of auras of other people.
In other words, we have a specific sensitivity. We‘re less sensitive to the auras of
others; we‘re still obviously affected by them, but less sensitive to the auras of
others, more sensitive to the neutrino program. And the Reflector is many times
more sensitive to the program. In fact, that's what they're built for. You can see
that obviously. The very essence of life force in the Reflector is something that is
only provided by the consistency of the transit field.
Sampling Auras
So the fact is that the Reflector has a unique relationship to the program and has a
limited sampling, because that's what it does. That is, it's this Teflon aura that
samples. And the Reflector is always sampling the auras of others rather than
connecting to it. So unlike a Projector, when a Projector focuses on you, you notice
it right away. You can feel like it is burning a hole in you. Whereas, the Reflector
can just slide by and grab something, that piece of information that they grab,
because that‘s what we're doing with aura
contact, we‘re exchanging information.
The moment that you're in aura contact
with anybody they're affecting your design.
That is, they are acting as a conditioning
force.
So here you just get this sampling, just a
taste of what it's like. So it says a lot
already about the nature of the Reflector
as a being. First of all, they‘re outside of
the movie. And of course no other Type is
more outside of the movie than the
Reflector. They are about 1.3% of
humanity, which still means that there are a lot of them, I don‘t know what that is,
70 million of them or something. There are still a lot of them in the world. But still,
it is a true minority and obviously they are more than just a minority, they are really
different.
As a Manifestor with my open Sacral Center I have a certain affinity to them. We
both have a similar sort of relationship to the program. There are similarities, but
boy, are they alien. I know how different they are, because of course, they have no
definition. It seems like an obvious to say, but I think it‘s very important to grasp
what that means. They have no definition. Definition is what is consistent and
reliable. It is definition that forms the bedrock of what the potential of the true self
can be. It is definition that brings the consistent life force into the vehicle.

One of the reasons why the Reflector is the most deeply connected to the program is
that it is the program's relationship with the Reflector that creates this life force.
They are totally dependent on the program to—they certainly don't need people to
provide them with that life force. They‘re not like a Projector. People have these
things-they see a simple Projector that might have—here‘s John F. Kennedy, this
(Ego Center) would be colored in and this (Solar Plexus Center) would be colored in.
And people think that this Projector somehow is similar to this Reflector. They're not
at all. It becomes a totally different construct, because there is definition.
John F. Kennedy
The Cosmic Police Force
One of the things to recognize about the nature of the Reflector is that they have a
very, very profound role in this life, because they recognize how everyone fits in or
not to the program. They‘re the cosmic police force, sort of, cosmic Interpol. The
advantage that the Reflector has is that the Reflector is one with the program in the
way that no one else is, which means that they understand the prevailing life force.
And they can match it against whatever they see. And of course, what they see is
that the Reflector is in a world of the not-self in which the program that they can
grasp is what is dominating everyone else's life, which makes Reflectors very
interesting in the sense that they understand those people who are trying to break
out of it. They can recognize, they can sense those beings that are ready or trying
to break free. It‘s an interesting role.
They're very, very sensitive to community. They are an essential measuring force,
but not something that generally is taken advantage of. I think that Dharmen doing
the neutrino forecasts was the first example of Reflector wisdom being publicly
shared. That is, really letting people in on what goes on. This is the program and
this is what everybody is dealing with, pay attention. It is something that's very
significant because this is what they're about.
When I first began describing Reflectors, because I wasn't in a hurry to talk about
their spiral, I talked about the canary in the cage in the mines in Wales in the early
19th century, the canaries were more sensitive to gases that were toxic so if the

LECTURE SIX
Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
canary stopped singing and dropped dead the miners knew they had to get the hell
out of the mine. Well, the Reflectors are canaries. They can sense what's going on;
they can deeply connect to the community around them.
But of course, those opportunities for them to express that, as I was suggesting to
Dharmen, this doesn't really happen and it doesn't really happen because of the way
in which they‘re raised, that the discomfort that they have of being in the world of
dense, dense multiple conditioning, like the Manifestor having an aura that doesn't
necessarily make their relationships with others easy, particularly in their growing up
environment. And of course the great dilemma for Reflectors is that if they are not
fortunate they start their lives always in the wrong place. And of course, this is
something that is so distorting for them, because it is the foundation of them
beginning to be able to find some stability.
The Open G Center
Now, of course this is something that is a commonality of the open G Center.
Obviously, the open G Center is about if you're in the wrong place you‘re with the
wrong people. And so if you're an open G baby and you're in the wrong place you‘ve
got the wrong parents, and that means you‘re going to have the wrong upbringing
and it means you‘re going to meet the wrong friends and you‘re going to go to the
wrong schools, and it goes on and on and
on and on. And of course, without
awareness of this you not only affect the
child that has the open G, but you affect
the whole family.
I can remember our family‘s concern,
because my youngest son has an open G,
and we found a beautiful place that we
wanted to live in. But the agreement was
that it's only if he likes it. He's the only
one with the open G, if he doesn't like it
there's no point moving in, because
nothing is going to work. There was no
attempt to sort of—he had no idea that was our thinking, I think he was seven at the
time. We just took him with us the day we went to really look the whole place over.
We never said a word. We never asked him what he thought, just waited to hear
what he would say. And fortunately he loves it. But think about the poor Reflector
who isn‘t just simply connected to a family in a place, but needs to be connected to
the right community, how important that place is and they have no choice in that.
And they have no way of communicating that to their parents for years and years
and years, finally saying, I don't like it here and whatever.
This is something that is one of the deepest problems about the development of the
Reflector, and that is the environment. And one of the first things you can do in
helping a Reflector is begin the process of getting them to look at their environment
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

99
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
and look at their environment very, very carefully, and to go through what is their
strategy in order to be able to come to a very secure sense of the correctness of
where they are or not, because this is something that is the bedrock for them in
terms of their process.
The Strategy: The Lunar Cycle
After all, we are talking about the relationship of a strategy and its context to Type.
And obviously, the Reflector isn't just simply different because it has a totally unique
matrix or at least the way the matrix operates. But its strategy is also very, very
different. Its strategy is connected to an object. And again, I cannot stress enough
how deeply connected the Reflector is to the program. And in their strategy you can
see the real focus of that, the highlight of that, that this is not about responding and
this is not about informing and it's not about waiting for an invitation. It's connected
to the Moon and it's connected to the Moon‘s rapid cyclical orbit of the wheel; their
connection to the program and their connection to their specific and unique
mechanisms, that is, their Moon.
The lunar cycle is everything for Reflectors. It's everything. In order for a Reflector
to truly come to grips with their power, because they are powerful beings, again we
think of openness as a weakness because we, the other three Types, all have
definition as a counterpoint. And so we think openness is a weakness, because
that's how it plays out in our design. But openness is not a weakness for a Reflector.
It is not a counterpoint to definition. It is what they are. They all are this openness,
but they are this openness that is connected to a larger body. They‘re connected to
the solar system body. This is what they‘re connected to.
And it is the Moon that is the fastest expression of that; the Moon roaring around the
wheel faster than anything else. And obviously you can see that every step along
the way is going to bring some activation somewhere or another to that Reflector.
And of course, it‘s not just the Moon, but the Moon is the clock. There are all the
other planets and wherever they happen to be in the program and what happens
when they‘re at any of those places. In other words, to see how deeply connected
the Reflector is to the program. And the Moon is its mechanism in that complete
cycle of the Moon over that lunar month, the 28, 29 days of the lunar month, over
that time a Reflector processes awareness.
This is not a waiting cycle. It's an awareness cycle or intelligence cycle. It‘s like
with somebody who is emotional that goes through this clarity cycle. You have to go
through the wave to build the clarity, to see the various points. The awareness cycle
for a Reflector is day-by-day-by-day as the Moon moves through approximately 2 ½
gates a day which is approximately 15 lines a day. And this is this progression as it
goes around hitting all these points. It hits the 11 and there's an idea. As it moves
along, it hits the 48 and the talent comes out. Step-by-step-by-step as the Moon
goes around all of the various components get stimulated and at the end of a cycle
whatever is being processed can then be resolved.

Type: Manifestors and Reflectors
This is the way things work. When I asked Dharmen to do the forecast I gave him a
lunar cycle to respond obviously. This is what matters for Reflectors. This is the
point. This cycle for them gives them authority in their process. But again, you
have to see that the Reflector, because of their unusual nature and because of the
way in which they can meld in, that is, they are a Reflector, that if they are not
understood they suffer from the oppression of a world of energy types that dominate
the world, that expect everybody to be what they are. It is something that is
extremely difficult for them, extremely uncomfortable.
The Signature: Surprise
They are most connected to the homogenized field, which means that they are the
ones that can recognize the difference in there. The signature for the Reflector is
surprise. The surprise that something isn't locked in, the surprise that something
can break out. This is what they're here to measure. But in their own life, they have
to see that unless they have beings in their life that respect their frequency, because
they are lunar, it is a frequency, and it needs to be respected in the same way that
any Type according to its nature needs to be respected. It needs to be given time,
always.
The most uncomfortable thing for a Reflector is the pressure, the pressure to make a
decision. This is the most unnatural thing, because in fact Reflectors don't make
decisions. They grind out over a cycle of the Moon solutions. It‘s not the same as
making a decision. They grind out their solution, whatever that solution happens to
be. It may lead to a decision or not. But what they‘re working on is problem
solving, in a sense. And going through that whole cycle gives them that power to be
able to realize the solution.
Now, you look at the world that we live in, and you look at a world that is dominated
by Sacral beings, and you look at a world that is dominated by definition, and you
look at a world in which nobody wants to wait. All the Generators want things to
happen now, nobody wants to wait. And here is the Reflector, the Reflector needs to
set a waiting standard—I love you dear and I want you to be with me forever—well,
give me a cycle of the Moon, will you. Pity the poor Reflector.
The not-self never gets a chance for anything like that. This is a world of pressure,
this is a world of go, go, go, go. So, this is one of the things to understand about
the Reflector‘s being. If you're going to embrace a Reflector in your life and you‘re
going to embrace them as friend or as a lover or as a colleague, you have to
understand their gift and you also have to understand that anything that is truly
important that you need from them that you have to understand that you can never
put pressure on that—I need it now, I need it tomorrow—because it is just not the
point for them. It is not going to work for them and they're never going to be able
to have the authority they need, the authority that arises out of the natural
emergence of the solution. This is them, but they have to have the time, which
means they have to be respected, which means they have to be recognized, which is
not something that is common.

The Need to Demand Respect
Reflectors are one of the few Types that really have to go out of their way to say to
somebody, look I don‘t operate the way you do. I need a lot of time to process
things. And if you can't give me a lot of time, then there's no point in us dealing
with each other. And again, the truth it is a very, very powerful thing. Reflectors
need to set the standard of the kind of respect that they expect from others, whether
it is somebody who wants to hire you for a job and you want the job, you can be
under enormous pressure. The fact is, as a Reflector, if you jump on that—well, if
you don't take it today someone else, well, okay, if you don't think that I'm worthy
of waiting for it, well, all right. That‘s a real challenge.
One of the things that is part of discovering your own authority is beginning to trust,
beginning to trust in who you are, beginning to trust in the integrity of what it is to
be you, begin to trust that when you are correct you are not going to be punished for
it, you have to trust that. The Reflector has to trust that their certainty, their truth,
their solution is more important than anything else. And if they're not allowed to get
to that point, because of course what will happen is that the Reflector takes the job
because they don't want to lose it because they think they will, and by the time that
the Moon finally does complete the cycle they quit, because a solution shows itself
and they realize it was all wrong and they never had a chance to get there
beforehand and avoid all that.
A Reflector has to have the courage to demand that their cycle of awareness is
respected, and not be afraid that nobody is going to play that game. Some won‘t,
but those weren't the ones that you were going to be able to work successfully with,
or be successful with anyway. But the ones who allow that, the ones who accept,
they may not like it, but it‘s your terms, that when you do get to the solution if they
are part of the solution you're going to have a very successful connection in
whatever it is. To be a Reflector is not simply to be different, but to express that
difference in the way in which you expect to be treated.
Strategy is the Basic Key
Well, we have taken our little journey through the various Types now. There is just
one thing I want you to keep in mind from all that. The strategy that arises out of
Type, this is a key. It is the basic key. It is a generic, though. There are so many
variations and nuances in all of these Types. We are all unique, in that sense. But
when we're looking at Type we‘re looking at the specific vehicular models that we
have, and the way in which these models express their energy, the auras that go
with them. And in understanding how it works, following the strategy, allows you for
the first time to make decisions according to what is in fact your true potential. The
potential of what it is to be a nine-centered being, the potential that lies in the
consciousness of your design.

Authority: Dominant Authorities
Let's begin our discussion today because our discussion today is one of those that is
really basic to the knowledge, and it is fundamentally the key of what Human Design
is all about. That is, being able to recognize where and what is your true inner
authority. Authority is something that is complex not in terms of inner authority, but
in terms of outer authority. That is, what happens to us when our minds take over
both our inner and outer authority in this life and our life literally becomes lost. And
everything about the nature of authority is that authority has always been one thing.
That is, for millennia this is the way in which the mind has operated. It has operated
both as inner authority, that is, the decision making authority and outer authority,
which is the communicating authority.
I guess one of the most profound things about Human Design is that as a dualistic
system, as a binary, it divides these two functions and in so dividing them one is
able to begin to gain access to what has been hidden for so long. We are a binary
consciousness, and everything about the key in this knowledge, that is, to ultimately
be able to operate correctly and therefore begin to move towards the fulfillment of
whatever one's potential is, that that is rooted in decisions. And it is rooted in
decisions that have to be made by an inner authority. Not the outer authority, which
is the natural domain of mind. This is our communicative authority; you‘re

experiencing my outer authority. That is, the expression of my cognition outwards
towards you for whatever it's worth, this, that, or the other. This is outer authority.
Inner authority is what makes those decisions in your life that is in the sum total of
the navigation of your process through this plane of the maia. Every decision that
you make is an adjustment in the steering as you move along in this way. And this
is what authority is all about. If you ask people who are involved in Human Design
about inner authorities, they often give you the impression that it is much more
complex than in fact it actually is. And that impression arises out of the fact that
there are minor variations of inner authority that can be confusing.
But the reality is and this is what we're going to look at today is that we‘re going to
look at the dominant authorities. Now the dominant authorities are somewhere
around 81% of the human population. In other words, the vast majority of human
beings operate out of these dominant inner authorities, that is, should operate out of
these dominant inner authorities and there are only two of them. It is a basic
binary, and it is a basic binary that is and begins with the Solar Plexus system.
The Solar Plexus System
You can see in this bar chart,
and by the way, this is from the
Human Design global survey,
which is in the free access area
of the Jam. Basically what this
gives you is just a bar graph of
inner authorities and the
percentages of inner authorities
in humanity as a whole. And
you can see by far the largest
grouping is that of the Solar
Plexus system. That is, 51% of
humanity, 51 out of every 100 people, 3½ billion people approximately on the
planet, have emotional inner authority. So they are by far the largest group. And it
means that one out of every two people, literally, one out of every two people has
Solar Plexus authority. So, in that sense this is a vast chunk of humanity that
operates under the same authority, there is little confusion in that.
The Sacral System
The next in line is the Sacral system. Now of course, the Sacral Center represents
nearly 70% of humanity. That is, Generators are nearly 70% of humanity. But of
course, half of those Generators are going to be emotional. So these (blue column)
are pure Generators who are not emotional. And they can be, by the way,
Manifesting Generators who are not emotional. So here and only here is the Sacral,

Authority: Dominant Authorities
the pure authority and you can see that's 32%, at this point. This was done on
about a quarter of a million samples, which is pretty solid as a statistic.
The Sacral is 32.89% of the population. Approximately a third of humanity has
Sacral authority. You have half of humanity that has emotional authority, a third of
humanity that has Sacral authority, and if you put those two together what you get
is nearly 84% of humankind.
These are its two main
authorities. Now, we‘ll look at the
others next week. What we're
going to look at today, because
the others are nuances, and some
of these nuances confuse people,
the difference between what is
Self-projected or Ego projected if
the G is connected to the Ego,
and there's all these kinds of
mechanical nuances that are
there.
But the reality is if you take in
splenic authority on top of it,
which is nearly 10% of the
population, 94 or 95% of
humanity basically has very simple authority to understand. So, don't allow that to
become an area of confusion. And as you'll see, even when we look at these
minority authorities, we‘ll see that there is a very straightforward logical basis for
them. And it's just a matter of familiarizing yourself with how you recognize them.
Okay, so what we're going to do is take a look at the dominance because obviously
this is what rules the planet. And in many ways what you're really looking at is
you're looking at a profile of the planet. And you're looking at the profile of a planet
that is emotional/Sacral. This is our planet. It‘s probably the best way to
understand the—if you can grab all the human beings on the planet and put them
together in one huge pile and you wanted to check out what that aura would feel
like, the general theme of that aura would be Solar Plexus/Sacral. This is the buzz of
the planet. It's also the authorities.
Inner Authority
What is inner authority? This is something else, something that needs really to be
grasped. And a very simple thing to understand about the construct in Human
Design is that it is all about a binary interactive system. That is, we have something
we call a neutrino, and a neutrino is a subatomic particle, it has mass. It travels
near the speed of light. And what it ends up traveling through is what we call
crystals of consciousness.

The moment that a neutrino in zipping along hits that crystal of consciousness, the
moment it hits that crystal it gives off a frequency. This is called the entry frequency
and this is what we call a base. And as the neutrino moves across the inside of the
crystal, this is a frequency zone that we called tone. And when the neutrino leaves
there is an exit frequency, this exit frequency is called color. So, here is the
programming. The neutrino going
through and where we get our
breakdown of the way in which the
substructure of line operates so that
we've got this base-tone-color
frequency. And then what we have is
that we‘ve got a G Center, and in the G
Center we have a magnetic monopole
and the magnetic monopole has an
attraction frequency.
Now this is where the dilemma is,
between the exit frequency—color—and
the attraction frequency from the
monopole, because the monopole's
frequency is dependent on the overall frequency of the design. And that overall
frequency of the design if it is not correct, in other words, if it is not-self, then what
happens in this zone here is that we get what's called transference. And what
transference does is that it cuts us off from the information underneath. And the
most important information is here, it is tonal, and tone is about cognition.
In other words, it is the underlying intelligence that is there within us. The moment
that you're operating according to your inner authority is the moment that the
illusion, what we call our lives, that this frequency becomes correct. And when this
frequency becomes correct the attraction frequency is correct, and there's no
transference. And that means that the cognition, the intelligence, is able to come
through and guide the being, guide the vehicle.
This is what real inner authority releases. It releases the intelligence to properly
guide the vehicle. It's what's lying underneath. And you don't get to this tonal
information, the cognitive information; you don't get to that cognitive information
until your vehicle is operating according to its inner authority. And of course, in
order for the inner authority to be effective on the physical plane, this is obviously
the inner authority that has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with mind.
Nothing; it's about the body.
Human Design is all about the form principle. It is about the mechanics of the form
principle in the maia in the way these things work. So, what we're looking at here is
that for a huge, huge chunk of humanity that the key to being able to operate
correctly, the key to being able to transform their life, the key to all of those things
lies in only two very straightforward inner authorities—the Solar Plexus and the
Sacral. It‘s not like humanity has to search far and wide to know how to operate
correctly, that there is some incredible array of nuances. There isn't. It's very
generalized. It‘s how the not-self thrives on it.

The Emotional Being
What does it mean to be an emotional being? I speak personally from the other side
of the fence. That is, I‘m the 49% that doesn't have a defined Solar Plexus system.
So, though I am wise in the nature of the emotional system, and certainly
intellectually I understand it rather well, I'm still not an emotional being. And as
such, I can never fully describe what in fact it is to live it, rather than to experience
it or to understand it. So, I'm limited in my perspective.
When you‘re dealing with the emotional system, foremost is the understanding that
what you're dealing with is a very powerful unique kind of motor. The BodyGraph is
a motor system. In this particular design, this very, very powerful energy Projector,
you have a real powerful three motor energy Projector, an atomic bomb looking for a
place to explode anywhere, please and the choices are going to be the 12 and the 6,
these are going to be the big choices, this
is going to be the big attraction. Let me
get to that 12, let me get to that 6, let me
manifest it, let me generate it, whatever
the case may be. And you can see that
those are going to be very, very deep
influences in this particular life.
But what is it to be emotional? These
motors, including the Sacral, you're
dealing with very different kinds of motor
functions, and they‘re very different in the
way in which they work. When you're
dealing with the emotional system you‘re
dealing with the Solar Plexus Center, we
know what we're dealing with, we‘re dealing with something that we call or refer to
is a wave. And it‘s something to recognize about the nature of the Solar Plexus
system, is that the Solar Plexus system has no real solid face ever. There is always
this fluidity to it; there is always this movement to it. And in fact, though it's
described as one wave, there can be many, many, many, many layers of waves that
are all intertwined in all of that. And it's not intelligent.
This is the dilemma of the motor. It is a motor that drives perception. It doesn't
mean it's intelligent. You're at a point, and that point allows you a certain
perspective. The point changes, it gives you another perspective, the point changes,
it gives you another perspective. It‘s one of the things to recognize about what the
motor does. The theme of clarity is that the motor is constantly pointing you
towards a different way of taking in experience, a different filter on taking in
experience that is moving.

No Truth in the Now
What is the thing that we say to anybody when they come to a reading and they‘re
emotional? The first thing to come to grips with is that there is no truth in the now.
This is the most important small thought, because it's a little thing, but it is the
essence of what it is to be emotional. No truth in the now doesn't mean the truth
cannot be present in a moment, it means that in the moment of dealing with
anything there is no truth in the now. It is something to grasp. In other words, it is
the antithesis of spontaneity. And of course, it's a very powerful motor.
Think about this being, think about this being as not-self—the bitterness all this
power in there and the restraint that is on them in this life to get that power out, and
the kind of bargains that they make in order to be able to get that power of theirs
out. And of course, the emotional system in somebody who is moody, it's a 39/55,
with a ratcheting temper in the 40/37, all
this stuff hanging around, and the 49s.
This is not a being that will wait. This is
not somebody that will naturally wait for
anything. It feels incredibly handicapped
in waiting. It can be deeply, deeply
exhausted with just the idea of having to
wait.
That open splenic system says jump, take
the risk. If you don't take the risk we‘re
going to fail—the 28th gate, the risk gate;
the 38th gate, the failure gate; take the
risk. 51% of humanity, it‘s a lot of
people, have a defined emotional system.
How many of them do you think are waiting? This is a world in which rage rules.
You look at the world, you look how easily emotionalized it is. Think about the 49%
like me who are open who have to amplify the 51% that are emotional. Think about
this planet we live on.
Always in a Hurry
The first thing that an emotional being has to come to grips with is the truth that
they‘ve always been in a hurry. And they‘ve been in a hurry because that's what
they were taught to do. I think one of the things that is least understood is how we
all have, relatively speaking, different frequencies. I‘m a splenic Manifestor,
unemotional. I‘m an existential being. Not by choice, not intellectually, not
philosophically, but that is literally my design. It‘s the only place that works. I'm
not somebody that‘s here to wait, after all. It's different. It's a different frequency.
If you're an emotional Manifestor and you‘re walking down the street with me the
thing to recognize is that what I can react to in the moment you can‘t touch with a
flagpole, because we don't take information in the same way. So we cannot operate
at the same speed and there is no comparison.

And this is the dilemma of the emotional being. The emotional being that wants to
be able to be fully spontaneous in the assumption that that's what they're supposed
to be. You know, the curse of Baba Ram Dass: be here now. Well, not for 51% of
humanity, thank you very much. It‘s not their trip. It is not what it is to be an
emotional being. There is no such thing as a fixed point. There isn't. The splenic
system is nothing but a punctuation; over. But the emotional system is a flow. Any
perspective at any time is just the slicing up of the arc. It is a flow, it is never
standing still. And not only is it not standing still, but it's taking the whole inner
consciousness with it as it moves in its wave.
I've had situations where I've had an emotional person with me and I've gone
through a process with them of explaining something to them and a day later they
don't know what that was all about, and they did then, and they will perhaps a week
later, when they're somewhere in that wave where it resonates back to them and
they get it. It‘s a wave; it‘s always moving. There is no punctuation point. If the
emotional being can be transformed, the planet can be transformed. They‘re the
majority. This is the authority.
The Only Reward for Patience is Patience
I used to quote, not that I‘m a particular fan of his, but I used to quote St.
Augustine, because he had this great line that said the only reward for patience is
patience. In essence, this is the emotional life. And of course because it's the
emotional system and because there is such intensity to that emotional system, it‘s
vibrant, it is sexual, it is deeply connected to the pleasure principle, it is the human
experiential way, it is the heart and core of the ultimate mutation that is taking
place. It's quite a thing, this emotional system. But we‘re still dealing with the
dilemma of the motor function.
Time Clarity
So, a being that is emotional, their inner authority, what really is it? You hear
phrases like wait for the wave, which sounds almost mystical or maybe you‘re a
surfer, I don‘t know. It is time, it‘s a big secret, time; it‘s only about time. It really
isn't about anything else. You have emotional people that are consciously connected
to their emotional system; you have emotional people who are poorly connected to
their emotional system or weak emotional systems that are mostly unconscious. You
have all kinds of variations.
Not everybody is attuned to their emotional system. People that have heavy mental
activation, people who were sidelined by other things, other aspects of their design,
the splits, or whatever, it‘s time. It's not about whether you can feel the wave, get
to that place. It's just time, and it's learning how to judge your wave in a relativistic
way, like we use time space, because this is time clarity, and time clarity has
different formulas for different things. Time clarity can be long when it comes to

love, and other ―serious matters." Time clarity can be short. It can be sleeping on
things in order to have that altered view that you need in order to get some kind of
parallax view, some kind of way of looking at where the curve is going. It's time.
This is the only way it‘s ever going to work. It‘s going to be very difficult for
emotional beings just simply trying to contact their wave, it's not about that. It
begins with the institution of patience and beginning to appreciate that the time is
their depth. I think it is the one thing that emotional beings do not grasp about
themselves. The Solar Plexus isn't intelligent, but it can be very deep. That
collection of perspectives ultimately can become the substance of conceptualization,
outer authority, a wisdom that can come out of that.
But until the emotional being surrenders to a different frequency, you know that
expression about marching to your own drummer, this is something that every
emotional being has to understand. It is about their very dignity, because they are
always rushing themselves or being rushed by others and it is for their very dignity
that they say ―stop, stop rushing me, there‘s no hurry. I'm not in a hurry.‖ You
can‘t afford to be in a hurry. You‘re going to miss what's there for you to take in. As
an emotional being you‘re here to be deep. That's the whole process, not the
surface. This is not the Spleen. This is deep, layer upon layer upon layer upon layer
of experience, layer upon layer of feeling sensation. The whole thing about being an
emotional being is that you need to live in your own frequency and not in the
frequency that is established by those that are so different from you. Not this quick
―now.‖
Savoring Life
To be an emotional Projector is a great challenge. It is a great challenge, because it
is not simply a matter that the invitation is necessary, but no invitation is worthy in
the moment. No invitation is worthy in
the moment. The emotional being,
because they are so deeply connected to
the experiential way has to savor life.
That‘s why they were endowed with the
pleasure principle. And if they don't savor
life they end up with a great deal of pain.
And this savoring is not the rushing from
this to that for the emotional gratification
that is never fulfilling. But it's the pacing
of oneself. It's the savoring of the
movement in the wave. It's beginning to
sit back in the passenger's chair, watching
the chemistry work, because it's just
chemistry, watching it. And of course, in all of that, in living out the correctness, in
being able to make decisions according to that patience, you've got a human being
who has a new life; inner authority, 51% of humanity, emotional inner authority.

Authority: Dominant Authorities
Usually the Sacral stands at the top of the heap, but even the emotional system can
trump the Sacral. And it's something always to think about, particularly in the
context of how many emotional Generators there are and to understand how
uncomfortable the Generator is not being its own power. That is, being
overwhelmed by the emotional system that its moment-by-moment responses are
not enough to actually move the vehicle. This is a great challenge.
Again it goes back to understanding what it is in the context of the emotional. The
recognition that you have a different frequency and that frequency is not rooted in
the now at all, and can't be. And of course, the moment that you live in that
changed frequency that's the moment that everything changes for you. That‘s the
moment that you begin to take in the essential ingredients of information that are
necessary for you to get to that point of feeling in which you can be correct in the
actions that you take as an emotional being. It is a huge challenge.
The Sacral Authority
When we‘re dealing with a pure Generator, and here obviously a pure Generator, not
a Manifesting Generator, undefined emotionally, so we have this approximately 30%
of humanity or so whose only authority, their pure authority is their Sacral authority.
I have talked myself blue in the face for 20 years trying to get Generators to wake
up, because when you look at the Generator design as a mechanic, just as a
mechanic, not anything else, just as a mechanic, if you look at a Generator‘s design,
non-emotional, and you think wow, perfect engineering. It‘s perfect engineering.
Here you have the perfect system. It is a moment-by-moment-by-moment-by-
moment response system. It's perfect;
it literally can handle anything, anything,
anything, I can‘t say that enough,
anything; any situation, any challenge,
anything in response. It‘s incredible
engineering.
Not only is it perfect in its response, but
the very fact that it represents as
Generators 67 or 68% of humanity
indicates something rather interesting,
that everything is provided. If you go
back to those old biblical descriptions
about how God's glory is distributed on
Earth and all you've got to do is embrace
the truth and you shall receive. What did Jesus say—witness the lilies of the field,
they do not toil. They don't do any work, they just sit there and they just wait and
the sun comes and makes them feel good, and so forth and so on.
It‘s something to understand about Generators, Generators are the lilies of the field.
This is what they're intended to be. They‘re flowering in a world in which all they
need to do is receive. This is an incredible thing to imagine, it‘s fairytale stuff, it‘s

spiritual stuff, it‘s all that, all wrapped up into one, plus some science fiction, throw it
all in. But the fact of the matter is that is exactly what they are.
It took me a very, very long time to understand the density of the not-self because
my assumption was that it would be so easy, so easy for Generators to just
generate. It would be so easy for them just to respond. And I see clearly that yes,
there are tens of thousands today where there were none 20 years ago, so they are
out there and they can learn and they can transform. But, it is astonishing that
there aren‘t zillions of them because it's so simple. And what a difference it would
make in their lives.
And we know that the Sacral Center is many things. It is a very powerful motor. It
is the reproductive creative center of the being. It is a generative force. It creates
this enormous enveloping aura that pulls
and drags everything into it. It gives life
to the planet. But nobody as a Type has
a greater ordeal in this life than
Generators. They are the basis upon
which life is built on the planet and they
don't function properly, so they‘re
carrying an enormous burden. It is a
huge burden. We know that because
this planet is nothing but frustration, the
1½ billion people who are frustrated
because they have no access to fresh
drinking water, 3 billion people that are
frustrated because they don‘t earn more
than two euros a day. The level of
frustration on the planet is absolutely
incredible, and this is a world of Generators trying to be Manifestors, and being
smashed for that, being smashed for the stupidity of it more than anything else.
When the gods give you such perfect engineering and you turn around and you say,
no, I'd rather have something that has more quirks to it, it‘s the moment that you
really have a problem, and it's there. I have personally done readings for thousands
of Generators, thousands of them. It is astonishing the depth of lost-ness.
Generators are here to know themselves; nobody else is. Generators are really here
to know themselves. They‘re here to see the truth; they‘re here to penetrate the
truth of what it is to be them, to live it out. This is what they're here for. But they
cannot get there if they chase things, they cannot get there if they‘re going after
things. It doesn't work that way. It is not an easy thing to do.
There is this mantra that runs in the consciousness of Generators that says if I don't
do it somebody else will. If I don't do it, it won‘t get done. If I don't chase that, I'll
never have it. This Generator consciousness—if I don't, if I don't, if I don't, if I
don't, if I don't—because that‘s the way they were raised. It's the way they‘ve been
conditioned. They‘ve been conditioned to be Manifestors so that they'll spend their
entire life as not-self deeply homogenized and frustrated and keep the planet exactly
where it is. Because that's basically what their contribution is to planet.

Authority: Dominant Authorities
Generators Need To Wait for the Inspiration to Respond To
What I do understand about the simplicity of the inner authority of the Generator is
that though it is literally such a simple thing, it takes an enormous leap of faith to go
there—faith, trust, and hope. There has to be a very deep driving force because it
means that you have to give up. You have to. If you don't give up you will never
receive. This is something that is as ancient a concept as one can be. But this is the
Generator. If you don't give up the illusion that you are in charge, then your life is
lost. You are a force that is always waiting for guidance. That‘s what response is.
It‘s not waiting for control, it‘s not waiting to be led, it‘s not waiting to follow, its
mechanism is response. It waits for inspiration. It‘s really what it is, waiting for
inspiration, waiting for the inspiration to respond to. It‘s about decision making.
I think this is the most confusing thing for people. They say, I‘m a Generator, okay,
I‘m going to stop doing everything. It‘s about decision making, only about decision
making. You say to a friend of yours—you‘re a Generator—I'm thinking maybe that
I‘m going to go to wherever this winter for vacation. Now, that‘s not a decision,
that‘s just a thought. Even expressed out loud, I'm thinking that I might do this; I
might do that, that's not a decision. If the person you're talking to says to you,
―You‘re really going to do that?‖ and you go ―ahuh,‖ well, yeah, then you're really
going to do that because the decision has been made in response. And it gets very
confusing for people because they don‘t understand what it means. You mean I
have to shut off my mind, my mind is always thinking about this thing and that thing
and the other thing. And is it okay if I start a conversation, and all of these
questions. Of course, it is.
But when it comes to making a decision it has to be in response. It doesn't matter
what you say, it doesn't matter what you talk about. But when you make a decision
it has to be in response, otherwise it's not real. That stuff you talk about doesn't
mean that that‘s something for you to do, it‘s stuff for you to talk about, obviously.
But what it is to be a Generator and have to deal with the way everybody else
expects you to be, and this is not about whether you make funny sounds or not, or
all this stuff. It isn't. It‘s because you're here to make decisions in response you
stop initiating them. And this disturbs others, and they don't understand what you
are waiting for. There is all this pressure that comes for anyone.
But as a Generator if you don't start making decisions in response all is lost. It just
is. This is the humanity that we have. We've got this huge slice here, this emotional
slice that needs to slow down the world, literally. They're the ones that can slow it
all down. They can slow everything down, and slow it down to their pace. And if
they don't do that—the best sign that you can see that the Solar Plexus system is
exploding, because of course there is this huge mutation taking place underneath, is
how fast the pace of life is, because a pace of life is based on the pace of decision
making. And you can see that 51% of decision making is supposed to be on the slow
track, not the fast track. But we know the way Solar Plexus beings operate in the
not-self, all fast-track, exploding, releasing the energy.

We have all these Sacral people who are waiting to respond, this is most of
humanity. And you look on the flip side of that, and what you look out on the flip
side of that is you look out at a not-self, false emotional manifesting force. It‘s what
you get. You get a world that is driven by manifesting demands to make things
happen, to go where no one's ever gone
before, to lead onward, to fight the good
fight and all that stuff, and emotional—the
emotional mobs, the emotional armies, the
emotional forces, the negativity on the
planet. One of the things that you get to see
when you begin to examine the nature of the
program is that you get to see that there is
no way of turning the tables on the program.
This is not about a struggle between good
and evil with the program being evil, it is
not. It is the evolutionary program, period.
The fact that the evolutionary program,
which is designed for a homogenized process, can be offensive to oddities within it,
that's another thing entirely. But it's not like we‘re about to change this. It‘s not
like the 3½ billion people on the planet who are emotional are suddenly going to
accept that there is no truth in the now and begin to operate according to their inner
authority. It is not going to happen. We are not slowing down. We are, in fact,
speeding up, faster and faster.
2027 and the Solar Plexus System
We're moving towards a dynamic point of transformation in terms of the function of
this motor. By 2027 the motor function of the Solar Plexus system is going to be
disturbed. There are already things going on that are impacting it in terms of the
influence of its wave system and many other things. It is under a huge mutative
pressure. What we need to concern ourselves with is the dilemma in those who, by
their very fractal, are emotional beings or Sacral beings who have come into contact
with Human Design. And of course here is the opportunity for them as variations on
whatever their design is, whatever their Type and configuration happens to be,
therein lies their possibility of being able to free themselves from the control
mechanisms of the program and begin a process of living out their own authority.
We Learn As Children to Give Up Our Authority
You have to understand something about the nature of authority. It‘s the way you
were born. Everybody had authority over you from the moment you came into the
world. These giant people that were standing around you, these parents, huge
authority figures, the schoolteachers and the rules and regulations in society and all
the forces that are there, that what we learned most as children is that we learn to

give up our authority to others, and to do so without argument and to do so without
challenge. What we expect when a child becomes a teenager is that they'll begin to
establish their own authority, but of course, this is not their own authority. This is
just simply the attempt to separate from their parental authority.
It‘s all locked in against us. To be your own authority is something that is really
extraordinary. It has never been something that has existed on this plane, never.
No single human being has ever been allowed their own authority. We didn‘t know
how, weren't smart enough, lucky enough. It is a magical thing. It really allows you
the possibility of being able to fulfill what is a potential that‘s far beyond something
that you can grasp, that being that is you. But that being that is you that in
operating correctly and going through a long process along the line, that what
emerges is something that emerges only out of that authority, only out of that inner
guidance.
And remember what that inner guidance is. We‘re moving in space. It‘s all about
movement. It‘s all about where you are and who you're with and where you go, this
is life. Every decision is an adjustment in your movement, every decision. It's
steering. And if you're not in the right place this life does not give you anything. It
is what inner authority is. It's turning the navigation over from the personality that
has no idea where to go, to the design that is the life.
Seven Years of Deconditioning
The moment that you enter into this experiment, many possibilities open up in terms
of what it means to be transformed as a being on this plane. It takes seven years to
decondition. It‘s not like it happens right away. This is about awareness, not about
instant gratification. It was never designed, this knowledge, to be something that
was for adults. It was knowledge that came here for children that could only get
there through adults. Deconditioning is an enormous process, very, very difficult
and some aspects of conditioning, the impact on the not-self mind, some aspects are
practically impossible to eradicate in this life, they just hang there forever. The fact
is that conditioning is something that is very profound. The seven-year process that
it takes once you enter into Design, this is really only the beginning of what is
possible, because this is just the deconditioning, it is not the life itself. Not the
beginning of the expression of the emerging personality, who the being really is in
this life. And it‘s not what you think, it's not about—I remember it so clearly.
In the early ‗90s when I first began training people and I explained to them then
about the seven-year cycle and that they would know what I mean when they got
there, but I would never be able to describe it because in fact if you go through the
deconditioning process to establish your own authority, nobody knows quite what
that is. It's your authority, it‘s your process, and it‘s your being. And one of the
most enjoyable things for me over the many, many years now in Design because
I've been fortunate enough to have a lot of students go through that process, is how
for each of them, it is obvious and at the same time, not a surprise.

It is not about drama. It is about shedding forever those forces that control you that
are not you. And the only armor that you have against that is your Strategy and
Authority. You do not have any other armor, you have no other protection. Your
mind, your knowledge, your spirit, all of those things is very nice, but they cannot
protect you. The only thing that protects you
is your ability to make decisions correctly. As
long as you can make decisions correctly, this
life is really something that is awaiting your
complete exploration. It‘s what it's about.
I look at the vast majority of humanity, the
Solar Plexus people, the Sacral people and it
is so obvious to me that this could bring such
an enormous transformation into the very
nature of what life is. We are living life too
fast. It‘s not anybody's fault. It‘s not the
blame of all these Solar Plexus beings who
don't know any better. It's not their fault.
It‘s just never the way that it works, unfortunately. And we hold it up as a
counterpoint for those who can find their way free from it, because every emotional
being knows the pain of being incorrect, every Sacral being knows the pain of
meeting resistance, they know the pain.
So, it is something that is one of those things that is the very basis of the
knowledge, it is the bedrock of the work that I do, is to remind people day in and
day out that it is the surface where this life is lived. It is the surface where your life
is transformed. And the surface, the illusion, is all built on our movement in this
maia, and that means that we have to be able to be in the right position. That our
positioning in the maia is something that our minds are not capable of grasping.
They‘re not. It‘s not what mind was designed for. And the beauty of this knowledge
is revealed knowledge, is that it gives us this profound mechanical insight into
exactly the way the vehicle can operate, how to make decisions, how to make
decisions as yourself, how to change your life.
Yes, it‘s a challenge. It's a challenge to deal with anything, whatever your particular
design happens to be, everybody's got something that they have to deal with. But, I
want to remind you of something. You only get one chance. It's there on your plate
in front of you. You either dive into the experiment or you walk away. But this is it.
It‘s the whole thing about the privilege. You have the privilege of being on the
fractal, and you have to see that that brings with it the responsibility of not just
studying, but living. And it‘s decision by decision, it‘s breath by breath. It's about
being correct.
Anyway, next week we'll look at all the minor authorities that seem to confuse
people. They‘re not confusing, but anyway. You have yourself an interesting week
and a correct one. I‘ll be back with you next week; bye for now.

Authority: Minor Authorities
Good morning to all of you, nice that you are here. We are going to continue our
look at authority. As I mentioned last week, one of the things to keep in mind,
because there tends to be a lot of confusion about nature of inner authorities, the
vast majority of inner authorities are very simple to see. That is, you've got a
defined Sacral Center; you already can see inner authority. You have a defined
emotional system, you can already see the inner authority and it represents about
80% of humanity. The rest of humanity is broken up into a whole number of minor
authorities, not minor in the sense that they‘re small in their value, if I can put it
that way, but minor in the sense in terms of population, or in terms of their
representation in the whole.
And again you see this here in the graphing. 51% of humanity has Solar Plexus
authority; 32, 33% here, this is the pure Sacral authority. That is, Generators who
have an undefined emotional system. So you can see that the vast majority, the
major authorities, what represents 83, 84% of the population, it is simply in these
two examples. What we‘re going to look at today is we‘re going to look at the rest of
this.
One of the things to notice is that these are all very tiny, these last four that we‘re
going to look at. But the splenic authority is something that is relatively common.
In other words, like triple split definitions, which are about 11% of the population,

THE FOUR VIEWS

splenic authority is around one tenth, one out of every 10 people approximately have
splenic authority. And in order to have a splenic authority understand what that
means, that means that the Spleen obviously is defined, but the Sacral can't be and
the emotions can‘t be. Because obviously in the moment that they would be defined
this would no longer be a question of splenic authority, the major authority would
take over. So it is a limited grouping, in that sense, but it‘s 10 percent. The rest of
these normally, this is where some of the confusion arises, but we are going to take
a look and see how all this pans out.
Splenic Authority
Our first example is 10% of humanity approximately. By the way, this is a very
simple perspective of it in order to just make it absolutely clear. That is, this splenic
authority could be more complex.
That is, there could be this activation
here. There are other things that
could be there, but nonetheless this is
the authority. And it is the authority
because there is a ranking system. If
the emotional system is defined it's
automatically the authority; that‘s
number one. Number two, if the
Sacral Center is defined and it's not
emotional than it‘s the authority.
Number three, if the Sacral is
undefined, if the emotional system is
undefined, then if the Splenic Center
is defined, it is the key. In other
words, it is an awareness center and
in the hierarchy of things it is the third most prevalent authority, that is, the defined
Spleen, splenic authority.
Splenic authority is not a simple thing.
For example I'm somebody who has a
very complex design and in my design
it sort of goes like this, and like this
and then down across to here. The
fact is that I operate out of a splenic
authority. I have an open emotional
system. I have an open Solar Plexus
system. Splenic authority is very
complex in the sense that you have
nothing to hold onto because of the
nature of the Spleen. And it also
means you have to be very connected
to it. I had to make a lot of minor
errors in my early years, really, a lot
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

120
LECTURE EIGHT
Authority: Minor Authorities
of minor errors. And what I mean by that is ignoring my Spleen, because the Spleen
is very quiet, it's very quick, it's instantaneous, it simply delivers a tiny little piece of
information, that's all it does, and then it doesn't come back. It doesn't repeat it.
So if you don't pay attention to it, it gets you.
And often what happened to me in the early years of my own process is that I would
be aware of it, but it would have no pull on me. I‘d get that feeling, that typical
splenic ―don't do this.‖ And there would be momentum in whatever I was doing, Ego
Manifestor, and I would quickly see the folly of that, very quickly. So it took a great
deal of discipline to get to a point where my mind simply was totally out of the
process and only when the mind is really totally out of the decision making process
can you begin to just let your Spleen work.
So, splenic authority is not a simple thing. And in many ways it is much more
difficult for males than it is for females. There is a tendency to be much more
sensitive to the inner hunch, whatever you want to call it. Out of the Spleen comes
very basic things, very basic instantaneous judgmentation, instantaneous instinct
and intuition, all of this in the moment as a protective system.
And of course the difficult thing with the Spleen is that there's no understanding it.
You don't understand the Spleen. You never get to understand the Spleen, you
can't. You can't because it doesn't explain itself. It‘s not the Ajna Center; it‘s not
evolved to lay out all these kinds of patterns or memories. It isn‘t like that. The
whole thing about the Spleen is that
it's this moment-by-moment-by-
moment-by-moment decision
making process. That, this is good,
this is not; this is good, this is not,
basically those kinds of things are
going on all the time splenically.
So, to have the Spleen as an inner
authority, even though it can be
enormously rewarding, you take a
look at this example that we have
here. Here is somebody that with
an 18/58 unconscious only
definition, you have somebody
that's very open and the only
definition that they have is
unconscious, this is a deep vulnerability, it‘s a deep vulnerability to the conditioning
plane obviously. But at the same time, what you're looking at here is somebody with
a very, very powerful judgmental authority. Because after all, the 18/58 is the
channel of judgment, it is about the energy for critical capacity. It is about being
able to correct things.
This is a Spleen that really knows what needs to be dealt with or not in the given
moment, or a Spleen that is very, very aware collectively of the other, if you can
trust this. And of course the thing about the splenic system is that it's spontaneous.

So, in anybody's particular authority it brings a special quality to it. Here in this
particular Projector what we have is the ability to be able to accept the invitation or
not in the moment.
Splenic is Existential
To be splenic is to be fundamentally existential. This is where the world lives out.
It‘s something that over time people learnt about me, particularly those people
around me a lot in my process. I would say something and nothing would happen
with it, or there are all kinds of things about the Spleen where one moment it says
something because in that moment it's correct, and 10 minutes later it's not correct
and may never be correct again, and this is the Spleen. And there's absolutely no
way of controlling that; none whatsoever.
It is the same thing with the Spleen in relationships. It‘s why you have to be very
grounded to have splenic authority, because at any given moment your Spleen is
going to say ―yes‖ or ―no‖ to anyone in any situation. And you're not going to know
why, because you can't. My favorite splenic story recently, because it was one that
was just so startling to me as evidence of the magic of the Spleen and no way of
penetrating it. I live in the countryside, and when I go driving off to the local village,
as long as I'm on the back country road I never put on my seatbelt. And when I get
to the highway, it‘s not a highway in that sense, it's just a two-lane road, but it's
considered a major artery, I put on my seatbelt.
One morning I get into the car and I'm driving out of my driveway and I literally
watch my arm go over and pull over the seatbelt. And I note this, because it's
unusual. I'm deeply individual; I'm very repetitive in that sense. Individuals follow
certain things that work. This was not a pattern for me. So, I watch myself with my
seatbelt on, and I just note it; nothing else, interesting. And I go off and I get onto
the main artery and I want to make a left turn across the highway into an area
where there's a newspaper store and I'm standing in the middle of the highway with
my blinkers on and I‘m just standing there.
And some local in a van, obviously his mind on other things, didn't see me standing
there. I was right in the middle of the road. And by the time he did see me, it was
too late. I‘m sitting there waiting to make my left turn and I hear this screech and
then bang, he bangs into the back of my car. And there I am with my seatbelt on.
And obviously nothing happened; I would have been, I don't think seriously because
it wasn't a horrendous crash, but nonetheless, I may have bruised my chest or
something or whatever, but nonetheless.
And the moment that I heard the brakes, I mean before his van actually hit my car,
when I heard the brakes, I thought, ah, Spleen, yeah, because this is what it is. And
you don‘t know why. I don‘t know how my Spleen picked that up, I don‘t. There's
no way of understanding that. I truly do not understand that. I don't know whether
that is based on probability on the way in which the neutrino ocean, the information,
was picked up. I have no idea. Who knows why? This is the beauty of the Spleen.

Authority: Minor Authorities
It‘s one of the things that I love so much about it is that it is so deeply, deeply
mysterious. And when I say mysterious it's not like we cannot go in there and
discern how all that functions and works, I do that. That‘s not the point. I mean, it
is mysterious in the sense that it doesn't share it with us.
It‘s not the mind or for that matter the emotions that you churned through the
various places in the wave. The Spleen doesn't do that. It doesn't take you into its
confidence. It doesn't say to you, look I'm processing this and I've decided—it
doesn't do that. Not only that, but it doesn't tell you where its resources come from.
Your mind always does, at least it tries to. Not your Spleen; your Spleen doesn't tell
you where it got the information. It just simply gives you that one and only one
notification. That‘s it.
And when I say notification it is a notification, because in fact, the Spleen is actually
telling those of us who are splenic, telling us things all the time moment-by-
moment-by-moment-by-moment, literally. So, these specific notifications are like
little slight highlights in this ongoing moment-by-moment-by-moment. This is the
Spleen at work. And of course, what that does is that means that as a human being,
that you have to see that your life is the now for you. It doesn't mean you can't
plan. It doesn't mean that you can't have an
enjoyment of the continuity from the past,
but it does mean that if you're not paying
attention in the now you‘re going to have a
lot of problems, because you will not hear
your Spleen. And if you don't listen to your
Spleen, you do get hurt.
That‘s why you're given a defined Spleen in
the first place, is that you have to pay
attention to your defense system. So we
have one tenth of humanity that has splenic
authority; no Sacral, no emotions, but a
defined Spleen. And of course, for them it
means that these are beings that have to pay attention in the now. They just do.
And this is the most difficult aspect for them. Obviously, entering into your Strategy
and Authority as a Projector in this particular case, as for all Projectors, it‘s a long
process to be healed, a long process to cleanse out the conditioning that has been
there for whatever, decades. It is quite a thing.
And of course for the Projector the road to healing is the root in learning. This is the
way that a Projector heals themselves. They study and they learn and they master.
And in that way they begin to grasp the way things work and slowly but surely their
process is transformed. However, it is essential for this particular Projector to
recognize the meaning of the existential. In other words, that for them the invitation
is something that is dealt with in the moment, whether that is a life transforming
decision, or the minor of the mundane life, whatever it may be, because this is what
it is for them. And one of the things that I tell those that are splenic, those that are
not rooted into the Sacral/emotional system is to really enjoy the fact that you can
be clear in the moment, but only trust it in the moment. This is what‘s so difficult.

Trust Only in the Moment
You can only trust it in the moment. That's the thing. That's the thing that it forces
you to stay aware in the now, because when the Spleen says yes to something it is
only saying yes to it in that moment, in those circumstances, in those conditions.
And change any of the background, framework, and the possibility is that the answer
is going to be different, so you can't trust it. Anything my Spleen ever tells me
about anyone or anything I only give value to it in the moment that I take it in,
because there's nothing else I can do, because I've learned that it changes. And it
does; conditions and circumstances change, particularly when dealing with people.
After all, you‘re dealing with the not-self all the time, most of us deal with the not-
self all the time. As a splenic being I have to rely on my Spleen to be able to
recognize which not-self is reasonably healthy enough to deal with. I look at a
design like this and it always comes down to the question of the discernment, the
people that are going to be in your life, the people that are going to be filling up all
that space. But nonetheless, splenic authority is something that is just there in a
moment.
Ego Manifested Authority
The channel 45/21 is something that stands on its own. It‘s always stood on its own.
Any study of the Ego circuit, as an example, that is, the tribal circuitry that is
expressed through the 45/21, that in essence the 45/21 is, you can‘t call it a circuit
by itself, but it has always in essence stood by itself. It is very different from the
rest of the circuitry. As a matter of fact, that is true in both cases. That is, in both
cases in terms of the Ego outside
of what is this tribal diamond
here. That is, the movement out
through the 51/25 leads to a
unique combination of projected
authority, and the 45/21 leads to
a very unique example, that is the
45/21 without the Sacral, without
the Spleen and without the
emotional system. In other
words, when the three big boys
are no longer ruling the roost,
because it is all about hierarchy in
terms of what's going to be the
inner authority.
So, you remove the three across
the bottom. And next in line is
the Ego. So, what we have here is that we have Ego manifested authority, we have

Authority: Minor Authorities
pure Ego authority. This is the only way that you can get pure Ego authority. There
is no other way. If it is connected to here, it can still remain Ego authority, but
again, I will talk about the dilemma that comes with a 25/51 because it has its own
particular formula. If it goes here (26 to 44) the Spleen becomes the authority,
because that would then be higher up in the hierarchy.
So what we're looking at is the only example of Ego authority. And the only example
of true Ego authority is manifested Ego authority. In other words, you're looking at
a very, very tiny slice, which is 0.99%. So it's approximately 1%, one out of every
hundred people. Again, we've got nearly 7 billion people, so it's not like there's
nobody who has this, the numbers are quite large. However as a percentage, you
can get the feel for it—one out of every hundred people is going to have Ego
authority. That means one out of every hundred people has the 45/21. Think about
that, because that is rather interesting. That's the power and the dominance of this
particular channel because it is a very unusual channel.
We know it as the channel of materialism. This is the only expression of the tribe to
the Throat. After all, everything about the tribe is locked into what is the Ego
system, that is, the Ego circuit, everything locked into the Heart Center, locked into
the Ego so everything about this is about outlet. And of course we can see that
when you look at the Throat at
the place of expression and
you've got 11 gates in the Throat
that only one gate in the Throat
is tribal.
So in dealing with the 45/21 what
you're dealing with is a
possessive voice—―I have or I
don't have‖—and a possessive
voice that is rooted in the 21st
gate, that is, the gate of control,
Biting Through. And what you
have is this very, very powerful
Ego Manifestor. And basically
what Ego authority is, is that
whatever comes out of this 45 as
a verbal expression is the
authority. Now, we have situations where you have authority that has no
awareness. For example, the Sacral Center connected down to the Root. Here you
would have a Generator. But you would have a Generator that is connected only to
the Root Center; it's not connected to an awareness center. It‘s not like the Sacral
connected to the Spleen, as an example.
So here what we're looking at is we‘re looking at a non-aware source, because
people say, oh, yeah but there's no awareness, you don't need awareness for an
authority, this is the vehicle. And the authority in this particular case is the authority
that is expressed out of that Ego power. I have to go do this—away you go. At least
you‘re informing as you go.

And you'll notice that in this particular configuration even though there happens to
be an Ajna Center, a Head Center, the defined awareness. Remember that this can
never be an inner authority so it has nothing to do with it, it does not out rank the
Ego. And the G Center, the only time that the G Center can compete with the Ego is
when it is directly connected to it, otherwise it cannot. The Ego, after all, is a very,
very powerful motor. And two of the most powerful authorities are motor driven,
that is being Sacral and being emotional. As a matter of fact, the majority of
authorities are motor driven.
So here you have the third motor driven authority, but only in this specific case, only
in the presence of the 45/21. So the only time you can say that somebody has Ego
authority, pure Ego authority, is when they‘re a 45/21, and they don't have any of
the three major authority centers—the Spleen, the Sacral, and the emotional
system.
But there‘s something interesting to note, that automatically when you see that
45/21 you‘re looking at something that is very interesting. The other thing is how
difficult it is for the 45/21 to be in a design where other motors are defined and it
has to compete. It‘s not easy at all. Again, we are looking at minor authorities.
That is, those kinds of things, one out of every hundred people. And again most of
the people that you're going to deal with in any kind of analytical work that the
majority are going to be Generators or Projectors.
Self-projected Authority
Here in this particular case of this particular Projector, there are very interesting
elements. Here is, obviously a Projector, the G Center directly connected through
the 31/7 to the Throat. And this is called Self-projected authority. Here is the self.
It's projected because it can only exist
in this configuration. After all, again
think about hierarchies—no emotional
system, no Sacral, no Spleen, and no
Ego—so automatically the G Center
then automatically becomes the
authority. But, of course, it is very
limited in this sense because you know
it's going to be a projected element.
In other words, no Spleen, no Sacral,
no emotions, no Ego, you can‘t be
anything else but a projected element.
This is a Self-projected authority. And
basically what that means is that my
guidance to people who have this
authority is that they have to hear what they say, they have to listen to what they
say. In other words, they have to hear themselves because what they say in the

Authority: Minor Authorities
now, and again that is very important, what they say in the now, in response or in
reaction, this is their truth, this is what they can trust. So if someone comes up to
them and says look, I'm wondering if you would like to do this thing and they hear
themselves say in the moment yes, yes, that's interesting for me, too, okay that‘s
your authority, Self-projected authority.
In other words, it is the identity that is establishing the authority. Basically, it‘s the
direction that is establishing the authority. If you deconstruct this down, basically
that is very much sphinx related, and it's very much about establishing the direction.
In other words, whatever this identity is going to say yes to, basically it is saying yes
to a specific direction. In other words, it is acting as an authority for the monopole
in a way, driving the direction of everything. So as long as this is in the right
direction, then it's going to be able to deal with the rest of this.
But Self-projected authority—self because it's the identity system, projected because
it's a Projector configuration and can be nothing else, and so it is that Self-projected
authority. Again, if we look, you can see that it's actually a larger grouping, much
larger, for example, than the simple presence of the 45/21 in that configuration
without the other major centers. Here you can see that you're dealing with 2½
percent of the population. That's a lot of people. It's not enormous or anything, but
it's in two or three out of every
hundred people you're going to find
that, which means that, again, looking
at that you're also looking at a
grouping that is only Projector. And
the same thing is going to be true with
the next one, which is Ego projected,
but there is very little of that. But
you're only going to see this in terms of
certain Projectors.
Again remembering that as we‘re
moving down in this that we get into
more and more isolated circumstances.
We saw that in the Ego, you have to
have the 45/21 and everything else is
blank, the major centers are out of the game. But a 45/21 is the key. So this is a
very specific grouping. Here in the Self-projected it is more complex because we
have more possibilities. That is, there are more channels that can be involved in
creating that self projected element; in other words, any of the Sphinx gates pointed
upwards from the G Center to the Throat. So you end up with many more
possibilities of that kind of definition coming into existence.
But again, remembering that this is something that you're going to see only in a
certain number of Projectors. So when you're looking at designs and trying to figure
out the authorities, the one thing you know is that there's no such thing as a Self-
projected authority if this isn't the configuration. In other words, it is very simple;
one of these three channels (7-31, 1-8, 13-33). Now, any of these three channels
are going to bring that out. It‘s the same thing here. Also with the single

integration like this (10-20), those four, they all are Self-projected authorities. And
the authority arises from spontaneous verbal response. That‘s where their authority
is, it is in their spontaneous verbal response or verbal reaction, whatever the verbal
reaction happens to be.
So, only here in this example; and again, you can see because you have the
variations, you have the four varieties that can bring this about, you‘ve got a larger
slice of the population. But even with the four it still is only 2½ percent. In other
words, it is relatively speaking, a rarity and limited to this kind of Projector.
Ego-Projected Authority
Now, here is where we have something totally
different. And again it takes us back to the
anomaly of the relationship between the Heart
Center and anything else. In other words, it
has this closed circuit (26-44, 32-54, 19-49,
37-40) that it operates in, in terms of its tribal
nature, but the outlets out are very unusual,
because they both lead to unique authorities.
We've already seen the 45/21 as the unique
Ego authority and here we have the balancing
of the G Center and the Ego. And we get this
out of the presence of the channel of Initiation
(25-51). And I have had a zillion, well, maybe
that's too many, but I would guess over the
years at least a few hundred direct or indirect
e-mails from people who are translating manuals, people who are writing them,
people are always trying to figure out what this is, is this Self-projected authority or
Ego-projected authority.
Now, frankly, the Ego is stronger. My
tendency is always to call this Ego-
projected. However, you could say,
because again, it is a very unusual
configuration, you could say that this is
Self-projected authority, Self-projected Ego
authority. Now, there are all kinds of
labeling that can go with that. Quite
frankly I don't think it makes much of a
difference. But for me it is Ego-projected,
because the Ego is more powerful. And
even though it could be called Self-
projected, because again, there are those
that will argue that the identity is far more
sophisticated as the authority than the potential of the Ego, in other words that
within the G Center is the monopole, the orientation towards our direction, the

Authority: Minor Authorities
potential of the higher self, all this kind of stuff. But I'm a mechanic, and it is clear
to me that the Sacral Center doesn't need a higher awareness to make it efficient,
that it can be efficient in a configuration regardless of that, that when the Sacral is
connected to the G Center that the G Center doesn't dominate the Sacral.
So for me in this kind of configuration my preference is to look at this as Ego-
projected authority. So what we get out of the Heart Center, so that it makes it
uniform, is that we get pure Ego
authority when it manifests and we
get Ego-projected authority when it's
in its relationship to the G Center.
These people, by the way, are very
interesting human beings, frankly. I
know a lot of them who just have this
configuration (25-51 only), and not
have anything like this (Head or Ajna
Center defined) hanging around
outside of it, just this in the center of
what is otherwise a very open
BodyGraph. There is a very powerful
core to them. And there is indeed a
very powerful identity; there is no
question about it. But the authority is
going to be out of the push of the Ego. And everything about decision making in
terms of the way in which that inner authority operates is the Ego pushing towards
initiation, because that's basically the way it works for these beings.
The Projector Finds Correctness in Mastering and Understanding
It is not easy. They are, after all, a Projector and it means that they literally have to
be able to wait for what is the right possibility for initiation for them to be able to
express their power of initiation. As for any Projector, the only way in which they
find correctness is in mastering and understanding, literally, the way in which things
operate. It is very difficult for them otherwise. It takes a long time. Invitation is
something that is haphazard in a way. It is not a consistency, it‘s not like a
Generator being able to respond moment by moment; it's much more selective. A
Projector has to deal with its environment; it has to put out a lot of focus and
concentration because of the nature of its aura on those around it to be able to
maintain itself.
So this learning process is really the healing process. But in terms of just
understanding the authority, this is Ego-projected authority, even though it is this
special relationship with the G Center. I wouldn't get into calling this Self-projected
Ego authority or trying to turn it around somehow. I think it is healthiest just to see
this for what it is mechanically. It is coming out of the Ego and it's a projected
authority.

No Inner Authority
You can see that it's the Projector, and here being the final one, it is the Projector
that has all these weird authorities. Other than the anomaly of the 45/21, because
obviously that is a manifesting theme, that the unusual ones, these projected
authorities, this is all coming out of the Projector population. So again it's the kind
of thing that the moment you see a Projector‘s chart that's the moment that you're
looking at a chart that can be very complex in terms of where is the authority.
Because what you can see is that it is obvious the Projector has very unusual
configurations, again, minority configurations. Most Projectors are pretty
straightforward in terms of their authority; they‘re emotional Projectors, which mean
that half of all Projectors have emotional authority or 51% of all Projectors. It is the
rest of them where you end up—and we know that 10% of them are going to have
splenic authority and that leaves the rest of the projected population with these
unusual configurations.
Here is perhaps one of the most unusual, in that sense. In other words, this is a
design of somebody with no inner authority. And they're not Reflectors, nor should
they be treated as Reflectors, which again is a tendency when people hear that they
have no inner authority. They obviously have a very, very powerful fixed mind, all of
them. What you notice about these unusual authorities is they come out of set
configurations. If you're
going to be a Projector with
no inner authority either you
have the Ajna connected to
the Head and nothing else,
or you have the Ajna
connected to the Throat and
nothing else, or you have
like here, all three connected
and nothing else. In other
words, everything below the
Throat has to be blank.
And the moment you have
definition above the Throat,
this is a Projector with no
inner authority. Let me take
you back for second. This is
2.66%, but out of that
2.66%, 1.38% are
Reflectors. In other words, basically there are about as many Projectors who have
no inner authority as Reflectors. They're about the same in the population, which in
itself is interesting. But of course, the way in which they deal with all that is very,
very different. That is, the Reflector, in essence, does have an inner authority. It
just operates on an unusual timescale. That is, the lunar cycle, and has a very
unusual way of getting to its inner authority. But again, Reflectors are very different
from everyone else. This is not a Reflector. This is obviously somebody that is quite
defined. But this is a Projector that has no inner authority.

Authority: Minor Authorities
Now, what exactly does that mean? Here is a Projector that is designed to be a very
powerful outer authority. You can see that. And certainly in this particular case, not
in all cases, but in this case, we have a very, very powerful Throat. One of the
dilemmas for the mental Projector, that is, the mental Projector in the sense that
they have no inner authority, is that it is essential for them to be able to create a
pattern by which they move through concepts. And those concepts rooted in
decision making. For example, this is a Projector, obviously it can only be a
Projector, it has to be invited. Okay, let's say it gets an invitation, the invitation is to
do whatever, to be somebody's lover, friend, business partner, go on vacation,
whatever the case may be, whatever it is, but something that is considerable to
think about.
For this Projector there is only one way to find their answer. That is, there is only
one way to derive the correct decision. And the one way to do that is that they need
to talk about what that decision would
lead to, could lead to, might be. In
other words, they need to discuss it and
they need to discuss it with at least
three different people at different times.
So, you're offered a job. You get on the
phone and you give your mother a call.
Yeah, I got this offer today. And hear
how it comes out of your mouth,
because that's what you need to hear.
You need to listen to the way in which
you talk about it. Okay you put that
away, and the next day or the next
morning you're out with a friend and
you're having a coffee together and you
talk about the same thing. And it's going to be very different, because you're like an
iceberg. This is what's above the surface, but below the surface is all this
conditioning that‘s changing moment-by-moment and day-by-day and person-by-
person that's impacting you. And being a Projector working one-on-one with people,
and this is the way for you to discover this decision in your self, is that different
things arise that influence the way in which you talk about whatever it is you're
talking about.
By the time that you've done three of them you're going to know. In other words,
you're going to have a sense of whether this is something for you to do or not. It's
the sound board technique. Again, it is a minority; there is no question about it. But
still, for them in their lives this is not an easy thing. What it does mean; here you
have somebody's advantage, they‘re a 4/6, and they have a basic social capacity
that is there. They are a networking person; it‘s perfect for them. After all,
Projectors are here to guide. This is a knower, they've got good connections, all
they need to understand is don't jump to conclusions about anything until you have
gone through this process of sounding it out, because the more you sound it out, the
more you get clear about what is the correct thing for you to do.

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
To make it easy for people, this whole process about what is the authority and where
is the authority and how do I find the authority, the first thing that we really know
about this is that these are all Projectors. They‘re just Projectors. And you know
basically that is where you may get something that's unusual, it's here, too, half of
the None are Projectors. So three of these minor ones are Projector, the Ego one is
very simple, because it's only one channel, and of course the other three centers
have to be missing. This
is all very easy to spot,
and the rest is either
Projector or Reflector.
So if you're looking for
these unusual
configurations, you know
where to find them,
they‘re on either side of
the Throat. The Self-
projected is from the G
up to the Throat. The
Ego-projected, and of course the None, the Ego-projected isn‘t obviously, but the
None is in terms of the mental Projector; again, all of that is above the Throat. So,
they‘re not difficult places to find. And again, with Ego-projected, it is the same
thing with the Ego, these two Ego ones are the same, there are just these two
channels (45-21 and 25-51), and you can spot it rather easily.
The Reflector
Finally, what we get to is we get to the Reflector. And of course because Reflectors
are not designed to have definition their authority is something else. And of course
in the mechanics of Human Design, that
authority is something that emerges
over time. In other words, Reflectors
need to go through a cyclical process.
They need to go through a cyclical
process that is a repetitive process. It‘s
why the Moon is so important to a
Reflector, because obviously all of these
hanging gates and where they're
pointed at, that in the process of 28, 29
days the Moon is going to bring
activation to all the oppositions, to all
the harmonies of those gates. And it's
going to do so in a cyclical pattern on
and on and on.

LECTURE EIGHT
Authority: Minor Authorities
So, one of the things for Reflectors to deal with is that they are not without their
inner authority. It is simply not an inner authority that is personal. It‘s not their
personal inner authority. After all, the thing that is unusual about Reflectors is their
relationship to the program. They have Teflon auras when it comes to people, but
they are deeply, deeply sensitive to the program, and particularly to the agency or
the actions of the Moon. And for them, their inner authority is derived in a
relationship with the turning of the wheel, basically. So they have a very unusual
way of experiencing authority. It is simply a matter of time. It's a matter of going
through a sequence and each time they go through that sequence this new level of
or new layer of clarity can emerge.
In all of these cases, because again
it is really something to see, that is,
what we‘re looking for, in most
cases, is that in these difficult or in
these odd situations you're dealing
with projection. It doesn't matter
whether it's this Ego projection or
not, you're dealing with in most
cases with the whole theme of what
it is to be a Projector, because the
other authorities really are very
straightforward. The 45/21, as the
Manifestor Ego authority is very
straightforward. So are the Sacral,
so are the emotions, so are the
Spleen.
Again, what we come to in understanding authority is that you have to realize
something. In these unusual circumstances we‘re dealing only with Projectors. And
in that sense we're dealing with the way in which only slowly over time is a Projector
able to live out whatever their inner authority may be. This is the other side of it as
well, what it means to be a Projector and what it means when you enter into this
process of self-discovery, not self-discovery, system discovery that it takes a long
time. It takes time to begin to understand how things work. It takes time to begin
to understand how deep the people in your life are into you. It takes time to get to
all of these things.
For most of these Projectors with these unusual authorities, the primary process for
them is not so much in discovering their inner authority, but in beginning to discover
what it means simply to be a Projector, to really understand what that means. This
is the beginning of their healing process, to have a grasp of that. It's not such an
easy thing to say to this Self-projected authority, listen, listen to yourself, listen to
what you say. They don't trust that. They want to be able to trust what they think
they think. They end up being conditioned by all this openness in all kinds of
directions that becomes the not-self of their process, and so forth and so on.

Dealing with the Limitation of Being a Projector
So again, this whole journey of looking at authority, first in so many human beings
it's just something that's very, very straightforward. And the moment that you see
that it's not straightforward, the moment that it is involved in any of these projected
aspects, is the moment that you see the dilemma here is not about dealing with,
boy, this is an unusual authority or it's different, it's about dealing with the limitation
of what it is to be a Projector, that these are Projectors that really suffer, because
they have very, very unusual and difficult to access authorities in a way. They're not
the standard methodology, it‘s not the standard way of dealing with things, and it‘s
all there.
So, it means working with
them in terms of what it is
to be a Projector and get
them to look into
authority, and begin to
look into their kind of
authority, to begin to
understand how it works.
But one of my goals in
doing the Four Views this
semester because my
overall purpose was to be
able to have the material
that I'm covering with all of you live during this semester available for Channel 88,
for people to be able to learn these things whenever, is that I wanted to make sure
that one isn‘t confused about these authorities and get caught up in thinking how
complex all that is. It really isn't.
Most of it is extremely straightforward. About 95% of authority is very, very
straightforward and it is that other 5 or 6% that is there, that is rooted in the
Projector. And not the Reflector, because this is a quite straightforward authority, it
is just about time. It‘s different, but it's not the same question as for example, the
mental Projector and how difficult it is for mental Projectors to give up, in that sense,
the false inner authority.
Written question: What about for the Lunar Cycle starting gate for the
Reflectors??
Ra: Starting gate for Reflectors? Well, I think the starting gates are timing things
and I think timing things are when something strikes you. I think the timing is
always the moment that an obvious process has been initiated, somebody comes up
to you and you have a meeting and in that meeting something is proposed. That's a
starting point. I think the starting point is something that has to be associated with
the initiation of some kind of process, and then you can track it.

Authority: Minor Authorities
I know in my own dealings, for example, in working with Reflectors that I always set
it up so that I give them basically a month in order to respond so that they have the
time to go through their process. And again, when you initiate something with a
Reflector you have to assume that you‘re going to have to give them a month
because that's the timing. Once you start it, you‘re off and running on the wheel.
But again, to finish my thoughts on this, it is simply in these very minor projected
elements, again, five out of every hundred people are going to have an unusual
projected authority, and the dilemma isn't going to be in the authority. The dilemma
is in what it is to be a Projector, to come to grips with that process, and literally to
begin that study. That is, to begin to dig deep, deep into the science. If you don't
do that, you're never really liberated as a Projector.
But the rest of it is straightforward, and for most of us it's always going to be one of
these—and for most of the planet and for most of the people that you're going to
deal with. So inner authority is not a mystery, it is something that is quite readily
recognizable. There are nuances, obviously. I think that coming to understand any
authority that expresses only through the Throat, like the Self-projected authority,
that this takes a great deal of attention, in the same way that takes attention to be a
splenic being. It takes attention because otherwise you miss things. It's the same
thing with projection through the Throat that you have to hear what you have to say.
The same thing is true, by the way, for the pure Ego authority. It also expresses
through the Throat. And again, the requirement to really listen to what you say, not
about being in your mind thinking about what you'd like to say or what you should
have said or what you might have said or what you could have said, but actually
being totally behind what you do say in the now, because that's your truth.
Anyway, it‘s always nice to share my morning coffee with beginner‘s material. I do
like revisiting all these things. And I appreciate the fact you‘re all involved, because
I think for years to come it will be good information for people, good for them to be
able to have access to. So, anyway, you have yourself a good day wherever you
are, day or night, or a good sleep if that's what's in store for you. And until next
time, when we will enter into the land of profiles; until then, bye for now.

Profiles: 1/3, 1/4, 2/4 and 2/5
Well good morning to all of you and welcome to the last of our views and one that is
different than the others and different from the others because it‘s not in the
BodyGraph. And what I mean by that though ultimately the activations can be seen
within the BodyGraph; you cannot look at a BodyGraph by itself and recognize the
profile. So, unlike what we get out of definition or authority or strategy, what we're
looking at and the Type is what's there in the BodyGraph. And the information that
we get is information that is there in front of us in the graph itself.
But the profile is not like that all. Profile is a view that we get from the database. At
the basic level of Human Design it is the only information that we derive directly
from the database in terms of an overview of the being, of the higher levels of the
knowledge. There are other database-rooted insights that are not available within
the BodyGraph that lead to different ways of being able to look at what I refer to as
characterization.
That is, profile is the beginning of establishing a style for life, because that's really
what profile represents. I've often described profile as a costume. That is, it's the
basic costume that gives you a generic difference. In other words, it is a broad
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

137
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
generic. After all, there are 12 profiles, there are 7 billion people. If you look at the
global survey you'll see quite clearly that for each of the various profiles we‘re
talking about anywhere from tens of millions to hundreds and hundreds of millions of
beings. So obviously, we‘re dealing with a very, very broad generic. It is the
beginning of the process. As a matter of fact, the refinement of the profile is when
you take the next step and you look at the profile within the context of the gates
that it's in and this leads to the incarnation cross and it leads to another variation of
basic characterization.
The Science of Differentiation
So when you're looking at somebody and you see that they‘re a Generator with a
split definition and emotional authority, what we do know about that is that through
profile there are going to be 12 different variations of that, or the possibility of 12
different variations. In other words, it adds a new level of nuance in the direction
of—Human Design is called the science of differentiation. Everything about this
knowledge is about establishing clearly what makes us different from each other.
It‘s interesting, I don't know if any of you saw this, I don‘t know where I picked that
up, I think it was in a news magazine, that there's a whole new movement in the
genetic community. And it's very interesting, this movement, because genetics for
so long has been focused on our similarities. They like to say that genetically
speaking human beings are 99% alike. But they never talk about the 1% that‘s
different. It's interesting that there's a whole new movement in genetic research in
trying to figure out what makes us different from each other, which is very nice
because they‘re finally catching up to Human Design.
But anyway, everything about this work is about differentiation. So, the first thing
that I want to see about the nature of profile is that profile is the first step in
differentiating you. You may be that emotional Generator with three or four other
emotional Generators, but if you have different profiles you‘re very different people.
Despite the fact that you have a similar kind of way in which you‘re intended to
operate, a similar kind of strategy, whatever the case may be, the reality is that the
moment we get to profile, the moment we get to this key we get to the beginnings of
the nuance of differentiation. We get to our first basic costume that separates us
from the other.
The Basis of Profile
Profile, where do we get profile? The basis of profile is the recognition of the
fundamental duality that is us. In other words, we are a binary consciousness. And
in this binary consciousness we have two calculating points. That is, the point of
birth and the 88° retrograde of the Sun before the birth. So, we have these two
points of calculation. And because we make two calculations we have two sets of
Sun/Earths. The Sun/Earth is the fundamental element for the programming of our
character. It's 70% of the neutrinos we receive. So, when we‘re looking at the
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

138
LECTURE NINE
Profiles: 1/3, 1/4, 1/4 and 2/5
Sun/Earth combination, that is, the neutrino feed of the Sun and the living out of
that within the context of the Earth that we have these two calculations.
Of course, the Sun and Earth are always exactly opposite each other, which means
that regardless of what line the Sun happens to be in, its Earth is exactly opposite in
the same line. So where we take profile is from the lines of the Sun/Earths, both
personality and design. In fact, the way in which it is written is different from the
way in which we see it. In other words, the way it's written as you see here, we
refer to somebody who has a 1st line Sun/Earth personality and a 3rd line design
Sun/Earth that we refer to them as a 1/3 and you can see that the personality is
written first. Okay, so it's just simply to see the formula of that. So, when we‘re
referring to somebody who's a 1/3, that 1 is their personality Sun/Earth and the
second digit is always going to be the design Sun/Earth.
In that, we have the beginnings of what is the miracle in Human Design. That is,
what makes the wheel so incredible and what makes the way in which a human
being is calculated within the context of that wheel is so incredible because it is not
based on a 90° separation between the two calculations. It's this 88° calculation,
and only this 88° calculation that makes possible the progression that we call profile.
And you can see very clearly here that this 1 personality and this 3 design, when
there is a shift forward, there is still a 1 personality, but because of the 88° there is
a shifting that takes place at the unconscious level. And of course, the next shift is
going to take place at the personality level. And then the next shift at the
unconscious level. What you get literally is the spiral of life. In other words, you get
the spiraling movement that moves through this chain of what we call profile, all of it
rooted in the presence of the 88° differentiation because this is what creates this
whole profile progression.
Understanding the Lines
When we are looking at profile, basically what we have to deal with is that we have
to deal with lines. This is really what it's all about, because until you can grasp lines,
it's very difficult to grasp profile. Profile, the 1/3 or the 1/4 or whatever, you need
to know what the 1 is, because this is the foundation of profile. It is the foundation
of Human Design analysis. It is the foundation of being able to enter into this
knowledge at any level. If you don't understand the lines, you‘re very limited in
what you can see, because in essence all you get to see is what's up there in the
BodyGraph and the information, the secrets that are there in the database itself, you
don't have access to.
Everything about understanding the lines is first of all recognizing that the hexagram
structure is something that works from a foundation upwards. This is the basic
structure. The basic structure is divided into two parts; that is, the lower and upper
trigram. So, the first three lines are lower and the next are upper. And you can see
that there are themes that are associated with all of this. Now, it's not my intent
here, after all, this kind of information is very basic information in Human Design.
It's available in the basic level trainings in Human Design. But I do want to make

sure that it is well understood that the key to understanding profile is that you have
to know what the lines are about. If you know what the lines are about, you can
begin to understand the process and you can begin to understand the way in which
this spiral provides us with such incredible variation in the way in which human
beings live out their lives.
My goal today is to take you through what is the first quarter binary. And this first
quarter binary, the 1 and the 2, is the very beginning, this is the very basics of the
process. We‘re going to look at personalities of introspection and personalities of
projection. We‘re going to look at the 1-2 configuration and of course, what is there
in terms of the vehicle, what is there in terms of the design.
The 1/3
Let's begin with the 1/3. What is a 1? One of the things to grasp about the 1, and
by the way the detail information that's in here it's there for you to look at and to
ponder because it
just gives you more
and more access to
the nature of the 1—
behavioral identity.
Well, behavioral
identity is all
connected to the 1st
line of the 10th gate,
the gate of behavior.
Out of these various
areas we get to see
certain 1st line
themes in the way in
which these 1st line themes are going to operate. So it gives us of a series of
keynotes, a different level of keynotes to be able to associate with the 1st line, as
well as of course obviously with the design; again, the level of keynotes that are
there.
I‘m going to give you a much more general view of this. First of all, we‘re dealing at
the very beginning of the process. We‘ve got a 1st line personality. This is the
foundation. And everything that we know about this foundation is that the 1 is all
about introspection. So, if you‘re somebody who is a 1/3 or a 1/4, because it‘s not
going to make a difference in terms of your personality, if you‘ve got a 1st line
personality you need to get to the bottom of things. This is what the 1st line
personality is all about. It needs to get to the bottom of things, it needs to get to
the root of things, and it is very insecure. So you have a very insecure personality
whenever it's not standing on solid ground.

In other words, if this is a personality that has to go into some kind of an interview
or test, whatever, if they haven't done their homework, if they haven't studied, if
they haven't really gone deeply into things, they're going to be very, very insecure,
and they‘re going to be very uncomfortable. So, this is a personality that needs to
have the facts, it needs to see that things are solid. Now, of course there are other
attributes that are there that you can see—the investigative, modesty, the
authoritarian that‘s there in the 1, because the moment that it finds the foundation—
I have 10 1st lines, I‘m a 5/1, I'm an authority and you can hear it in my voice and I
sounded like that when I was five. In other words, it's just there in the 1. Because
the moment that you have a solid foundation, the authority is natural, it's not put
on. It‘s simply there in the voice.
So, if you're talking to a child that has a 1st line personality and you ask them
something and they give you an answer, if they really know that answer, you will
feel the strength of their authority and certainty in that. But, if they are on shaky
ground they are very, very insecure. And you can get a lot of personality complexes
out of this level of insecurity. So when we're dealing with a 1st line personality we‘re
dealing with a certain kind of being. Now, we know that you can be a Generator with
a 1st line personality or Projector or Manifestor, and of course that means that quite
literally you're going to operate based on the way in which your personality guides
you. In other words, the nuance is there in the way you play out the role of being a
Manifestor.
Seeing the Character
1/3 Manifestors and 3/5 Manifestors and 6/2 Manifestors are all different. Because
what we see in profile is that we're beginning to see the character. We're beginning
to see the way in which the holistic being, the whole being, is intended to present
itself, because obviously this is not just simply a matter of what is the personality.

It's also about, here is a vehicle; it‘s a 3rd line vehicle. It‘s the so-called martyr
vehicle. And its key in life is to be able to adapt. This is a vehicle that is very, very
resilient. It is able to pick itself up. It is a real fighter.
And of course when you put the two of them together and you have yourself a 1/3,
then you have something very unusual. First of all, you have the only profile in
which both of the lines are lower hexagram. In other words, this is the most self-
absorbed of all profiles. Everything about the right angle, that is, the first seven
profiles, everything about the right angle is that the right angle is self-absorbed.
They are into their
own process.
Personal destiny is
the theme of the
right angle. In
other words, they've
got to work out their
movie.
So when you're
looking at a 1/3
you're looking at the
extreme of this.
The other side, by
the way, the mirror, the harmonic hexagram to the 1/3 is the 4/6; harmonic in that
the 1 to the 4 and the 3 to the 6 are basic harmonies in hexagram structure. And
the 4/6 is the only profile in which the lines are both upper trigram. In other words,
they‘re bookends to the right angle process, the 1/3 and the 4/6.
When you're looking at this 1/3 what you're looking at is a vehicle that is going to be
involved in trial and error. It is a body that is going to bang into things. It is a
vehicle that is going to have to fight for what works for it on the material plane. And
of course, as a 1/3, because of the 1, that without the proper education, without
learning what is necessary in order to be able to establish the security for the
personality, you're going to end up with somebody who is constantly making
mistakes. That is, the way in which the 3 is perceived, because they have a trial and
error process they do make mistakes. That is, they‘re here to find out what doesn't
work.
And the 1/3, at the very basis of all profile is that you have a personality that wants
to find out what is solid and you've got a vehicle that's designed to find anything that
isn't. It‘s what makes them special. But of course when you look at them in terms
of the not-self, the way the 1/3 operates in the world, this is a very difficult
configuration. It‘s very limited, limited in that it's so deeply self-absorbed. They
don't really know how to handle the other well. This is not what they‘re about.
They‘re really into their own thing and they're very concerned about the fact that the
world appears to be a lie.

You tell your 1/3 child a lie, even a harmless lie, your child starts losing their first
teeth and you tell the child that the tooth fairy is going to come and put some money
underneath its pillow, that child knows that that's not true. It will investigate that.
It will really investigate it. It‘s the same thing with the Santa Claus myths and
things like that. The moment that you lie to a 1/3 child, they‘ll never forgive you.
They will never fully trust you. Again, it is one of these things about they are here to
find out what doesn't work. They‘re here to discover the world of broken promises,
failed dreams, all of those things. It‘s part of their process. And of course the 1/3s
when they're not raised correctly, when they're not given the advantage of
education, when they're not given the possibility of security, they live a very difficult
life. It can be very, very difficult.
This investigative martyr, they can end up really suffering in life. So for them the
key is always being able to find what finally can work for them. And of course that's
when the characterization, the beginning of the differentiation is so dependent on
what's there in the BodyGraph, because the realization of the perfection of what it is
to be a 1/3 goes back, as everything does in Human Design, to Strategy and
Authority. It is the Strategy and Authority that guides all of this. It makes it
possible. It makes the movement, the decision making correct and ultimately brings
out what is correct for the 1/3.
This is just a general introductory movement over the profiles. There‘s a
tremendous amount of profile information available. It is something that is one of
the keys in understanding characterization in Design. It is the bedrock of being able
to understand incarnation cross. There's some very good material available. I think
there are a couple of things in Channel 88. It‘s worth looking into, by the way,
particularly for those of you that are really newcomers, if you're really interested in
having analytical skills in Human Design how important it is. The other things, of
course, are just basic trainings in Human Design, which obviously have to cover all of
this in depth because after all it is a basis in the knowledge.

Shifting to the 1/4 Transitional Profile
Okay, we have a shift here. This is an aspect that is so fascinating about Design;
this shifting that takes place, because we have the same personality. And if you look
in the global survey you'll see that 1/3s are about 13 or 14% of the population and
1/4s are about 2½ percent of the population. In other words, this is a much smaller
area of arc that emerges in the shifting because of the 88°. So you get what is
called a transitional profile. And transitional profiles are easy to recognize because
they are always harmonics.
A harmonic, 1 to the 4, 2 to the 5, 3 to the 6 are basic harmonies in Human Design.
So you're going to have transitional profiles that are based on 1/4s, 2/5s, 3/6s and
the other way around, 6/3s, 5/2s and 4/1s. In other words, harmonies always lead
to these transitional or bridging profiles. So from the 1/3 we go to the 1/4. And of
course, if you meet a 1/3 and a 1/4, they‘re both the same kind of design in the
sense that let's say that they're both Generators and this and that, their personalities
are very similar. They're both investigative personalities, but their bodies feel so
different. They physically feel different, because their costume has really changed.
After all, the personality is who you think you are. So, in order for you to have a
unique characterization you have to have a unique way of looking at yourself. This
defines you as different from somebody else. And this unique way of looking at
yourself, this is the personality, but the personality is within the vehicle. The vehicle
is the life. So though you have the same personalities here between the 1/3 and the
1/4, they have very different vehicles.
So instead of this 1/4 banging into things, it's not a 1/3, and having to deal with the
consequences and all of that stuff. This is not a 1/3; it's a 1/4. And the 4 is not a
lower trigram line. It‘s upper trigram. The upper trigram is fundamentally
transpersonal. That is, if you think about lines. Think about a gate that you have.
Let's say that we're talking about the 12th gate and you have the 1st, 2nd or 3rd line of

LECTURE NINE
Profiles: 1/3, 1/4, 1/4 and 2/5
the 12. Everything about the way in which that gate works is focused on itself, it‘s
focused on its 12-ness, if I can put it that way. But if you have the 12.4 or the 12.5
or the 12.6, you‘re much more interested in what's across the channel. You're
looking towards the 22.
This is what makes these lines transpersonal. The 4 is looking towards the other
side. And in that sense, the 4 is very different. It is about externalization. It isn't
about banging into things and struggling. The 1/4 is very fixed. There is a harmony
here, a harmony between what they investigate and what they externalize. And
what they want to externalize is what they investigate. They‘re very different. And
instead of being a martyr they‘re an opportunist—never leave a lover until you have
another lover; never leave your job until you have another job; don't move house
until you have
another place to go
to. This is the
opportunist. And
the opportunist is
rooted in
networking.
So when you're
looking at the 1/3,
you're looking at a
deeply self-
absorbed into-
their-own-process
investigator. And when you're looking at a 1/4, you‘re looking at somebody who's
looking for an opportunity to be able to externalize their personality, to be social, to
get it out to the other. It‘s very different. And of course, the unconscious is the
unconscious. You have no conscious access to it. People run around thinking their
personalities are really who they are, rather than who they think they are. It‘s quite
different. It really isn‘t who they think they are, it‘s simply who they think that are.
But who they all are is that thinking process within a life. And even though those
personalities are deeply, deeply similar to each other, you would never feel these
people the same way. You just wouldn't, because they're a different kind of
character. They carry a different value in terms of what happens when you meet
their aura. So the shifting that takes place underneath, the shifting at the
unconscious level is something that is a bridging process. Remember I described to
you how this is a spiral, the 1/3 to the 1/4, the 1/4 will then go to the 2/4, we have
this movement of information.
Transitional Profiles are Bridges
And these transitional profiles are the bridges. This is the bridge between the 1
personality on this side and the bridge to the 4 design on the other side; from the
1/3 to the 2/4 with this 1/4 in the middle bridging both ways. Because in fact when
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

145
THE FOUR VIEWS

we separate from just focusing on our individual presence obviously we are a species
and we are interconnected deeply to each other and the way general information
operates is that it moves through the spiraling of this process. These bridges are
intended to act in a certain way.
One of the most fascinating phenomena about the transitional profiles is that all
transitional profiles have the same personality color. It is something that is really
deeply, deeply significant. In other words, that there is a bond that exists through
all transitional profiles in terms of the way in which they're intended to be motivated.
And their motivation, which is intended to be innocence, is designed to emphasize
the fact that they are meant to be a neutral bridge, neither giving preference to the
1 or to the 4, like in this situation, but a neutral bridge that allows the movement of
the general information from one side to the other.
There are many, many levels of knowledge integrated into all this. At the basic level
we‘re just looking at a character construct, because that's what it is. In the early
years of theater it was the costumes that defined what a character was. You would
see somebody come out in a costume, the costume would be recognizable, and that
costume would give a role, whatever that role happened to be. It is something so
important to understand about profile is that profile is your costume. And it's
something that you grow into, literally, because not everybody wears it well. If
you're not-self your profile can end up being the burden in your life because it is
your characterization and your personality being not-self taking control of your life
means that there's incredible distortion that takes place.
Something to understand is that when you get to profile you‘re getting to something
that is suddenly very personal. This begins the real personal movement. You can't
escape it. Nobody can escape their profile. Even the not-self because it is such a
vast generic that has to operate within the constraints of their character. And of
course if you're not correct that becomes something very painful. Really; look out at
the world around us.
The 2/4
The 2/4 emerges out of the 1/4. So, you can see that not only do we get this
unconscious shift, but we also get the personality shift. In other words, we go from
the 1/3 to the 1/4, and then we go over the top to the personality and we continue
our spiraling process. But things change here. We know that we've got the same
body. Think about it this way, if you meet a 1/3 and a 1/4 you can tell right away
that they‘re very different from each other. If you meet a 1/4 and a 2/4 you‘re not
so sure. You have to wait until you deal with their personality, because their vehicle,
their physical presence, their physical feel is the same. It is the same 4, after all.
It's the same opportunist, it is the same need to externalize, but there's a big
difference here. And the big difference is that we have a totally different kind of
personality, day and night.

Remember that this is the basic binary, the 1-2, this is the foundation binary. They
are so different from each other, because the 1 looks into things, investigates,
studies, and goes into all of this stuff. The 2 will never do that. They can be
conditioned to do that. But, the 2 is a natural. These are the ones that actually
have a real gift. What‘s interesting about the 2 is that they don't necessarily know
it, nor do they necessarily understand it.
I had a friend of mine who was a musician; it was in the ‗80s. And being able to set
up all the technical equipment and everything else was an incredible thing to be able
to do. This was the kind of person that could just do it without even thinking—
hundreds of plugs to plug-in, and this and that. And I would watch this guy do that
and I was amazed because there was no thinking. You could just see it. You could
just watch him; he just knew where everything belonged and how to do everything
and how to get it.
One day I asked him to show me something. I have never been so apoplectic. Here
was somebody that can do these things with ease and there was absolutely no way
that he could explain what he was doing. This is very common in the 2—he was a 2
profile. There is a gift there. One of the ways in which we look at the hexagram is
that we see the hexagram as a two-storey building. You‘ve got your windows on the
first floor and your windows on the second floor. And if you think about it, the
foundation is the 1st line and the ceiling is the 3rd line and that window is the 2nd line.
Now, if you go further above, by the way, the floor of the next level is the 4, so there
is its harmony to the floor, to the foundation below. And then you have the window
above, which is the 5. And then finally, you have the roof, which is the 6. This is
the basic concept.
This window, this 2—imagine that it's night time and the lights are on and you're
walking along this street, you can look in and you can see inside, when in fact, this
person inside could not see you. You know what that's like, you‘re inside a room at
night and the window and the blinds are open, the lights are on, you can‘t see

outside, you only get the reflections in the glass, you don't see outside, but anybody
can see in. This is what this projection means. Anybody can look inside of the 2 and
say, hey, you could be really good at this, or whatever.
The Hermit Opportunist
So, it is something to understand how different the 2 is from the 1. But also to
recognize that after all this is right angle, this is about being self-absorbed. And
when you have the 2/4, the keynote theme of the 2 is the hermit. So we have the
hermit opportunist. And what we know about the 2 is that the 2 doesn't want to go
out into the world. As a matter of fact, if it didn't have a body it would never go
anywhere. I make the joke about people that have 2/4 children that don't fantasize
that one day they‘re going to leave home and you'll finally be able to have that nice
retirement. They don‘t
want to leave home.
You‘re more likely to die
and leave the house to
them, than they‘re going
to leave home. This is the
hermit.
The whole thing to
recognize about the
hermit is that this hermit
opportunist is always
waiting for an opportunity.
And it‘s that opportunity that can transform their life. And of course, that again
leads us back to something very basic that is so obvious in Human Design, over and
over again, that in order to be able to recognize the right opportunity, in order to be
able to then do something with that, they have to be able to make a decision that's
correct and that correct decision making is going to be rooted in their Type and their
strategy and their inner authority.
In other words, we‘re really looking at two things when we're talking about the first
three views that we've looked at and this particular view. In other words, here what
we‘re looking at is the character that is going to act out their decision making in a
specific way. In other words, that the Type, the strategy, the inner authority, is
simply the way in which this particular character needs to make correct decisions in
their life.
So we have two very separate things. One is about decision making—strategy,
authority—this is about decision making. This isn't. This is about who is making the
decision, not the decision, but that character that is going to make that decision. It's
these characterizations what makes the Sun/Earth, what makes profile, what makes
incarnation cross so fascinating because finally you get to see all of the potential
characterizations.

I‘m a great fan of Shakespeare, the Bard, and I indulge in updating his all-the-world-
is-a-stage to it‘s all a movie, because for me it's very clear that it's so absolutely
true. And within this metaphor of the movie, you have to see that the program
simply provides us with the characterization modules. That‘s what this is. These are
characterizations. These are different kinds of characters to populate the spectrum.
Now, we know that these characterizations go much deeper. They do. After all, I‘m
only dealing with a pure generic. We're not talking about the designs and we're not
talking about what goes much deeper than that. That is, the substructure and all of
these things that ultimately leads to the true differentiation of the being. Here we
are still very, very much on the surface. And on the surface what we're getting here
is that we‘re getting this basic generic, this basic profile. We‘re not connecting it yet
to gate and turning it into what is a much more refined characterization. That‘s why
it fits everybody. It is something really to understand about profile, is that it fits
everybody, because it‘s such a loose suit, if I can put it that way, as a costume.
Anybody can get into it. It doesn‘t mean it fits you well, but everybody can see it.
In other words, the moment you understand your profile is the moment that you see
it. You see that this is you. I cannot escape the fact that my basic character
platform is being a 5/1. There is absolutely nothing one can do about. It is just a
framework. It's the nuance of that that makes a difference.
Correct Decision Making
So here when we're dealing with somebody who is a 2/4, this hermit opportunist
where everything in the life is about to call, the 2nd line is about receiving the call,
how important it is that this character is not separate from its decision making
authority. Think about it, because what we're looking at here is that we're looking at
the competition to the truth. Because the moment that we're talking about
personality, we are talking about who you think you are. And we‘re talking about
the personality that as not-self will make all the decisions in the life. And of course,
this is where the enormous problem is.
And you can see why in this view that in fact they are different, that definition and
Strategy and Authority are of the BodyGraph, and to really see that they represent
that potential for that holistic vehicle to operate correctly, for that life to operate
correctly. But separate from that in the database, not in the BodyGraph
configuration, is this characterization rooted in a personality that is going to
dominate it. And that personality is going to take the reins of the life and make
decisions. And it's going to be separate from what is its inherent truth that is there
in those three views that are rooted in the BodyGraph.
This is our dilemma. Here you get to see a way to understand the separation that
exists between characterization, who you think you are and the decisions you make,
and in fact, what is correct for you. And if you live out your process as a 2/4 and
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

149
THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
you are not-self you will still be recognizable as a 2/4. You would recognize it
yourself if it was explained to you, but it doesn't mean that it works to your
advantage. It doesn't mean that you're living out its potential; you‘re simply, as a
character, limited by its framework. The dysfunctional 2/4 is a dysfunctional 2/4 like
anything else.
If you don't operate according to your Strategy and Authority, if your personality is
making decisions, you‘re really in trouble. As long as your mind is making decisions
for you in this life things are simply not going to work. One of the basic things to
understand about the construct is that because the vehicle literally is the life that it's
about the potential of the personality to be able to absorb the experience of life. Not
about dictating its direction.
And again, you can see that there is tremendous pressure here on the 2/4 that that
projection leads to a demand to externalize. Go on, dear; show everybody how well
you do that thing, whatever it is. I think you're going to be terrific. Why don‘t you
try this job? Only that it turns out to be an absolute disaster because just because
somebody projects on you that they think that they think that they see something
doesn't mean that that's correct for you. And if it's your mind making the decision,
and you happen to like that person or the message of what they think that you could
achieve if you go with them and do their thing and off you go, and it doesn't work, it
is very painful. And what happens when it doesn't work is that the 2 wants to be
more and more isolated limiting the amount of opportunism that arises for them
because their vehicle needs social interaction.
Again, if you don't operate correctly according to your Strategy and Authority,
whatever it is that you are is going to be distorted. It just is. And the basic
characterization, instead of giving you that possibility of really getting that really
great opportunity, the opportunity that you deserve, you answer the call to all kinds
of things that are wrong for you and it ends up being deeply painful. And that 4 in
you, the abdicator, and the fatigue simply begins to break down and give up. There
are so many 2/4s that never come out anymore, because all those failed calls, all
those things that didn't work out. And in that, their gift is never fully realized.
So profile represents a deep challenge to us. That is, it challenges us in the sense
that because it is the design characterization and because our personalities, this is
who we think we are, and because the not-self operates through personality
dominance that your profile is actually something, in terms of not-self, that gets in
the way of your life, if you understand what I mean. In other words, the profile sets
up your personality. This is what the program wants. The program wants you to be
not-self, so you‘re set up in which the personality becomes the authority. This is
who I am. I‘m the hermit, democrat, this is me. And of course that's all very nice
and good, it is a vast generalization, but it's all going to go downhill the moment that
you're not making decisions correctly, the moment that the profile is ignoring the
key, which is the strategy.

The 2/5
As we continue this process with our 2/4 now, we just had a jump on the personality
side so the next jump is again going to go to the design side and again were going to
be moving into a bridging or a transitional profile. And that brings us to the 2/5.
And again, you can see the harmony—the 2 and the 5. Again the same thing,
whenever there is a shift at the unconscious level this is where you get a difference.
You don‘t get a difference when you're switching at the personality level. The 2/4
and the 2/5 have the same personalities. They have the same kinds of ways in
which they can potentially think of themselves. And the way in which they're going
to frame the way they think of themselves as a character is very, very much the
same.
However, that is what's going on inside. It‘s not what they are. The vehicle is the
life. And there is a big difference between a 4 vehicle and a 5 vehicle. There's a big
difference, because the moment that you step into the 5 you step into the true
transpersonal. And of course, the moment that you step into this 5 you step into a
heretical body. And of course, the heretic gets tremendous projection. Remember
our little construct here of the house with the upper windows and the lower windows.
Well, if you‘re a 2 the lights are on and everybody is looking in. But if you‘re a 5, the
lights are off, and you're looking out and nobody can see in. It‘s very different. So,
imagine what that‘s like as a combination for somebody. And the thing about the 5
is everybody projects on the 5, that the 5 can be the best of this and that, and the
other. The great dilemma for the 5 is dealing with the projection field. And here we
have double projection.
We have a personality that it's projected on and we have a vehicle, a body that is
projected on, and the body, because it represents the way in which the person is

going to be received or felt, this body brings all kinds of projection. Wow, you‘re
going to be a great business partner, you‘re going to be a great lover, you're going
be my best friend, let me call you to that. And of course, what's interesting about
the 2/5 is that the 2/5 kind of pulls you in and pushes you away. It is a hermit. And
yet, at the same time as a hermit, it attracts additional projection. It can be very
difficult for 2/5s, all the projection that they receive.
The Role We Play
We have roles that we play. Every single one of the attributes that are here in the
data that you see are all derived from role gates. Again, a great course in Channel
88, The 36 Roles, to go through and see all the roles and to understand that these
are roles that become a part of what your character is, this hermit heretic, it's a role.
We know that from films, we know that we're always looking for certain characters
because we understand the generic, the good guys, the bad guys, the ―this‖ and the
―that,‖ whatever,
these are roles. This
is how you build the
character. You build
the character through
adding to this depth.
So, we've got a
hermit heretic, we‘ve
got the democratic
general, we have the
bigoted savior. This
is a character that
has depth and
dimension to it, and we are within the construct, we‘re controlled by the limitation of
what our profile is. We cannot escape it. I cannot escape being a heretic. And if
you don't believe that, come to my juxtaposition class next month. I mean, I cannot
escape being a heretic. There's nothing I can do, nothing. Sometimes I think it
would be a good idea, but it is the role and it is part of what my character is. And if
I am correct, which means my personality doesn't interfere with all of this, that role,
that character is going to be fleshed out and what it is going to finally get to see, as
a being, the possibility of fulfilling one's purpose, because the role points you
towards your purpose.
I‘m a 5/1 Clarion. When you add the cross to the profile you begin to define more
clearly what the specific character is here for. And again, there is incredible
refinement in that in terms of the nuances. There are probably 50 or 60 million
Clarions in the world. It‘s not like there are only a few of us, it's still a generic. I
don‘t know how many of them are 5/1 Clarions, I would assume that out of that
maybe 3 or 4 million are 5/1 Clarions like me. And how many of them are
Manifestors? Maybe 4 or 500,000 are 5/1 Clarion Manifestors. Again you have to

see these are still generic roles until we can operate purely so that the underlying
differentiation is us.
Differentiation doesn't emerge until you are correct. It‘s one of the most important
things to understand. It can't really emerge until you are correct. Oh, yes, you get
a generic differentiation. In other words, you‘re a 2/5 Manifestor, whatever the case
may be. But to differentiate you need to gain access to the information that is
literally below the line.
When you're not operating correctly, that is, when you're operating as not-self you
have no real contact to what is your true color and tone. Color and tone literally are
the key to the differentiation of you within this larger construct. In other words,
somebody like me as a 5/1 Manifestor, that it is only in my correctness that I gain
access to those unique imprints in me that can be realized on the surface out of my
correctness that refines my 5/1 Clarion into something that ultimately becomes a
unique representation, that becomes Ra Uru Hu, that becomes something that's
quite specific.
Everybody has this, but you have to get there. You cannot get to your underlying
motivation or determination until you're correct. And so this is one of the things to
grasp about what we're looking at when we're looking at profile or incarnation cross.
A lot of people get really excited about their incarnation cross. For me it's just a
broader generic. That‘s all it can be. It is very clear to me that out of these millions
and millions and millions of Clarions all that means is that we‘re a type, we‘re a kind.
But it isn‘t in and of itself uniqueness at all. It‘s moving towards it. And it is
something for everyone to grasp who is involved in, particularly in the early stages of
experimenting in Human Design and beginning to live correctly as yourself.
Seven Years to Decondition
This is a long process. It takes seven years to decondition. It takes seven years to
clean out all that old conditioning. And it means it is going to take that amount of
time before the cumulative benefit of what you're doing with your life begins to add
these layers and layers and layers of nuance to what is your direction and opens up
this potential for you. And again, it's very important to see. Somebody says, I'm a
2/4, whatever, yeah, terrific, but that's sort of like saying I'm an Aries. So what?
There's got to be at least 600 million other Arians on the planet. It doesn't really
mean anything other than yes, it gives you a framework.
So, I want you to be able to approach profile correctly. It is something that needs to
be respected, because when you're not correct it works against you. It‘s also to be
seen that this is the beginning of you being yourself by getting to live out the purity
of what that profile is; and again, only in being able to do so by operating correctly.
It is that process of operating correctly that releases the color and tonal qualities
that truly define you as unique, that bring your orientation from as deep down as the
base level that integrates you into what is a very, very, very unique you.

So here we have the platform of the beginning of it. It‘s sort of like the way in which
you slowly but surely break down a huge group of people into different parts. It's
breaking them down into different groupings and slowly refining and refining and
refining until you have beings who stand alone correctly in their own authority. Then
there's no point in saying they‘re ―this‖ or ―that,‖ you'd have to read off their own
genetic code, because they‘re just simply unique. They are, whatever it is that they
are.
So for those of you that particularly are new, the real key in profile to begin with is
lines. Dig into the lines. I've used this particular PowerPoint for the last 12 years.
There is a lot of wonderful keynoting in here, so it's very helpful to give you a nice
little overview to work with. But, this is really the place to begin your work.
Understand the lines; begin to really see the dynamic of this spiraling of the profile.
But most of all see it for what it really is. Don't exalt it, because it doesn't deserve
exaltation. In other words, this is the very beginning, this is the first step in a
platform of being able to express your uniqueness and there is an awful lot of work
down the road to get the profile finally to resonate as it was intended to.
Well folks it‘s nice to share it with you. It‘s nice to share my morning coffee with
you. To all of you, take care. Until next time, bye for now.

Profiles: The 3/5, 3/6, 4/6 and 4/1
Good morning to all of you. Here we are in profile and we're going to continue our
little journey in looking at the basics of profile.
The 3rd Line Theme
So, let's get into our journey. We begin here with the transition obviously to the
personality; the last profile we looked at last time was the 2/5. In the shift of the
personality we shift to something that is often very, very difficult from the
personality perspective to deal with. That is, the 3rd line theme. It is categorized,
because all of the profiles, the lines themselves, the names that we give to them, are
all derived from the 10th gate, the 10th gate of behavior.

One of the things about genetic continuity and one of the things to really understand
in Design is that, for example, if you take the various role gates—we have roles of
the self, so we have the 7th gate and the 1st gate and the 13th gate and the 10th gate,
these are roles of the Self. We have genetic roles in the 59th gate and the 27th gate.
If you take those gates and you just look at their lines, that is, look at all the 1st
lines, look at all the 2nd lines, basically what you're looking at here in terms of what
you see in this categorization, in other words, behavioral identity is from the 10th
gate. And this projected attitude is from the 7th gate and limited perspective is from
the 13th gate and the
aspired role is from
the 1st gate. And
again it goes through
all of the various role
gates, the sexual
gates, the 59 and the
27, and then the
actual wave of it all.
So you're looking at
basically role gates.
This is how we
develop our
understanding of
lines. For any of you
that are new to the
knowledge, which
half of this class is,
it's very important to understand that to grasp the meaning of a line, if you really
want to know what a 3rd line is, read all the 3rd lines, all 64 of them and you will
begin to grasp what the 3rd line is. And the fact of the matter is that even though
your 3rd line is in whatever—gate number 2—it doesn't really matter in a sense. That
is, that 3rd line carries with it values from every single other position of that 3rd line
because it's a 3rd line. It is a personality framework in which the personality is
operating. It is a generic.
And when we're looking at the 3rd line what we're basically looking at, what you
really get to see in the bonding strategy and the security strategy are these bonds
made and broken. That is, the trial and error process that is inherent in being a 3rd
line personality. If you have a 3rd line personality it means it is natural for you not to
make mistakes which is normally the way in which it is themed, but it is natural for
you to discover what doesn't work. This is the great gift of the 3rd line. The great
gift of the 3rd line is that inherently it is ready to unmask anything that's flawed. It's
why it's so deeply associated with sciences, as an example. The 3/5 has a strong
association with scientific thought. The 3rd line that is ready to discover what doesn't
work, which often leads to new discoveries, and a 5th line unconscious, which is a
universalizing quality, the ability to universalize the discovery that is there in the 3rd
line potential, being able to universalize it to others.

The Not-Self 3rd Line
But the scientific value of the 3rd line is something important. And I say scientific
simply in the sense that it does not accept things at face value. Third lines do not.
They will kick the tires and they'll check things out and they'll look to see where the
flaw is, where the error is, where the loophole is, where the trick is. In other words,
it is a real gift in that sense. Unfortunately, the way in which it operates within the
not-self is totally different. Within the not-self having a 3rd line personality means
that you have a not-
self mind that is
going to make
mistakes. You‘ve
got a not-self mind
that is going to
blunder. You‘ve got
a not-self mind that
is going to go
through trial and
error in things that
are not correct for it
to be involved in.
And of course this is
where the great
dilemma comes in
for the 3rd line being.
This is why you end
up with this dark label of the martyr, the suffering that is inherent in the 3rd line that
is not-self. I think one of the great transitions that takes place in Design is
particularly related to 3rd line beings in the sense that there's a great burden that is
lifted from them when they begin to understand the dynamics of this kind of
personality, the kind of personality that is capable of incredible adaptation to
circumstances and the environment or whatever the case may be. This is the beauty
of the 3rd line.
It is also deeply material. If you have a 3rd line personality it really means that if
you're struggling on the material plane that life is going to be very difficult for you,
more difficult than somebody else who isn‘t a 3rd line who struggles on the material
plane, because it has such a deep material value to it. I think in the very first Ibiza
event I did a course about money. I did all the 64 third lines. I think it‘s available
from Human Design UK actually as a recording or film or something. I know it‘s
available there.
It was an incredible journey just to look at the material values of all 64 third lines,
because the 3rd line is the line that is most deeply, deeply connected to the material
plane. It‘s why it‘s so good at discovery. It's good at discovering things in the real
world. Unfortunately, the dilemma for the 3rd line is that without cognition that is
correct they do not know what to challenge, what to bump into. They don't know

how to deal with the dilemma of things not working the way in which conditioning
and propaganda suggest that they're going to work.
A very interesting process for me—all aspects that I have mentally are all 3rd line.
I‘m a 43/23 through the 3rd line and I have the 4.3, so I have this very, very strong
3rd line mind. And my sons are both 1/3s. One of the most rewarding things about
being aware of the knowledge is to be able to guide my sons into seeing their gift in
terms of having the 3rd line. Again, it‘s different because it‘s unconscious. But the
gift of having the 3rd line is that when things don‘t work, this is not a failure, this is a
triumph. It‘s very different. And of course, it is very easy to turn it in the right
direction. That is, it is a triumph; it is a triumph of discovery. It may be annoying.
It may be frustrating, but in fact it is a victory, because there is no point being
involved in something that's a lie, that doesn't work, that is false, and so forth and
so on.
One of my great concerns, those of you that have followed my work over the years
know that I put an enormous stress on the fact that the dysfunction in the 3rd line
has led to a civilization in which we do not learn from our mistakes, because they are
not being properly publicized. A product that is suddenly released and becomes a
fad, and so forth and so on, what we end up with is endless amounts of hyperbole
and praise, and only if it is really, really drastic do we get the negatives. And all of
these things have their negatives, all of these things have their problems,
particularly when you talk about all these technological things that they release that
there is always something.
I'm amazed by, for example, of the phenomenon of the iPhone. You must know
what this is because there has been all this hoopla. This is an Apple creation. It‘s a
kind of multifunctional telephone, computer, iPod, everything. And it's a wonderful
piece of imaginative technology. But one of the things that always has disturbed me
about the technological age is where do all the old computers go. I have a house full
of old computers that on this island here I can't take it to a garbage disposal area,
because I know damn well they‘ll just throw it in the ground or something. The
toxins that are there; they are only now letting people know the level of pollutants
and the toxins that are in these iPhones. They sold one million in the first month and
next year you're going to have 10 million that are going to be thrown out for some
new additional whatever.
If we don't have 3rd line beings, we have nobody that lets us know about that. This
is really what it's all about. It‘s like you‘re a 3rd line being and you get something
that is supposed to make you smarter, faster, whatever the case may be, and you
try it and it doesn't work, who do you blame? Yourself. You don‘t blame the thing,
because you're conditioned to believe that you make mistakes, that you fail, that
you‘re flawed, that you‘re the martyr. If you're raised correctly or if you go through
a process as an adult where you begin to operate correctly, begin to understand
what this is, you have a totally different power in this life. It‘s a totally different
power.
It‘s the power to say, hey, don't tell me that this thing is what you say it is because
it isn't. It isn't. And it's only when those voices are raised that the con artists, the

hustles, all of the horrendous wool that‘s pulled over humanity‘s eyes can be
corrected. Without the 3rd line we have nobody to stand up and take the heat.
That's what a martyr is. You stand up and say, this is not true. And instead of
suffering yourself and putting all the blame on yourself, you‘re finally operating
correctly.
The 3/5
Now here at the unconscious level, we have the 5. And that means that there is
going to be unconscious projection on this person. And this is why the 3/5 is so
difficult. Remember about the 5, because it is a universalizing function, because in a
way it closes the potential of the hexagram, because the 6 is quite different that
when you're looking at the 5 even when you look at the 5 traditionally in the I‘Ching,
as an example, you will see that all 5th lines are exalted. In other words, the 5
carries with it the most positive of projections, that universalizing projection, that
you're going to be the general, that you‘re going to be the savior, that you're going
to be the one that's going to be able to make a difference.
Now, it doesn't mean that because you have the 5 that you will, unfortunately, it
doesn't. And because it's unconscious and you have no conscious access to it, the 3
personality is unaware of the fact that everybody is projecting on them that they're
going to be terrific. Now think about the disaster that that leads to because you're a
3; so, that person on the outside is going to project on you that you're going to be
the perfect friend or the perfect partner or the perfect lover or you're going to be
able to do that job better than anybody else or you‘re going to be able to do this or
that or whatever it is. And of course, you‘re a 3.
And if anything is going to go wrong it will, because if anything is in it that doesn't
really work you‘re bound to discover it, which on the outside can look like you're not
doing well. And if you are a 5 and you mess up in any way because it's so set up, so

high up that it's going to be so perfect, that any mistake you just fall. It‘s my
standing joke; I‘m a 5/1. The moment that I came out of the womb and did
something that was disturbing at any moment, I stopped being a perfect baby. And
I would never again be that perfect baby, because that's just the way that it works.
1So you have to really understand that the dilemma of the 3/5 is that they‘re being
projected on that everything is going work and they're designed to find what doesn't.
So they end up suffering, the martyr heretic. And one of the things about 3/5s is
that in most cases the way in which they deal with it, is that they run away, because
if you're a 5 what happens to you is that your reputation is what gets impacted by
anything, any projection you fail to live up to. And so in that sense, they can't live in
the communities they‘ve been a part of or the families that they‘ve been a part of or
the job they‘ve
been a part of
because they
simply have lost
their reputation
and they're well
aware of it.
And it was one of
the anomalies
when I first began
to do actual
readings long
before I started
my professional
work in ‘92 here on the island. And as part of my research at the very beginning of
my career, everyone who came to me, I kept a record of all the Ibiza island outsiders
because we were all foreigners who had come here for one reason or another. The
majority of the locals that I knew, the foreigners who had left their homes and
countries, were 3/5s. It was so distorted. After all, the 3/5 in terms of the global
survey, like all the major profiles it‘s around 14½ percent of the population and here
on my little black sheep island they were over 50%. This is what happens to 3/5s, it
happens to them all the time.
So, understand this dynamic. And the only way that this can be remedied is the way
in which this person understands their nature. Profile is our character. Once we are
given an insight into that character it allows us to begin to relax into our skin and to
accept what it is that we are; finding these flaws, finding the problems, seeing the
problems. This is one of the things that is so difficult for 3s in relationships, because
they're not going to be fooled for long. It‘s just the way that it works. It's their job
to see what doesn't work, and they're going to see what doesn't work in a
relationship faster than anybody else, which is why their sexual and human theme is
bonds made and broken, because they see what doesn't work.
Unfortunately, when it comes to relationships other than if you bring two awake
people together who are truly aligned to each other you're always going to find the
flaws in the relationship. By the way, because you find them doesn't mean you have

to leave them, because the nice thing about bonds made and broken is that when
you're correct, it becomes bonds made and broken, made and broken, made and
broken, made and broken. In other words, you can keep the same relationship
forever as long as you have space, as long as you have distance. Within the Human
Design context that is your own room, your own bed to sleep in and wake up in.
Transitional Profiles
We have a shift and we have the unconscious shift, our spiraling outward into our
transitional profile. And again transitional profiles have a unique task not in a
personal sense but in the larger sense of the way in which the dynamics of being
human is programmed, that these bridging profiles are all intended to operate in a
uniform way despite the fact that they are different from each other. In other
words, if you take the 1/4 and the 2/5 and the 3/6, if you take 4/1, the 5/2, the 6/3,
in other words, you are looking at the harmonic transitional profiles, the thing that's
so extraordinary about all of them is that they all have the same color.
In other words, they are unified in their motivation. And unified in their motivation
both in the true sense, they are designed to be motivated by the 6th color; however,
we well know that the vast majority of humanity does not operate correctly so one of
the things that is a dilemma for us in the way in which humanity as a whole operates
is that these bridges no longer have innocence to them. In other words, they are no
longer innocent conduits between this and that, between the two full profiles on
either side. They no longer have what they were intended to have which is the
capacity to without prejudice move information from one side to the other.
And because it's in transition, rather than being motivated by the 6th color and
innocence, they are motivated by desire. This is called the dumb desire, dumb in the
sense that it is not connected to its cognitive source, because obviously these people
are not-self and they‘re operating out of the not-self mind, which means that these
bridges and the way in which they link up humanity is distorted by their desire and it
means that their desire tends to create prejudices in terms of the way in which
information is moved. It is probably why humanity as a whole has great difficulty
coming to some kind of unified principles, particularly unified principles at the higher
levels of consciousness.
The 3/6
Anyway, let's take a look. We have the same personality, but the game has
changed. The game is changed because we've got a 6 at the unconscious level, so
we've got a 6th line profile. The moment we have a 6th line profile, we know that we
are dealing with a mutated form. Remember that the 3/6, the 4/6, the 6/2, and the
6/3 are the four mutative profiles. In other words, they‘re basically carrying the
mutative process necessary for us to move into what is the Uranian cycle.

THE FOUR VIEWS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
Everyone who carries the 6th line is really carrying this new life dynamic energy. And
because we no longer are being conditioned by what is basically a 29 or 30 year
cycle, we are now being conditioned by an 84 year cycle. And there is no way in this
grand 84 year cycle that that is one simple stream, it is not. What we see is that it
is a cycle that is divided into three parts. What we call the 3rd line phase, that is, in
the Saturn era in the first 29 or 30 years the 6th line lives out a kind of 3rd line
process. And then we have the roof stage that lasts from approximately 30 until 50
years of age. And then at the Kiron return, we have the off-the-roof stage.
The Tripartite Life Process
So, basically what we have is life now divided into three cycles. Now, by the way, if
you're not a 6th line being doesn't mean that you are not influenced by this tripartite
life process. You are. It is secondary in the sense that we all experience it because
we‘re all in the neutrino ocean and we‘re all being influenced and conditioned by all
these 6th line beings because they are actually carrying the markers. It was clear to
me as an example—my Kiron return was a classic what I would teach of what the
Kiron return brings in terms of this final stage, the flowering stage, the coming-off-
the-roof stage. It is a fact that in this new cycle it takes until we're 51 years of age
for us to really have the tools that we need in order to fulfill our potential on this
plane.
But let's get back to the specifics of this 3/6. The first thing to recognize is this first
stage. By the way, I have a lovely way in which I always imagine the 6th line being
and it has to do with the kangaroo, odd creature that it is. When the kangaroo starts
its life, it starts its life as a very, very tiny little wormlike creature. And that little
wormlike creature goes through an incredible ordeal of crawling out of the womb and
slowly working its way up until it finally gets inside the pouch. And then it spends

the roof period as what is called a joey. That is, as a little kangaroo sitting in the
pouch of its mother. And then finally, it's out in the world.
Now, what is interesting about this process is that in essence, this really parallels
what this tripartite life process is all about. If you're a 6th line being, you're not
actually, and take what I'm about to say very, very, very carefully, you're not
actually born yet. You
don't actually take on
your nature until you get
beyond the Saturn. You
don't.
This is why so many
beings with a 6th line
profile have so many
problems in their first 30
years because they are
not a fully formed being
yet. So, when you're
dealing with a 3/6 that not-fully-formed is something that has to do with the form
itself, has to do with the body itself. There is a fundamental immaturity physically
that isn't going to be ready to take on its full physical potential until it gets to the
roof stage. And what you end up with is somebody who is living a kind of 3/3 for
nearly 30 years. This is something that is chaotic.
Now, what's interesting for me is that I think that with the unconscious 6 as opposed
to personality 6s that the 3/3 phase is usually damaging to the body rather than to
the psyche. I say that because the personality is a 3, it's not a false three, in that
sense. Next week when we look at the left angle you really get to see that in the 6/2
and the 6/3, it‘s a personality trait, it‘s very different. This is in the body. The 3/6,
the 4/6, this is in the body. It is my concern that there's physical damage that's
done. And in most cases that physical damage, the healing can only take place
when we get to the roof stage, when the body finally is fully mature.
And so it is really something to keep in mind when you have children that are a 3/6
that is not so much a concern for whether their personality can handle the trial and
error of life, it can, and obviously as I mentioned before, if it is given proper
guidance, if it understands its gift, it would be a very strong 3rd line personality. But
that the concern for me is physically. I've talked about this a lot in terms of the 6th
line profile, its vulnerability in the Saturnian stage to disease, to all kinds of
problems, but it really is divided into two parts.
One is the psychological problems, so you get people, as an example 6/2s or 6/3s
who have psychological breakdowns in their first 30 years or, that their psychological
dilemmas lead to drug or alcohol abuse or all kinds of things. Whereas, when you're
dealing with a 3/6 or a 4/6 you're actually dealing with something that impacts
negatively the physical body and may not even reveal itself until the roof stage, but
there is damage that is being done. Now in the 3/6 it is more likely to show up
physically in the first stage. In the 4/6 it's different. That is, in the 4/6 it is more

likely to show up on the roof and 4/6s traditionally take longer to settle on the roof
than 3/6s.
When you look at all these things, I have been doing this for so long and you look at
all the various aspects in the way in which things work and you know the not-self is
trapped in such an ordeal. You know what parent is there, other than this new
generation of conscious nine-centered beings involved in Design, their children are
enormously fortunate in that sense. But the vast majority of humanity, these beings
are going to have a really rough time. And the fact is that because they don't
operate correctly, they can do lasting damage to their body that lasts well beyond
that first stage and their vulnerability, in that sense.
So, one of the things to keep in mind about wherever you see the presence of the 6,
because we‘re only really beginning to look at that now, to begin to understand how
important it is to get to that correctness, because the correctness is the only thing
that is going to be healing, in that sense.
The 4/6
This brings us to the close of the right angle profiles. And in coming to the close of
the right angles we come to the harmonic mirror of where we began. We began with
the 1/3. And of course, the 1 is a harmony to the 4, and the 3 is a harmony to a 6.
And the 1/3 that begins the right angle is the only profile that is rooted in the lower
trigram, and the 4/6 that ends the right angle is the only profile that is rooted
exclusively in the upper trigram. So they are true mirrors to each other, part of
what is the elegant symmetry that is there just about everywhere you want to look
in Human Design. But this one is a particularly pretty one, this movement from the
beginning to the end of the right angle process, from the totally self-absorbed to the
totally transpersonally absorbed.

LECTURE TEN
Profiles: 3/5, 3/6, 4/6 and 4/1
We have moved into a new personality configuration. That is, we've moved to the 4.
And of course, given its behavioral identity, it's the behavioral identity that gives it
its name; this is the opportunist, an opportunistic personality. Something to
understand about the 4, the 4 has an unusual gift, after all. They are right angle and
self-absorbed, and yet they're very aware of the other and the importance of the
other to them. After all, they‘re still self-absorbed, they‘re still right angle, it's still
personal destiny. This is not transpersonal, this is personal destiny.
So, when you're looking at the 4, you have to see that their opportunism is all about
their ability to connect to the right other. It's all about the other for them. It's
about thinking about lines, if you have the 1, 2, or 3 in a gate, they‘re only focused
on the gate. The moment you have a 4th line in a gate, it‘s more interested in what's
on the other side of the channel. It is more excited by the possibility of the
conditioning than the 1, 2 or 3. For the 1, 2 or 3, when the conditioning happens it‘s
always surprised. Oops, there's something there. You have a 3 in a gate and
suddenly there's
something at the other
end of the channel and
it‘s like, this banged into
me. There is this, oops,
here it is.
With the 4 you know it‘s
there and you‘re looking
for it. And of course,
there are many laws that
we have for the 4—don‘t
leave a lover until you
have another lover, don't leave a job until you have another job, don't do anything
until you have a replacement. And the other thing is that who is in your life is the
most important thing for you. And yet, you have to see that because the 4 is self-
absorbed it is not truly designed to be transpersonal, though it needs the connection
with the other that working at this can be deeply exhausting. It's why in the limited
perspective we see the fatigue. And of course, fatigue, burnout, are themes that are
rooted in the nature of the 4th line; exhaustion. And one of my warnings to 4th line
beings always, because the 4/6 is the classic 4th line being, it is the voyeur, it is the
voyeur personality, it‘s somebody that can be invited to the party, but sits at the
outside ring and watches everything that's going on, on the inside.
And everything about the success of the 4 is rooted in who it knows. If you‘re a 4/6
and you know two people, that's the limit of your opportunities. And if those two
people can‘t provide you with any opportunities, you have a life without them; not a
pleasant one either. In other words, the expansion of the network is something
that's very important to the 4, but the quality of the network is even more
important. The not-self 4/6 wastes an enormous amount of energy trying to
maintain relationships with people that will never give them anything in return,
because they can't tell who to invest in. It is only when they‘re operating correctly—
Strategy and Authority—that there is this possibility for the 4 to actually recognize
who to invest in.

And I don't mean to make it sound so cold and calculating, because after all, it isn't,
it‘s simply their nature. But it is an investment, because they have to spend their
personal energy on trying to maintain transpersonal relationships for their own
benefit. It‘s a lot of work. So it becomes a problem if you invest, put your energy
into the wrong beings. That leads to fatigue, exhaustion, burnout, corruption, the
whole thing falls apart—abdicator.
And obviously we're dealing with a 6th line unconscious. And in dealing with a 6th line
unconscious, again the 4/6 is a mutative profile and we know that it is going to begin
its process with, theoretically speaking, being a 4/3, its first 29, 30 years. Now, one
of the great dilemmas and one of the great warnings that I give about 4/6s when
they're young is that in their first 30 years it's the wrong friendships that destroy
them. And it's usually their bodies that get destroyed. So, you‘re a 4/6 and you're
17 years old and you go out with some friends in a car and everybody's drunk or
stoned and it hits a tree and you‘re a dead dog. You‘re a 4/3 and you make friends
with somebody that gets you into trouble; it goes on and on and on.
It is one of those things where the wrong associations are going to end up having a
disproportionately negative impact on your vehicle, on your body, whether you end
up with physical bad habits, physical diseases. All kinds of things that are possible.
And those are the kinds of things that come through the relationship. In other
words, they‘re brought to you. So you choose the wrong partner and you end up
with a sexually transmitted disease, and on and on and on. In other words, the 4/6
in its first 30 years is really at risk in terms of who it associates with, because here is
where there is a threat to their vehicle, to their body, and ultimately in that sense to
their life.
The Transition from the 3 to the 6
It is a very easy thing, in a sense, you can't see it in the 3/6s or the 6/3s, but you
can certainly see it in the 4/6s and the 6/2s, and that is that there is a transition that
takes place when one goes from the 3 to the 6. That transition is a transition from
pessimism to optimism. Now, obviously, that is not something that is going to
change in a moment. It doesn't. In the same way that I describe the metamorphic
process of the kangaroo and the way that works is to understand something about
what it is to move from being this 4/3 to this 4/6 when you get to the roof stage.
Everybody thinks that there is a line drawn in the sand here, this line that says let's
call it the 30 because it's an easier number to deal with, everybody thinks there is a
line in the sand. Okay, you've got a 6th line profile, you‘re 30 years old, and you‘re
on the roof. When you meet a 4/6 or a 6/2 and they‘re 35 years old and you have a
conversation with them and the pessimism that's coming out of them makes you
uncomfortable, you know they're not on the roof yet, because they‘re not.
This is not a line drawn in the sand. It is a natural movement. As a matter of fact,
that movement from the first stage to going on the roof is going to take, you

guessed it, a seven-year process. It starts when you‘re 26 or 27 and starts leading
in, and about the time you‘re 32, 33, 34 the roof begins to settle in, you begin to
lose this pessimism about life, you begin to see that things could be more positive
for you, that's the transition.
And when you're dealing with it from the unconscious level also see that there is a
difference in the frequency of the body. If you're a 3rd line, the 3rd line, because it's
always dealing with crashing into things, it is deeply resilient and there is a lot of
tension in that particular body. It‘s very different to leaving it behind for the 6. And
again you grow into that, the calming down of the vehicle, if you will. But you can
already see by what I‘ve described how incredibly difficult it is if you do not have the
knowledge to be able to even see a way out. Think about all these people on the
planet who are 4/6s. This is 14 ½ percent of the population. So we're talking about
a billion people. It's a number that is just hard to imagine, alone anything else; a
billion 4/6s on the planet, talk about a generic.
When you think about that you have to think about those billion who go through that
early part of their life, that billion that are going to have the wrong associations in
that early part of their life, and what it is going to do to their bodies and what it is
going to do to their future. All of that leads to dilemmas on the planet; it leads to
the physical body of humanity being susceptible to disease.
What I mean by that is if you go into the Third World and you go into the hundreds
of millions of 4/6s that are going to be in the Third World, the 3/6s, the 4/6s,
hundreds of millions of them that are going to be the most susceptible to all of the
diseases, the malaria, all of these things that strike as a kind of complex thing that

hits so many beings. Well, this is the homogenization vulnerability system at work.
It's the way the program controls the population, something like that.
Anyway, it really is something to understand the vulnerability that is there
physically. And again it's different. For the 3/6 it‘s not about their associations. It
is about what they challenge as a 3/6. For the 4/6 it is really about the other, and
their physical problems, their physical dilemmas are things that are going to come
from their relationships with the wrong other and they get put at risk.
The ideal here is very beautiful, the opportunistic role model. It is somebody that
can be an example for others, deeply influential to others. But of course, it's always
something to understand about the 4 is that it is very influential. It does have its
impact. It is an externalizing force. And it means that all of the not-self 4/6s
represent quite a problem on the planet. They really do, and they‘re very unhealthy
and it's enormously costly. Not just costly in human life, but costly in human
resources.
The Ultimate Bridging Profile: The 4/1
And that brings us to our transition, to our moving away; the 4/6 to the 4/1. You
can just see it, here it is, straight up and down, and here you get this slight 88°
shifting, you get the juxtaposition cross emerging, so even though the personalities
are the same, the design underneath has shifted and this is the way life works. This
stays the same, there is
a shift underneath, and
we have something new.
And we enter into what is
the ultimate bridging
profile. It's the ultimate
bridging profile, the 4/1,
in the sense that the
bridging profiles that
we've seen so far, that is,
the 1/4 and the 2/5 and
3/6 are all right angle.
And we will see the 5/2
and the 6/3 that are left angle. But this stands on its own. This is juxtaposition, and
it is the profile that acts as a bridge between the right angle and the left angle, and it
brings with it fixed fate. In other words, this is not personal destiny, this is not
transpersonal karma, this is simply a line of movement, their line of movement,
different from others.
They are very fixed as beings; there is no question about that. They are deeply fixed
as beings. And of course, they are very, very different at the unconscious level,
because we don't have a 6 here anymore. What has happened in the juxtaposition is
that the design, because of its movement, has moved into another hexagram. We
have something totally different here. We've got a 1 here instead of a 6. And it's

LECTURE TEN
Profiles: 3/5, 3/6, 4/6 and 4/1
not the 1 that was the buildup to that 6, it‘s the next one that came after. And so
it‘s in another hexagram, it carries another value, and here is a bridging of two
worlds.
We've already seen the 1 in terms of the personality; that is, the introspection, the
investigation, the insecurity, all of the things that are part of what is a 1st line theme
seeking a foundation. Basically what you have in the 4/1, what makes them so fixed
is that they have the foundation and the ability to externalize it all within
themselves. And so they get very, very locked into that. Again, this is something
important to understand about them, because it's not like you can change their mind
with any kind of ease, you cannot. It‘s like meeting somebody who is a 17/62. They
have their own opinions and they have their own facts to back it up. You can't argue
with these people. You can have an argument with a 17, you can have an argument
with a 62, but you can never have an argument with a 17/62 because in fact there is
no place to go because they have both the opinions and the facts.
Here you have both the investigation and the externalization. So very much they
stand on their own, which means that psychologically they can be very, very strong
as beings; this ability to be able to stand on their own. And what you get here in the
4 personality is that where their fatigue, where their exhaustion comes from is when
they are constantly being challenged. This is the most difficult thing for them,
because again they carry their own foundation, they carry their own externalization,
they just want to externalize. That's all they want to do.
The Not-Self 4th Line Personality
And of course, it can end up being very, very difficult for them because in essence
they're not-self. And of course we know the dilemmas of what it is to be not-self, to
be a not-self 4 personality. That means that's what's guiding the way in which your
The Four Views is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

169
THE FOUR VIEWS

mind thinks, so you‘re looking for your opportunities to be able to externalize and
you're going to choose the wrong people to try to externalize it to.
It's the Jehovah Witness showing up at a mosque. There is a certain bizarre in all of
that. No matter how right you think you are that is not a good choice. It isn‘t.
Again, this is one of the dilemmas of the 4; the not-self 4 doesn't know who to give
their energy to. And in this case, the 4/1s are always in that situation with their
very fixedness externalizing to the wrong people. And the moment they externalize
to the wrong people they meet all of that resistance.
And again depending on their design, whether they're going to be Manifestor,
Generator, Projector, Reflector, whatever the case may be it's going to lead to the
anger, the frustration, the bitterness, the disappointment. And of course they are
not going to give up their foundation. They are not. They are going to abdicate,
they are going to back away, they‘re going to leave that relationship and look for
somebody else to externalize to.
Again, because they don't have the cognition to be able to make a true selection, the
right beings to externalize to, they‘re always going to meet the resistance and feel
uncomfortable. These are the people that can be broken. You can break a 4/1. It‘s
the only profile, in that sense, that you can really break. You know, the oak tree
that at some point it just can't bend, you just knock it down. Because the whole
thing about the 4/1 is that given that they're not-self they can get very fixed on
very, very, very inaccurate things. It‘s like the 4/1 that says the Earth is flat. And
by the way, these people exist; the earth is flat. Okay, everybody's entitled to their
―this and that,‖ but the reality is that if you take that 4/1 and you do everything in
your power to prove to them that they are insane, if you actually get to a point
where it dawns on them, they‘re shattered.
It‘s one of my comments about having a 4/1 as a lover, they're always right. If you
don't always let them always be right you‘re really going to have trouble, because
you're not going to be able to alter the way in which they move through their
process. You're not going to alter the way in which they externalize to the other.
You're not going to be able to do anything about it.
These are beings that are a key; they‘re a key to linking the right and the left. We
have 4/1s that are aware, that operate correctly according to their Strategy and
Authority, you‘ve got a totally different kind of process. This is the thing about
looking at profile. We‘re talking about a costume, in a sense; we‘re talking about the
way in which we operate as a character. You can see it is not unique, the billion
4/6s, nothing unique about that. It is a generalization about a character type. And
we know that Human Design is the science of differentiation. We can get to
enormous nuances within all of that.
And remember that we‘re looking at these profiles we‘re not looking at these profiles
relative to gates, relative to crosses, relative to designs, relative to the nuances
within those designs and so forth and so on. It is just a very, very broad
generalization. But this is where the not-self lives. If you‘re trying to interpret the
not-self, just looking at their profile tells you the story. That is, the distorted story of

LECTURE TEN
Profiles: 3/5, 3/6, 4/6 and 4/1
how that vast generic operates, because they operate very much like they're not
really differentiated. Profile is very powerful. When you're a professional you're
dealing with the not-self and you tell them about their profile, they recognize it right
away. What they recognize is the not-self framework of that profile, which has been
a part of their life, but not really living it as it was intended, because it all goes back
to decision making.
One of the great dilemmas that you see in any kind of profile is that the personality
aspect of the profile is actually what defines the not-self because this is the
personality in them; this is what is running the mental system in them. When you're
talking about a 4th line personality, it's just a broad generic. These are opportunists.
This is an opportunistic personality. They're all opportunistic personalities. They all
operate in exactly the same way. And in terms of not-self, they don't get it right.
The Vast Majority of Relationships are Incorrect
It‘s one of the bedrocks to understand that given we‘ve got billions of people who
carry the 4th line, billions—the 1/4s, 2/4s, the 4/1s—if you think about all those
billions then you begin to understand something that is really, really bizarre, that the
vast majority of relationships on this planet are incorrect. This is the not-self world;
this is the great homogenized world. This is the way it works.
This is why humanity suffers in the way in which it does. This is why we live in a
world of vast homogenized diseases that eat away at our human structure that there
are these vast homogenized psychological dilemmas, that there are these vast
homogenized moralistic perspectives, all of this is the not-self. It has nothing to do
with what is possible. It has nothing to do with what the true potential of any of
these profiles happen to be. It is so rare that you get to see that.
Strategy and Authority is something that is really remarkable. And it‘s remarkable in
the sense that it's the only thing that gives you a chance to fit into your skin, not to
be lost in that deep homogenization, not to be vulnerable, not to be a victim, but be
able to take advantage of your design. We‘re all here to take advantage of our
design; that is, from the personality point of view, take advantage of our vehicles.
They are our lives.
If they are healthy and operate correctly we are healthier and wiser at the same
time. It allows us to be able to navigate this plane. And not make the inherent
mistakes that are there in the way in which the not-self operates through any of the
themes that are there in profile. You don‘t want to be a not-self 3 any more than
you want to be a not-self 4, but in fact, you don‘t want to be a not-self anything,
because they are all so deeply distorting.

Incarnation Crosses
I know that there are so many people who enter into Human Design that they are
fascinated with their incarnation cross, the potential of their purpose in this life, all of
these things; very new age, very nice. But, your cross; it takes a long time for you
to be your cross. It‘s just there. It begins with the basics, which is the profile itself,
which is the foundation upon which the cross is built, that this is the character that
you're here to play in this movie. And if you do not play this character correctly,
then you're not going to have a good ride. This is our movie; this is what it's about.
I love being a 5/1, but I do remember when it was awful, because I remember the
not-self of what it was not to fit into my costume, not to wear it correctly, not to
know what the hell I was doing because I was being guided by not-self. Yet, the
moment that you begin to operate correctly, you begin to appreciate why you have
the profile you do. After all, it's part of the continuity of what you're here to achieve
as a being on this plane in terms of the fulfillment of your purpose. It‘s one of the
bedrocks of it.
I think the thing that I like most about profile is that it's a signpost. The more you
operate correctly according to your Strategy and Authority, the more your profile
begins to define you. It defines the way in which you operate, it defines the way in
which you meet the world around you, and it can give you a sense of being in the
right direction in terms of where you're going in your process.
Anyway, it‘s interesting to reflect once again on these themes. It‘s nice to share it
with you. I'm glad that they're those of you that that still show up here in the
morning for this one. Until next time, our last class, until then, bye for now.

Good morning everybody, and welcome to all of you. Here we are at the end of our
process together. We‘re going to take a look at I guess, appropriately enough, the
left angle to close all of this out. There is quite a difference between the personal
destiny that the majority of profile represents, that is, the first seven profiles from
the 1/3 to the 4/6. Personal destiny is really about self-absorption, and is really
about one's own process. It‘s one of the things to understand about what it means
to be right angle is that to be right angle means that whatever is going to happen in
your life ultimately it's going to be up to you. That is, if you're going to be correct, if
you're going to be this or that, or if your life is going to change, whatever the case
may be, the fact is that ultimately it is your own hands.

If you‘re left angle and left angle, as you can see, dealing with the context of
transpersonal karma, you‘ll notice one of the things about profile and angle, the
three angles that we have, that is, right angle, juxtaposition and left angle, that it is
a place where you get to see the proper application of particular language, that is,
personal destiny as
we describe in the
right angle, fixed fate
in the juxtaposition,
and here karma, that
is, transpersonal
karma in the left
angle.
So often, particularly
in Western society
that has been
collecting all kinds of
information from
different spiritual
sources all over the
planet, and
particularly the way in
which the English
language works in which it‘s quite common in English to take words from different
languages that basically have the same meanings and interchange them and
eventually confuse them. I think this is one of the things that is really true about the
nature of destiny, fate and karma. They tend to be very much jumbled together
within the general not-self understanding of these terms, whereas, within Human
Design you can see that they have a specific mechanical application, and a
mechanical application that is always relative to movement in a world of the other.
It is why that the right angle often has greater dilemmas in being able to recognize
and value relationships. It‘s very different from a left angle that often gets lost in
the presumed value of a relationship that may not be there. After all, given that the
vast majority of humanity is not-self the way in which the not-self functions is
―dysfunctional‖ so you end up with a lot of distortion out of the natural mechanics of
these particular angles.
The Left Angle: Transpersonal Karma
Here we‘re dealing with the left. And in dealing with the left angle and dealing with
transpersonal karma, literally what that means is that one cannot fulfill one's
purpose alone. It doesn't mean that one is dependent on the other. It doesn't mean
that it has to be a special kind of other, lover, and friend, whatever the case may be.
The best way to illustrate that is—I‘m a 5/1 so it‘s easy for me to take an example. I
disappeared in 1983. That was the beginning of my mystical process. I ended up
crossing the Atlantic and I ended up in Amsterdam. I met a 17 or 18-year-old

American student. I don't know his name, never did, don't know where he came
from. I've often thought it would be nice to send him a note and say thank you. He
was just a kid. I was much older at that time than he was, at least 10 or more years
older than he was. Well, more than that. I think I was 34, so I was quite a lot older
than he was.
I was staying in one of these pensiones in the center of Amsterdam trying to figure
why I was there in the first place because it all seemed rather mad to me. I'd left
quite a lot behind. I met this young guy and he asked me where I was going and I
said I didn't know. He said to me, you should go to Ibiza. I took his advice. I had
no idea what it was, by the way. I said to him, what is it. He told me that it was an
island that was off the coast of Spain and he told me how to get there, literally he
told me how to get there. This was somebody that I knew for maybe 90 minutes in
my life, and changed
my whole life; literally
changed my whole life.
This is transpersonal
karma. This is the
way that transpersonal
karma really works.
It is one of the things
that you learn as a left
angle being. The more
correct you become,
the more clear it is
that you don't know
where your allies are
and you can't imagine
who they are, but they
do show up and you
always know once they've shown up. It‘s one of those things about being left angle.
The other thing about being left angle is that there is a quality of recognition of the
other that isn‘t necessarily logical. It's the kind of thing where you casually meet
somebody and there is a sense of connectivity to these people that is far beyond the
surface illusion; a sense of knowing them, a sense of being connected somehow to
them, this is very much part of what transpersonal karma is about.
It can often be very, very misleading, because as a left angle, and I know this so
well, that I can have this kind of recognition of the other and yet realize that there's
no point in investing in it. In other words, transpersonal karma is based on a whole
history of interconnectivity that has impacted the personality. Remember that to
have transpersonal karma your personality has to be upper trigram; the 5 or the 6.
So, these are personalities that in essence have had connectivity to other
personalities in other forms over long periods of time. This is where you get a sense
of some past connection that isn't really sane, if you know what I mean, it's not
really logical. You can't really put a finger on it, but it is part of what it is to be left
angle.

The Marketing Department of the Hexagram
The other thing about the left angle is that the reason that it has this kind of
transpersonal karma is that basically the left angle is the marketing department of
the hexagram. When you think about hexagram, the right angle is R&D; it‘s
research and development. This is what the right angle does. The right angle does
research and development. Juxtaposition takes the results of research and
development and hands it over to the marketing department, and the left angle then
goes out and markets it.
So that when you start with a left angle and you start with what is the most left
angle, if I can put it that way, of the four profiles, which is the 5/1 is that this is the
pure marketing of the hexagram. That's why the 5 as a line, if you go into the
history of the I‘Ching, which is quite an extraordinary thing, and you look at the way
in which it was constructed, one of the most fascinating things is that the 5th line is
always exalted. It‘s isn‘t the case, by the way, in the Rave I‘Ching in terms of that
language—exalted/detriment. Let‘s put it differently, in the I‘Ching, the 5th line is
always very special. It‘s special in that it is the hope, which is probably the best way
to put it, it is the hope of the hexagram—to be the general, to be the savior, to be
the therapist. If you look at all the 5th lines in the Rave I‘Ching, what you get to see
is the hope or the potential of the realization of the hexagram.
And so what happens to 5th line beings is that they have to deal with a very, very
deep, deep level of projection. Now, we‘ve already looked at this in the sense of
looking at the 2/5 and the 3/5, but there we were seeing it at the unconscious level.
At the unconscious level, in essence, it's much more difficult. That is, you don't
know why people are projecting on you. Or you have no sense that they're
projecting on you until it's too late, until you've disappointed them and like the 3/5
you get punished for it.
The 5th Line Personality
But when you have a 5th line
personality it's very different. With
a 5th line personality when
somebody is moving towards me—
transpersonal karma—somebody's
coming in my direction, they're
moving towards me, the 5th line
personality is already trying to
figure out what they want.
Because everything about the 5 is
that it recognizes that whoever is
going to approach it in one way or another is going to have a projection, and in that
projection they are going to want something. Even if they don't articulate it, they‘re
going to want something. And if you can't deliver it, they‘re going to blame you.

Not only are they going to blame you, but they‘re going to tell everybody, the
heretic.
And you know what happens to the heretic if the heretic is not able to really bring
something practical and of value, they‘re going to destroy that heretic. They‘re
going to burn it at the stake; they‘re going to do whatever they can do. So, one of
the things about the 5 personality is that it has an inherent level of paranoia—what
do they want, what do they expect from me, what is it that I have to do, because
they have to deal with the projection.
One of the difficulties of the 5 is that it cannot always deal with projection. That
illustration that I often make about thinking about the structure of the hexagram and
seeing the hexagram as a house that has two floors, and you have the lower
window, which is the 2nd line where the lights are on and everybody can look in, and
then you have the upper floor window where the 5 is and the 5 is where all the lights
are out, and the 5 is standing there behind the blinds and it's looking out on the
street below. It is a very, very different way in which they operate.
There is a naïveté to the 2 that isn't there in the 5. The 5 is suspicious. It's
suspicious because it knows that the moment that it deals with projection, if it
doesn't deliver the goods, it's over. I knew right away that Human Design was okay.
And I knew it right away because I'm a 5/1. If it wasn't going to work, I was going
to know right away and everybody else was going know. Everybody was going
know, because that's the dilemma of being a 5.
So, one of the first things to understand about dealing with the 5 personality is that
for them the demands of others are always a risk, which is why they have to be very
careful. And of course, this is the whole business of what it means to have inner
authority. If you can operate correctly out of your inner authority, in other words,
that you know how to make a decision, that you know what projection you can
handle, when somebody says to you: I think that you can be the perfect this or that

for me, even if they don't articulate it that way, that's what they're saying. And if
you don't enter into that correctly, you are going to fail in that.
The person that falls in love with a 5/1 there is the assumption that they are going to
be the best this and that, obviously if it is not-self there is always going to be failure
in that. No one can live up to the expectations of others all the time. And the 5/1
has to be selective. It has the potential to universalize. So anyone who has a 5th
line in their design, conscious or unconscious, has a certain advantage, an advantage
that in any dualistic system obviously can become a disadvantage. That is, the
advantage is that they get initial positive projection.
So somebody comes to me and their positive projection is that I am going to be able
to help them. If I deliver the practical goods, if I do help them, everything is terrific.
And by the way, they don't jump up and down because this is what they expected.
But if I fail to help them, there is going to be a disproportionate negative response.
And this is the dilemma that all 5s have to deal with. And of course, the solution in
that is Strategy and Authority. There is no other way.
The 5/1
When you're looking at a 5/1 you are looking at a transpersonal potential to be able
to take investigated information and universalize it. That's their power, that's their
potential. I‘m a 5/1 with ten 1st first lines, so I universalize the detail of
investigation. That's my job. That's the job for any 5/1. In other words, that they
have to know their
stuff, because if
they don't know
their stuff they're
going to blow that
expectation, that
positive expectation
that is there.
The great dilemma
in terms of the not-
self 5/1, and
obviously that's the
vast majority on this
planet, is that they get crushed at a very early age. They get crushed because if you
don't live up to the expectation and it begins with your parents—it‘s my standing
joke that the moment I came out of the womb as a 5/1 Manifestor, my poor mother,
she knew right away this is going to be a problem. The moment that I did anything
less than what was expected my reputation was always going to be damaged.
Most 5 personalities have had damaged psyches from the time that they were little
children, because the moment as a 5/1 that you have not fulfilled somebody's
expectation and you realize it because you get punished for it, it is very, very

painful. And of course it increases the level of paranoia in terms of well, should we
really get involved in anything. It‘s one of the dilemmas about the 5/1 and the 5/2
is that they can be incredibly reclusive. But of course, the gods have their own game
in all of this.
If you're a 5 you are naturally attractive and seductive. And it means despite the
fact that you may not be interested in pulling anybody towards you and their
projection, you can‘t help it. This is the most extraordinary thing about Human
Design is what Strategy and Authority can do for life. Because of course, if you're a
5 personality, and particularly if you have an undefined Ego, it's very easy for you to
end up in horrendous situations in your life. You get flattered by the fact that
somebody thinks that you‘re going to be terrific at something, and of course you
want to prove yourself, and then you blow it. Not only do you fail within yourself,
but that other person who had the expectation is going to tell everybody. They‘ll tell
your mother that you screwed up, they‘ll tell your lover, your dog, your boss,
everybody will know. They‘ll be on the telephone in 10 minutes letting everybody
know.
So 5s, very, very early in their process can be crushed. And of course, it means that
they're less and less able ultimately to try to fulfill those expectations. It‘s why the
key for all 5s is practicality. If you're a 5 and you want to succeed in this life, accept
the projection that you can deal with practically. If somebody wants to know about
themselves, as a 5/1 I have enormous ability to be able to do that, because I have
practical knowledge. And I can deliver it in a practical way, and everything is okay.
This is the story. And of course, we have so few 5/1s that are doing their work.
There is not enough heresy on this planet, I tell you. They‘re not doing their work.
The 5/2
So when we open up with a left
angle and we open up with this
transpersonal karma, it is
something to grasp that though
this is the potential to have a
very powerful impact on the
other, that the very positive
orientation of all of this, the
positive values of the projection
lead to so many problems for
the not-self, for the not-self
personality that is a 5. Where it becomes very, very difficult is when you enter into
the 5/2. This is one of the most difficult configurations as a profile. And what I
mean by that is that it's difficult in the sense that because of the 2nd line
unconscious, after all we're dealing with the hermit, we're not dealing with an
investigating heretic, we‘re dealing with a hermit heretic, a heretic that is locked
away and waiting for a specific call.

But the moment that you're dealing with a 5/2 like this you're dealing with
something that is very interesting. The 2 basically is rejecting. The 2 basically says:
leave me alone. And the 5 says: I'm available. And of course, there is an enormous
conflict here. So that the unconscious is literally trying to keep people away and the
personality is attracting them.
And again, you end up in the dilemma of what it means for a 5/2 to actually step
out. Think about the 2. The 2 is a natural. This relationship between the 1st line
and the 2nd line is one that's really extraordinary. They are the basic binary. And
when you look at the 1st line you see that life is a matter of gaining knowledge. You
work things through, you investigate, you study you build a framework for things,
you dig in. And then you have the 2. It‘s sort of like the ant and the grasshopper
story, I don‘t know if you know this story. But any way, the 1st line is the ant. It
works really, really hard digging around. And the 2 is a grasshopper. It's sort of
just flitting around and just taking advantage of life and smelling the roses. They're
very different.
When you think about talent, as an example, the difference between the 1 and the 2,
the 1 has to study. The 1 has to work really, really hard. As a matter of fact, 1s end
up being more successful as artists than 2s, not because they have more talent, but
because they have more discipline. And the 2s who have so much talent have no
discipline. This is them.
So you say to the 2 that has a natural gift for music, you say to them: practice. This
is not what they want to do. Leave me alone; don‘t tell me what to do, leave me
alone. If I want to play, I‘ll play. Oh, but you could be great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So
it‘s one of the things to recognize about this combination of the 5/2 as opposed to
the 5/1. The 5/1 has really done its work, it knows all that stuff. So when it does
have its opportunity to universalize, it feels very, very comfortable. If you're
universalizing something that's practical, you‘re very comfortable.

But we know what happens to the 2. The 2 isn't comfortable in that role, they can't
be, because they have no underpinning in it. They just have a natural talent. And of
course, when they get called out, the way in which the 5 can be projected on in
which they can get as not-self flattered into doing something, pulled into doing
something, when they don't perform correctly, which happens quite often, because
they're not receiving the right call, they‘re devastated. And you rarely see them
coming out of their cave after that, because they don't like it. This is one of the
great dilemmas for the two. Everything about the 2 is that the 2 establishes a
barrier so that it can block off everything except what is absolutely correct for it. For
a 2 there is always the right call. But you have to know, you have to be able to
discern, you have to be able to figure it out.
Again, this is what the mechanics of Human Design are all about. The moment that
you can make a decision as yourself, that is, through your inner authority, as a 5/2
it's the only way you're ever going to know whether that is something that is correct
for you to act on, that it is the right thing to pull you out of your cave and to put you
in that heretical
situation. And it's
only when it's
correct for you that
you can do that. It‘s
still the same story.
If you're 5, it's got
to be practical. If
you don't provide
practical solutions—
that's that wonderful
example of the 49.5;
the 49th gate, 5th
line: practical solutions in revolutionary times. This is what the 5 is all about,
practical solutions. But for the 5/2, it‘s a great dilemma, because they‘re just not
prepared. They don't have the background, they don't have the depth, they simply
have the talent, but it's a talent for something very specific, which means that it can
only be a talent that is going to flourish when it gets the right call.
When you think about the 5s as being the marketing wing—because for me the 6/2,
the 6/3 are very different, they're already pointed in another direction away from the
hexagram. When you're dealing with 5/1 and 5/2 you‘re really dealing with the core
of what is the universalizing potential of that particular information, the hexagram
information. And you can see quite clearly in terms of the way in which the not-self
operates that those that are endowed with being 5/1s and 5/2s, which if you add it
up is about 19%, about a fifth of the world population, it's kind of spooky to
recognize that there is very, very little that is being put out. This is the great power
of homogenization. It is an enormous power.
And of course, because these heretical forces are operating incorrectly, they are
simply smashed down and they‘re eventually cowed and they eventually just let go,

THE FOUR VIEWS

they let go of any attempt of trying to establish what is natural for them to establish.
They lose contact with their essence. This is enormously common.
Knowing What the Other Wants
Again, you see that in dealing with the 5 personality, particularly children who have a
5 personality, how important it is to encourage their development, encourage their
understanding of what is their power and to make them aware that they need to find
out what other people want. Remember, that‘s how I started looking at the 5s with
you. The 5s looks out through their eyes, the 5 personality sees somebody coming
and says: what do you want? But that's what they need to know. They need to
know what is it that you want from me; and the moment that they get the answer,
then they know practically whether they can deliver or not. If you want me to be
your friend, then this isn‘t going work. If you want me to help you in a certain
situation it might, but I need to know what you want. I need to know what you
expect from me. And if you don't tell me, I'm not going to deal with you. This is the
key for any 5.
And of course, it is often very difficult in their workings, because again they are left
angle, they are transpersonal. In their connection with the other, to even have the
courage to ask the other, again we're not looking at what their design is, the way it's
going to work, whether they've got an open Throat, a defined Throat, a this or that,
whatever the case may be. To really grasp that this is the key, and of course, this is
all part of the practicality. I can't practically be of value to you until you tell me
practically what you require so that I know practically whether I can deliver. That's
the whole equation.
The moment that equation is there, the moment that there is clarity in that then
there is the possibility of the 5 being able to function normally. I know what people
want from me; they want to be saved one way or another. So I understand the
game. This is what is projected on me, this is what I have to deliver, and because I
have practical tools, it is what I do.
But I can remember in my life where not only did I not know what people expected
from me, beyond that, you can end up doing so much damage to human beings
because you don't understand what they expect from you. You can hurt them, you
can do all kinds of things, and it can be very uncomfortable. And of course, it opens
up this whole thing about the nature of the 5, and as a transpersonal being, the
importance of communication, the importance of communication to be able to
establish a framework for action or not.
The 6th Line: Transition
And when we enter into the realm of the 6 we really do go to a different place. If
you have a 5th line in a gate, it‘s looking across the channel and there is always this
possibility of seducing what's on the other side, or attracting it and perhaps receiving

a projection and being able to practically deliver. It‘s always interested in what's on
the other side of the channel. But when you're dealing with a 6, the 6 is looking to
the whole circuit. In other words, it has a totally different view. When we're looking
at the construct of the house, for me the hexagram is the 1 to the 5. That's really
the hexagram. This is the way it works with the 4 as the medium in here—all this
research and development, the transferring over of the information to the marketing
department.
And then you've got this roof. And up on this roof is the 6. And it's not really
connected to this process below. It really isn't. It‘s looking way off beyond the gate
at the other end, beyond that channel to the next, to the next, to the next, along the
line of the circuit, looking a long way. One of the dilemmas of the 6 is that while it‘s
looking around off in the distance, somebody comes along and whacks it in its
kneecap, because it doesn't see it coming.
The 6 is about transition. Every 6th line is eventually going to become a 1st line in
the movement of the wheel. It's the way that it goes. And the 6 on the roof is
already looking at the next hexagram that‘s about to be coming. And because it is
not directly involved within the work of the hexagram, it is simply a model of it. It‘s
why we call it a role model. It is the model. It isn't to be universalized, it isn't to be
worked on; it‘s just what it is. That is the classic of it. But what we know about this
model is that because it is 6th line that is going to go through transitions in its
process; that is, the tripartite process of the 6th line experience.
The 6/2
We know that, as an example, when you're dealing with a 6th line personality that
this is one of the most difficult aspects of being a 6 in a profile. We‘ve already seen
in the 3/6 and the 4/6 the dilemmas that come physically into the life as the result of
this tripartite process, but it's always coming from the unconscious. It isn't a

conscious aspect. It's not about the personality itself. But here we're dealing with 6
personalities. When you‘re dealing with a 6/2, again we have our hermit theme, so
we have form that would like to be protected, would like to find a nice secure
environment to work out of, a form that has its basic talent. But what we have is a
personality that is unstable.
If you want to look for levels of mental illness as a proportion percentage wise of
what profiles would have higher levels of mental illness, you will find that in the 6/2
and the 6/3. The reason for that is that this is the only personality that goes
through radical transitions in the lifetime. In other words, it goes through that
tripartite process of going through the 3rd line phase in the Saturn cycle. So you've
got those first approximately 30 years where you're going through the 3rd line phase.
You've got the period that‘s on the roof. And then by the time that you get to 50-51
years you go to your Kiron phase, and you come off the roof—the three-partite life
process of the 6.
The Uranian Cycle
But this is not personality. So all 6s go through this 3rd line personality phase when
they're young. And because humanity is still basically operating out of old seven-
centered rules it means that most human beings try to establish their lives between
the age of 20 and 30. This is the great joke, and the sadness, I guess, it's a tragedy
actually, of about the way in which life works now. You have the kids who are really
kids, in the Uranian cycle
you're not an adult until
you've reached a midlife
sometime between 38
and 44. You're basically
a child developing until
then. We have a much
longer process for that
maturation.
It used to be you were
mature at 15, which is
the half Saturn cycle.
Obviously, the maturation process, given the complexities of the nine-centered being
has really extended this process. One of the standard things that I‘ve said to my
children over and over again is: don't worry about what you're going to do in life
until you're 40. There is no pressure. Don't worry about what you're going to do in
life until you're 40. Life is going to deliver what it delivers; you need experience,
many things to learn, and all this stuff because it's the reality.
The moment that you think a 6/2 person, 3rd line phase, somewhere in their 20s has
gone to University, taken some kind of whatever, training, this, that, all of this is
going to end up being a fiasco, because this is their time of chaos. It‘s their time of
trial and error. It's their time of blunders. It's their time of bonds made and broken.

LECTURE ELEVEN
Profiles: 5/1, 5/2, 6/2 and 6/3
It's all of those things. And all of that at the psychological level, so they make all
kinds of incorrect personality decisions. So you have a very, very chaotic mental
process in terms of what happens to not-self 6th line beings as they go through this
first part of their process. And then comes the crash.
I know so many 6/2s and 6/3s that the moment that they hit this barrier; this is
when they had their breakdowns. They fell apart. They crashed. And either they
crashed and burned or they crashed and started a new process. But this is when it
happened. And for most of them it will take the next 20 years to put all the Humpty
Dumpty pieces back together again. Because of what happened to them, personality
wise in that first cycle of the tripartite-like process.
I was listening this morning to a wonderful, wonderful interview on Jovian Radio with
my good friend Randy Richmond. Randy is a classic example of a 6/3. In his 20s he
was both an alcoholic and a junkie and nearly died. Around 29 he reached that point
of what he calls breakdown breakthrough, which is something that is so classic for
what it is to be a 6 personality. And he's not alone in that. I know so many 6/2s
particularly who have had so many psychological problems that came to a head, as it
were, by the time they reached the beginning of going up on the roof as a stage.
6th Line Children
Again, it means that where we can be of value is particularly with children. It‘s rare
in Human Design by the way that we have clients that are in their 20s. That is, it is
still a minority. Most of the clients in Human Design are post-Saturn in terms of
their life process. Often it takes that burn and crash in order to bring people to a
point where they're ready to look for help. It‘s one of the things to see that we can
be of enormous value if we can get to young people, teenagers particularly, who
carry a 6th line personality, for them to understand that they are really going to go
through a trial and error phase in their life and how important it is for them that they
know how to make a decision.
This is what this knowledge is about. This semester is coming to an end. I have had
an extraordinary and wonderful journey this semester going into some of the most
incredible depths of this knowledge, all of which is very beautiful. And it's wonderful
to be able to see things and grasp them. And yet over and over and over and over
again I remind my students at any level that it's so obvious that the story of the
success of a human being is about how to make decisions, not how much you know.
It isn't about how much you know. It really is about just knowing how to make a
decision.
If you really know how to make a decision as yourself, all this mainline not-self
suffering is eliminated. And it is something that is so important for young 6/2s and
6/3s to know, because if not, oh yes, we‘ll see them, maybe. But when we get to
see them they're really messed up, they‘re really confused, and they‘re really lost,
because this becomes a highly dysfunctional personality, because it's so mutative.

The 6 is the Key to Mutation
Remember that the 6 is the key to mutation. This is a mutative personality going
through a very complex staging process. And of course, the not-self doesn‘t know
that. It has no idea. This is where you have so much psychological damage that is
done. And of course, these are enormously important forces because they are the
forces of the future. It's like thinking about global cycles.
I talk a lot about the fact that we're slowly but surely leaving the Cross of Planning.
We happen to be in the 1st line of the Cross of Planning theme. We‘re in the 1st line
because these global cycles operate like the precession of the equinox. In other
words, they operate in a retrograde fashion, which means that when we enter into
the next cycle, in 2027, we will enter into a 6th line phase. This is the framework of
the mutation that we‘re dealing with.
And not only are we dealing with the fact that the 6 as we have seen it underneath,
that is, as 3/6 and 4/6, is bringing mutation to the physical form. And by the way,
the way it does that is that it is actually the 6 at the unconscious level that is
bringing us our new Uranian life standard. In other words, it's extending the
potential of the body as a general marker to live a much longer life than was the
case under the Saturnian cycle of the seven-centered being.
And here at the personality level, what we are getting is the mutation of the
personality itself. And the mutation of the personality away from the 5; that is,
away from my role, which is to seduce you into getting information. The role of the
6 is simply to be an example, a correct living example, nothing more nothing less;
no motive in that, no goal in that, simply the correctness of being correct. And of
course, this is the future.
One of the things that I talk a lot about is that Human Design trains sheep to be
wolves, because that's really what it is, to stop being this everybody-has-authority-
over-me and start being I-have-authority-over-myself. And of course, this is
ultimately the example that the 6/2 is there to express. It is there to express the
fact that it is in its own authority. This is its correctness. And as a hermit, as a role
model hermit, it is here to operate correctly and that there will be those there that
call out this role model so that it can be a valued and trusted leader in a certain
given situation.
The 6/2 is here to establish the example of the future. The example that we are
here to stand on our own, that we are here to be our own authority, that only as our
own authority are we going to be able to maintain any kind of stability in this life.
And again to understand the fragility of the 6 as a personality activation, to
understand that in those first 30 years that there is enormous risk of psychic damage
that leads to all kinds of problems. Remember that this is not-self. If you're living
out a dysfunctional 3rd line ―theme‖ as not-self you‘re going to make horrendous

mistakes in those first 30 years and you're going to be paying for them for a very
long time.
We can do a lot to be of value and help, particularly to teenagers. This is a key for
teenagers who carry a 6th line as personality. They need to know how to make a
decision as themselves. They need to understand what their process is like, that
they're on a learning track. They need to understand that they shouldn‘t make any
quick decisions in their first 28 or 29 years like getting married or deciding ultimately
what their great lifelong career is going to be, that they should just take their time,
that they should learn to just take in the experience of this trial and error so that
they can see the things that don't work, to begin when they go onto the roof to see
what is possible for them, and what can work. But you can‘t do that if you have a
damaged psyche. You can‘t do that if you're not making decisions correctly as
yourself.
The 6/3
And of course that leads us to the 6/3. The next step after the 6/3 is going to be the
next 1/3. In other words, here you get to see the true transition. And this is the
most unstable of profiles. It has its sister, the 3/6. But again, the advantage of 3/6
is that the 3/6 always has a consistent personality. It's a real advantage despite the
fact that they go through the cycles and the turmoil. There is a consistency in their
personality that leads to less psychological breakdown. Here you really get to see
the psychological breakdown. Here it can be very, very difficult.
Again, it's like anything in Design. When I say things like that because I know a lot
of people take that out of context—this is more difficult than that—every profile is
difficult if you're not-self. Please understand that. Every profile is difficult if you're

not-self, every profile is going to turn on you if you're not-self. It's just the way it
works and it doesn't matter what the numbers are.
It‘s just the thing to see about the 6/3, as an example, is that it is so mutative, this
deeply mutative personality. And a deeply mutative personality that has at its
unconscious level this whole martyr. It‘s so easy for these beings, these are the
ones that are the most fragile at the 3/3 stage. And again, it‘s like a 3/3 stage. If
anything and everything is going to go wrong it will. And there is nothing that one
can do for these beings, really, unless you can get to them early, because if you‘re
going to get to them later, like my friend Randy, they would've had to have survived.
Not all of them do. And I don't mean that as dramatic as death. I mean, just
survive as even being in any way ready for help or to find a way out or whatever.
This kind configuration just goes down.
They‘re very different. There is enormous pressure here on these beings that carry
the 6/2 and the 6/3 to be mutative examples. Yet, to be a mutative example means
you have to be an example of something where there is no established methodology,
where there is no specific, because it is about you being the correct example of
yourself, not the correct example of some generic. It‘s the correct example of
yourself. And you can see what happens if this is not-self, you‘re an incorrect
example of yourself and you suffer for it—martyr, martyr, martyr—martyr, anarchist,
pessimism, you name
it, bonds made and
broken, collapse, all
of those things as
not-self, wow.
We‘ve had a journey.
You‘re looking at
profiles and we've
looked at different
costumes, because
that‘s what they are,
we‘re looking at
costumes. And yet,
we have to wear them in life. We‘re choiceless in that. You come into the world as a
6/3; this is what you have to wear. And the dilemma for all of us is that we came
into the world with parents that were not aware; not their fault. What to do. And
the dilemmas of what it is to be not-self, to live a life of dysfunction, most human
beings never get out of that.
The Role Model of Adaptation to Transition
The one advantage for the 6/2s and the 6/3s as personalities is that they go through
personality crises that can be transforming in their process, or shattering. And that's
what you get to see. If you look at the vast majority of 6 personalities in the world,
most of them are deeply dysfunctional beings that never recovered from the first

stage, as a personality that never recovered. And of course, they‘re not-self, living a
not-self life making not-self decisions.
And the great beauty of this is lost. Who better to teach us about the nature of
transition than an awake 6/3? This is a treasure, because life is transition. This is
what it's about, the ability to move from this to that. Here is the capability in this
6/3 to understand how to adapt to transition; it‘s their potential, and how to be that
role model of that adaptation to transition. We don't have many of those beings as
guides. They‘re dead or institutionalized or they are so repressed that they will
simply go to their graves screaming. It's just the way that it is.
It‘s one of the things that I recognized right at the very beginning when I began my
process as a teacher of this knowledge. There is a seduction in learning things.
There is an assumption in learning that somehow you‘re mastering. But Human
Design is about life. It‘s about your life; it‘s about living your life. That knowledge
can be very sweet, but it is only when you operate correctly mechanically that your
life is different. It's only then that you begin to wear your costume and wear it
properly. It is only then you begin to open up the possibility of being able to
function in a way that you were intended to function and be able to exalt the
possibility and potential of that.
I can point to every aspect in Human Design and show you the curse, because the
world is made up of not-self and I can show you how every aspect, no matter what it
is, will turn against those that bear it, because the fact is that it's all a negative if
you're unaware, if you're not operating correctly, it‘s always going to work against
you.
One Decision at a Time
In the end this knowledge is deeply, deeply simple. It just says something very,
very simple, very simple. It says that life is built on, as a moving form, one decision
at a time. That‘s all. This is what your life's made up of. If you look at your whole
life story, it is nothing but one decision after another, a decision that in most cases
where the majority of them have been made by others. The decisions made by your
parents, your teachers, your lovers, your children, your government, your this or
that, whatever the case may be, one decision after another makes your life. And
every decision is an adjustment in your movement in space.
Human Design says very simply that if you follow your inner authority you align
yourself to what is your correct movement. You eliminate resistance. You extend
the possibility not only of the vitality and well-being of your physical life, but the
potential of your consciousness. And all this comes back to making decisions
yourself and not with the mind, but out of your inner authority, out of your vehicle's
consciousness.

Only then if you're a 6/3 can you live the beauty of being a 6/3, because I can paint
it as dark as dark as dark for the not-self. But if you're operating correctly, it‘s such
a magical thing. To have this gift of being able to be an example, of being able to
adapt to any transition in this evolutionary mutative life, there is no greater
expression, but you have to make decisions as yourself to get there. There isn‘t any
other way. Strategy and Authority is for every beginner, and it's for everyone that's
gone through their seven-year cycle, their 14-year cycle, or like me going through a
21-year cycle, it's always the same, it stays the same. It's the one true law for
correctness in life: Strategy and Authority.
Anyway, it has been a delight. I definitely enjoy revisiting all of these basic areas in
Design. It‘s fun to do that with the eyes of experience. I hope you all enjoyed it. In
this slot, by the way next semester, I'm going to be doing something called The Life
Force, and I'm going to be looking at—it‘s the first time I've actually done a course
dedicated only to channels. So, it should be interesting. But anyway, to all of you,
as always I'm always grateful to my students. Without you I don't teach. So, it‘s
been fun and I'm glad you've been a part of it. Until next time, whenever there's a
next time, bye for now.
