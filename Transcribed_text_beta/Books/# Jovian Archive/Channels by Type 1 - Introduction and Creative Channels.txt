4 Channels By Type
International Human Design School Manuals and Texts
This book is a transcript of The Channels Course by Ra Uru Hu that was held in Taos, New
Mexico in 1999. The Manifestor & Generator Channels Course was held on April 8-13, 1999,
and the Projector Channels Course was held April 15-18, 1999.
Including over 40 hours of lectures on all the channels in a Human Design chart, Ra also gives an
in-depth view of how each channel adds to the overall nature of the circuit of which it is part. He
discusses at length what quality each channel demonstrates about the entire circuit.
NNNNooootttteeee: Numeric separators – Channels are indicated with a hyphen, like 20-34. A gate and its
line are indicated with a period, like 34.2. Profiles are indicated with a slash, like 5/1.
Color coding: Blue indicates either a Manifesting channel or an individual circuit. Green
indicates a Collective circuit. Red indicates a Generated channel. And burgundy indicates a
Tribal circuit.

Introduction to Channels by Type
This is really the finale of teaching the structure of the BodyGraph in my
experience of teaching the basis of Human Design in Europe, and in following
that process years later here in America. Now we’ve come to the point where
we’re completing the basis or the basic knowledge of how the BodyGraph
operates.
We’ve looked at the centers and we’ve looked at the gates and we’ve looked at
the lines. And what we’re going to do over the next ten days is take a look at
all the channels and take a look at the channels from the right perspective.
Many of you now, we’ve known each other quite a while and you realize by
now that you get certain amounts of information at certain times and you get
no more and no less. I’ve watched analysts struggle with the nature of channels
for years because they haven’t really been taught how they work. They just
know about the gates, but everything in its time.
Everything about a Channel is Related to Type
The fact of the matter is that you cannot truly understand the nature of a
channel until you understand Type, because everything about a channel is
related to Type—everything about a channel is related to Type. And Type is
something that had to wait until you learned all about definition, all the basic
things in Human Design.
There is nothing more important in terms of looking at a chart and in terms of
the power of that chart to be of value to another human being than to be able
to recognize instantaneously what that Type is. And out of that Type to be
able to understand an overall view of the being.
You see, channels can only be understood according to their Type and we only
have three types of channels. We have Manifesting channels, and we have
Generating channels, and we have Projecting channels. Now we do, as such,
have Reflector channels. We’ll talk about that, but that’s a secondary aspect to

Underlying Themes of Type
I want to review with you this morning very important elements about the
nature of Type. And as we’re doing this, I want you to think about the
definitions that you have, and think about the definitions you know about, and
think about them in the context of Type. And the first thing to recognize
about Type is that Type has an underlying theme. Each Type has an underlying
theme.
The theme of the Manifestor is anger. It’s anger. Now think about what that
means. What that means is that every Manifesting channel is a channel that
manifests anger. And that when you look at a Manifesting channel, the 35-36
for example, then you’re looking at a theme of anger.
You see a channel is more than the sum of its parts. It’s greater. It’s greater
than those gates and their keynotes and that you can only begin to understand
the channel by first recognizing its basic themes.
Resistance Makes Us Sick
Now everything about life and everything that makes life suffering is resistance.
You see, in teaching human beings how they can recognize who they are, what
they’re really doing is recognizing how to eliminate resistance. When you
eliminate resistance, then you get your life and that’s what it’s all about: to get
your life.
This is synthetic knowledge and it’s important to understand that being
yourself is about many things. It’s about eliminating resistance, it is about
being healthy. It’s not just about some kind of spiritual equation of being
awake; that’s nice. But you see it’s resistance that makes us sick and it is
resistance that brings anger out of a Manifesting channel.

The Manifesting Channel is Nature
The nature of the Manifestor is that the Manifestor carries the burden of being
the stereotype of what it is to be human. Every child is trained by its parent to
be a Manifestor—every child: do that, do this, be good, be bad, whatever. And
everything about our philosophical concepts of about what it is to be alive and
human is rooted in manifesting. After all, the most important center is the
Throat because the Throat is the center of manifestation and we are here to
manifest.
So manifestation becomes the Holy Grail and the Manifestor becomes the
archetype of how you get to that grail. You are the doer. You get things done.
But, of course, this is the irony of being human, that the credo of the
Manifestor is used as propaganda to condition all the three other types:
Generator, Projector, Reflector. They are conditioned via the manifesting
propaganda and it makes them sick.
Now the manifesting child is a disappointment to its parents. It is
threatening, rebellious, it does what it does without asking permission, it is
uncontrollable, it gets punished. So recognize that when you’re looking at a
Manifesting channel, what you’re looking at is a channel that brings
punishment, and all of that is rooted in the resistance.
You see, as long as you’re living in the not-self, there is no way to escape the
resistance. And everything about mechanics is about recognizing that the
mechanics provides you with basic, fundamental tools, and these mechanical
tools that apply to Type are directly applicable to channels.
Think about the Manifestor. The Manifestor has a job. They hate their job.
Now because they’re a Manifestor and because they suddenly hate their job,
they can just walk out the door. I know. Slam it hard, hit the pavement, away
you go. Everybody’s pissed. And resistance follows you; you get a bad
reputation.
Now if you have that job and you hate that job and you’re a Manifestor, there’s
something very simple to do—very, very simple. Remember being yourself is
accepting form and the mechanics of your form, so it’s very simple. You tell
the person, any person that you’re working with, you say to them, “You know,
I’m thinking of quitting my job.” Now whether they agree with you or not,
16 Channels By Type
when you go out the door and slam it, they’re not going to provide any
resistance.
They’re not going to talk behind your back, they’re not going to join in any
chorus that says anything negative about you. You eliminated the resistance.
This is the only way in which Manifestors can avoid resistance.
Now think about the nature of the manifesting child. What the manifesting
child learns in life is that you get punished, and you get punished if you don’t
ask permission. Now, it’s not about saying “may I,” though that is very much a
part of it. It’s so important to understand that Manifesting channels have to be
trained to be polite and have to be treated politely.
If you have a manifesting child, you treat them with respect. You speak to
them with politeness because that’s what they need in their life. They will
never forget a rudeness, ever, so think about what that means in terms of the
channel.
You take the 35-36. You have a channel that is inherently angry because every
time it has an experience, it’s punished. And every time it has an experience, it
gets punished because it did not prepare the ground and eliminate the
resistance. And if you don’t eliminate the resistance, then you end up suffering.
The second thing is that Manifestors do not know how to ask for help. Think
about that in the context of the 35-36 as a collective channel that’s here to
share. It’ll share, but it won’t ask for help. While it’s trying to make love in the
canoe and it’s tipping over, it isn’t going to say, “Look we need some help
here.” They get their crisis instead.
You have a Manifestor walking down the street and they get a heart attack and
they fall to the ground and there are people all around. They don’t ask for
help. They’d rather die there. I mean that’s built into them. They assume that
they’re only going to meet resistance. “What? Help you?” We have two
Manifesting channels that go directly from the Throat to the Solar Plex. This is
where anger can become rage.
See, everything about being healthy in this life is about understanding the
mechanical nature of how we operate so that you can eliminate the resistance.

When we talk about themes, mechanical themes for each of these Types—and
remember they apply to each of the channels that are a part of these Types—
it’s so important to recognize that by following the mechanical theme, you get
to live out that nature and you get to live it out without resistance. And it’s
absolutely essential because without that you cannot be healthy.

The Generating Channel’s Nature
Now, the Generator and Generating channels are very different. Generators
are the great mules. They’re the slaves of society. They work harder than
anybody else and they work at things they can’t stand. They’re the world’s
greatest quitters. They quit all the time. They’re stuck all the time. They’re
frustrated all the time.
When you’re looking at a Generating channel, you’re looking at a theme of
frustration. But you’re looking at more than that. A Generating channel is
going to be rooted in the nature of the Sacral and the nature of Sacral
response.
And Generating channels (below in red), as opposed to Manifesting channels
(below in blue), have a very different voice. Manifesting channels speak.
Generating channels respond in sound. They live in a different language world.
And it says something very, very basic about any Generating channel: it does
not function unless it’s asked.
Now, by the way, at the practical level, this whole business about Generators
being asked. Generators are here to respond. Now what that actually means is
they are not here to initiate, period. They are not here to initiate anything,
anything. And at the moment that they don’t initiate anything, then they are
ready to respond and they are always correct.
Now that does not mean that they have to be asked a question. A bird can
tweet, tweet, tweet and they can go hmm-mm. That’s a response. Somebody
can be walking down the street and saying, “Jones is two blocks down,” and
they can go “uh-huh” and it wasn’t even someone they were walking with. In
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 11119999
other words, they are here to respond. It is not a formal question. Oh, yes,
sure it can be. “You want to go out?” “Uh-huh.” But it is not exclusively that.
And it’s very important because Generators are the dumbest creatures on earth.
No offense. So they don’t really know anything unless they’re responding.
Unless they’re caught in response, they’re caught in being dumb at a vibrating
level for the rest of their lives. So many Generators suffer in this life working
at things they cannot stand. And what that means is that a Generating channel
is only going to operate out of that response. It doesn’t matter how it’s hooked
up. It needs that opportunity of responding in order to work correctly.
Now, I have this old joke about Generators. That they have this easy path to
enlightenment, blah, blah, blah. All they have to do is wait to respond. No
other Type has an easier way and a more difficult ordeal because the Generator
has to start from scratch, always. The real power that lies in any Generator is
to have that moment in which they truly respond and in responding can
actually stay with things.
And one of the things to recognize, always, about the nature of any kind of
channel is that you always have to see if that channel is in relationship to the
Solar Plex Center or if that channel is individual
in nature (blue channels to the left.) And by
individual in nature, I don’t just mean the
individual circuit.
I include the centering circuit and integration.
All of that is individual. That’s a lot of
channels. Both of those bring in specific
criteria that need to be recognized because they
change the nature of how the channel is going
to operate.
The Nature of the Emotional Waves
For example, in looking at Manifesting channels (image next page), the
difference between the 35-36 which is collective, and the 12-22 which is
individual and both of them are hooked into the emotional system. In other
words, both of them operate in the wave so the authority of those channels is
always to wait out the wave. Ain’t no truth in the now.
20 Channels By Type
But the fact of the matter is that the individual channel, the 12-22, because all
individuality brings the chemistry of melancholy, that individual channel is
emotionally melancholic and that is a much
more profound state of down than the 35-36
which is transitory.
Think about the nature of how the emotional
waves work. It’s something for you to keep in
mind in looking at the emotional system in
clients. When you’re looking at the tribal
wave that operate from the 19th to the 49th to
the 37 to the 40, you’re looking at a wave that
is regular. In other words, the ups and downs
come at regular times. You can say, “Ah, it’s the 26th of the month. She’s
going to be nasty.” In the tribal wave, that tribal wave is highly predictable—its
ups and downs.
When you get to the individual wave, it operates on a plateau. In other words,
individuals can go along for months, weeks, years, relatively at the same
emotional level. And then all of a sudden it
spikes, and it either spikes down or it spikes
up. Most of the time, it spikes down, what we
call the sadness of melancholia, the movement
away from the plateau.
There are occasions when it spikes up and it
can be deluded in terms of its feeling of bliss,
the exhilarated happiness that’s possible at the
other end of that spike. So it’s one of those
things to recognize when you’re looking at
somebody that has the 12-22 and you’re
talking about melancholy in their process, for them also to understand that
that’s not a regular wave for them.
They have a plateau that they move along. That’s why the melancholy can be
such a shock. They suddenly just dive down. And then because we’re always
so busy making up reasons, they desperately try to make up a reason for why
they just dived down and then they end up being depressed because it’s not
about reasons.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 22221111
The abstract (collective) wave, from the 41
to the 30, is sort of a kind of gradual, uphill
movement. There’s a plateau from the 35 to
the 36 and when you get to the 35, you drop
like a stone. This is the experiential wave.
Rising up in one’s desire, waiting for the
experience and the moment that the
experience is over, that it’s consummated,
crashing downwards.
If you have a Generating channel that is
individual, then you know it also generates
melancholy. It simply generates it. And it’s
important to see that it means for that human
being, wherever that channel happens to be,
whatever the nature of that channel happens
to be, that it’s going to be a deep theme of
happiness and sadness in their life. And they
will have to recognize that their creative
potential lies in accepting the sadness as an
environment for their creativity through that
specific channel, rather than trying to make up
a reason for why they’re sad.
If you have a Generating channel that is connected to the emotional
system, emotional Generators, then you
know that you have a very powerful
generation of the emotional wave. But it says
something else. The difference between an
emotional Manifestor and an emotional
Generator is that the emotional Generator is
only going to respond emotionally. The
emotional Manifestor can just simply throw it
out without any control.
This whole business about waiting, people
think that when you’re waiting you’re not
doing anything, and of course it’s not true. We’re alive. Most of us stay
22 Channels By Type
relatively busy from the time we wake up until we go to sleep. Life goes on.
Everything about living out your own design and everything about bringing
somebody else to living out their design is about the day-by-day experiment
with living out your Type. Each new experience that you meet, each new
opportunity that is there in front of you, you meet that through your Type.
You’ll find that in eliminating the resistance, you get the reward you need for
your experiment.
Remember, Human Design is logic. It is theory put into practice. And that
theory put into practice has to be experimented with, to be verified. You have
to verify the experience. Your clients have to verify the experience themselves.
And you can only do that, not by understanding all of this stuff, that’s your
job. That’s what you’re here for. But that isn’t what your client is all about.
They don’t have to become students of Human Design. They have to learn
how to live their design. And they can only begin living their design when they
live their Type. It’s the first step. They don’t know anything about this
knowledge. It’s the only place to start because it gives you the right mechanics
for entering into things and that’s what it’s all about. How you enter into
anything.
See, everything about our existence is movement. We’re caught in a geometry,
the forces that come into our lives. We have forces that are designed to come
into our lives; interconnecting geometries. We’re in a vehicle. We’re not the
driver. This whole thing about recognizing your Type is that you recognize
how you vehicle works. The basics of how the vehicle works.
So the moment you honor that, and whether that’s in your Type or whether
that’s in the nature of the Type of your channel, that’s the moment you start
eliminating resistance, and the elimination of the resistance is the reward. It
makes it so much easier for you to be yourself instead of having all kinds of
people that are putting all kinds of pressure on you to be what you’re not.
The whole thing about generating is to understand that it is a long time process
to get to mastery, and that the only way to mastery through the Sacral process
is step-by-step. And each step has its own timeframe, has its own parameters,
and each step brings the Generator to their place in which they say, “I’m stuck
and I don’t know if I can stay here any longer.”
This is the whole thing about Generators, that regardless of the circumstances,
regardless of whether they are correctly asked and they respond, they still will
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 22223333
have to deal with a built-in mechanism that says we’re stuck. Because what that
mechanism is really saying is, “I want to get to the next level. I want to get to
the next level.” And then when it gets to the next level, it says, “I want to get
to the next level.”
It doesn’t matter that it can look back and see that it has climbed 8, 9, 10, 1000,
a million levels. It’s always going to look back and say, “I want to climb to the
next level and I feel stuck unless I can see that I can get to that next level.”
So if a Generator doesn’t enter in absolutely correctly, there’s no way that they
can stay with things. That part of them that says, “I’ve got to get to the next
level” will drive them crazy. They have to understand how it works.
You see, they’re not in charge of how long they stay at a level. It’s not up to
them. And all Generators have to deal with vanity much more than any other
Type. The vanity that “I can do it, I don’t have to wait.”
I try so hard to tell Generators that they’re kings and queens, that they’re
priests and priestesses in the temple. I try to give them the drippy, every kind
of delicious image that I can come up with for them to recognize their power.
And inside of them they’re saying, “I don’t want to wait. I have to do this and
I got to do that and everybody else says blah, blah…”
Do you understand what happens to us in life? Forget about your individual
design. There’s a very basic phenomena that you should grasp by now about
what happens to auras when we live together in the world. We all have defined
Throats, we all have defined Sacrals, and we all have defined emotional
systems, as a rule, the moment there’s more than three or four of us.
Now, that says something very important. It tells you about the nature of what
it is to be in this life and it tells you that we’re here to work really, really, really
hard because that’s what we’re conditioned to do. Think about the power of
the Sacral Center. The whole world could have a defined Ego, but a defined
Sacral will overwhelm it.
So when we come together, we are emotional Generators that are here to
manifest. That’s quite a picture. So what do you think it’s like for the
Generator? The Generator lives in a world where it seems like everything is
manifestation and everyone is manifesting. And they’re an energy being.
These are energy channels. You’ve got all this energy inside of you and you are
24 Channels By Type
conditioned to believe “I can do something with this energy.” Yeah, you can
suffer with it. You can get sick with it.
See, this is the whole thing about mechanics. Mechanics are very, very, very,
very simple; simple. And there’s no ‘why.’ It just works. This is the whole
thing to grasp about living out your mechanical nature.
The Generator has to truly understand that by being a Generator, it is the most
powerful force on Earth. But they can’t take that in as a concept. I’m already
appealing to their vanity by telling them that in the first place. “Oh, I’m so
powerful.” Yeah, yeah.
When you see their failure rate in their resumes, you can put all that in
perspective. And yet at the same time, how difficult it is for them. How
difficult it is for them to simply just surrender to not being the initiator, in not
being the Manifestor. It’s not their job. It’s not what they’re here to do. It’s
not what they’re about.
You see, in the aura of the world, we have nothing but anger, rage, and
frustration from energy types and that is our world. We all know that. That’s
our world. And wherever you go there’s resistance and everybody is exploding
all the time. And then you tell the exploding Generator, “Well it’s really easy
and all you got to do is wait.” They smile at you, you know. It’s like, “How am
I supposed to make a living, huh?”
Auras. I’m getting to the point that I’d like to have a holographic projector
with me that would show approximately where the hell my aura is so that
people begin to think about what an aura is.
You look at the BodyGraph and you think that all of that is contained in that
BodyGraph. It is not. It’s a picture. The living aura is an incredible thing; it’s
an incredible thing. It’s big; it’s big. My aura is outside. Anybody walking by
there walks through my aura. Our auras are big. We live inside of an aura-
sphere. If you put your hand out twice as far as your outstretched arm from
your body in both directions all the way around—all the way around—and
you’re in the middle of this sphere, that’s your aura.
So what happens? You come to Human Design and you find out about the
structure of the design, you find out about the undefined, and you find out that
people are impacting you by connecting you up in various centers. And then
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 22225555
you start seeing them, but you forget something. You always forget that.
Human beings are forever forgetting that. They forget themselves.
You see, what is defined in you, you put into everybody else. Any time
somebody steps into your aura, you put you in them. Now grasp what that
means. If you’re a Generator, you’re not here to start conversations. You’re
not here to initiate action. You’re a Generator. You just vibrate. Wait for it to
come to you.
Generator Aura Forces You to Ask
So you step into a Generator’s aura and in the moment that you step into a
Generator’s aura, what do you think happens? You take in their power. Now
look, their power and the way it’s designed as a mechanism is that it’s designed
that it’s attracting the other to say something to them. You, the Generator,
don’t have to do anything—you don’t have to do anything. You’re already
doing it. You’re already inside of them and because you’re inside of them,
they’re automatically ready to ask you something because what’s inside of them
demands being asked so they can respond. It’s just mechanical.
Look if you’re a Generator and you get up in the morning and there’s
somebody in your life, do me a favor. Try a little experiment. Get up in the
morning and shut up. Don’t say hello, don’t say good morning, don’t say
anything. That other person is going to die. They will immediately come up to
your face and say good morning. Waiting for you to give them some kind of
response.
It’s just mechanics folks. This is not intellectual. It’s not a concept. It’s a
mechanical thing. You’ve got an aura. You’re a Generator. You put that aura
in somebody else, they automatically will start the conversation, automatically.
They’ll automatically be the ones who make the request, automatically.
When I step into somebody’s aura, they’re automatically prepared to resist,
automatically. These are just mechanisms—mechanisms. You have to
understand what your aura is. It’s alive and it’s powerful and it’s beyond your
body and you put it inside of everybody in your life.
Why do you think so many people are messed up by therapists who have the
best intentions? They don’t know what they’re putting into those people
they’re trying to help. The person that wants to quit smoking that has the
26 Channels By Type
undefined Ego and goes to the therapist that has a defined Ego. “You can do
it,” says the therapist. And the client jumps on that Ego and says, “Yes I can,
yes I can.” And then they go outside and 2 minutes later they go into a tobacco
store and buy a packet of cigarettes and feel guilty for the rest of their lives. It
wasn’t their fault. But the person, whose best intention was to help them, was
placing inside of them willpower without recognizing it. Without knowing it,
without understanding that the client cannot carry it with them when they leave
that aura.
You have to grasp the importance of that. You see, the whole business of
living out your Type, everybody is expecting that everybody else has to know.
I’ve had so many Generators say to me, “But don’t I have to tell them that they
have to ask me?”
To make them feel good I used to say them, “Well, ask. You can tell them
once, go ahead be a Manifestor.” “You ask me, okay?”
That’s not what it’s about. It’s about the power of your aura. It’s about the
power of who you are. You see, because you don’t know who you are, you
don’t know your aura. You don’t realize that you can bring all of that into your
life. You don’t have to set it up. You don’t have to ask for it. It just comes in
and it’s just your aura.
You’re a Generator. You could just sit; you could make everybody around you,
force them physically, force them to open up the door for you to speak to you.
That’s what you’re here for. That’s just your aura. You don’t have to do
anything, nothing.
It’s like the Generator that has to tell them. You don’t have to tell them. If
you step into the aura of a Generator, you know that they’d make a great slave.
You know that right away. Great slave, whew instantly. You get the vibe
because the aura’s there and you’re riding on that Sacral. You have to
understand that. It’s so important because only then can you live out your
Type by recognizing that everybody is going to recognize your Type without
them even knowing that. They don’t have to know that because it’s
mechanical.
They might say to you, “How come you’re so quiet this morning or you don’t
say good morning to me?” and then you know right away they’re the enemy.
You’re not here to say good morning to them. So you don’t have to tell them.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 22227777
All you have to do is understand your aura and experiment with your aura and
experiment with its power.
These Generating channels, there’s lots of them, and they all operate out of
response. When you look at a channel like the 2-14, keeper of the keys, all
about direction, all about movement, but
that’s not manifesting movement. It’s a
response. See evolution is a response.
Mutation is a response to opportunity. It’s
all in the response.
The design of a single cell is the Generator—
the 15-5. Life is a response. When I talk
about Generators being the most powerful
creatures on Earth, it’s because they are
rooted in its very life force. The life force of
our species is rooted in the Sacral Center.
It’s one of those idle fantasies to speculate on a world in which Generators are
doing what they love, the nature of productivity being what it is.
After all, if you’re going to run a business, you’re going to need lots of
Generators, and Generators that are happy, Generators that like their work,
Generators who have entered correctly into their work. These are the best
possible workers you can have. And they feel good at what they do. Now, of
course, that’s not the state of our communal societies and the way they work,
our businesses and the way they work.
Can you imagine how many Generators have jobs where they’re always being
told what to do? Think about the horror. They go from their parents telling
them what to do, to their bosses telling them what to do, and they’re
Generators after all. They don’t respond well to that.
It’s one of those things in corporate analysis, in business analysis, and I’ve done
quite a few lately. To see very clearly that Generators that are working for you,
that if you treat them according to their Type, they’re enormously productive.
They’re not there to be told what to do. They’re there to be asked. “You want
to look after this? or “Would you like to do that?” Then they’re productive.
So in understanding the nature of a channel according to its Type, you get to
see what its limitation is. But more than that, you get to see, because you’re
28 Channels By Type
looking at the mundane when you’re doing somebody’s reading. You get to see
the mundane level of what’s there in that because when you’re looking at
somebody’s chart and they’re coming to you for the first time, you know that
they’re living the not-self.
And you know clearly that if they have a Manifesting channel, they’re angry as
hell. And if they have a Generating channel, they’re frustrated as hell. You just
know that. It’s there. And you can then talk to them about their frustration
and talk to them about their anger according to how they can deal with that by
eliminating the resistance.
A Manifesting Generator Has a Different Strategy
In looking at energy types, there is a,—I don’t even know how to call it. You
could call it a crossover version. We have an awful lot of charts in which the
Sacral Center is a motor connected to the Throat and there are endless
questions from analysts as to whether this is a Manifestor, or this is a
Generator, or exactly how all of that works.
The first thing to recognize about it is that the moment that the Throat is
connected to a motor, it is always a Manifestor—always technically. It’s very
important to understand that—technically.
However, when the Sacral Center is the motor and it’s connected to the
Throat, the Sacral overwhelms in that sense. In other words, the Sacral
dominates by its very nature. Now it doesn’t change that person into a
Generator. It changes them into a Manifesting Generator. And a Manifesting
Generator has a different strategy than either a Manifestor or a Generator.
We know that the Manifestor’s strategy is to eliminate resistance by informing
before it acts. It’s the only way that the Manifestor eliminates resistance. The
Generator eliminates resistance by waiting to respond.
But for the Manifesting Generator, they play out a Generator-like role. In
other words, the Manifesting Generator waits to be asked to use its power.
Now by the way, that gives the Manifesting Generator the easiest strategy of
the energy types.
In other words, the Manifestor finds it exceedingly difficult to inform anyone
of its actions beforehand because it’s been conditioned in its life to know that
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 22229999
it’s going to meet resistance. It makes it angry even to think that it has to let
somebody else know.
But the Manifesting Generator doesn’t have to go through that. The
Manifesting Generator can just wait to be asked to use its power, and instead of
responding can immediately manifest.
Now, often these people are charismatic. That is, often they carry the 20-34.
And there really is an ease and a charisma in action when you see a Manifesting
Generator that is operating correctly. In other words, they’ve been asked to
use their power. Otherwise, you have a frustrated, angry person, you get the
combination. And, of course, that will depend on what channels are defined so
that you can see how that theme really operates within the BodyGraph itself.
But we’ll look at that as we go through our process.
See, the Sacral Center and the Solar Plex Center are very, very powerful forces.
You know, as a personal experience, and for me this is one of those things
about Human Design that is very enlightening in the Human Design process is
to experience long-term transits and their impact.
I have an undefined Sacral Center and for approximately seven years, Pluto in
its transit of Scorpio, hooked up my Sacral Center. So for seven years up until
about a year ago, I was a single-definition generating Manifestor in that sense. I
had, other than my Ego that’s always defined, I suddenly had this Sacral Center
defined and it was fascinating to watch that process.
You see the Ego has its rules. The Ego demands rest and reward. The Ego
will never overwork itself—never, never, never. It will never risk its health and
its well-being and it will only work hard if its properly rewarded. That’s the
way it is.
But the fact of the matter is that the moment the Sacral Center is defined and
connected to the Ego, that’s the moment that the Ego is overwhelmed because
the Sacral is much more powerful. It is a prime motor. The Ego is
overwhelmed and then the Ego being overwhelmed, all of a sudden you have a
real work horse.
Now, I never have worked so hard in my whole life. I never stop traveling, I
never stop moving. I’m astonished that I survived all of that without just
30 Channels By Type
dropping dead somewhere. And it was an enormous relief for Pluto to go
away. It was like ‘yes, good, good-bye, thank you grandma, good-bye.’
So the nature of the Sacral in anybody’s chart, these are themes that you pick
up over the years, and working in analysis you begin to see that these are very
important things for people to understand. People, for example, with an
undefined Ego Center do not know how to value themselves. They always sell
themselves cheap—always, always. They do not have this Ego that says, “I
know what I’m worth. I’m worth a fortune.” The undefined Ego has no idea
and no certainty about it.
And so when you see people, particularly in this day and age, where you have a
huge amount of human beings who are operating as self-employed, whatever,
it’s very important for those people with undefined Egos to recognize that they
are under-valuating whatever their efforts are and that it’s an important guide
for them.
At the same time when you have somebody that has a defined Sacral, you know
right away that they overwork. You just know that about them. They keep at
it too long and it’s one of those things for them to understand that when
they’re doing what is correct for them, then they will only use their energy in a
proper way.
In other words, they will use the fuel that they have for what is correct for
them, and they will not be so exhausted and will not have to spend so much
more time working at things to get them right. Remember that frustration is
built into all of these Generating channels—just built into it.
Think about the 59-6. Here’s an emotional Generating Channel of Intimacy.
Here’s high-level frustration as everyone knows. It’s just built into it. And that
is why relationships are things that we always feel like, at different points, we’re
stuck in because that’s a theme of a Generating channel. And that in order for
any relationship to survive, it has to go through levels and levels and levels and
levels and levels because it’s a generating process.
The moment you grasp these channels within that context, you begin to
understand what is necessary in order for them to operate properly. You have
to take the resistance away and then the channel operates properly. And when
you take the resistance away, what you’re really doing is waiting for your role to
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 33331111
be played out according to your Type—that channel. It doesn’t matter if you’re
a Manifestor.
That Generating channel you have whatever or whatever part you are, it always
carries its own values. Each channel carries its own values. Now, you can
string them together. I will show you how to do that. But it’s essential for you
to see that when you understand how that works, relationships breed
frustration and they breed frustration automatically if you don’t enter into them
correctly.
This is my mantra for you endlessly, because I’m hoping that if I tell you 8 or 9
million times, that you’ll tell your clients at least once. Enter into it correctly
according to your Type, basta. It’s so important to think about that. It’s like
somebody that comes into your life and they have the 16-48. Today we’re
going to start talking—afterwards—about creativity.
When you look at the 16-48, this is a Projector channel which means it needs
to be recognized. It’s very simple. The great artist, philosophers, what’s
written in the 46th hexagram. Art for art’s sake. Everything for its own sake.
Nothing else. Otherwise there’s no recognition.
With the 16-48 you cannot stand up there and say, “Hey, I got the 16-48. Oh,
I’m talented.” And everybody looks at you like you’re mad. They don’t care.
They don’t see it. You see this is the whole thing about not living out your
Type.
The Generator who gets up in the morning and says “good morning” first?
The other person doesn’t hear them. You get it? They don’t even hear them.
They’re not paying attention because you’re not being yourself.
So each and every one of these channels, if you look at them according to the
Type, you’re going to see the mechanism of how to bring that channel out in
the life. Remember, all of you started in your training with definition.
Definition is the fundamental, connect the dots. But now you can see that
where you started with the definition in order to see somebody’s design, now
you can come back to that definition. Because what we’re dealing with now is
how do I get who I really am—my definition—out there in the world living the
way it should. Because this is what this is all about.
32 Channels By Type
In other words, how to bring you out, and bringing you out, by the way, is just
about you not resisting your life. Let your aura do its work. This is the most
important experiment. Let your aura do the work. See how powerful it is.
Understand what that means to put yourself into somebody else and recognize
how you’re conditioning them as you’re doing that. You see, if you’re a
Generator, you’re conditioning that person to ask you. You’re forcing them to.
I was asked this morning if in the kindness of my heart, I would provide a 5-
minute pee break. So just to show you that I’m truly a compassionate man, you
can have a 5-minute pee break.
Enlightenment Lost in the Light
This whole business of four Types and the recognition of how simple that is, 6
billion of us, it’s so important for you to understand that until you or anybody
else can live out their Type that there’s no way for them to get access to all the
wonderful information they have and that swirls around them.
It’s one of those things that is remarkable for me in my process, in my work
over the last 10 or 12 years, I’ve met an enormous number of very intelligent
people who were really dumb. It’s not about the level of intelligence that’s out
there. There are all kinds. In this room here, there’s all kind of knowledge.
There are all kinds of knowledge. It’s not about that. That’s one of the
difficult things that intelligent people have when they come to something that
is an absolute of the Maia that is a pure mechanic.
You see, you’re so used to having to scrutinize everything intellectually. You’re
so used to going through all of the deep, philosophical, conceptual crap that
people go through. Because, of course, you keep on looking for an answer in
stuff that’s impossible to find an answer in, but you keep looking. And then
the moment you find something that’s really fundamental, basic, simple, then
you gag. It’s like, “You mean I have to write? That’s it? That’s all I have to
do? Don’t I have to read any books? Don’t I have to figure out all of this
(blah, blah, blah)?” It’s not about that. It really is mechanical. Just mechanical.
See, this is the true nature of surrender. There’s this whole binary dichotomy
that exists around us. We have enlightenment on one side, that’s being lost in
the light. Many people have been lost in the light through the whole Piscean
Age.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 33333333
And on the other side, you have being lost in the darkness. You have
endarkenment. You have the world of ignorance and evil and all kinds of
things.
Being Awake is Being Aware in Form
And in the middle what you have is being awake, and being awake is being
aware in form. And the whole thing about that is you cannot be aware in form
until you accept the form. And you can only accept the form by living by its
mechanical requirements because it is a vehicle.
There are rules as to how that vehicle is designed to operate and run. This is
your manual. It tells you how to run your vehicle. It says to you, if you’re a
Generator, the only way you’re going to run your vehicle properly is if you wait
to respond and then the vehicle will always operate properly.
You can make up a million reasons for that if you like. It is like each Type, the
font of all of our philosophical concepts. But that’s not what it’s about because
that’s the other way around. See, we started off with all of these concepts
trying to find a synthesis that actually works. So at the mechanical level, all you
can do is experiment with the surface, the Type.
Doesn’t matter how well you know all this stuff in between. That’s for you as
professionals to be able to guide people to a deeper level of understanding of
themselves beyond just that Type. But to live out who you are, only the
surface is necessary because that’s the truth.

The Projected Channel’s Nature
So when you come to the non-energy Types, you’re dealing with something
fundamentally different. And again, to be able to look at Types properly is to
recognize that the Manifestor, and the Generator, and the Projector belong
together in a triangle. In the center of that you can put the Reflector because
the Reflector is different. It’s different.
In dealing with the Projector, we’re dealing with a theme, unlike the anger of
the Manifestor and the frustration of the Generator, here we’re dealing with the
theme of bitterness. These are sweet and sour people.
And when you look at a BodyGraph, you realize right away that there are more
Projector channels than anything else. The whole mental system, after all, is
projected. There are so many Projector
channels. And that’s an immediate
indication that so much of what we are is
looking for recognition.
Why do you think we’re all longing and
yearning at whatever level it is—right
level, right work, right this, right that,
whatever the case may be. We’re filled
with projected elements.
It is a common phenomena in design
with split definitions. Invariably you
have split definitions in which you have
projected elements in that definition. Somebody who has the Ajna to the
Throat and then they have the Sacral to the emotional system. Well yeah,
they’re an emotional Generator with a projected mind Throat.
So with split definitions, you’re going to meet these projected elements. You’re
going to meet them through the projected channels regardless of the Type.
And then you begin to see that to be a human being is to be rooted in
bitterness. It’s one of those things about life. Life is sweet and sour. It just is.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 33335555
The Non-energy Type Implodes
Then there is enormous bitterness in the world. We’re the lucky ones. We live
in a peaceful affluent society. The world is full of bitterness because bitterness
is a human theme and it’s a much greater theme than anger or frustration. It’s
just not as powerful and in that it’s insidious. It eats up the people on the
inside rather than exploding on the outside.
And this is the difference between being an energy Type and a non-energy
Type. The energy Type explodes outwards. The non-energy Type implodes.
Instead of dumping the pain out, they suck the pain in.
If you can recognize how many designs have projected channels, then you see
that part in anybody’s design where they must have recognition and early
recognition. The moment that you see a projected element in a child like the
16-48 that I mentioned earlier, that’s the moment you recognize their potential
talent. And in recognizing that potential talent, give them the energy they need
to pursue that talent. You see, this is the great gift of Projectors. They are here
to be recognized, but that’s a mechanical thing. And again remember the
nature of an aura.
If you’re a Projector and you step into the aura of an energy type, they know
right away and so do you, you’ll get immediate access to their energy and they
realize you’re getting immediate access to their energy. Now that is designed to
be mutually beneficial.
Projectors are here to understand the nature of energy because they’re not
energy types. Remember that the whole business of wisdom, to be wise in
Design terms, is that wisdom is the potential in what you do not have. The
gate you do not have, the center that’s undefined, whatever the case may be.
The Projector, because they do not have access consistently to either the Sacral
or the Throat, that’s what they know. That’s what they’re here to be wise
about, that is the moment they stop identifying with it. And the wisdom that
they can have in understanding the nature of the Sacral and the Throat is
understanding how best the energy of the Sacral and the Throat can operate.
36 Channels By Type
Formal Invitation Brings Out the Best in Any Projected
Channel
Now there is a formula like for all other Types, but it’s very, very different for
the Projector. We’ve seen, for example, many people confuse the response of
the Generator with the invitation of the Projector.
Now invitation simply means that it has to be formal and this is an essential
ingredient to be able to bring out the best in any Projected channel. The
formal invitation. The embossed engraved invitation. The on-bended-knee
invitation. The “let me treat you” invitation. Absolutely essential that it’s
formal. It’s not like the Sacral.
When the bird tweets, the Projector isn’t going to go ‘hmm-mm.’ No, they’re
not there to respond to that because the bird cannot make a formal invitation
as much as it would like to. “Would you like to come up and sit with me in my
nest?” or whatever.
So this business of an invitation, because it’s very important, but it gets
confused because Projectors think, “Oh my God, do I need a formal invitation
for everything in my life?” It gets very heavy for them. The answer is no.
Projectors are Designed to be Recognized Once
You see, Projectors are actually designed to be recognized once. And when I
say once, at least once at a time because this is the whole thing about the nature
of the Projector. They cannot wait for many invitations. They’re waiting for a
specific invitation. And they’re waiting for the invitation primarily from an
energy Type. If you’re looking at just basis of relationships, how important it is
for Projectors to have relationships with energy types because that’s where
their whole future lies in their ability to be able to guide and their ability to be
able to manipulate the energy.
And the whole thing about a Projector is that once you recognize a Projector,
they have access to that energy, and they have access to that energy for life. It’s
just the way that it works.
Long after I’m dead, Projectors will still be making money off of me. That’s
what Projectors are here to do. That’s their job in life. And the moment that
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 33337777
they are recognized, that’s the moment that they can be successful in life and
that’s the moment that they get access to the energy that they need.
If they’re always waiting for invitations, they run into a lot of difficulty. And
it’s one of the things to recognize about any projected element that’s within
you: It’s really waiting for the right kind of recognition, not just any old
invitation.
Remember that just because somebody asked correctly according to your
design doesn’t mean that you have to be grateful and say yes to them. And
that’s particularly true when you’re dealing with Projectors. It’s essential for
them to recognize they are waiting for the right invitation and without that
right invitation it doesn’t work for them. They end up being bitter. And in no
place is the understanding of definition more important than in the Projector’s
design because, after all, that’s what’s there to be recognized in them.
Projector Aura Forces you to Invite Them
And, I have the same thing for Projectors that I have for Generators, because
these are people that truly do not understand their auras and how powerful
they are. When you step into a Projector’s aura, the mechanics of that is that
you’re being forced to invite them. Understand that’s the mechanic.
So, you meet a Projector and you’re interested in them, you step into their aura,
you’re forced to invite them for dinner whether you’re male or female, you’re
forced to pay for it, otherwise it is not going to work. And of course they don’t
have to tell you that, you have to recognize me and you have to pay. That’s not
what they are there to do, all they have to do is put their aura inside that other
person and wait mechanically for the results. It’s just a machine. That’s its
whole beauty.
Once you understand how the machine works, there’s no reason, no need to
have any resistance in your process. And these Projected channels, it’s telling
you something about them. It’s telling you that they may take a long time to be
recognized or not, but it doesn’t mean the recognition’s going to come right
away and it has to be the right kind of recognition.

Human Design is Meant to be Taught to Children
One of the most difficult things in the teaching of Human Design to adults is
always to keep in mind that this is knowledge that’s meant to be taught to
children. Instead of being in a de-conditioning process, we’re in an educating
process. Of course, that’s very different in terms of how quickly that could be
grasped and how effective that is.
It’s much more difficult when you’re involved in a de-conditioning process and
you have all of this stuff that you’ve collected throughout your life that you’re
still holding on to. It’s one of the things about being lucky having the
geometry that allows you to go through the process. And it’s why it’s so
important to keep in mind day-by-day as you go through your Human Design
process that you have to live your Type when you enter into anything.
Otherwise, it’s never going to work for you because it’s got to take over the
cells in your body.
It’s got to take you seven years—many of you are long now into that process—
to get that out. Very different if we’re talking about what this means just in
terms of Type for children and what it means to recognize those elements in
your own child. That’s the most important thing. When you recognize that
you’re dealing with a child that is an emotional Manifestor whose theme is to
go from anger to rage because of resistance, if you know that, for God’s sake
it’s real simple to raise that child.
You don’t have to be the one that provides the resistance. You can help them
learn how to eliminate that resistance in their life. It’s easy then. It’s a big story
when you’re dealing with somebody who’s an adult and they’re a 35-36. Even
with the best intentions—wow, because the not-self is so deeply ingrained in
us. Being a Manifestor is so deeply ingrained in people.
If You Can’t Live By Your Type, Quit Human Design
It’s hard to get rid of all that propaganda. Very few people are ready to actually
live their Type because of the consequences of it. It will take a large wave of
energy to bring that about. That will come. But it’s essential to understand
that that’s your ingredient.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 33339999
You see, if you’re living your Type, it means that everybody who comes into
your life knows there’s something different about you. And what you share
with them in that moment has a much deeper impact.
If you’re a Generator and you wait for somebody to set it up so you can
respond to them—remember, it doesn’t have to be a question—they’ve come
to your power. They’ve come to who you actually are. You haven’t played
not-self to their not-self to show them self. It’s a lie. It’s just a lie.
You have to live by your Type. You have to live by your Type more than
anybody else. That’s the most important experiment for you. If you can’t live
by your Type, quit Human Design, do me a favor. Because that’s the only
thing that’s really worth experimenting with. You already have—all of you—
loads of information. You can keep collecting information. That’s okay. But
if you live out your Type, that information crystallizes in a way that you can’t
even imagine.
It’s not about that. It’s about the mechanism. It’s not about our gift of being
able to deal with all these concepts and terms. It’s about living out who you
are. So when you look at those projected elements within yourself, you have to
look at those elements and see they wait for recognition. They wait for
recognition. I know, I have the 20-57. There’s a projected channel. And I
have Venus in the 20th Hexagram in the 6th line. I’ve got the line of wisdom.
It’s all very sweet.
Nobody recognized that. It waits its time. And it waits its time to be properly
invited. It waits for that recognition and it can’t be pushed. There’s nothing
one can do about that. Have to wait. Yet at the same time that awareness in
the now can be nurtured by recognition. That recognition doesn’t have to
bring with it an invitation. It can just be recognition.
After all, Projectors are not looking for a lot of invitations in life. It’s very
confusing. It makes them very uncomfortable. They’re looking for the right
invitation—basta, nothing else. And then after that what they want is
recognition for what they’ve been invited to. “Recognize what I’m doing.”
So the moment that anyone who has projected channels within them is living
out their Type, they’re going to get their opportunity to be recognized. See,
you don’t have to do anything. You’re all smarty-pants. Well, okay, terrific.
But you don’t have to do anything, sorry.

You don’t have to learn how to drive the car because you’re never going to
drive the car because it’s not your job to drive the car. You’re never going to
change the car because the car is what it is. You’ve got the vehicle that you
have and the driver that you have, now sit back and don’t interfere. Just let the
car drive. And letting it drive means living out your Type and then it drives.
See Your Individual Mythology
It’s one of my goals that human beings get to see their individual mythology
because it is there, each and every one of you. And, of course, you have no
access to that as long as you think that there’s something wrong with where
your vehicle’s going, or you don’t like its color, or you want to change the
upholstery, or you want to take turns driving. All of that stuff. That’s all gone.
Remember something about the nature of awareness: Awareness is driven by
fear. We’re all full of fear. We are all full of fear. It’s fear that makes us
intelligent. It’s one of the great jokes. And it’s fear that can keep you away
from being who you are. Better the devil that you know than the devil that you
don’t, and most human beings will live with a devil they know, terrified to find
out what it’s like to really be themselves. And the risk that it takes for them.
The Defined Throat Cannot Walk
I know so many Generators, who the idea that they cannot initiate anything, is
so difficult for them, particularly the ones that have the Ajna connected to the
Throat or any Throat element involved as a projected element. The Throat is a
trickster, right? The moment that the Throat’s defined, it thinks it can actually
walk. It’s Jesus, walks on water. But it’s all an illusion. That defined Throat
can only talk. But it really thinks it can walk.
So you say to a Generator, “Don’t initiate the conversation,” and they’ve got a
defined Throat, it’s like (sucking in air noise). It’s one of the magical things
about my life. I have a very powerful Throat as you know. And when I don’t
have people in front of me or I don’t have an audience in front of me, I don’t
have anything to say. I learn to shut up. Not very good at making small talk
and I don’t create conversations.

That person who has the defined Throat who’s a Generator, they have to
recognize their truth. If their mind isn’t recognized, if they’re not invited to
speak, why bother. Nobody’s listening. If you have the Ajna connected to the
Throat and you tell somebody the most important thing they’re ever going to
hear in their life, they’re not listening. They’re not listening. They will not hear
it. See it doesn’t work. The mechanics, it does not work. That projected
element when it’s not invited to speak does not work.
This is the whole thing about an aura. You got the Ajna connected to the
Throat and you’re sitting with three or four friends. Your aura’s in them. That
defined Throat of yours, that defined mind of yours is in them. They know
you. They know you can talk a blue streak. They know that ever since you
were a child and you could speak you’ve been conditioned to be a verbal
Manifestor. Shoot off your mouth.
Now the moment you say nothing, nothing, you’ll drive them mad. You will
force them to look you in the eye and say, “What do you think?” or “Why are
you so quiet?” and then everybody is listening. It’s just a strategy because that’s
the mechanism. Just a strategy and then you have somebody who’s actually
listening to you and not you being deeply bitter because you’ve told someone
the most important thing they are ever going to hear and they didn’t pay any
attention.
You’re a Generator who’s a Human Design analyst and you tell somebody that
you meet, “You should really have a design.” You know what that says? That
says they’re not going to be listening. Even if they pay you when they come,
they’re not listening.
A week later they’ll say to a friend of theirs, “I don’t know what that was all
about,” because they weren’t listening because you did not enter into that
relationship correctly. And if you don’t enter into it correctly, it does not work.
And it’s not because you’re not smart enough, it’s none of those things. It’s
just mechanical.
Projected Channels are Fussy
So in order for the Projector to have success in this life, it has to learn to get by
with little recognitions until it gets the invitation that is correct for them.
They’re here to be fussy. And that means that all projected channels are here
to be fussy.
42 Channels By Type
The 30-41 is the Great Sweet-Sour Projected Channel
The 30-41 b50-27y the way is the great sweet and sour projected channel. It
carries both ends of that in the extreme. How in the obsession of the 30 that
life can be so incredibly sweet. “If I can only have this experience, life is going
to be so sweet,” and it’s so sweet
thinking about the experience.
And then the experience, and
then the crash, and the sourness.
“Ah, it wasn’t that good.”
Never listen to somebody who
has this abstract stream of
feelings when they tell you about a movie that they haven’t seen, because it’s
always going to be the best movie in the world. And then if you talk to them
after they’ve seen the movie, it’s always going to be the worst movie in the
world. “Very disappointing. I wasted my time.” Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Because there is so much bitterness through the Projected channels that lie
within us, it tells you something about the importance of the nurturing of an
aura. You see, we’re not separate. We’ve never been separate. We only have
the illusion of separateness. We are always connecting. We are always
connected to the program. We’re also interconnective and that means that
there is a deep human responsibility to recognize the other.
We’re here to recognize each other, and all of our projected elements carry that
and it’s going to be very rare to find charts that don’t have projected elements.
The 44-26 Projects Mutual Recognition
They’re quite common,
obviously. And it means that it’s
a general theme in humanity for
us to recognize each other.
That’s why when you get to the
44-26, which is the creative
channel of the tribe which is a
projected channel, you get to see that what it’s actually projecting out is mutual
recognition. We all get to have the same refrigerator, or the same Ford, or
whatever the case may be.

There’s something else. There’s a gift, and the gift of the Projector is that the
Projector recognizes. It’s not that they’re just here to be recognized. They
recognize. That’s why they’re good at dealing with energy types. They can
recognize the kind, the type of energy, and the way that it can be used
effectively. And their recognition comes out of their definition.
In other words, it’s not a wisdom. Don’t confuse it. Remember wisdom
comes out of what we are not. It’s inherent in the definition of a Projector to
recognize out of that definition. In other words, that same 44-26 can recognize
what can be transmitted. It can also recognize who can transmit. It can
recognize what transmissions work as an example.
It has a gift of being able not only to be recognized, but to be recognized for its
recognizing if that isn’t too cute. When it’s not recognized for its recognizing,
it’s bitter as hell. And, of course, it is not going to be paid any attention to
unless it’s invited to make that contribution and that’s part of the bitterness.
We’re Not in Charge of Timing
The thing to recognize is that the deepest vanity in a human being is to assume
that we’re in charge of the timing. This is a huge, huge vanity. If I had known
and I could choose, I certainly wouldn’t have been dumb for 38 years. It
would have been nice to avoid all of that.
See everything about a human being leads to pain and discomfort in the vehicle
as long as you do not honor it. We incarnate. ‘Carne’ is meat. We come into
the meat. It’s so important to understand that. And the meat is the life.
If you don’t understand how the vehicle works, if you don’t honor the way the
vehicle works, you don’t get to see how beautiful your life is. You don’t get to
see that your life is for you. You don’t get to see that everybody in your life is
for you. You don’t get to see your mythology. You don’t ultimately get to see
your purpose. We all have a purpose, but that purpose can only be realized
when you’re a good passenger in the vehicle. And the moment that you really
surrender to that and you’re living your Type, you’re as awake as Buddha.
This is the great cosmic yoga. That’s what Type is. This is the ultimate
exercise to liberate yourself. And all logical systems demand that exercise. You
44 Channels By Type
cannot avoid it. Each experiment brings you closer to yourself. It’s an ongoing
process.
Identity has to be Recognized
Think about the recognition that exists in our identity. How much of our
identity is projected: the 20-10, the 31-7, the 8-1, the 33-13; these four
channels. In other words, our very identity has to be recognized by the other.
You see, it just tells you about what it is to be a human being.
We’re designed not only to be stuck with each other, we’re designed to work
really hard together. We’re designed to fuck like rabbits. We’re designed to go
up and down in rage and madness. We’re designed to be busy, busy, busy,
busy, busy, busy and that’s what we’re
designed for. And while we’re designed for all
of that, we’re designed at the same time to be
deeply connected to each other in doing all of
that.
See, because when we come together as a
specie and you color in all of those centers
and you hook up all of those channels, look
out! And then you come back and you look at
your own individual design, and you have to
see that the only way that you can deal with
the madness in the world around you, in the not-self world around you, is by
being yourself and not telling anyone that you’re yourself. Let your aura speak
for you. I love that. Maybe it’s a band. “They’re not going to get my
recognition today.”
What is Recognized has to be Nurtured
So in looking at what happens to us the moment we come together with others
is that we become emotional, melancholic. Think about all these things. We
become bitter. We’ve got all this stuff.
On the other side, we have this incredible possibility of being able to recognize
the other, to see them for what they are, and to nurture those aspects that need
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 44445555
to be nurtured. Because the moment you see the creativity there, the moment
that you see whatever it happens to be, it has to be nurtured.
I do a lot of relationship charts. And you look at a lot of relationship charts
and you see that the vast majority of them are Generating or Manifesting
Generators that are emotional. That’s what you get to see. That’s how we get
things done. That’s a sexy combination that works hard. That’s the program.
Now everything about that is correct as long as you enter into things correctly.
That’s the whole point. It’s okay for us to be busy. It’s okay for us to be
sexual. It’s okay for us to bond. It’s okay for us to do all of these things if we
enter into them correctly because then they work.
The Greatest Teacher is Your Aura
And you see, in the beginning when people come to Design, they think they
have to teach the other person Design. Now obviously there is truth in that in
a way. But you see the greatest teacher is your aura. It’s the greatest teacher.
It’s the greatest teacher. Let your aura speak for you and then you get to see
that the experiment works. It really works. And of course that’s the moment
that you have them on your terms.
See, everybody goes around and moans about the compromises and the terms
that they get in this life. Now, you only get your terms when you live out your
Type. There is no other way.
If you’re a Generator and somebody comes to you, you can set the terms. If
you’re a Projector and somebody invites you, you can set the terms. If you’re a
Manifestor, you can remove the resistance. It’s your way of setting the terms.
You can eliminate those things and you get what is right for you and you don’t
have to demand it. You have to live it. It’s the only way.
Day-by-day each new experience, enter into it according to your Type so that
you get to see what the reward is for that. And then you get to realize you’ve
got a great driver, beautiful car, and then you can have a hell of a ride.

The Reflector’s Nature
Deeply Misunderstood
When we come to the Reflector, Reflectors are deeply misunderstood. They’re
misunderstood through the arrogance of the other three Types who have
definition. Because when you have definition, the undefined centers in you
have a stark contrast to your definition. And so they really mean something
special to you in the sense that it’s really a sense of vulnerability. These are
your open centers. You already have an inherent discrimination.
You’re operating out of definition and it doesn’t matter that you only have a
single definition in your design, like two centers connected. As long as there is
definition, there is a sharp contrast between the definition and the lack of
definition.
So to begin with, the Reflector is a totally different being. And the Reflector
operates out of a theme. Not the anger of the Manifestor, not the frustration
of the Generator, not the bitterness of the Projector, but awe. Awe defines the
Reflector. And the other side of awe is disappointment or disillusionment.
You see, there’s wonder in everything to the Reflector. Nothing can be as wise
as Reflector potential, and everything is moving through them. They are much
more in touch with the whole than any other Type. They’re much more
connected to society and the way in which the vibration field of the whole
works than any other Type.
And there are two criteria that are essential for the Reflector. One criteria is
that the Reflector operates in a lunar cycle of approximately 28 days. And for
every Reflector that means that in order for them to be aware, decisions
operate on a 28-day cycle.
You’ve already seen that we have different ways that cycles operate in terms of
how we make decisions; authority. We know that emotional people have no
truth in the now, they have to wait for their wave. They have to sleep on it, for
example.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 44447777
A Moving Definition Theme
Here with the Reflector we have a set program. After all, because the chart is
entirely open, every 28 days the Moon is going to go through all 64 gates and is
going to bring an ongoing sequence that will exist throughout the life 14 times
a year, approximately; it’s going to exist throughout the life, in essence, their
lunar definition. In other words, they have a moving definition theme.
And again, you could say, “Okay, I’m a Projector, but I only have one channel
defined. Aren’t I really like a Reflector? Shouldn’t I really follow the Moon?”
No. No, because a Projector is a Projector is a Projector period. And their
relationship to those undefined centers is very different.
Yes, it’s interesting to see the lunar pattern, obviously. It certainly is going to
have impact on somebody that’s as open as that. But it’s not their decision
making process, because they have definition. Within the definition, they will
have their authority. No, it’s very different for a Reflector. They have to wait
out that sequence.
Now that means that small things in their life cannot be relegated to a 28-day
cycle. It’s not going to be very efficient. “Well I’ll go to the bathroom in 28
days.” It’s not about that. It’s about recognizing that by the time you get to
non-energy types, what they’re looking for is major decisions in their life.
It’s not like the Manifestor and the Generator who are energy types, who every
second they want to be able to do something and they can. When you’re
dealing with a non-energy type, you have seen that the Projector needs to wait
for the right invitation. There may only be one in a lifetime, but the right
invitation.
Now, it doesn’t mean they can’t have a lot of invitations coming at them, but at
the same time that’s not what’s important for them. What’s important for
them is to wait for the right invitation. Now the same thing is true, it’s inherent
in the Reflector to wait out the cycle in order for them to be clear. They have
to wait out their 28-day cycle and while they’re waiting out their 28-day cycle,
they need something very specific.
48 Channels By Type
No Inner Authority Needs Feedback on Decisions
Anybody that has mental definition and everything else open, or anybody who
has the Ajna to the Throat and has everything else open, like a Reflector has no
inner authority. That is, inner authority is the place within you where you have
a decision ‘yes’ or ‘no’ that’s reliable according to your Type and design.
So Reflectors by their very nature have no inner authority. They have
potentially incredible outer authority, obviously. They’re very open, so they can
have a great deal of wisdom as part of their nature. Yet at the same time
without inner authority, they become dependent. They become dependent first
of all on children and they become dependent on others to maintain a reliable
aura for them.
But there’s something else that they automatically do. They automatically seek
out feedback. And this is the most important thing for Reflectors to
remember, they need to get feedback on their decision making process.
So if they have a major decision to make in their life and they wait the 28 days
of their lunar cycle and during that 28 days they ask different people in their life
what they think, to get the feedback, by the time they get to the end of the 28
days, they will be clear in what decision to take.
Now what usually happens if they’re unaware is that they turn their children
into their sounding board, which means that there are children getting involved
in making very, very sophisticated decisions. “No mother, you should not
make love to that man.” When they’re 10 or 12 or 13 years old then they end
up taking on burdens that actually drive them out of the house earlier.
And at the moment that Reflectors can really recognize is that all they need is
good sounding boards in their life, they don’t have to put that pressure on their
children because that’s something they naturally do.
Undefined Channels Represent Awe or Disappointment
But I want you to glimpse for a second that it’s not like the channel does not
include a fourth Type. It does in a sense. It does in the sense that those
channels that we have open, those channels where we have a single gate, those
channels do represent a principal of awe or disappointment for us. That’s
inherent in them. It’s why we’re so attracted to them.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 44449999
The awe of somebody opening up to an emotional system, it’s like wow, you
can get this blissed out, wow. Only to be with them the next morning when
they’re blissed down, when you say, “Oh my God. Does it feel like this? This
is really heavy.” So that awe and disappointment or disillusionment is in every
channel that we don’t have defined. It’s always lingering there.
And of course the whole thing about those undefined channels is that if we
follow the rule of the Reflector, that rule of the Reflector is wait 28 days.
Actually you don’t have to wait 28 days, wait for the Moon to be in that gate
that’s harmonic. Then you can make your decision, and get people to
comment on it, get a sounding board for it.
Remember, the most important thing to remember about a channel is its Type
and that everything about the channel will come into place and come into its
proper perspective—everything. So it’s a key in recognizing that.
But it also means that when you’re looking at the undefined channels in us, do
not forget what they represent for us. This wonder and at the same time
disillusionment or disappointment as a possibility and how important it is for
us to get a second and third opinion about what that’s all about before we jump
into that blindly.
The moment you get to see the overall design, the way the channels are
structured, what I’m going to take you through over these days is to show you
the little mechanics inside the major mechanic.
In other words, you have the level of Type, but built into that Type through the
channels, through the definitions, you have the sub-themes that have to be
dealt with. And we’ll see how these two themes—the general Type and the
sub-themes of the channel types underneath—how they fit together and how
out of that, you have specific tools and guidelines that you can give to your
clients that allow them to enter into the experience when they leave you. And
of course that’s so important.
Lunchtime, break time. I’ll give you 1½ hours so that you’re well-digested
because I’m so sweet. You’re going to have to change the bulb. That’s why
you asked whether there was a spare. If this happens again, I want all of the
28-38s to leave. Nothing personal. That’s right.

The Seven Creative Channels
One for each Circuit
We’re going to begin our process with looking at what are called creative
channels. The first thing is to understand the nature
of this term ‘creative.’ You have to take away, first
of all, the human vanity that associates creation with
being something that belongs to us. “I am the
creator,” which is the great vanity. And it’s not
necessarily about being creative in the context of
what we see as the arts, in that sense, which is very
limited in terms of the creative potential of life.
What’s to be understood by creativity is that there
are seven creative channels. There is a creative
channel for each of the seven circuits. And it is
through that channel in that circuit that the full
circuit has its opportunity for expression. This is
why they are the creative channels. They are the expression of their circuit.
Release the Essence of their Circuitry
And when I say that they are the expression of the circuit, they’re not greater
than any of the other channels that are part of that circuit. Do not confuse that
terminology. In other words, it is their gift as a channel to be able to release
the essence of the circuitry that they’re a part of. So in that sense, they are
creative. They are the key to being able to express the essential nature of any
of the circuits. They become many different kinds of creative lives in many
different ways.
As we go through these seven creative channels, I’m going to use seven
different charts so that you can see examples of that and have a real sense of
how that works. So let’s begin at the beginning and let’s begin with integration
as a circuitry.
(cid:1)
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 55551111
Integration Circuit
We know that the essence of integration is that it’s the prime, founding
circuitry of what it is to be human. It is the basis, the backbone if you will, of
animal man. It is rooted in our primary awareness that is the Splenic awareness
and the Splenic awareness connected to the Sacral
Center.
The archetype, the beginning of life, the beginning
of human life. The empowerment of individual
intuition and individual potential survival
capacities. And in integration, we have the 10 and
the 57. We have the Channel of Perfected Form, a
design of survival. And out of the 10 to the 20,
the Channel of Awakening.
Integration at its key represents the voice of that
20th gate that says, “I know that what I’m doing is
for myself in the now.” That’s the voice of integration. “I know what I’m
doing for myself in the now.” And it is the basis of just simply being alive.
Remember, that awareness is rooted in fear and that the integration system, our
primary system, is rooted in the fear of survival. And that primary fear of
survival, all fear, life and death fear, begins with the 57th gate. This is the prime
gate of fear in the Splenic Center and it is the fear of tomorrow and out of that
fear of tomorrow comes all the other fears.
The 10-57 Perfected Form
So you can see that when we’re dealing with the creative
channel of integration, the 10-57, this Channel of
Perfected Form, you can see that it is rooted in the
deepest of all fears. The very fear for your survival.
That fear of tomorrow. And that it’s connected to the
10th gate.
Now, the 10th gate is a gate of the vessel of love and it is
the expression of love through behavior. It is the
52 Channels By Type
potential to love life itself. And at its highest level, it is the potential of self-
love.
The 57th gate is a gate of intuition and it’s a deeply acoustic gate. It is the gate
of our right ear of hearing in the now. That is, perfected form is behavior that
is conditioned by the right tonal environment.
10-57s Design Environments of Love Survival
The first thing to recognize about the creativity of 10-57s is that they’re always
designing environments. They are our architects, our fashion designers.
They’re always designing environments. That’s their creativity. And they’re
designing environments in which survival will be guaranteed, an environment
that provides protection in
terms of the fear of tomorrow.
The 10-57 is potentially the
most bisexual of all gates of all
channel systems, particularly
when you’re dealing with the
10th hexagram and you’re
dealing with either the third or the fifth line. In other words, people that are
abused emotionally; it can always lead to a tendency through the 10th gate
through the 10-57 to create a different kind of environment in which love can
survive. That environment can be bisexual, homosexual. It doesn’t matter
because it’s not about the sex. It’s about love and the environment of love.
One of the things to recognize about the deep creativity inherent in the 10-57 is
that because it is purely individual and because it is mutative, they truly can
change the environment that we live in. They can literally mutate that
environment and change those who are within that environment as a result.
The 10-57 is a Projected Channel
Now let’s remember what we discussed this morning. It’s important to keep in
mind when you’re looking at the 10-57, this Channel of Perfected Form − it
sounds delightful, doesn’t it − well, the reality is that this is a projected channel.
There is no power here, none. There is the very weak immune system
connected to the identity. Nothing else.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 55553333
And what we know about any projected element is that it requires recognition.
It’s essential for them. A projected channel is also a recognizing channel. It
recognizes the forms. It recognizes the right environment or the wrong
environment in those that are around it. It has that gift. “I could make nicer
clothes than that.” It has that gift.
And yet at the same time, it’s a projected element. It needs to be recognized.
But more importantly, in order for it to get access to energy, it needs to be
invited formally to that energy and the opportunity of that energy.
The architect does not build the house. And the architect doesn’t even do the
drawing unless the money is there. It needs to be recognized and have access
to the energy before that perfected form can come out and it must be
recognized.
Think about the nature of bitterness. You see, these are people that go sour on
love. These are people who go sour on themselves. Remember this morning
when we were talking about Type, one of the things that I referred to was
always keeping in mind the equation of what is individual and what is
emotional because these are forces of deep authority within the mechanism.
The Chemistry of Melancholy Creates an Environment
When you’re looking at the 10-57 and you’re looking at an individual channel,
you are looking at melancholy. You’re looking right at it. Now think about the
10th gate. Here’s a gate of love. Here’s a gate of loving life, but you’re
melancholic. Sometimes you’re happy with life, sometimes you’re sad with life
because it’s a melancholic chemistry and it’s about loving yourself.
And again, that melancholy is a condition of whether you can or cannot love
yourself, but it says even more than that. Think about the nature of what it is
to be melancholic. Melancholy is a chemistry and the chemistry creates an
environment.
That environment at one end we call sadness. That sadness is to be
understood as a creative environment only, only. That’s what it’s for. In that
sadness comes out your creative potential. But the moment that you give the
sadness a reason, the moment you say, “I’m sad because of this and that or
blah, blah, blah” and all that stuff, the moment you identify with the chemistry,
that’s the moment you’re lost. That’s the moment that what is melancholy and
54 Channels By Type
a positive environment becomes a negative environment that we call
depression.
So 10-57s can be deeply depressed and they can be deeply depressed about
their form. They can be deeply depressed about their survival potential. They
can be bitter that life is so tough. They can be bitter that they have to work so
hard to get any kind of recognition because that’s a projected element. It’s
there. That 10-57 needs to be nurtured and it is nurtured by being recognized.
So when you’re looking at somebody’s design and you see that 10-57 is there,
it’s so important for you to encourage these people to live out their design, live
out their Type, because if they live out their Type, that aspect of them that’s so
important, the projected aspect will get recognized.
Frida Kahlo – A 10-57 Emotional Manifestor
Let me give you an example and that’s Frida Kahlo who seems to be quite
popular and reliable in the last four or five years. Here’s a classic 10-57. And
when you’re looking at this 10-
57 you can see that what you’re
dealing with is an emotional
Manifestor. After all, that’s the
Type. You’re dealing with an
emotional Manifestor.
When you are dealing with an
emotional Manifestor that has
this projected element in them.
By the way one of the things
you will notice about doing any
kind of research or studies on
creative individuals is that you’ll
see that channels that are entirely unconscious can produce all kinds of
fascinating creativity because they are not being manipulated in any way in the
quantum of what the personality does.
In other words the personality because it participates with any operation of a
channel, in that participation it affects it. The nature of what quantum is.
When you have an unconscious channel there is nothing you can do, you can
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 55555555
only allow it mechanically to come out. I don’t mean to disturb you but it’s the
unconscious in us that really does the best job. It really does, it is innocent
and wonderful and just does its job and just behaves `according to Hoyle’ and
everything is fine. And then the personality jumps in and says wait a minute,
wait a minute, this can’t be like this.
So what does Type have to do with getting access to a projected channel.
Think about how this works. Aura, this is my big word for the week okay—
aura. So think about Frida Kahlo’s aura. You step into that aura and the
moment you step into that aura, you get that whole blast, eh? You get the
emotional, adrenalized, manifesting rage, all that stuff; wild being in there. But
that doesn’t mean you don’t get the 10-57 as well. You do—you do.
And you see, there is a secret to all creativity, and the secret to all creativity is:
don’t ask why and don’t have any expectation. Just be it—just be it. And this
is absolutely essential when you’re dealing with a projected element. In other
words, it really has to be in its thing and nothing else, to wait to get the
recognition that is correct for it.
So look, think about what happens for her. The moment that we’re dealing
with an emotional Manifestor, remember that we’ve seen that Manifesting
channels − like the 12-22 here − can be anger turned to rage in the emotional
wave. And we know right away that when you’re dealing with somebody who
has emotional definition, there is no truth in the now. The Solar Plex is their
authority, and that authority is that they cannot jump, they cannot be
spontaneous, they are here − and I say this to all emotional Manifestors and
emotional Generators − they are really here to wait things out.
You see the emotional Manifestor, remember how I explained how the
Manifestor gets rid of resistance in their process. They get rid of resistance by
letting people know beforehand what they are going to do. Now think about
what that means if you’re an emotional Manifestor. It means you have to go
through your wave before you can let them know what you’re going to do.
Take the example of the emotional Manifestor that hates their job. That
emotional Manifestor in the low end of their wave is ready to quit in a moment.
Now in that moment if they follow the strategy and they let somebody know
when they’re down, it’s not effective. They depress the other person. They
make them really unhappy that they’re going. It is just simply not productive.
56 Channels By Type
When they’re just at the high end of their wave and they’re ready to just jump
out of there, it doesn’t work. It doesn’t work because they will come down to
Earth. In other words, before they can get rid of the resistance, they have to
wait out their wave.
Now look, anybody that comes into that Manifestor’s aura, they take in
everything. If the Manifestor releases the resistance, gets rid of the resistance,
whatever they’re going to do then, that creative aspect of their nature is going
to be recognized and is simply going to unfold.
And it’s one of the things that’s so important to understand about what it is to
carry any kind of projected element; you don’t have to do anything. Your aura
does the work. And remember that a projected element is waiting for precisely
the right invitation, not any invitation.
Now, they don’t start off sweet or sour. They become sweet and sour. The
moment we have Projector children and children with projected elements who
understand the nature of what it means to be recognized, then they’re not
going to constantly be going back and forth between being sweet and sour. It
won’t be there.
So this 10-57, when you see that in somebody’s design, you also have to
recognize something about the nature of that creativity. It’s very basic. Look
at Kahlo’s paintings, for example, what’s called Primitive Art or Neo-Primitive
or Neo, Neo, Neo,—I don’t know, whatever you want to call these things.
But you can see that this is primary. After all, it’s related to the integration
circuit itself. So when I talk about it being creativity in terms of environment,
it’s very important to understand, environment always where mutation can take
place. That’s the whole key. The key is an environment that is secure enough,
but at the same time malleable enough to continue to be open to mutation.
And one of the things you’ll notice about 10-57 creativity is that they’re always
trying to enhance the individual—always. Whether that’s creating the perfect
physical environment for an individual to live in or the right clothing to put on
their body. There’s a great deal of styling that’s here in the 10-57. And it’s
styling that comes out of this fear of tomorrow, the kind of protection that
we’re going to need. That’s what the environment is all about. It’s about
protecting us.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 55557777
If you explain to somebody that has the 10-57, you have a client and you’re
saying, “Look, you have this unconscious gift in you. You have no access to it,
it’s all in a tunnel. You don’t know what’s going on there. The reality is for you
that at some point in your life, you have to be invited into your creativity. It
has to be recognized in you and it’s going to be recognized in you as a by-
product of you living out your Type because that’s the only way that it’s going
to work. The moment that you’re correctly in somebody else’s aura is the
moment that they can recognize that projected element in you because it will
mechanically pull that out.”
Now, one of the oldest formulas that I’ve used in Human Design analysis is
one I’ve used for splits from the beginning, and that formula is a public place
where you can be private. The moment that a split definition is in a public
place where they can be private, they get advantage of having their split
connected without that being directly controlled by anybody who wants to
influence them.
You’re just taking advantage of
mechanical circuitry that is
around you and in that sense,
you integrate it. So think about
what happens in an aura for
somebody like Frida Kahlo. She
steps into somebody’s aura and
they hook up her split. She’s
putting her aura in them. They
don’t just get the manifesting
part of her that’s out front.
They get the whole thing.
And in most cases, they’re
hooking it up and they’re automatically going to recognize it. “I just hooked
into your 10-57,” because they hook it up and suddenly they recognize it, “Hey,
you got a 10-57.” Now obviously it doesn’t come out in that way, but that is
the way that it works.
You see, we think we’re so smart. There’s just these little mechanisms and all
you have to do just honor your form. That’s what it’s all about. It’s really what
it means to be spiritual. Because after all, you’re never going to get the fun of
the real spiritual stuff unless you honor your form. Otherwise, you’re just too
58 Channels By Type
busy suffering, and it’s a lot of work and it’s a lot of energy, and it’s a lot of
pain.
So you have to begin to recognize that when you’re dealing with any kind of
projected channel, it doesn’t matter what’s going on there. The only thing that
matters is that if they’re living out their Type, it will get recognized because
that’s the way it works.
You see, genetic continuity operates in everything. I can read a chart from the
profile, I can read a chart from the definition, I can read a chart from the Type,
I can read a chart from the lines—it all ends up being the same chart. It’s
genetic continuity. That’s why they’re called views because they are views.
These are different views on the same thing and they’re all deeply, deeply,
deeply, deeply connected to each other. Nobody’s ever really a split.
If you add up all the hours, you’ll find that it’s not a big percentage of the time.
The world’s a busy place and the planets are moving. We have quite a
program. It’s not about that. It’s about understanding that those parts of you
that need to be recognized only get recognized when you’re living out your
nature. It doesn’t mean you go around saying, “Hey, I have the 10-57.” No
one’s paying any attention. Aside from that, people who have the 10-57 don’t
do that. They don’t do that at all because individuality is always getting noticed.
Freaks always get noticed.
That 10-57 is never going to lack for attention or recognition. And yet what do
they do? They scream for it all the time and nobody’s impressed. And there’s
nothing funnier than a 10-57 when their bluff is called and they can’t deliver
because they got no motors, and they haven’t been properly recognized and
then they crash like a stone. And they’re bitter as hell and life is really a sour
thing and they don’t like people after that.
Why Humans Get Ill
It’s one of the things that happens to us when we get conditioned away from
who we really are. We accumulate endless amounts of pain and discomfort
into our lives which we are not equipped to handle. That’s why we get ill. It’s
why we die off. It’s why we have all these things. It’s why most human beings
go through life uncomfortable. It’s just the way it is.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 55559999
And the vast majority of humanity is really uncomfortable with being ‘in the
meat.’ They’d love to be anywhere else, actually. Heaven mostly. Seems like a
good place to go.
The nature of sound, everything about the individual process is acoustic in
nature. And it’s like the Bible opening up with “In the beginning is the word”
and sound, frequency, tone.
Creativity in the 10-57 is Deeply Sensitive to Sound
So one of the things to recognize about the nature of the creativity in the 10-57
is that it’s a creativity that’s deeply sensitive to sound—deeply sensitive; and to
understand that our basic fears are acoustic. The deepest primal fear in us is
acoustic. It’s like hearing the growl of a lion when you’re in the jungle. It’s
really knee-deep scary.
Nothing will pump up your adrenaline more than listening for a sound in the
middle of the night. Crank you right up. And it’s one of the things to see
about the nature of melancholy—the creative process in individuals is always
enhanced by music.
Now whether that is music being created by the individual, or music being
enjoyed by the individual, or music being danced to by the individual, it doesn’t
really matter. It’s not about that. One could be a very creative listener. It’s not
about that. It’s simply about
understanding how important music
is to the individual process. It’s an
essential ingredient. And tone is an
essential ingredient.
Think about the 10-57 and their 6 or
7-year-old child and they’ve just built
a house out of cardboard. And you
say something sarcastic about the
Design, being cute with them. That
tone you use, they’re never going to
forget it, ever. As long as they live,
they will remember that tone and how much it hurt going in.
60 Channels By Type
It’s something to keep in mind about the nature of individuals. They are
deeply, deeply sensitive to tone. And that if they don’t hear the right kind of
tone, automatically they’re alert and automatically they’re going to be resistant.
So to be able to have the right kind of music for the individual is something
that’s essential.
Melancholy is Soothed by Music
It’s like if you have a 10-57 child, make sure that there’s music in its life long
before it can do anything about all that. In other words that the music is an
essential ingredient. The nature of melancholy is such that it is soothed by
music because it is part of the individual process. And of course if you look at
the history of classical composers, something like half of them were, in their
time, classified as suffering from melancholia. And the reality is that it’s
synonymous with that.
The melancholy could be so deep that the individual has to produce music
themselves just in order to deal with their inner tone that’s so uncomfortable,
to change it within themselves. I’m an example of that. I have to play every
day. If I don’t play every day in my life, then the sadness gets internalized
instead of externalized. It’s just one of those things that individuals have to
deal with.
But it’s very important to see that if you’re dealing with an individual that is
projected, that element like here that’s projected, and this is a creative process.
When that child is unhappy, you don’t ask them what’s the matter. You leave
them alone. You don’t turn them into neurotics. You don’t make them feel
like there’s something wrong, but more than that you don’t force them to make
up reasons. “You look sad, what’s the matter with you?” “Well, well I, uh, uh,
uh, yeah, a train went by yesterday.” Make up a reason.
And of course what happens is that the moment you make up that reason,
they’ll make up a better reason for you. They’ll say, “No, no, no. That’s not
true. You’re really sad because of this, that, and that.” And the whole thing
becomes depression and all the creativity is gone and 10-57s are deeply, deeply
aware.
After all, this is a root of intuition. This is a very, very intuitive, creative
process. You can see that in the detriment of the 10.1. That there’s deep
sensitivity in the 10-57. Part of its foundation is to be very upset with any kind
of criticism. After all, it’s individual. And because it’s individual, it’s in denial.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 66661111
All individuals are in denial. “I don’t need you, don’t want you, don’t care
about you, don’t bother me, don’t help me, get out of my face, leave me alone.”
So you have a projected channel that’s in denial that is potentially bitter. And
then you can understand why it’s so difficult for people without understanding
their mechanism how to live with that. So many 10-57s become so disturbed
with the environments that are around them. So the martyrs die, cursing the
environments, and the heretics get burnt trying to change them. And
everything is simplified the moment that you just live out the Type. There isn’t
anything else. Then that aspect begins to function properly. Then that aspect
will get recognized the way it should.
You see, your Type is the only thing that guides you to the correct
relationships. Nothing else does because your Type tells you how to enter into
a relationship correctly. If you don’t enter into the relationship correctly,
you’re not going to get the recognition for that projected aspect in your
definition or that projected channel that’s part of whatever your definition is.
It’s not going to come to you.
It’s not enough to say you can look at my design (Ra’s) and say, “Well, he’s a
single definition Manifestor,” but I have my projected elements. Lots of
them—lots of them. They have to be recognized and they only get recognized
when I’m living out my Type. There is no other way.
And it’s not about me having to pay attention to each and every one of those
channels and say, “Well, you know…”—it’s too complex. It would drive you
mad. All you have to do is see that if you live out the mechanism of your Type,
whatever is there in the genetic continuity is going to get fulfilled. And that the
encouragement that comes in dealing with children is to allow that to come out.
You Cannot Interfere with the 10-57’s Life
And when you’re dealing with an individual and you’re dealing with integration
remember, you cannot interfere with their lives. You cannot do that. The one
thing that they don’t want in their life is interference. That’s why individuals
through the 10-57 always create environments where everyone—everyone—
can be free to exist, everyone including all the ones they hate and all the ones
they would like to have destroyed and all the ones that they think are stupid as
hell. Because the individual knows that if they don’t make room for everybody,
62 Channels By Type
they’re the first ones that get killed. So it’s just basic. Make room for
everybody. That’s why those environments are so special.
But remember, integration is not the way in which we literally meet each other.
It’s very, very personal and individual. It’s extremely self-absorbed. So the
reality is that what they do is create an environment that other people see as an
example. The designer that creates their own clothes first. And by walking
around in their wardrobe, they get recognized. “Would you do that for me?”
Because as individuals they have to be role models and examples, not guides,
not leaders, not witnesses, not teachers—just examples.
And of course that 10-57 is never going to get its opportunity to be an example
unless it’s recognized. And it’s not going to get recognized until it’s living out
its Type, then it’ll get recognized. See, you don’t have to worry about this, and
this, and this because they’re all connected to each other. And it all begins with
the surface which is the Type.
Live Helplessness — You are Not in Charge or to Blame
This is about learning not to get involved in your life. That’s all you’ve done
up until now is being involved in your life, because you thought you were in
charge. And everybody told you, you were in charge because every time you
messed up somebody blamed you. This has been the program through all of
this. And the thing to recognize about this is that you, we, are all helpless
period—basta—nothing else. Helpless, helpless, helpless. And it is a vanity
and an arrogance to assume anything else. Absolutely helpless, so it’s a real
good idea to live that. Not just to recognize it intellectually, but to live it.
The moment you live helplessness, you discover what it is to be empowered.
You discover what it is to get it from the outside. Everything’s from the
outside, I mean where we are in the universe. That’s not where the G Center
is. The G Center is somewhere out there in the sky. So we rent love. That’s
all we’ve ever done. We rent fear. It’s out there—Libra, Scorpio. It all comes
flashing in on the neutrino stream and it goes whizzing by. It’s not ours—it’s
not ours, ever.
You see, the spiritual-mystical teachers all tell you that. They all tell you that
and then they tell you to go pray somewhere or meditate or whatever they tell
you to do. But you see helplessness is a natural state and what it requires is not
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 66663333
to learn how to be helpless, because we are. It’s to give up thinking that we’re
helpful, which we’re not. We’re just not, period.
So this business of teaching intelligent people, how to put their intelligence
over there in the glove compartment, and just sit back and be very, very simple
and mechanical, and then you see that these things come out instead of the
intellectual thing.
The typical student question, “Does it matter that it’s unconscious? Does it
matter that it’s a split definition? Does something else have to be done to this,
to that in order to get that out? Do they have to really be able to see that it’s
the perfected form? Do they have to know my planet, you know?” No.
Because we like to make up reasons, learning is fun. If you want to be
professionals at this business, you got to have all this background information
so you can have fun learning how all that works. But to actually live it out, no,
no, no, no. To live it out, you simply need to live out your Type, then you get
it any way. You get it recognized, you get it fulfilled. It’s simple.
You don’t have to have an agenda or a program for each of these steps in order
to get all of these things to come together blah, blah, blah. But you also have
to recognize that somebody who carries the 10-57 can’t push it in anybody’s
face. They can’t. They just can’t.
I had no intention of bringing Human Design to anybody—none, none. But I
had all these people who kept on taking resistance away from my path. That’s
all they did. They just kept on taking resistance away and then there was
nothing I could do. It’s the way it is.
And that 10-57 that’s in my design (chart
to the left), the environment that can
come out from my creativity; it had to
wait to be recognized. It had to wait for
that resistance to be eliminated. I did not
do anything about it. The moment I
would have stood up in 1987, black
magician that I am, and pointed my
finger at somebody and said, “You let me
tell you about your life.” They run away
quick. No, that’s not the way it works.
64 Channels By Type
And so that aspect, even though it’s part of me as a single definition
Manifestor, it still had to wait for its recognition and its invitation. I had to
wait for my experience with the voice, otherwise it never would have been of
any use to anything. Any projected element in you, you wait for that invitation.
The one that really matters. And in living out your design and living out your
Type, it naturally will come out. It naturally will be recognized and this is the
magic of an aura.
To really understand that, what it means to put your aura in somebody else and
to recognize that at a mechanical level they’re responding to all of that at a
mechanical level. There are all these kind of genetic hooks. Keys into locks
and it brings out mechanical responses. So if you have a projected element in
your design, it’s going to get recognized, period.
Now think of all the people that are bitter about their environment. Think
about all the people that are bitter about the struggle to stay alive in the world.
Think about all the people that are bitter about bad music. Oh, it’s true. I
mean at the end of the 20th Century, there are a lot of people that are bitter
about bad music all the over place, because it’s so diversified. You had more
bad music complaints than you’ve ever had before. When you only had the
local minstrel he was the best ever. It’s just the way it works.
The Simplest Formula Ever
I’ve spent a long time now in bringing Design to people individually and
teaching people how to use Human Design. I have learned a lot in my process
of dealing with all of these human beings. And I recognize that for most of
them, 99.99%, the only thing that matters for them is that they know their
Type.
Somebody’s got to be able to take them through. So there’s always going to be
people that need to study Human Design to really understand it, to really be
able to give it back. But you see this whole business about being awake is not
for the few. It’s for the many.
The simplest formula that’s ever existed that is not philosophy, that is not a
belief system, the simplest formula ever to provide humanity with a way of
being awake is by getting them to recognize their Type and to live it out as an
experiment, because everything else operates through that. Oh, they may not
understand why suddenly they have creative opportunities. It’s not about that.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 66665555
It’s not about them knowing every aspect of their design unless they go and
have a reading with somebody.
Simple Medicine
But what’s important is that they understand that mechanism, because by
understanding the mechanism of Type, all these other things come out. And
that split-definition little girl with that magical 10-57 and its innocence sitting
off on the side, that could be deeply nurtured as long as this human being
doesn’t kill itself with suffering and pain, which is what she did, from anger to
rage and back again—self-inflicted wounds, pain, disease, all kinds of horrors in
this woman’s life, horrors. Not living her design. See, it’s the only way you get
ill, I mean really ill, is by not living out your Type. It’s simple medicine—it is
simple medicine.
See, we’re all designed to be able to handle certain things according to our
Type. That’s our gift, but we are not designed to handle things that do not
belong to us. We’re not. If you’ve got an undefined Solar Plex system, you’re
not going to be able to handle your kidneys well. So you’re going to have to be
very careful because if you identify with that emotional system, you’re going to
have all kinds of physical problems. You just are.
You see, the practical business of Human Design—just the practical business.
My Design Venus in 49.5, practical provisions in revolutionary times. It’s
about being practical.
You see, to be healthy is the only thing that matters. After all, you can be
lucky, you can be rich but if you’re not healthy it doesn’t matter—it doesn’t
matter. Life is a horror when you’re not healthy. And living out your design is
automatically about being healthy, automatically.
See resistance makes us sick. That’s what it does, it makes us sick. So the
Manifestor that keeps on meeting resistance gets angrier and angrier and
angrier and angrier until somewhere inside of them they explode. And a
Generator that keeps on trying to be a Manifestor over and over and over again
and keeps on quitting and keeps on quitting, eventually just stops in total and
absolute frustration. Gives up on life, gives up on itself, gives up on
everything. You see, practical. Live out your Type. It’s just practical. It’s the
surface, yet it’s the most important step you can make.
66 Channels By Type
You see, you weren’t taught, you weren’t brought to Design through Design
being popularized. You were brought to be analysts and future teachers of
Human Design. In other words, the way in which you were attracted to this
knowledge is very different than the way in which the masses will be attracted
to this knowledge.
You have to come in and go through years and years of trying to put the whole
picture together, getting bits and pieces of information along the way as you’ve
had in your process with me. That’s so that you can really be masters of this
knowledge. That you can teach it and teach it well. But it’s not about
popularizing it. The masses need to know their Type. That’s all. It’s simple—
it’s simple.
It’s where everything begins. And the horror of this life is over—it’s over.
And that potential of creativity, that individual mutative creativity will be
recognized. And it’s not about whether it will be recognized, it isn’t. It will be
recognized. The fact of the matter is that that’s the whole point. And that not
all recognition should be accepted. That’s the most important thing.
When you’re living out your mechanic and you’re actually living out your Type
and you’re putting your aura into somebody else, what you are getting from
them when they say to you, as a Generator or, they ask you something or
whatever, the fact that their behavior is correct, it does not mean that they
automatically deserve a yes. The fact that somebody comes to you as a
Projector and invites you does not mean automatically that that deserves a yes.
What it’s saying to you is “they have correct behavior towards me.” That’s
what’s important. It’s the only thing that’s important.
Everything is about the correctness of how you enter into anything. And all of
this complexity that you’re aware of now in Human Design, at the client
level,—remember that we’re talking about the way in which you as
professionals can deal with and provide the client with the best possible
information.
The best possible information is always the simplest. No client can leave you
without understanding what their definition, and their authority, and their Type
is. And if you do that job and if they understand that by living out their Type,
they do get that fulfillment, then you can encourage them to take that
experiment.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 66667777
Now understand the reward. There is a reward system built in. See the reward
for the experiment is you get the satisfaction of seeing that it actually works. It
gets you into trouble too because when it actually works, then you’re really
stuck with it. And every time that it works for you, it gets stronger.
Remember, you’re changing the cells in your body breath-by-breath, moment-
by-moment in a process of regenerating your life as a different being as who
you are, and it doesn’t matter.
Responsibility of an Analyst
When somebody comes to you and they’ve got a complex life. After all, people
come to you because they’re messed up. They don’t come to you because
everything’s terrific. You can’t do anything to help them with their
relationships and their problems and what they think they should do with their
career, and this and that and all of those things. Because the moment that you
tell them about their Type, it’s the only way in which all of that will get
corrected any way. It’s as simple as that because that’s where everybody has to
start—everybody.
The future is made up of those who will start with Type and learn later. You’re
the other way around. You’re the basis of the professional foundation of being
able to provide people with quality analysis. That’s what that’s about. But
don’t bring all this stuff that you know to them because you just burden them.
Every once in a while you’ll find that you have a client that you know wants to
become a student. That’s different. They’re different and there are not a lot of
them. They’re there and you’ll know. But your job with them is to awaken
them and awaken them according to your Type.
Remember that if you’re a Generator and you tell somebody they should have a
design, it doesn’t have any impact. They would have to ask you. They have to
be able to come to you and they have to be able to say, “Would you do this for
me?” Then it has impact.
Up until this time when you would look at a chart like this, you would be
working out all of these strategies of gates and lines—all of these things. You
see, we’re at the end of a process together. I’m taking you back to the simple.
That’s what it’s all about. We’ve gone through all the detail. It was like when
we went through the 384 lines. We nearly all died going through that detail. I
mean detail upon detail upon detail.
68 Channels By Type
We know how profound all of the information is, but it’s time to take you back
to the simple and take you back to the responsibility of an analyst. Because the
responsibility of an analyst is to give that client the keys they need, the logical
keys they need to walk out and begin their experiment. And that doesn’t mean
that they can know much about Nodes and this and that. There’s endless stuff
you could tell them about.
But what they have to leave with is the sense that there’s something that they
can actually do about it. There’s something they can try. There’s something
that they can genuinely experiment with. And it’s that experiment, it means
everything. Remember, it’s just pure logic. It’s pure logic. You have to have
that experiment in order for it to be grounded as fact. And then you have to
experiment again to be reassured that it’s fact and again, and again, and again,
and again. Eventually it is absolutely clear and you’re yourself.
So don’t confuse your process. For many of you, you’re actually going to have
a harder time than a lot of people who will just meet the surface because you
know so much now. It’s different. And you really have to see that that’s one
part of you over here. That part of you over here that has a track and a
geometry towards guiding people to this knowledge. That’s over there.
But remember you, for your lives, you have to stay with the simple. You have
to stay with the Type. And most important of all, you have to honor your
Type when dealing with your clients because only then are you truly going to be
successful because only then are you going to have your rightful impact on
them. And let’s face it, Manifestors, Generators, Projectors, Reflectors, they’re
each going to have different impact on their clients. It’s obvious. They work
differently.
Live Your Type to Get your Terms
Projectors are intent on bringing out the recognition. A Reflector analyst says,
“Isn’t this all incredible.” They each have their way. You got to honor that.
And you have to recognize something about the nature of aura, that the
moment that you’re living out your Type, you’re going to get those clients that
belong to you who really are in what I call your fractal line. Who really meet
you. Who are there to take that in. Because when you’re living out your Type,
you get your terms. You get the terms.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 66669999
And everybody’s struggling and compromising and it’s not what this life is
about. You don’t have to and everybody thinks they do. It’s this manifesting
propaganda that everybody has from birth and you all got this manifesting
propaganda. It’s unbelievable.
I still have Generators that still come up to me and say, “Does waiting mean
doing nothing?” and they sort of say that with a kind of “does it mean doing
nothing.” What they’re saying is, “I can’t do nothing. Can I still be waiting?”
And the answer is yes. Yes, keep vibrating and while you’re vibrating wait.
The whole thing about being in movement, we are all flying in space. We’re all
moving. Recognize that it’s just all a vast movement. That’s its beauty. And
the moment that you just allow your driver to do its job, you’ll see your place in
that movement. You’ll see the harmony of life. You see the way that it all
works instead of wondering why it works the way it does.
Simplicity Makes the Obscure Obvious
The beauty of simplicity is that it makes the obscure obvious. This is the
difficulty for all of you in coming to Type—the obscure is more exciting. It’s
just more exciting. We humans in our reason hunting, we love all that stuff.
Give us something simple and we say, “Come on let’s make it complex. Let’s
make it hard for them to understand. Let’s leave things out,” whatever the case
may be. Human beings are funny when it comes to knowledge.
Now when it comes to simple things, even when they grasp it, it’s amazing how
much resistance is there in their conditioning. It’s amazing. What’s funny to
me is the recognition that people really think that everything—everything is
complex and it’s not. We started off with a simple binary. A binary moving in
space, that’s life. Life isn’t complex. The Maia is complex, life isn’t. It’s just
the illusion of how we perceive this life with our funny little boxes up there on
our shoulders.
The 10-57 Establishes One of the Primary Codes of
Behavior in Humanity
One of the things to be clear about in the 10-57 is that it establishes one of the
primary codes of behavior in humanity. Now the 10th gate can operate three
different ways. That is, it can operate as following one’s convictions to the 10-
70 Channels By Type
34 and it can operate through the 10-20 awakening and obviously here also in
perfected form.
The thing to recognize clearly about the 10th gate is that the 10th gate is the
gate that conditions the behavior of all human beings. And so the creativity of
the 57-10 is a creativity that’s there to enhance in
the environment the potential for human
behavior. Now that can be controlling the
environment to control the behavior, or opening
up the environment to expand the behavioral
possibilities.
But it’s always about being able to get the
behavior to be correct in order for survival to be
guaranteed, like teaching kids at school how to
respond to a fire drill. Or creating the necessary
environment, an orderly environment, quiet
environment, attentive environment necessary
for survival. And this is one of the main jobs, in
that sense, creatively of the 10-57 is to be able to provide environments that
allow for all kinds of behavior. So you can see how you can end up with gay
communities.
You know, create a new environment—a mutative environment—to provide a
way for that behavior to be able to survive or any kind of cultist community or
any kind of ashram. It doesn’t really matter. It’s all coming out of that 10-57.
One of the more interesting aspects of the 10-57 is its religious side effect.
In other words, that the 10th gate being part of the mystical stream, the 10-57
is often involved in creating environments for faith. So the designing of
churches or the designing of robes that priests wear and all of that being a part
of it. And in doing so, hoping to be able to impact on the general behavior.
Again, that usually starts because it’s creative. It usually starts by someone
being an example. And one of the things to recognize about individual
creativity is that individual creativity is never about being best—never, never
about being best. It’s simply about being different.
When you get into collective creativity, then you’re into the competition of
what is best because it is about mastery. But there is no mastery, in that sense,
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 77771111
in the individual process. There is only creativity as a by-product of the
individual life. One of the things to recognize about having individual children
is about encouraging their uniqueness, encouraging their expression of their
uniqueness, because that’s where their creative power lies.
Never Forget The Binary of Channels
In creating environments, one also has to see that every single channel has its
binary. So when you’re looking at this creative Channel of Perfected Form,
you can also see the channel of imperfect form or unperfected form, if you will,
or the ongoing “we’re trying to do the best we can” perfected form.
Never forget the other side. And the other side of the perfected form, the
design of survival, is the unperfected form, a design of potential disaster. Lest
we forget the binary.
Without the recognition, you’ve got imperfect form. It’s as simple as that.
And again the perfection of the form comes from the recognition and the
recognition is inherent in living out the Type. It’s a chain reaction through its
genetic continuity.
So the 10-57 tells you something very funny about life. After all, integration is
the beginning of our human process. And I used to have a joke, I used to say
the first villains were architects. They separated us from the sky and took us
away from stars. Right there in integration are these villains built in. The thing
to see about that is that out of the 10-57, we lose our animalness, perhaps the
most important thing to recognize about it. You see, the 10-57 covers its
naked body. That’s something for you to ponder. We have a 15-minute break.
If you can figure out that one, you’re really good.
Individuality Creativity: I am Art
In looking at individual creativity, one of the things to be clear about individual
creativity is that the three individual creative channels—the 10-57, the 8-1, and
the 25-51—they all originate in the Self. Individual creativity is always about
their identity—always. They are their art.
72 Channels By Type
I am art. I don’t make art. You are it. And this is the whole thing about
individual creativity—individual creativity is literally in the identity and out of
the identity. And that, of course, is going to
make it different than other kinds of creativity.
It also is amusing to note that these three
different versions of individual creativity are all
projected elements. None of them have the
capacity to manifest. None of them have the
capacity to generate.
Individual creativity specifically is about the
identity being recognized. That’s why when we
give a label to somebody who is creative, we call them an artist. We give them
that as an identity. You even have Prince who changed his name to The Artist.
That’s classic. I am art. I am the art. I do not make or create art, I am art.
That’s cute. I never know what I’m going to say—the nature of individual
creativity.

The Knowing Circuit
So we come now to the knowing circuit. We leave behind integration, and the
thing to recognize is that integration and the creativity of integration is a very,
very personal piece of business. It’s personal in that integration, in and of
itself, is not open to the other and thrive
best as an example.
But the moment you come to the
knowing circuit, you come to a circuit in
which empowerment is its theme and its
design to connect. In other words, the
creativity of the 8-1 is a creativity of
empowerment. It’s empowering
creativity and it’s about as mutative as
you get.
If you go back to the beginning of your
Human Design education, you were told
that there were two creative channels: the 16-48 and the 8-1. You’ll see as we
go through all of these creative channels, the recognition through the 8-1 and
the 16-48, these are the creative aspects that we most identify with the arts and
that kind of creativity, and it’s important to recognize that. It is in the 8-1 and
the 16-48 that we have the kinds of artists that impact deeply on society, but in
what we call the arts.
The 8-1 – The Only Creative Voice of the
Individual
Now the 8-1, because it is a self-
projected creativity, remember that
it has to be recognized. And here
you have something unusual
because here you have the only
creative voice of the individual.
Now it’s interesting to note that.
This is the only creative voice of
the individual and the only creative voice of the individual says, “I know I can
make a contribution or not.”
74 Channels By Type
In order for the individual to be truly creative, they have to empower the other.
Their natural contribution is the empowerment of the other. The 8-1 is rooted
in the most creative, the only hexagram called creative, in that sense, which is
the first hexagram.
When you look at the fact that individual creativity is all rooted in the identity,
that’s the first thing. The second thing to see is the 10th gate in the 10-57 is
about love, and the 25th gate is about love. And the two loves, at that level, are
universal and self-love, and the 1st gate is the primary gate of direction. That is,
a primary gate of what we call mutation or evolution.
Remember that the direction we move in mutatively is conditioned by the 2nd
gate, that is the opposite of the 1st gate in the zodiac, and it’s the opposite of
the 1st gate in the design. And the 2nd gate is the actual direction, the driver.
But the 7, the 1, and the 13 are just perspectives. That is, the 7’s perspective is
where the drive will lead to in the future, and the 13’s perspective is where have
we come from in the past. But the 1st is just there driving. And it’s driving in
that direction following the 2nd gate’s lead. It’s there to bring the existential
mutation—the existential contribution. It has a voice and that means that the
primary creative function of the 8-1 is acoustic and verbal.
There are a number of opera singers. I can’t remember which are which
because I did a whole group of them. But I think it’s Jose Carreras and
Pavarotti that both have the 8-1, but I’m not sure. (Note: Both have Gate 1 only.)
But any way, this is individual verbal creativity.
Mutative Impact Comes Only from Explaining
You see, the individual cannot really have mutative impact unless it can explain
itself. This is the whole nature of the impact in individual circuitry; the
individual has four different gates in the Throat, after all. So expression for the
individual is very, very important—very important.
So the ability to be able to explain oneself is everything. After all, the 8th gate is
a gate of holding together. It is a gate of assimilation. By being able to explain
oneself one makes the contribution. Do you see the inherent selfishness in
that? Because it’s important to grasp that. Individuals are not communal.
They’re not there to share. They’re not there to support. They’re there to
empower and empower only.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 77775555
So the 8th gate, by explaining itself, empowers the other. In other words, it’s
not trying to empower the other. It’s trying to explain itself. And it’s a
projected element, which means that it cannot explain itself unless it’s
recognized. It can’t. It has to wait for that recognition.
One of the ironies that one gets to meet in Human Design is by using many,
many different people and charts. This is Diego Rivera, who of course is the
man who was involved with Frida
Kahlo. They were involved with each
other throughout most of their lives.
He’s the man who painted these famous
murals in Mexico City. Also quite a
character.
And here you can see that in this
example we have the 8-1. This ability to
be able to explain oneself. Now you
can see that that explanation, though, is
primarily verbal and he was somebody
who, like a lot of painters, got into philosophy. He liked to talk a lot. He was a
Marxist, a Leninist, and he had his whole story.
But the reality is that it also means that contribution, that explanation can be art
or it could be music. And it’s one of the things to recognize about Rivera
because he’s a classic example of this, that the murals he painted (see example)
were self-explanatory. You could see
the poor people suffering under
oppression and you could see the
liberators coming and smiling and
you could see this whole thing
explained for you. Because that’s the
whole essence of individual creativity:
the capacity to be able to explain
oneself. And of course that’s not
about being best. He wasn’t a very
good artist.
If you technically look at that and Diego Rivera’s mural depicting Mexico's history
at the National Palace in Mexico City.
everything else, you’ll find that there
are many, many, many, many artists who never had his fame or notoriety who
76 Channels By Type
technically were better. It’s not about that. Nobody had ever done that before.
At least not in the modern way. He was different—he was different. He was
just being himself which most people felt was really too much because he was a
too much character. If you look at that design, you can see that he was being
busy being too much.
Diego Rivera – The 8-1 plus the 20-34
Remember that whenever you look at the 20-34, always remember that the 20-
34 only says, “I am busy now.” Always keep that in mind when you look at
that. So, he was busy making his
contribution—busy, busy, busy in
order for that aspect of his nature.
And again here’s a classic example of
what is often very confusing to an
analyst in a chart. You look at this
chart and you see that the Throat is
connected to the Sacral. So you have
the Throat connected to a motor
which means that this is a
Manifestor, but it’s connected to the
Sacral. And we know that the Sacral dominates in the sense that it changes the
strategy for a Manifestor. So the Manifesting Generator has to wait to be asked
to use his power.
But this is a Manifesting Generator that’s emotional. And we know whenever
there’s a defined Solar Plex Center, it is automatically the authority in the
design. No truth in the now, wait out the wave.
So this “I am busy now making my contribution; I am busy explaining myself”
has to wait to be asked. Then it can instantaneously get into explaining itself.
However, it’s emotional. And that emotional nature of it means that it just
can’t jump like that. It has to wait. So somebody has to come up and say, “I’d
like to commission you to paint the wall of my building.” And no matter what
the response is in that moment, there is no truth in that moment. There is only
the waiting. And this is somebody who has to wait out their emotional wave.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 77777777
But of course when you’re dealing with a client, you have to keep that simple.
You begin with “try sleeping on it.” That’s what you’d say to an emotional
person, try sleeping on it. That’s the first step. That they can handle. They
can wait a day. They won’t die. It’s good for them. Sleep on it.
That emotional conditioning in this design, that emotional authority in this
design means that in order for that person to live out their creativity properly,
they’re going to have to wait to be asked to explain themselves. And in order
for the work that they do to really be a contribution and really be charismatic,
they have to be asked.
By the way, he was notorious for that. There were always people pursuing him.
He had a reputation of somebody that everybody wanted something from him,
and of course he was always saying yes. You can see that in his design. That
29 there going “yes, yes, yes, yes” and of course disappointing all kinds of
people. Typical of people with a 29.
You also have a projected element here, the Channel of Community, all
unconscious. “Where are all these people coming from?” he says. “How come
they’re my friends. How come I’m hanging out with them?” Doesn’t make
any sense to this person, none - disconnected, unconscious.
And yet the only way the community in them can be properly recognized and
the only way in which they can enter into community properly is by living out
their Type, which means living out being a Manifesting Generator. Waiting to
be asked to use your power to manifest.
Guidance and Nurturing Individuals is Key
One of the keys in individuality, particularly the 20-34 and in the 3-60 is the
need for guidance. It’s an ongoing theme. And that is guidance without
control, guidance without any guarantee of influence, guidance simply as
encouragement, empowerment, out of love for no necessary reward.
And of course not every 20-34 or 3-60 is going to be able to find that kind of
support system, but it’s essential for them because otherwise they end up
burning enormous amounts of energy and it serves no purpose other than
making them very, very depressed.
78 Channels By Type
In looking at the 8-1, this business of not being best is about nurturing the
individual. And by nurturing the individual, that is guiding the individual but
trying not to influence the individual. In other words, you can guide them
away from things. You can’t influence them into things. It doesn’t work, but
you can guide them.
Formally Invite, Don’t Pressure
So when you’re dealing with an 8-1 and you’re dealing with this projected
element, to guide them is a simple matter. It’s a matter of inviting them. So
let’s say that there’s an 8-1 in your life. You have a 10 to 15-year-old 8-1. You
can invite them into what we call the arts. You can invite them to have piano,
guitar lessons, saxophone, whatever it is they like, painting lessons, sculpting
lessons, dancing lessons—and have to be invited into that. Not told to do it,
not asked to do it but formally invited to do it. Then you can encourage them.
That formal invitation to recognize their talent that is inherent in them is to
open up a whole possibility, a whole spectrum of creativity for them. But then
comes the next step and the next step is don’t allow them to succumb to the
peer pressure of the program they enter into. This is the whole thing about
individuals. Individuals don’t listen. They’re not designed to listen. They
don’t want to be influenced, so it’s very hard to teach them.
You can invite an individual Projector, but it doesn’t mean that they’re going to
accept and it doesn’t mean that you can teach them. And remember, you
cannot pressure them. That makes them very bitter even if it’s the right thing
for them. They don’t like that. The invitation is what matters. What you find
out of that is that you can invite them to many things to find out what works
for them. It doesn’t mean because you invite them to take ballet that they’re
going to be able to dance. It doesn’t mean that. And if you’ve got a Projector
who is from the Throat to the Self and there are no motors, you can be sure
that they’re going to have a tough career. So it’s not about that.
It’s simply about recognizing that in order for that talent to be nurtured, it has
to be invited and it has to be invited at an early age. Now think about the rest
of us here, the 8-1 that is a mature person. Their great creative opportunities
are not behind them. This is much more difficult when you get to collective
creativity where mastery and being the best is essential. The later you start, the
harder it is.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 77779999
But for the individual it’s not true. In other words, that spontaneous magical
mutative creativity can come at any moment in their life. But again, it’s rooted
in that recognition being there, and that recognition is only going to be there if
they live out their Type. Because this is a voice, the nature of this voice and its
ability to be able to explain itself is essential.
Does Your Voice Come from Your Mind?
Now very few 8-1s ever hear their own voice. You see, we live in our mind
trip. Everybody’s in the mind trip. On this recent tour, I did use many
different teaching techniques than I usually do, and I did an introduction that
was entirely informal. It had nothing to do with teaching people about how
Human Design works. I just wanted to shock them because that’s my nature.
I started off by asking them if anybody knows where their voice comes from
and of course they don’t. They have no idea where their voice comes from.
The assumption is it’s the mind that does all that. That’s the assumption. You
ask the average human being, the average 6 billion out there, where their voice
comes from and they’ll tell you it comes from their mind, and then they feel
very uncomfortable because, of course, it’s not true. It’s just not true. Yes,
some people have a voice like me that comes from the mind, but it’s not true
for everyone. It’s a matter of your design.
So here when you’re dealing with the definition, when you’re dealing with the
8-1, you’re dealing with a channel that speaks out of the identity. It speaks out
of the identity. Now in order for somebody to hear that voice, they have to
stop trying to get their mind to speak. And everybody is busy trying to get
their mind to speak—everybody is busy trying to get their mind to speak.
They’re always writing scripts, they’re always having phantom conversations in
their head, they’re always preparing. They’re always trying to get it out the way
they think they should get it out.
And then when their time comes, they babble and burble and none of it comes
out the way they want and then they’re really upset and they think they have a
problem with their mind. And their mind didn’t know anything about it in the
first place because it wasn’t supposed to be there. It comes out of their
identity, in this case.
80 Channels By Type
The Mind Recognizes as a Projected Element
So one of the things about understanding the nature of your design is the
recognition that you have you to hear what you recognize. Remember, that’s
one of the great gifts of a projected element. That’s why the mind is
wonderful, it’s all projected. The mind’s here to recognize things. All the mind
ever does is try to recognize things.
So you have to see the gift. It’s not just about being recognized. We all carry
these projected elements at some level or another. It’s about seeing that the
recognition is inherent in it. It recognizes things. That 8-1 makes its
contribution by recognition, as well. “I know,” it says, “I know the way, I
know the truth, let me explain it to you.”
But that doesn’t come out of the mind. It comes out of the deep need inherent
in the 1st gate, to express one’s self, not to express anyone else. And the
moment that individual creativity loses its power is the moment that it tries to
be like anything else, the moment it tries to copy, the moment it tries to
pantomime. It does not work.
Why the Education of Individual Children is Difficult
It’s why the education of individual children is difficult. It’s difficult because it
may not never truly be for them. But then we have the way in which our
society is structured and it makes it very difficult to give them that opportunity
to just be who they are, to just nurture that. My work with young people is to
encourage individuals to enjoy being different, to enjoy being the freak.
I like to tease them and play with them. Now, I can; I’m a freak myself. To get
them to think that that’s cool, because it is cool. Why not? And for them to
really enjoy that. For them to see that they can play the game because there are
always rules that you can never do anything about.
But the reality is that they’re not here to be influenced. And you see the real
individual, if you have a four-year program, the real individual needs seven
months. They need the first seven months and they should never graduate.
The first seven months, go away and then out of that, mutate it. Because once
they have the basis, then they can go to work being mutative but they have to
have the basis.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 88881111
Now, of course we don’t have a society that permits that. We can’t take our
individual children out of school. We can’t say, “Okay they’ve learned how to
read and write and do mathematics. Now I want them, and I want them to
have their own life.” We can’t do that. Hopefully, there’ll be a time when
that’s permissible. That society allows that.
You have to remember we’re interconnected. It’s the most difficult thing in
the world to come to be yourself because of the conditioned aura that you live
in. We all have the same feeling when we get back together again. Many of us
as a group—there’s quite a few of us here who have been working together for
a long time—and then you come back together again after not being together
and all of a sudden everybody’s together with the same knowledge and
everybody’s together with the same kind of approach to awareness. It’s a
totally different feeling—it’s a totally different feeling.
We are in an aura bubble of our own here and in an aura bubble where we are
allowed to be able to enjoy what design is about. It’s about people. It’s about
us integrating properly with each other. It’s about being honest in our
connections, in our relationships in the way in which we deal with each other.
And of course on the outside that’s very difficult because it’s all chaos and you
take that whole aura with you wherever you go. That’s why it’s so important
for you to concentrate on the simple: live your Type. If you keep on
concentrating on living your Type, you’ll see that it’s a great shield against the
chaos of the world around you.
You’re all like Maytag repairmen. It’s a lonely business and you really have to
see that you need to have your shield. You need to have your protection. By
the way, if you release that on tape, I want money from Maytag. Fuck them,
eh. (laughter) Not going to get it for nothing. Just my sense of humor folks.
It’s amazing I haven’t gotten into more trouble than I have.
Bitterness in the Voice when Individuals Can’t Explain
Themselves
The nature of bitterness in the voice is the whole thing that you get to notice
about individuals when they can’t explain themselves. There’s this terrible
sourness in their voice. They usually tell you that you don’t know anything.
Without the recognition, it’s not enough that you’re an 8-1 and you step into
82 Channels By Type
somebody’s aura. And in stepping into their aura, they recognize that you’re
ready to make a contribution and they call that out by inviting it. Because, you
see, if you’re not ready, if you don’t know how to explain yourself, it isn’t going
to help that much.
In other words, yeah, it’s going to be correct and they’ll sort of get a little bit of
what you’re trying to get across to them. But that’s one of the deepest focuses
for individuals, for them to recognize how important it is to be able to explain
themselves. And some of the deepest individual creativity is just explanation.
You see, explanation brings mutation. I mutate you. I mutate you by
explaining to you how it works. That’s all I’m doing. That’s my job. All
individuals are geared to do that—all of them, all of them.
The 8-1’s Role is to be the Voice of Direction
So it’s very important to see that this 8-1, in the nature of its creativity, is really
here to mutate through its explanation and mutate through its explanation
rather than what it does because it’s a verbal gate. In other words, the primary
function of this channel is to be the voice of direction. It’s their role. So,
there’s Diego painting all these revolutionary walls, eh. “I’m the voice of
direction. This is the direction. Let me empower you with the way.”
Listen to Your Identity Speak
And the next criteria to this channel is to keep in mind that it’s individual and
therefore it’s melancholic. And you see the only way that an 8-1 is ever going
to figure out how to explain itself,—and remember that’s not mental, oh don’t
miss the point here. You see, it’s not like you practice in your mind what
you’re going to explain. No, no, no, no. It’s about learning how to listen to
your identity speak. And the more you learn how to let your identity speak, the
wiser and clearer it will become.
I have this 43-23 unconscious mind and everything about my mental field is
unconscious. So when I was young—not just young, through the first half of
my life—I was always trying to get involved with what I was saying. I wanted
to be a part of it. It felt kind of funny that I would say things and I didn’t
know why I was saying them. So I’d always try to sort of get in on the game.
Very annoying. And of course it ruined explanations. Suddenly I would think,
“I have to say this or that or whatever.” The mind just processing. Now, I just
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 88883333
sit still and open my mouth and I just let it come out because it is my nature. It
is what’s natural.
8-1 Creativity is Not Nurtured on the Mental Plane
The whole thing to recognize about the nature of explanation and the 8-1 is
that it’s not creativity that’s nurtured on the mental plane. It’s creativity that’s
nurtured through letting go to hear one’s real voice—the voice of that
identity—and let the voice of that identity speak. And it’s not mind-speak.
And you see, once somebody understands that about their Throat—that voice
is not coming from my mind, that voice is coming from my identity and that
identity is my direction in life—you start hearing who you are. It’s very
surprising.
The other thing is that because this is a projected element, a projected channel,
it demands that it gets its invitation. And you know that the moment you’re
looking at invitation, there’s not many of them that are really worthwhile.
There isn’t. Not everybody can be mutated. I know that. No matter how
good you are, no matter how good I dance, there are some beings that are just
not here to be mutated. Well, what to do?
Not every invitation is to be accepted. Again, it’s dependent on your authority.
Your Type brings correct behavior. Your authority establishes what you can
say yes or no to. And then that ability to be able to explain oneself becomes
art.
Oh, it is magical to hear an 8-1 weave an explanation. They take the
rationalizing at the mental level and turn it into an absolutely beautiful gift.
They explain their knowing and they explain the knowing of their identity.
They explain the knowing of direction.
So we’ve seen that the creativity that comes out of the 10 is about establishing
environments to enhance the individual life to protect it against the fear of
tomorrow. And the creativity of the 8-1 is a direct mutation of the direction of
the whole and a direct mutation primarily by what one can say, and secondarily
by what one can do. In other words, it’s not enough to be able to explain a
direction if it is not your direction. Oh, that’s tough to do.
84 Channels By Type
You are the direction the moment you’re responding to the nature of your
Type. You are the direction. You are always in the right direction. It’s the
motor of evolution. It’s an evolutionary process. We have to come to grips
with the form. And the sooner we come to grips with it, the sooner we’re
going to be able to enjoy all of this stuff that we know so that we can see it in
perspective. That we can see our relationships in perspective, that we can do
things in our life that are rewarding.
The Job of Individual Circuitry
And remember that a creative channel expresses its circuit. The 8-1 is the
expression of the knowing circuit. It says that knowing is the direction. Only
knowing is the direction. That’s why when you get to the 2nd hexagram, the 2nd
line you have genius as madness, knowledge exclusively as power. It’s all about
knowing our direction. Through the individual process it’s all about knowing.
And it’s about explaining the knowing to empower and mutate others. That’s
the job of individual circuitry. Without it there is no mysticism, there is no
magic because it is evolution. So when you’re dealing with 8-1s, they become
exactly what the channel calls them, the creative role model. The example that
stands out or stands down. The living example of difference.
Difference is often exactly what is needed. And because this is a projected
element, the creativity of the 8-1 is waiting for that moment in which it is truly
recognized, then its explanation has mutative quality. But they can be creative
in any way. 8-1s can be everything from opera singers to piano players. It
doesn’t really matter. They’re rarely good dancers. They’re often very good
actors or actresses.
The 8-1’s Contribution is Expressing Individual
Evolutionary Direction
There is a very powerful verbal gift here and they are the real expression, along
with the 43-23, the 23rd gate and the 8th gate, they’re the real expression of
individual processes. The 23 expressing the individual mind where the 8
expresses the individual evolutionary direction. That’s what that contribution is
all about.
So think about what happens to somebody with the 8-1 when they don’t
mutate somebody else. They’re bitter. They’re just bitter. “I gave them all this
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 88885555
good stuff.” And of course the moment you’ve got an 8-1, what you have if
it’s a pure projected element is a verbal gunslinger. You have somebody who
talks first.
The moment that you have somebody whose Throat is connected to the G
Center and they’re speaking first, you know that they’ve worked for half an
hour beforehand to figure out what they want to say. And then finally they
blurt it out and it’s not what they wanted to say and then they’re in trouble.
The other thing is the gift is to be able to explain oneself. Now, what happens
to most people when they try to control their speaking from the mental plane is
that they focus on one pattern or one structure. In other words, they say, “I’m
going to explain it this way. I’m going to talk about this, and this, and this, and
this.”
And they think that that is going to be successful for them in being able to
explain themselves, when in fact, the recognition that they need is not about
their pet explanation. The recognition that they need is for their capacity to
explain—to explain.
What that means is when somebody comes up to them and initiates them,
somebody comes up to them and says, “What do you think about the Kosovar
situation?” blah, blah, blah. In that moment that they get initiated, that’s the
moment that they have real power. That’s the moment that they have
influence.
Now, the fact of the matter is that they weren’t prepared for that question.
They were prepared for something else. But you see, they’re designed to be
explainers and their real recognition comes not from trying to tell somebody
their favorite explanation, but waiting to be respected as an explainer so that
eventually they’re going to be asked for their pet. It’s all about being able to
explain.
Somebody with the Self connected to the Throat can never figure out, can
never organize, can never plan what their explanation’s going to be. They
can’t. It’s not about that. It’s about realizing that you’re there to explain and
that basically you can explain just about anything—just about anything—if you
wait to be recognized. If you wait to be asked—whatever the program happens
to be.

This is one of the ironies that you have with intelligent people who have
defined Throats. They’re exploding inside from rage, frustration, and bitterness
because nobody’s paying any attention to them. They’re screeching inside.
And the other part of them is saying, “Nobody’s paying attention to me
because I’m a fool and I don’t know anything.” Humiliation on one side,
whipping and all that stuff that people go through. It’s just not necessary—it’s
just not necessary, that’s the whole thing.
The Self speaks for love and direction and yet the only voice that speaks of
love that comes out of the Self is the 20. The 25, part of the 25-51, the creative
channel of the centering circuit, there’s no voice there. It’s so important to
understand this aspect of this creativity. That this is the great verbal creativity,
to really be able to assimilate, to provide the virus of mutation and to put it into
the other.
The 8-1 Processes its Sadness within the Identity
Melancholy. The Throat connected to the Self that’s individual and suffers
from melancholy, that sadness is going to have to be dealt with. And that the
sadness is the creative opportunity. Now think about how that works.
What that really means is that when this Self connected to the Throat is actually
sad, what’s going on is that rather than its processing the sadness at the mental
plane, it’s processing that sadness within its identity. And it resolves it, in that
sense, out of that sadness, the creativity. So what that means is that if you’re
melancholic and you’ve got the 8-1, don’t try to explain things to people, and
don’t accept invitations.
In genetic continuity, everything having to do with individuality operates out of
moods. It’s about moodiness. You cannot explain yourself, even when you’re
invited, if you’re not in the mood. You can’t. And it’s not the time for you to
do that because when you’re not in the mood, your identity, in this particular
case, is being creative. That’s its process.
When you’re up, when you feel good, when you’re happy, when the melancholy
subsides, when the sadness drifts away, that’s the moment when you’re open to
invitation. That’s the moment the opportunity can really be there for you, and
that opportunity, again, is to be able to explain yourself and in doing so, mutate
the other.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 88887777
Recognize Who Can Listen
The other thing is if you’re a good 8-1 and you know how to wait, you’ll be
able to recognize those who can listen to you. And that’s one of the things
about individuality and its need for attentiveness. Individuals by their very
nature are trying to figure out who will listen to them so that they can have that
possibility of explaining themselves to them.
In living out your Type, if you carry creativity in your design, you’re
automatically going to get that opportunity for that creativity to come out, to
understand the definition itself. To realize that in this definition of the Throat
connected to the Self, what that demands in terms of the limitation of that.
The power that’s waiting when you’re invited and it’s the right time for you and
you’re in the mood and you just let it come out and you don’t think about it—
magic, magic. That’s the moment you begin to realize that whatever is
connected to your Throat, it has its own language. It has its own way of
processing your life. It has its own way of expressing who you are. And it’s
not up to the mind. It can be, but it’s generally not.
The other thing is the whole nature of what it means not to be recognized. To
be recognized means that that channel itself has to elicit the recognition. In
other words, somebody sees that you’re ready to make a contribution.
Somebody, again if you’re an 8-1 and you get up in the morning and you don’t
say anything, that will drive whoever’s in that house crazy. They will beg you to
make your contribution. “Please say good morning to me,” and then you can
make your contribution and then it works.

The Centering Circuit
The 51-25: Initiation
Minor circuits have enormous power and the real power of this circuit is in the
10-34 because, at that level, it’s generative
and so it is an energy channel. And we’ll
look at that when we get to the Generating
channels.
The creative aspect of this minor circuit is
the 51-25, the Channel of Initiation, a design
of needing to be first. People often confuse
the design of needing to be first, which
seems to be highly competitive, with
individuals not here to be best. And it
seems to be something that they see as a
conflict in terms. It isn’t. It isn’t at all. The 51-25 can try to be the fastest but
it doesn’t mean they’re going to have the best running style.
The fact that they want to compete doesn’t mean that that’s about being the
best. It’s just about a drive to compete because they are about initiating things.
They are about beginning things. And of course herein lies the joke: The 51-
25, the Channel of Initiation, is a projected element. That has to be a joke.
This Channel of Initiation, this mystical Channel of Initiation, has to be
recognized. It’s a projected element. As a matter of fact, all three mystical
channels are. They’re all projected. It’s all about recognition. Allahu Akbar—
Only God is great. It’s all
about recognition. And it’s
all about waiting for that
invitation.
The 51—I know, I’m a 51-
25. To be an initiator, you
have to be invited to initiate
people. “Would you do my design, Ra?” “Oh yes, I will. You asked for it.
You’ll get it.” But it’s the way that it works and it has to be that way because
there is no other way. It doesn’t matter whether I am a Manifestor. That’s just
the strategy for me of my overall mechanism.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 88889999
But each of these different channels that are a part of my design or are a part of
anybody’s design, they each have their own laws. Each with their own law
rooted in their Type. So it doesn’t mean that my initiation is always
manifesting. It’s not true. It doesn’t mean that I’m always initiating. It’s not
true. You’ve got to ask for it. If you ask for it, you get it. That’s the way that
it works.
So it’s very important when you’re looking at the nature of your design now,
look at these channels. Look at them according to their Type and see that each
and every one of them have their own program. And the moment you’re living
out your Type, that program automatically works. Remember, I’m not telling
you you have extra work to do. You don’t. I don’t have to worry about
waiting to be invited to do a reading for somebody. As long as I’m alive people
are going to be asking me to do that. It’s just there.
It’s the Type that sets you free of having to get lost in all the nitty gritty. How
do I deal with this, how do I deal with this channel, how do I deal with that,
how do I… It isn’t about that. It really has to come to you and it comes to
you through the way that you enter into things. The most important
framework that you need in your own process, in the process of any client, is
this recognition that how you enter into something determines it.
The Cities Inside of Us
I often tell the story that inside of us we have cities. And these cities that we
have inside of us, we have a very good neighborhood where we put our loved
ones. We have the business section for all the people that we deal with at the
commercial material level. We have apartments for visitors. We have casual
residences for those who come and go.
But the thing to recognize is that the moment you take somebody into your
geometry, you’ve got them for seven years unless they renew their lease. That
means that if you have a one-night stand and it’s over, you still got them for
seven years. They’ve got this little place inside of you.
Now think about what that means for you in your life if you’re not entering
into things correctly. You’ve got all kinds of people living in your city who
don’t belong there and they distort the way that whole operation works and the
way that whole city functions.
90 Channels By Type
We’re all carrying, human beings carry inside of them, thousands of people.
You have no idea how many people you carry inside of you. There are so
many human beings in your life and if you start adding them up—how many
people you have contact with—you’ll start recognizing what kind of impact
that is on your aura. The numbers are vast and they all have a place inside of
you. The person behind the checkout counter that you see every other day,
you know, blah, blah, blah…endlessly.
So how you enter into things means that those people that come and live inside
of you for their seven-year cycle, that means if you’ve got a lover and you’ve
had a horrible time and it’s terrible and it’s over, you also have to recognize that
you’re going to carry it around for seven years. It’s much better for you to be
correct going in. Then if you leave your lover, you don’t carry any baggage.
Oh yeah, they still have a place, but they can live there in peace and you can
have them in peace living there.
But you can only get out correctly if you get in correctly. That’s the whole
thing. It’s a real Catch-22 when you start late in life. That’s why any of you
who come at this point in your life, I admire your choiceless courage. I don’t
want to give you too much credit, okay? It’s what it is, because it’s what you
have to deal with.
So entering into things correctly is very important. What it means is that for so
many of you, you can’t get out of things correctly yet. You’ve got a lot of stuff,
a lot of people who are a part of your life that you can’t get out of correctly.
It’ll come by the way, but it takes time.
You learn about that by entering into things correctly and seeing how those
things work. And I’m not just talking about the important relationships in life,
which is obvious, I’m talking about any relationship. If you walk into a shop
and you’re a Generator or you’re a Projector, you wait until they ask you if you
want something. I mean stand there and stare at them. They’ll ask you. “Can
I help you? Would you like something?”
Your relationship with them is correct at that point. It’s correct. If you go up
to that counter and say, “I want that.” They say, “No we don’t have that
today.” Because that’s what happens to you because it’s not correct. Not only
that, they may not even hear you.

The Step-by-Step Warrior’s Process
It’s not just about big things, it’s not just about love, it’s not just about your
career. It’s about every single encounter in your life. This is the warrior’s
training and of course you’ve got to go through that process because you’re
older. Kids don’t have to do that. You have to do it.
Step-by-step, you have to have the warrior’s perspective, that step-by-step,
everything that you enter into, you enter into correctly. Only then do you get
it and only then do all these other things that are inside of you that are so
beautiful come out.
When I do somebody’s reading, I look at somebody’s design. I see who they
are. I see their mythology. I see their beauty. I’m always overwhelmed by that.
It’s astonishing to me and then I feel their energy and I feel the pain and the
disappointment in their lives. And I look at that chart and I think Jesus, this is
so incredible and it’s true for every design. There is no difference.
The whole thing is that you have to get that point where you take the
experiment completely to its absolute. In other words, you just surrender to
living out your Type. Then you find out and you find out quickly. And then
that relationship that you have with the person who sells you a product over
the counter, not only is it correct, but you’ll notice that the relationship works
really well.
And that every time you walk in, they ask you, “Hi, what can I get you today?
The same thing?” They’re right there. They’ve learnt the game. They’ve taken
in your aura and they know what to expect. “That one who never says
anything, did you notice that dear?” “This one just comes in and waits for me
to ask them.” They get it and you have a correct relationship. And you don’t
just stand there trying to figure out what to say or what to order. The moment
they ask you, you know.
Runs through You Like a Waterfall
And see, the simple mechanic runs through you like a waterfall. It touches
everything. It touches every aspect. It touches your definition. It touches
everything, because in genetic continuity, they’re all one thing. That’s why it’s
so important to recognize that that’s the key. It’s the key for you to be able to
live it out. It’s the key. It’s the only key. There isn’t any other.
92 Channels By Type
You’re not going to get any closer by me teaching you more. You’ll just
become better analysts. That’s another story. But you don’t need me to teach
you more to understand what it is to live out your Type because it’s real simple.
You know, that’s the irony.
Oh yeah, you can keep on saying, “I need more information, I need more
information.” But that’s not what it’s about. That’s about learning Human
Design, it is not about living out your Type. Living out your Type is living out
your Type. All hypocrisy aside. This is the process.
Instant Gratification: Shut Your mouth in the Morning
And you see because it’s an experiment, you can get the reward. It’s about
instant gratification. I’m a North American Buddha. Instant gratification is the
way. Get your instant gratification. Shut your mouth in the morning and see
how funny it is that everybody is desperate to get you to talk.
Enjoy the experiment, and in enjoying that, recognizing its validity day-by-day
as you encounter the other. Enter into it properly. Just keep on doing it. Each
reward brings you closer to the point where it just happens naturally for you.
That’s its beauty. It takes three to four years for that to happen.
Tomorrow, we will continue with our creative channels. Don’t any of you dare
not be your Type for the next ten days. You’re never going to have a better
chance of experimenting with support around you. Be clear that you share
your designs; most of you know each other’s designs. Those of you who don’t,
make sure that the others do. It’s your chance for the experiment.
Live out what you are. The support mechanism is there. See how it works.
When you go out of here see how that works. That’s what it’s about. After all,
that’s what you’re teaching people to do. That’s what you’re bringing them to
by being analysts.
Ultimately, you’re bringing them to the Type. You have to be that, you know.
You’ve got to live that. So you’ve got to be involved in that experiment all the
time.

Caring for & Nurturing the Melancholic Individual
Being a parent myself and going through this process of dealing with children
in my life, you want your children to be happy. It seems to be a natural
condition. And if you have a melancholic child, every time that child is
unhappy, there is a pressure on the parent that says, “I got to make my child
happy. Something is wrong. I’m doing something wrong or there’s something
wrong in their lives.” And of course, this reason-making becomes an affliction
eventually. In other words, that individual child is not allowed the integrity of
its sadness.
So in nurturing the individual, this concept of “not caring,” in that sense, is
about not being concerned that you have a child that doesn’t smile all the time,
because it’s okay. You see, the moment you try to encourage them out of their
sadness, the way they translate that is that there’s something wrong with their
sadness, that they have a problem.
Don’t notice It
Now, of course, this is incredibly important to recognize in terms of your adult
relationships with people that are emotional or melancholic. Not only is it not
for them to make reasons about that for themselves, but it’s not about you
making up reasons for them as well. When you see that person in your life and
they’re down and you know their design and you know they’re melancholic,
don’t notice it. Don’t pay any attention to it. It is what they are, and it’s okay.
It’s okay. It’s just their process.
So, in dealing with this creativity that originates out of the identity that is
individual, you have to see that it is very, very important in terms of children
and how they are dealt with. You can see why the adults who don’t know
anything about this, that have never had that opportunity, why they have so
many problems in their life. The individual is always a freak.
The Individual is Always an Outsider
Remember that we’re talking about the channels that represent the expression
of their circuitry. Everything about being an individual can be found in the 43-
23 that is this ‘genius to freak’ equation. The fact is that the individual is always
an outsider—always an outsider. And in always being an outsider, unless it
can explain itself, it always feels like there is something wrong.
94 Channels By Type
It’s so easy in a communal environment that is collective or tribal to reject the
individual outsider. As a result with children, there is this enormous pressure
on them to conform to whatever the peer pressure happens to be, to try to give
up their difference, to be ashamed of their difference, to be uncomfortable with
their difference.
And remember that our institutions are created by collective minds to
homogenize the social process and that the individual is always an outsider in
those institutions—always an outsider in those institutions whether they do
well in them or not; they never really fit.
Now, of course, if you nurture a child to understand their difference and
appreciate it, they will learn to recognize that they have their impact, and that
they can enjoy being in a collective, communal environment. But we know that
human beings don’t have that privilege. All of these individual children have
gone into environments where they’re made to feel terribly uncomfortable
about their difference.
Individual Creativity Maintains our Evolutionary Progress
Again, this knowledge is for children, and yet the individual has a unique gift.
And that unique gift is that the individual creativity maintains our evolutionary
progress and there is no better place to see that evolutionary process…
(Note: Audio problems began, followed by a comment from Ra: “Mercury in 36,
communication difficulties and crisis is what we have today.”)
The 51-25 and the Mystical Stream
The 51-25. It’s fun for me to do that today. I’m a 51 Sun, so it’s my channel.
There’s something very magical about the 51-25 and it’s magical in the
evolutionary sense. It’s so much fun for me—the BodyGraph. I’ve been
watching the roads and tracks and movements of energy in this BodyGraph for
a very long time. It’s often surprising to me that students miss the obvious,
because so much of Human Design is obvious.
I’ve been doing so-called mystical readings for a quite a while now. And those
of you who have taken the gray course with me know about the mystical
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 99995555
stream. The mystical stream starts in the 19th gate and goes to the 49, the
Channel of Sensitivity.
In this channel of tribal sensitivity, what we have is the roots of animism, we
have the roots of tribal ritual, we
have the roots of what we call
sacrifice, all of these things.
And then you have the 37-40
which is the bridge. It’s the
mystical seeker’s road. The 37
says, “I want God, I need God, I
know God is there.” The 40 says,
“You’re full of shit. There’s no
God. I don’t need anybody.
There’s nothing to believe in.”
And when you look at that track
and the way that it’s moving on
the inside here, its natural
movement is not to go to the 21-
45. Its natural movement
mystically is to cross and to go
directly to the 51 through the 25, Image from Rave Cosmology course “The Mystical Way”
to the 20, and up to the 10, to
complete the mystical process. You can see that this is actually the only circuit
of its kind in the BodyGraph that purely links two different circuits.
The Material Tribal Stream
If you look at the tribal stream on the other side (see the image on the next
page), the other way around, you go from the 54 to the 32, the 44 to the 26,
and that crosses and goes out the 21-45. That’s the material side. And that
goes to honor the tribal rulers.
But you see, the tribe’s looking for something else in its community, in its
yearning, and in its denial of God. It’s looking to be mutated. It’s looking for
evolution. We’re tired of sacrificing animals. What’s next? They’re looking for
96 Channels By Type
mutation. And all of a sudden, what is a tribal channel, part of a tribal stream,
merges into an individual channel - the Channel of Initiation.
This is my traveling salesman’s joke. You know the individual, the traveling
salesman, is allowed to come into the village.
The farmer, not reluctantly, slyly says, “Yes, you
can stay in my barn,” just so that he can make
love to the farmer’s daughter. So that he can
bring in new genes and then under a shotgun
begins to look just like everybody else in that
little village. But the new genes have been
incorporated into the genetic pool and the tribe
will not die of evolutionary stagnation.
You see, without that individual, there is no
evolutionary growth for the rest. The collective
is only made up of tribes. That’s all it is. Tribes
strung together, and strung together through a
collective perspective that allows the individual
tribes to live together in a collective sort of harmony.
The 25-51 Initiates Evolutionary Mutation of the Tribe
It is the job of the individual to mutate the tribe, because the tribe is always
ready for a traveling salesman—always. So
here’s the magic in the 51-25. This is why it
is the Channel of Initiation. It is the place
where the tribe is initiated and it is the
creative act of evolving. You see, this is
where the art of priesthood was created.
In these three different individual processes,
coming out of the identity, we’ve seen out of
the 10th gate and in the 10-57 that we have a
channel where it is the environment, the
creativity of being able to create
environments to enhance human survival. In the 8-1 what we see is the
mutation of human direction. And what you see in the 51-25 is the mutation
of human spirituality.

The Lines of the 25-51: Every Kind of Spiritual Guidance
If you study the lines of the 51 and the 25 and you go through in the
progression from the foundation to the
6, you have every single kind of
priesthood, spiritual guidance that you
can imagine. They’re all there. All of
them are there.
You see, this is the only place where the
“I” and the identity, the Self, meet. It’s
the only place. The only place where the
Ego is given its higher purpose. Most of
the Ego is about the material, the will
power necessary to drive the communal
process of a specie and the necessity of strong communities in order for us to
be able to survive, to continue to procreate. But you see that’s not enough for
the tribe. It’s not enough for the community. It’s not enough to bind people
through a material mechanic. It’s not enough.
The Tribe Gets Infected at the Individual Level
There are too many mysteries and there are too many questions and this leads
to the tribe moving towards another direction, and what it moves towards is
the initiation of each individual within the tribe. And I use “individual” not as
a circuit, but as each specific person within the tribe. This is the way
everything changes, that the tribe gets infected at the individual level.
This is not a collective mutation. This is not about the Supreme Court passing
a law for everyone. This is a true mutative, evolutionary process in which each
and every single person has to get infected, and of course that never happens.
It’s always a struggle.
The Two Principles of the World Bind All of Us
You can see that we live in a time of the greatest struggle of all. We live in a
time of—certainly at a mythological level—something really spectacular. You
see the two principles of the world. The two principles of the world are
witnessed through the 51 and the 21, these two channels - the Channel of
98 Channels By Type
Initiation, and the Channel of Materialism. These are the basic principles that
bind all of us, all of us. We have already united
the planet through the 45-21.
This day and age there is no society that’s outside
of the world pool. We are all connected, wired
together. And at the material level, the world is
one. It’s one market. It’s one business. And of
course, that has created an enormous backlash
because the material plane is incredibly powerful.
Everything about being an animal is about having
enough material—everything—and the material
plane is what drives everyone. So we’ve
accomplished that, and of course it becomes instantaneously a threat to the
spiritual plane, instantaneously.
A Vast Retro Movement
So what is the result? The result is that we get a vast retro movement, and this
is what we have at the spiritual level throughout the planet today. We have a
vast retro movement. Now there is a lot to benefit from that. In other words,
my being a messenger of synthesis, if there weren’t a lot of retro people out
there who knew a little bit about this and that, the synthesis would not be
possible.
So we have a whole movement in the last hundred years of people seeking the
wisdom of the past and trying to popularize it in the present. But you can also
see how many people are holding on to various little wisdoms of the past,
terrified of the success of the material global plane—its technology, its invasion
of privacy, all of these things that come with it.
So at one level—we could call it at a sophisticated level—we have all kinds of
people that are looking spiritually in many, many directions. But look at the
organized religions and you can see how much pressure they're under. We
have fundamental Christianity. We have fundamental Judaism. We have
fundamental Hinduism. We have fundamental Islam. In other words, we have
vast spiritual movements on the planet that are deeply organized, that are going
back in time, racing away from the material communion that we've already
achieved. Because you see, that material success brings the homogeny that’s so
terrifying at the spiritual level. So we’re at a breaking point. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 99999999
We're at a point at which the individual faiths are having trouble standing up on
their own. They can’t. They can’t compete with global consciousness. They
can’t. So these two strains, the 21-45, which we’ve accomplished at this point,
but the next step is the 51-25 to bring a unified understanding at the spiritual
level.
A unified understanding at the spiritual level has to be able to mutate in each
individual being. You cannot dictate that. You cannot say, “As of tomorrow
we’re going to treat Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammed with equal respect.”
Nobody’s going to pay attention to that kind of legislation.
The only way in which you can unify the spiritual awareness of the planet is
mutating them one by one. That’s what it’s all about. It’s been so difficult in
the Piscean age to do that. See, in the material plain, you benefit from logic.
You can count money and everybody counts the same. Everybody has the
same one and one equals two. You don’t get a lot of argument over that. You
have very logical rules. But spirituality has never been logical. How could it
be? It was always rooted in faith. The common denominator is the logic.
Human Design is non-dogmatic. You can be a Hindu, a Jane. I don’t care
what you are, because it isn’t about that. It’s about the underlying mechanism.
Human beings love to anthropomorphize things. Give them names, turn them
into mythological beings, whatever the case may be, but it’s just plain
mechanics.
So think about the magic that’s inherent in this channel, that its true function is
to bring mutation to individual members of the tribe and eventually change the
tribe that way. So if you look at somebody like Osho or myself who have the
25-51 and the 40, you can see that we were deeply attracted to the tribe. That’s
what the tribe is looking for. Somebody to take them across onto the next
level of consciousness. That’s why you have such a stupid being in the 51,
particularly if it’s a male.
There’s absolutely nothing dumber than an Aries male, particularly an Aries
male that has their Sun in the 51, because this is just a gate of being either
brave or foolish, which are always the same thing but it depends on the
circumstances and the Ego isn’t bright. It doesn’t have any intelligence, it’s just
a power.

The Pulse’s Movement Arrives at a Different Place
The Ego’s there saying, “I can do it, I can do it, I can jump.” That’s the
miracle. That’s where the miracle takes place. It takes place in the jump.
Always remember that any individual channel is operating out of its format.
That is, it’s operating as a pulse. And because it’s operating as a pulse, that
mutation can take place because we’re moving in space. So that pulse, when it
goes out, does not comes straight back to the same place. It can’t because
we’re moving in space.
So when that pulse goes out, there’s a movement and it comes back to a
different place. That different place is always the possibility that suddenly you
arrive at a place that’s truly different—mutation. So the magic for the 51 is not
the jump. They’re the jumper. “I want to jump, I want to jump, I want to
jump.” So they jump, but it’s in the place in-between while they’re moving
over the canyon that the magic can take place or not. They either fall or they
get across.
Jumping to the 25th Gate
Woe, woe to the community that has a jumper that gets across. You see, it’s
not all just beauty and glory, eh. The jumper gets across to the other side and
the other side is the 25th gate and it’s the gate of innocence, and it’s the gate of
universal love, and it’s the gate of blood, and it’s the gate of the priest, and it’s
the gate of the sacrament. And the 51 and its Ego gets to the other side and it
says, “I know the way”. Yeah, yeah. Not everybody can get to the other side.
And so you have all of these priests who say, “This is the way.” And you have
the community that keeps on saying, “Yes, you keep saying that but I can’t get
there.” And the 25 says, “Keep praying. Be good.” Whatever the dogma is of
the particular faith.
The magic is in this movement. It’s this movement of taking the tribe to
another level, taking them to the deepest level. The deepest level is the unique
person, the separate unique person. You’ve often heard me talk about
individual human rights. No, I’m not talking about human rights. That’s a
collective concept. I’m talking about individual human rights. You see, each
and every human being has the right to be awake, has the right to be at peace in
this life. They simply do. This was not designed to be impossible. It was not
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111100001111
designed to be an endless drag. That’s not what it’s all about. It’s a progressive
process.
Each individual being has the right to understand how they can be awake, to be
nurtured in their awakeness, and this is where it takes place. The 25th gate is
the gate of the vessel of love and it is a gate of cool love—cool love. One of
the funniest phenomena in my life is women saying to me, “Do you love me?”
Now, some of them I did. However, they didn’t notice, if you know what I
mean.
The 25 is just like that, it’s cool. The whole thing about a 25 is that the partner
that it loves is equal in the amount of love that it can get to the computer or
whatever other mechanism is also a part of that 25’s life. After all, the 25th gate
is the only gate of inanimate objects. It is the basic ingredient of all things. It
is the basic matter structure in all things. And so that love that is rooted in the
25 is a love that is a love for anything, in that sense, and everything. It’s a
projected channel so it has to be recognized. And if it’s not recognized, it’s full
of bitterness.
You know how many priests have never jumped across the chasm, but hold the
standard and suffer from deep bitterness because they were not recognized?
You know how many people who are in spiritual positions throughout this
planet and never had a spiritual experience? I mean they’re bureaucrats.
It’s one of those things to recognize about the nature of the priesthood and the
nature of the state because both of them are expressed here. This is about
power and the power of the priest and its cool love. The power that can guide
the tribe across a chasm is a power that can be devastating. This is not about
good or bad. It’s not a morality. It’s simply the way in which it works. And
because it’s a projected element, it means that it literally has to be invited to
initiate—has to.
By the way, in terms of the way in which the mystical process operates, it’s
important to see that the priest itself is lived out by its role in the 10th gate. In
other words, the capacity in the 25 is what kind of priest or priestess; the 10th
gate is literally how that role is played out. You can see that the dilemma of the
individual and the dilemma of individual creativity is that it’s all projected. It’s
all Self-projected, all of it—all of it.
102 Channels By Type
And we’ve already seen that the individual by its very nature is an outsider, and
yet it’s the outsider that has to be recognized, and it’s the outsider that has to
be invited in. “Yes, you can sleep in my barn.” They have to be invited in.
Otherwise that creativity does not come out. It
can’t come out.
When you go through as many designs as I have,
you come across all kinds of interesting structures.
I know many people who are 51-25s and they’re
nothing else. Everything else is open. Pure
Projectors of initiation and it is astonishing what
they’re like. When you’re with them—how can I
describe that, a casual situation—they just mirror you. You get no sense of
their power. But the moment you invite them to do something with you, that’s
the moment you really get their power. They really can deeply influence other
people. And that influence is always at its peak the moment somebody comes
up to them and invites them, and invites them to be their initiator.
This channel is highly Ego-oriented and so it has its puffery. It can be very,
very pumped up and highly aggressive when it comes to competition out of its
Ego nature. That Ego part that’s ready to make the jump can be very
aggressive, can be violent. And remember, because it’s melancholic, you can
get all kinds of levels out of that. Imagine the difficulty of what it’s like to carry
within you only projected creativity. Think about that.
Remember that when you’re dealing with projection, you’re really dealing with
waiting for the right kind of invitation—very specific. Now of course that’s
less so when you’re just talking about a projected channel in somebody’s
design, much more so when you’re talking about somebody who is a Projector
as a Type.
But nonetheless, when you’re dealing with a projected channel you’re still
dealing with this “you have to wait for that to be invited.” Think about what
it’s like for an initiator to initiate without invitation. That is not appreciated,
and it’s going to meet heavy resistance, and that the resistance leads to
bitterness.
In understanding the Type of channel so you recognize what its criteria is, then
you get to eliminate that resistance, but it’s also something else. It’s also about
your capacity as being educated in this knowledge to guide people to how they
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111100003333
nurture their young so that we can really get the benefits of a pure evolutionary
creativity, so that the direction we take is clear, in the evolutionary sense, that
the environments we create are clear.
You see, these different forms of creativity, these three different aspects that
operate out of the Self, are so essential to our evolutionary life. And that each
and every one of them represents this creative potential to make sure that our
evolutionary life is working, because they’re bringing it. Now if they’re not
being themselves, if they’re not playing out their Type, if they’re not operating
properly, then you have a distortion so that you don’t have an environment
that’s necessarily conducive for this stage of our evolution, which is why we see
so many experiments going on in different kinds of environments.
We need this clarity and the clarity comes from allowing these creative channels
to be themselves. To not be influenced, to not be cared for unnecessarily, to
be allowed their moodiness, to be encouraged to enjoy their uniqueness, their
difference. To recognize that it is their difference that makes a contribution in
this life. And most of all—and I will repeat this for the next eight or nine days
—remember the power of your aura. Your aura brings out the mechanical
response necessary—your aura brings out the mechanical response necessary.
If you’re living out your Type and you have a projected channel and it’s a
projected individual channel of creativity, if you live out your Type you’re going
to get that recognized. You’re going to get that invited because your aura will
demand it.
There is no person that can step into my aura and not recognize that there’s
something that can blow them up. I don’t have to tell them, and if they want
that and see what that’s like, they’re going to have to ask for it and then they’ll
get it. That’s the way it is and it’s the only way that it works. The only way.
You don’t have to tell anybody. You’ve got an aura. Let your aura do the
talking, eh? Nice commercial for television. Let your aura do the talking, you
know. Give up these language courses and bury Berlitz. Let your aura do the
talking. It’s true. It’s what it’s all about.
You see, we’re so intelligent that the simple is sometimes impossible for us to
grasp. It’s the irony of being a human being and it’s just a great irony. And the
simple really works.

The Individual Creativity of the Self Mutates Direction &
Love
So here in this identity, what we have are the only creative processes that come
out of the identity. In other words, if we’re looking for all this creativity—
these seven different brands of creativity that we have within the BodyGraph—
it is the individual creativity alone that operates out of the Self. So it speaks of
something very profound in our lives. It’s not just simply the mutation in
direction, but it’s the mutation of love. After all, two of the gates of the
individual creativity are gates of love—universal love (25) and love of self (10).
You’ll notice what’s missing. There’s no hot love—love of the body (46)—and
there’s no love of humanity (15). Good news, eh. “Love everything, love
yourself, be happy.” Mutating love. Love is something that doesn’t belong to
us. Everybody with an undefined Self knows that. They know that love is
something that’s just blowing through them like the wind and they can’t hold
on to it and there’s nothing they can do.
Those of us who have defined G Centers have this perverse conditioning given
to us by the gods that says that love is ours and we own it. However, that’s not
the way that it works. The cosmic G Center is out there in space somewhere
and it’s pumping out its neutrino feed and we have love that’s pouring through.
But you see, we are a very profound filter. We just don’t dumbly take the
program, we interact with it. We interact with it according to our design.
Those of us who carry creative individuality, what we’re doing is mutating love.
We’re mutating love and as we’re mutating love, we change the rules.
The Creative Individual is Not Mutating Human Love
And what we’re mutating is not human love. Not the body and its sexuality,
not our interrelationship to others. That’s not part of the creative equation of
the individual. The love that has to be mutated is the love of self and universal
love, what I’ve been describing to you about this cusp point that we’re at
historically. You see, universal love can only be based on self-love.
Now people are always telling me, “Well, loving yourself, well what about
God?” I love these questions. “What about God?” Somebody a couple of
weeks ago said to me, “Where is God here?” And I was looking around. I
don’t think he was in the room. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111100005555
Being Helpless is the Recognition of True Spirituality
It’s like the spiritual people who get upset with no choice. It’s hard for me not
to laugh in their faces. The beauty of being helpless is the recognition of true
spirituality. That’s the whole point. And you can only love yourself when you
let go of running your life. You can only love yourself when you’re living out
your Type. And the moment you can love yourself and be helpless at the same
time, you recognize that something’s doing something really nice for you. It’s
called being allowed to be alive and to be alive and at peace with being alive.
It’s an extraordinary thing.
In the cosmology that I have, there is no name for the ying-yang, god-goddess,
whatever it is that made us all. I have no idea. It’s not important to me. It’s
beyond my ken and it’s beyond the ken of any human being to grasp. We are
part of something that is not alive yet, in the sense that it’s not born yet. We’re
part of something that is evolving. We’re a life that is forming. As such, we
don’t know what made us and we don’t know the world that we belong to and
we will never know that. Certainly not know that constituted in the way that
we understand things as separate little units now. It’s not the point.
It’s not the point whether God was male, female. As far as I’m concerned it
takes two to tango. There must have been the two of them. I don’t know
what they were doing. I don’t know what a cosmic fuck looks like, but
nonetheless we’re the by-product of all that.
So this question about where God is, I don’t know. But where life is, I do
know. I know that the great privilege of the greatest creative act is this living
process, this living life, this movement in space. And the moment you come to
recognize the beauty of yourself and to recognize self-love in helplessness, then
you can find real spirituality and you can see the beauty of why you’re here and
the beauty of your place in the whole. And that’s what it’s all about. That’s the
essential truth. Then you can become one with what is universal.
Understand the relationship between the 25 and the 10. You can only express
universal love out of your behavior, your perfected form. I’m a 10-57, I bring
you a way to perfect your form. That’s what I’m doing. That’s part of me
being a priest—my 25. Here’s the perfected form. Take this form and mutate
because that’s what it’s all about.
106 Channels By Type
And only when you recognize that, that you only have a connection to what is
universal, you can only touch the godhead when the godhead is you. In the
most mystical way when I think of what I call the biverse, the so-called
universe, is that I recognize it’s my body. It’s my body, and it’s your body, it’s
our body. We’re all in this body and we all have a direct—direct—impact on
its life. And at the moment you see yourself in helplessness—and that’s not
philosophy or religion, that’s just practical mechanics—that’s the moment
you’re connected to it.
It’s like my experience when I first was given this knowledge. Then I began my
own skeptical process of trying to debunk it. And I started to work with the
Moon, watching the Moon in the relationship to my design and the Moon
would crank open my emotional system, and I would have this double kind of
experience. I’d have this awe on one side, because of course the last thing on
my mind I ever assumed was that the Moon did anything to me, and all of a
sudden the Moon was making me very uncomfortable. So there was this awe
on one side. I’m connected to that, which was really quite a satori.
On the other side, it was like, oh that means that I don’t have any control. And
the deeper and deeper I went into the program, the clearer it was to me, I’m an
Ego being, how incredibly vain, not just me, but how incredibly vain my whole
civilization was. It was like wow and that’s the magic. The magic comes from
this realization, and what the experiment gives you is a reward, it rewards you.
It says to you, “Yeah, you’re right. You can be helpless, life’s going to look
after you, your machine will work. It will do its job. Don’t worry about that.”
So we have out of the identity these three different ways in which creativity
mutates us, and again to see the human responsibility. The human
responsibility is to be educated enough to be aware of that potential in others.
This is the whole thing. That’s why it’s so difficult to start knowledge like this.
It takes time until there is enough people so you can have the
interconnectiveness and the interrelationships that are the foundation of what
Human Design is all about. It’s not about the individual. Yes it is, but it’s not.
It’s about our connections and our relationships to others.
And you can see right away that this is a creativity that most people want to
ignore. It’s the freak after all. And in children it’s not formed yet. In other
words, the depth that’s possible that can come out of individual creativity takes
time like anything else, to grow and to be nurtured. Yes, there are exceptions,
there are prodigies, these kinds of things. But basically it’s a maturing process. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111100007777
For most people who meet Human Design in the middle of their life, many of
them have never had those opportunities that were available in that because
they were always having to deal with the conditioning impact on them in their
lives. It’s like having anybody with an individual definition who has an
undefined Solar Plex Center. They spend so much of their lives making nice.
Every time I meet a woman, particularly women, they have a undefined Solar
Plex Center and I know I can see them as little girls. I can see them when the
emotional energy rises in the house and everybody’s getting uncomfortable.
And they’re the ones that are getting poisoned and they go around smiling and
making nice. Calm everybody down. “Don’t get excited. It’s okay, it’s okay,
it’s all okay, I’ll look after it, I’ll do it, I’ll do it, I’ll do it, I’ll do it.” Then they
stop being individuals. They stop caring for themselves, they spend all day on
alert. “Is anybody getting upset?” No joke, eh.
Hidden Creativity
So, to be able to understand that this is a creativity that’s basically hidden. It’s
not manifesting, it’s not generating, it’s basically underneath. And you have
these human beings that are going through their melancholic process, that the
longer they go without recognition, the deeper the bitterness within them and
the pain that comes with that with not having that quality recognized in them.
And you see, any projected element that doesn’t get recognized never gets
access to the energy it needs to fulfill its potential. It has to have that. I thank
my lucky stars every day that I grew up in an environment where I had a
mother who was a freak. I was lucky. If you’re a freak and you’ve got a freak
mother, you’re lucky. Or a freak father, whatever. But I was lucky.
The Freak’s Mantra
I can remember growing up that every time I would get into trouble and my
father would be infuriated with me, my mother would say, “Leave him alone.
He’s different.” That was her mantra, “leave him alone, he’s different.” Not
that that stopped my father, but nonetheless, that was the freak’s mantra. Had
I had the misfortune of having a very collective mother, it would have been a
horror. It would have been a horror for me.
108 Channels By Type
We can’t wait for everybody to get lucky. We have to educate people so that
they understand these things. That education nurtures a very, very important
creativity for all of us. It is our evolutionary way and if we don’t have solid
mutations then we don’t have the potential for continued growth. We need
those mutative processes. We need that mutative creativity. We need to wake
up to new directions and new possibilities that can be provided by that
creativity. It’s style and it’s one of the things to recognize about creativity that
comes out of the Self. The creativity that comes out of the Self is all about
style.
Partners: Defined and Undefined Centers
One of the things that I have often talked about, not so much here but in
Europe where I’ve done a lot of partnership work. When you talk about
relationships and you see, for example, that one partner has a defined Self and
the other partner has an undefined Self, and one partner has a defined Ego, and
the other one has an undefined Ego. These are very common configurations
and they’re about two different things and basically the themes we have been
looking at this morning so far.
The Defined Ego Carries the Will Power for the Material
Way
If you have an undefined Ego, you want an Ego partner, because the Ego
partner is there to carry the responsibility and the will power for the material
way. So an undefined Ego is always looking for a defined Ego.
The Defined G Provides Cultural or Style Improvement
And if you have an undefined Self, you’re always looking for a defined Self
because what you’re looking for is a cultural improvement. It’s a cultural
improvement. You’re looking to improve your style.
It doesn’t matter if you’re an Ego person, that your lover happens to be a
starving painter as long as the paintings are good. You’ll pay for it, you’ll look
after them, but you get the style that you want. So it’s one of the things to
recognize about the nature of creativity that comes out of the Self is that style is
very important to us. You can see that.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111100009999
There are zillions of fashion, architectural, you name it. This is a process,
particularly for those of us that are advantaged, the western world, parts of
Asia, where you can see that the moment you come in to any kind of stable
material life, that style becomes something that’s very, very important. Style
points the way.
I grew up in a fashion house. My father was a clothing manufacturer and I
grew up around fashion trends. And it’s one of the things to understand about
what a fashion trend really is. You’ve got some mutative individual that creates
a look, and that look is actually an environment, a mutative environment for
them to move them into the future.
So think about the explosion of denim jeans. Now, that wasn’t just a physical
item. You could see a whole revolution attached to all of that. In other words,
style has impact. I lived in Europe during the punk movement. I tell you that
was really something to see. And of course it has its impact and this is always
coming out of the identity: it’s always talking about self, because you see what
we try to do with style is find a way in which through loving our environment
we can love ourselves. “I have a beautiful house, so I’m happy. I have this
brand new outfit, I love myself today.” It’s true though. Please understand
that. It’s so important to us.
And of course these are tools to help us feel better about who we are, but this
is the creative evolutionary process. So we don’t want lousy designers making
boring clothes. We want the best possible mutations, the most exciting
mutations pointing us in our real direction. We get that all the time.
The greatest shock for me,—I love architecture and I’ve traveled widely in the
world so I know, I’ve seen a lot of it. And when I was in Germany when the
wall came down, and I went to the East and the first place in the East I went to
is East Berlin. And East Berlin is the funniest place you’ve ever seen. It’s the
ugliest styling you’ve ever seen. It’s so ugly that it’s hilarious. It’s like you’ve
gone to a really, really bad movie.
My publisher and I, he was out there surreptitiously trying to take photographs
hoping that nobody would see him, that he wouldn’t get beat up. You’ve never
seen anything so hilarious in your life and you could see by the style that it was
doomed. You could see that.

Style Tells Us about the Right Track for Beauty
The 2.1, second hexagram, the driver, our evolutionary direction in life; first
line, aesthetics whether inborn or acquired, life is a direction of beauty and
nothing else—nothing else.
We are here to evolve into beauty. That’s what it’s all about. And you read
that line and you grasp that. If you don’t get little goose bumps, you’re weird
because it’s really quite incredible. That is what it’s all about. And of course
style is very important for us because it tells us whether or not we are on that
right track of beauty or not. So
aesthetics come out of this identity
and it is the aesthetics that give us
the signpost of the future always.
They’re always ahead of their time.
All right, here’s a nice example
(Dustin Hoffman) of individual
creativity and you can see the 51-25
operating unconsciously. And you
know when you look at this design
and you see that here is somebody
that is a Generator. It’s always so
fascinating to look at the nature of Type and see that in just living out the
simple rules of the Type that obviously everything else is going to fall into
place. Here is somebody who is a pure Generator.
The Sacral isn’t Intelligent, but…
Keep in mind something, because I think it’s often misunderstood, particularly
by people who first grasp the understanding of the Sacral and its power. The
Sacral isn’t intelligent. It’s not an awareness center. It’s an energy field. It’s a
motor. It’s a power system. But it also has this capacity to act as a diaphragm
just like the Throat does. Anything that’s connected to the Sacral speaks
through the Sacral. It’s not the Sacral that’s speaking. It’s a Sacral that
generates the sound. But what’s guiding the Sacral is what’s connected to it.
So for example, if you look at this design, the first thing you’ll see is that you
have the definition of the 3-60. You have the format energy of the individual
process. And you can see that this lower definition, that we have a classic split
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111111111111
here, that the lower part of the definition is all individual entirely and you see
that you have the 3-60.
The Sacral is Guided by What it is Connected To
So the first thing that’s speaking through the Sacral is the 3-60. And when the
Sacral goes ‘uh-huh,’ what it’s actually saying is ‘this can be mutated.’ That’s all
it’s saying. If you want to go out for dinner tonight, uh-huh, this could be
mutative. That’s the first thing.
The second thing is that you have the 2-14 connected to that Sacral. And the
2-14, the Channel of the Beat, the keeper of keys, is all about direction. It’s the
prime tantra of direction. It is our evolutionary direction. And you know that
when the Sacral is going ‘uh-
huh,’ it’s not the Sacral that
is thinking. It’s being guided
and it’s being guided by an
identity that says ‘uh-huh’
means ‘we’re in the right
direction.’
So if you’re a Generator and
somebody says, “You want
to go out tonight?” and
you’re going ‘uh-huh’ and
this is your design, it’s saying
‘this is the right direction.’
It could be mutative. If you
go ‘huh-huh,’ what you’re saying is ‘this is not mutative. It’s the wrong
direction.’ It’s not what your mind thinks. That Sacral is being guided by what
is connected to it. And along with that you can see there’s the 25-51
unconscious.
This direction is not only mutative, but it can be initiating. So then you can see
what the Sacral is going uh-huh or huh-huh, what it’s guided by. So the
moment that you see that you’re a Generator, look at what’s connected to that.
And it’s not just the definition, as I’ve done here. There’s the 52 in the Root
that’s part of that definition and the 54. It says ‘uh-huh, I can sit still with this
in the 52. I can be focused on this. I can focus on mutation.’
112 Channels By Type
The 54 says ‘I’ll be recognized’ if I go ‘uh-huh’ because the 54, the marrying
maiden, the gate of ambition is always looking to be recognized for its value so
it can rise up in the hierarchy. And so when that Sacral says ‘uh-huh,’ it’s
saying ‘I got a chance to be noticed here. I’m going to go to that restaurant.’
You can see that the 5 is there. It means that going ‘uh-huh’ either fits into
one’s habits or not. If you’re hungry and you want to go out to a restaurant
and you’re asked to go out to a Taiwanese restaurant run by Germans from
France and that’s not your habit, you may end up going ‘huh-huh. It’s not
mutative. It’s a lousy direction. It isn’t going to initiate anything but heartburn.
It’s not my habit, so I’d rather not focus on that.’ I’m just using keynotes.
It’s all there and it’s all speaking through the Sacral and the 7 is speaking
through the Sacral, and the 1 is speaking through the Sacral, and the 13. Here
is somebody that has the whole configuration of the Cross of the Sphinx. This
is this person’s incarnation cross and they have the whole Cross of the Sphinx.
So all of those different directions are expressed through that Sacral response.
In other words, the Sacral is always something that you can understand in
terms of why it’s responding and how it’s responding by looking at what’s
connected to it. Then you can see what’s guiding it. It’s not just the Sacral.
The Sacral is not intelligent.
The Cut-Off Mind Has No Inner Authority
Now think of the nature of a split like this and the pressure that’s on somebody
like this. You see, we’re all
deeply seduced by the mental
plane, deeply seduced by the
mental plane. We all want our
minds to run our lives and heal
them and we can never get out of
our minds—never. We’re all
roaring around in there all the
time. It’s the dominant field
because it’s connected to our
vision and we live in a visual
world of limitation. Our world is
structured by what we can see,
period. So it’s a deep limitation and that’s our mind world. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111111113333
So here’s somebody with the Head Center connected to the Ajna. Now look,
whenever you see mental definition, particularly mental definition that is cut
off—and it doesn’t matter whether it’s connected to the Throat or not, just the
fact that it’s cut off from the rest of the design—there is a basic dilemma there.
There is no inner authority, none. There is simply the fixedness of mind as an
outer authority.
In other words, somebody with a defined mind, somebody with an undefined
mind, they’re both in the same situation in that neither one of those minds has
inner authority. It’s the first lesson in doing somebody’s reading. I always start
a reading from the top after I’ve done the overview. And by starting at the top,
I always re-confirm, re-affirm for them that their mind is useless to them.
It’s my living experiment. I have great fun with my mind sometimes. It’s spent
most of my life trying to tell me what to do and obediently I went running
around, crashing into things as dumb Aries do, following this wonderful mind
of mine which is absolutely useless for me.
I have these wonderful experiences now with my mind. They’re really
hilarious. I’m lying down, I’m relaxed, and my mind says ‘you should really
telephone somebody.’ You know, giving me that instruction as it passes
through. And I notice that my body doesn’t move. Nothing happens. I
stopped giving my mind authority a long time ago and I’m long past seven
years.
And, my mind,—it’s very funny,
it still does the same thing, stupid
before enlightenment and stupid
after. It’s still a mind. It goes
roaring by and it says, ‘you know,
make that telephone call’ and my
body doesn’t move.
If my mind was another person, I
could feel its utter
embarrassment. It’s delightful.
It’s sort of like ‘well, all right I’ll
go on to the next thing now.’ It
114 Channels By Type
does not run our lives, and the moment you really recognize that, is the
moment that you become very healthy quickly. Minds don’t have inner
authority. They just don’t.
The other thing is if you look at this design, there is something that happens
automatically when you think about circuitry and you think about definition.
Look at this design. Here is somebody who is a Generator and a very complex
Generator in terms of the themes that are going into the Sacral. All of that is
individual.
Now look at that mind. That’s an abstract mind. Now what do you think
that’s like? You’ve got a collective, abstract mind cut off from an individual
body. The mind hates the life. The mind thinks that what the body does is
ridiculous, freaky, can’t grasp it, can’t make sense out of it. So you end up with
somebody like Dustin Hoffman who has spent 25 years in analysis.
And as long as you’re giving inner authority to that abstract mind, you’re going
to have a life that’s very painful. It doesn’t matter how successful you are.
That’s not the point. Just the torture on the inside that goes on with a mind
that does not understand its authority. Can’t make sense out of it at all. It
doesn’t want to be different, wants to be like everyone.
And so what is Dustin Hoffman’s style initiation? To be a superstar playing
second part roles. The anti-heroes. Can’t be himself. Doesn’t want to be
himself. Doesn’t like himself.
The Mind is a Torture because it Never Stops
See, the mind’s torture for us. It’s torture because it never stops. There’s
nothing you can do about it. You can’t change the way it processes
information. Your design is your design. It’s a genetic movement after all. All
you can do is recognize that it does not have any inner authority. And you see,
you can tame it.
My mind will not come back to me after it’s told me to do something and my
body doesn’t move. It doesn’t come back and repeat it. It might the next day,
but it’s not like it hammers at me because it doesn’t have the power to move
me—none. I don’t pay any attention to it.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111111115555
It’s one of the jokes of my living process that if I paid attention to my mind
that the life that I’ve been living all these years never would have
materialized—never, never, because this is not my life. This is what’s
happening to me. I don’t own this life. I get to rent these vehicles. That’s why
we’re all here. We’re passengers. We get a taxi ride.
People with No Inner Authority
So the moment you take away inner authority from the mind, that’s the
moment you really give yourself some peace and then you can allow the true
authority within you to be your guide. When I say that, always keep in mind,
there are people who have no inner authority whatsoever. You’re going to
meet them in your work. People who only have mental definition and nothing
else, or Reflectors.
And again the thing to recognize about that is: don’t feel like they have a
handicap. Jesus, it’s not true. What they can be wise about—because every
center is open, or in the case of the mental definition all the other centers are
open—is who has valued outer
authority for them that can
become their inner authority.
Anyone who doesn’t have inner
authority needs to have forces
in their life, beings in their life
that they can use as sounding
boards, feedback, in order for
them to establish who has the
proper outer authority that they
can make their own inner
authority. But never the mind.
So in order for the purity of this talent to come out, and of course that’s what
happened to him anyway. Because the moment he became popular was the
moment that people were always offering him scripts like a good Generator.
“Would you like to do this movie, would you like to do that?” That’s when
he’s at his best.
When he decides out of his mind what he thinks he should do as a project, it’s
not as successful and will lead to the typical Sacral frustrations. And in order
116 Channels By Type
for that unconscious, creative individual gift to come out, in order for him to
mutate style, to change our spiritual approach, in that sense, he has to live out
his design. He has to live out being a Generator. He has to trust absolutely in
the capacity to respond.
By the way, the other thing—it’s always fun in using an actor or an actress
because you can often see what are archetypes, or classic configurations.
Here’s somebody with an undefined Throat. Now when you’re growing up as
a kid and you’ve got a defined mind and an undefined Throat, you have a
terrible frustration. It’s like anybody who has an undefined mind. That
frustration is that the words never come out the way you want them to. You
never say what you want, when you want to say it, how you want to say it,
because it just doesn’t work that way. Think how frustrating that is.
He’s got a good mind. Strong, inspired mind, and yet at the same time, no easy
way to get that expressed, and after that, very difficult to turn that expression
into action with his undefined Throat. So what does he become comfortable
with?
Undefined or Cut Off Minds: Don’t Write the Script
I tell everybody with an undefined mind or minds that are cut off, don’t write
the script. That’s my mantra for them. So what does he do? Gets people to
write the script. Then he can feel comfortable in the words that he speaks,
because he doesn’t without it because it never comes out the way he wants.
Now if somebody had educated him as to how be a Generator, what the
mechanism of a Generator is, he would discover that his own script is the best
and his own script is waiting to respond. With his open Throat he has a gift.
We’ve seen his gift on film. He can speak in many different ways. He can
manifest, look like a Manifestor in many different ways. He understands all
that.
The Gift of of the Undefined Throat
The gift of somebody with an undefined Throat is to understand the capacities,
to be wise about the nature of the Throat. And the moment he’s waiting to
respond is the moment he can take advantage of that undefined Throat and
speak clearly. It doesn’t mean he’s going to say things the way he wants to. It
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111111117777
certainly doesn’t mean he’s going to say them in the way his mind structures it.
But if he speaks out of response, what he says is going to be clear and to the
point. Essential to understand that.
Channels in the Context of Type
Though we recognize that the Projected channel is something that has to be
invited, it isn’t as if he has to wait specifically for somebody to recognize his
initiating capacities. When I began to teach you about the different Types, the
first step in dealing with Projectors was to be able to see clearly where their
channels are defined. I pointed you towards how important it is for those
channels specifically to be approached so that you understand the principle.
In other words, that you understand that this 25-51 had to be invited. But yet
when you see that within the context of Type, the thing to be clear about is
that if they enter into things correctly, it will be recognized. It will get its
invitation. And it doesn’t mean it gets its invitation the moment that it is
responding. It means that in its
response, it enters into
something correctly in which
that aspect of their nature is
fully integrated and because of
its aura will ultimately be
recognized by the other. After
all, he doesn’t. It’s all
unconscious (the 25-51 and 3-
60).
It’s like meeting somebody
who’s emotionally defined but
it’s all unconscious. They have
no idea about their emotions. It’s all in a tunnel. They don’t have any access to
that. And not having any access to that, they can only see it as a mirror
reflected in the other.
His capacity to initiate and mutate others is perfect when they ask for it. That’s
the whole point. They have to ask for it. Then the rest of the mechanical
environment all clicks into gear, all comes into place, and everything begins to
work.

Explaining Type and Channels to a Client
I get stories all the time, people tell me about their experiments and how they
work. And one day it would be nice to collect all those stories so people would
understand the nature of how that experiment really operates. To really see
what that is like, to live out your Type and get the reward for your Type, and
how quickly you come to rcognize that reward.
The thing to see in that is yes, we have to, you have to. You’re the professional
representatives of this knowledge. You must understand what that Projected
channel is all about. You can tell them about their creativity in their reading.
But that creativity is only going to come out if they live out their Type. Yes, we
know we have to show them the definition. But be clear that that definition
comes out automatically if they live out their Type. If you’re just telling them
their definition, you’re not a hell of a lot better than an astrologer. “Oh, you
got this.” “Oh, gee.”
It’s about saying to them, “Look, this is a major theme in your life. It is so
important for you to get this recognition and have this mutative aspect come
out in you in your life, for its impact on others. And it’s not you saying ‘Oh
gee’ and it’s not you recognizing once in a while that that’s been there for you.
It’s about seeing that is you and that the moment you’re living out your Type, it
will click into place for you.”
The Magic of Genetic Continuity
This is the magic of genetic continuity. Those of you who have been following
along in the neutrino forecast that I do, after you’ve listened for a couple of
months you’ll suddenly realize that the planets have genetic continuity. The
whole program has a genetic continuity. Everything’s connected to everything.
And you see we’re all operating in that mechanism. The Type is just a way of
seeing genetic continuity through another view, but it’s a view that sees the
genetic continuity as a large hole.
It’s a view that says, “Look, through this genetic continuity of your Type, all
these other things will operate properly.” And if you’re a good analyst and you
show them what the other things are and what the not-self is, they very quickly
get to see how that works. And they very quickly can begin to get access to
who they are by living out that mechanic.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111111119999
It’s essential to see that the genetic continuity brings everything together.
Each aspect is linked to the other through the whole. So Type is your key
for them. It was always there. It was always there in the sense of what is
definition and what we learnt about definition. But we have a language now
that we can use that is easy enough for anyone to grasp. “This is your Type,
this is the way it works. If you want to stay frustrated, be a Manifestor. If you
want to stay bitter, be a Manifestor. If you want to be disappointed, be a
Manifestor, and if you want to be a Manifestor be angry.” All four Types get a
bad trip.
If you don’t live out your Type, you’re only going to meet the resistance that’s
there and the resistance is natural. You’re not supposed to be operating that
way. It’s like trying to drive your car sideways down the street. You’re going to
piss off a lot of people. They don’t like it. So you end up with a whole planet
where everybody’s driving sideways. Nobody wants you to drive straight—
nobody. You don’t get any support in that.
At the end of each of these types of creative channels, and we’ve completed the
individual, I’ll give you a half an hour, or in this case 25 minutes, to ask me any
questions. I’ve had requests for that. If I get two bad questions in a row
though, I’ll stop. Yes, you’re first.
Q&A
Difference between a Manifestor, a Generator and a MG?
Student: I’m having trouble with the distinction between a generating
Manifestor and how that is to be a Generator.
Ra: What is the difference between a Generating Manifestor and a regular
Manifestor or a regular Generator? Okay.
The True, Pure Manifestor
So look, first of all, the Manifestor itself, the only real, pure Manifestor is a
Throat Center connected either to the Ego, the Solar Plex, or the Root. That’s
the only true, pure Manifestor. In other words, the Throat connected to those
three motors. And as we know about a pure Manifestor, because the Throat is
connected to those motors, the Manifestor is, according to definition design,
120 Channels By Type
this is a doer. This is somebody that can act on their power, can manifest.
Okay. And we know that the strategy for the pure Manifestor is that they have
to eliminate the resistance by informing people before they act.
The Pure Generator
Now the pure Generator is somebody in which the Throat Center is not
connected to a motor. It can be defined, but it’s not connected to a motor so
it’s cut off in that sense. And the pure Generator is somebody that operates
exclusively out of response. In other words, they need to wait, not necessarily
to be asked, but they need to wait to be initiated. A bird sings and they go ‘uh-
huh.’ Somebody’s talking at the other end of the hall and they go, “No, that’s
not right,” whatever the case may be. They have to wait to respond. And that
is their way to eliminate resistance.
The Manifesting Generator
But when you get to the combination of the two as you have in this case,— this
is Diego Rivera, who I talked about
earlier. When you get to somebody
whose Sacral Center is defined and is
connected to the Throat, number one,
technically they are a Manifestor.
That’s very important to understand.
They are a Manifestor. There’s no
question about that. Not only are they a
Manifestor, they’re a very powerful
Manifestor.
As you can see with the 20-34, the
Channel of Charisma,–it got that name for just that reason. “I am busy now.”
They are powerful Manifestors.
Yet at the same time, the Throat’s not a motor and the Sacral is a prime motor
that has very, very similar kinds of capacities, and the Throat is overwhelmed
by the Sacral. So basically what happens is this: the Manifesting Generator has
two of the themes that merge together. In other words, they can suffer from
frustrated anger or be angry as a result of frustration because there are both
those themes. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111122221111
But what’s essential to realize is that they actually have an easier strategy than a
Manifestor and the same strategy as a Generator. In other words, the
Generator waits to respond. The Manifestor waits. The Manifesting
Generator waits to be asked, waits to respond, in exactly the same way as the
Generator. Now, for them, they don’t have to go through the Manifestor’s
deal of having to inform people beforehand which is so hard for Manifestors to
do—they don’t have to ask for permission. The Manifesting Generator just
has to wait to be asked, and of course, the moment they’re asked, they can
manifest immediately and they’re incredibly impressive.
When you ask a Generator, they will respond, but remember Generators are
Generators. They have to go level-by-level. You’re not going to get peak
performance right away. You can’t. Your investment in any Generator is the
time to allow them to go through enough levels so that they really have
mastered what is there for them to do.
But the Manifestor can go from nothing to peak right away—0 to 60 in 3.2—
zoom. So when you have a Manifesting Generator and you ask them to use
their power, they fly. And, of course, they’ve got no resistance because you’ve
asked them to use their power. So that’s the difference in that combination.
What Does it Mean When You Don’t Have Any Individual
Channels?
Student: I’m not quite sure when you talk about individuality,—I don’t have
any individual channels but I have a lot of individual gates. What does that
balance out…
Ra: There is practically no human being on this planet who doesn’t have some
kind of individual activation in their design. The fact that you have individual
gates activated is already an indication that there lies your mutative potential.
In other words, out of that aspect there is always the opportunity through the
harmonic gate to experience and have the mutative field work in you. So what
it means is an attraction to the mutative field.
If it is not defined, there is no consistent mutation, and of course it’s the
consistent mutation that is really significant in terms of the evolutionary
process. However, so many couples, for example, will have electromagnetic
individual definition in their relationships. And you can see that their
122 Channels By Type
relationship, out of that, has a mutative field in which their relationship can
evolve and continue to grow.
So the fact that you have individual aspects within your design, it’s very
important for you to see that when you’re looking at those individual aspects to
realize that these are your evolutionary opportunities. They’re your mutative
opportunities.
Again, everything having to do with the individual, as we’ve seen through the
creativity, is that that’s your opportunity for style. That’s your opportunity to
find beauty. That’s your opportunity to move forward in your evolutionary
process.
And the fact that it is activated but not defined is an indication that is your
need for the other, that for you, the mutative process is something that you
have to find in your linking and bonding with other human beings to form
mutative bonds that can grow and evolve. And you’re always going to be very
sensitive to relationships that don’t do that.
If you don’t get that kind of hookup in your relationship chart with somebody
else, then you know that you’re going to be at a dead end in that relationship.
One of those things that’s part of a deeper understanding of the way in which
we hookup with each other is to understand the significance of that. In other
words, that individual mutation always brings evolutionary change. And of
course for relationships, that’s something that is an important factor; it takes
away the staleness that’s possible in a relationship.
Of course it can also be the other way. It can be overboard, it can be
constantly mutating, constantly changing its face, constantly changing its style,
and that’s also possible as well, but it’s an important ingredient, eh?
Is the Undefined Spleen Designed to be Unhappy?
Student: The question is about Dustin Hoffman’s design. Is he designed to
be unhappy?
Ra: Yes. Anybody that has an undefined splenic system is designed to be, not
so much unhappy, it’s not about that. They just don’t necessarily feel good.
And my response to that is always tough. You know, tough.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111122223333
We all have our crosses to bear in this life. We all have undefined centers and
each and every one of them, as long as you’re being conditioned by them and
identified with them, are an ordeal. There’s
nothing you can do about that.
The thing to recognize—and there’s a
deeper response that I’ll get to in a
moment—the thing to recognize about the
undefined splenic system is that not feeling
good is about as important an attribute as
is possible for somebody with that design.
It’s very, very important to recognize that.
You see, wisdom comes through the undefined center. There is no more
profound alertness than somebody with an undefined splenic system. No more
profound alertness. I got a real big fat thick splenic system and it does not
operate like that. It’s defined. It has other functions.
The Undefined Spleen is Here to be Alert
The reality is that somebody with an undefined splenic system has an
enormous, an enormous capacity to be alert and of course that’s what they’re
here for—to be alert. To be alert to what they take into their body. And that
alertness is so that they can overcome their fear, that they can be secure
tomorrow, that they can survive, because it’s a survival awareness.
So the ‘not feel good’ of the undefined Spleen, I always tell them the same
thing. “It’s delicious to have somebody with a powerful Spleen step into your
life. It makes you feel good. It isn’t necessarily good for you. That’s why that
when you take them in, you have to be spontaneously aware of what you’re
taking in.”
I used to have my black humor. I used to say to undefined splenic people,
“Whenever you meet somebody, just think about whether you would eat them
or not,” which a lot of people didn’t find funny, but it’s really true. I know so
many people that I’m just not going to have them for lunch. No way. For me,
that comes out of my emotional system. There are some people that I will just
not swallow. And the undefined splenic system is like that. That’s what it’s
about.
124 Channels By Type
And so the most important thing for the undefined Spleen is don’t get caught
up in thinking “Oh my God, I don’t feel good.” Recognize that not feeling
good is great. It’s great. It doesn’t mean you’re not going to feel good.
Spleens don’t stay undefined. Nothing does. Everything’s going on. Life’s
going on.
There are no undefined Spleens in this room. It’s not about that. It’s not
about saying, “Oh my God, I’m not going to feel good for the rest of my life.”
That’s why I say “tough.” It’s just a projection on that. It has to do with being
alert as to what Spleens you allow into your life. That’s what matters.
The moment you see somebody with an undefined splenic system recognize
right away that they have to be very careful about what they take into their
body because it has to do with their health. When you see somebody with an
undefined splenic system or somebody with a defined Spleen that’s not
connected to the Throat, the first thing to recognize is that they should never
use what is called modern medicine unless it is absolutely necessary—absolutely
necessary. And if they’re living out their Type, it wouldn’t be. But then again
we’re dealing with people that are deeply conditioned.
Somebody with the undefined Spleen should use medicines that are
homeopathic, holistic, whatever those approaches are. But it’s basically about
approaches that are very mild and take time to work. Remember that the
undefined immune system is much healthier than the defined immune system.
People don’t realize that.
I have a fantastic Spleen, but one day I will just go pop. The undefined splenic
system becomes deeply wise about what it’s taking into its body. I pay no
attention. I don’t have to pay attention, my Spleen takes care of it so I work it
to death. The undefined splenic system doesn’t do that. And if they become
wise, which means: enter into things correctly.
You see, that undefined splenic system, they don’t have to have your
knowledge and understand all of these things about the Spleen. If this person
lives out his Type, he’s not going to allow people into his life that will distort
that Spleen because his Generator wisdom is his authority and he will know
what is good for him. It will tell him.

The Totally Undefined Solar Plex is Often a Sign of Autism
The other thing is that Dustin Hoffman has a very extraordinary chart. “Rain
Man” for example, the film that he did. He’s got a totally undefined Solar Plex
which is often a sign—very often a sign of autism. Interesting to play it out.
It’s like me with my totally undefined Solar Plex, except for the 49th gate
unconscious. In my time I was called a hyperactive child. Today that would be
called a version of autism. It’s very common for children with undefined
emotional systems to be hyperactive, to be overloaded with energy.
The Magic of the Totally Undefined Center
But there is a magic in any center—in any center—that has absolutely no
activation. The magic in that is that there’s no prevalent theme. If you have
just one gate like my 49 in the emotional system, it becomes a theme.
The only way that I know emotions is that every time somebody hooks up my
Solar Plex, it doesn’t matter how they hook it up. It doesn’t matter what their
channels are, it doesn’t matter at all. What matters is that every time they hook
it up, my 49 becomes active which means that the emotional system for me, no
matter how it’s hooked up, always comes through that theme of 49. I either
accept or reject. I marry you or I divorce you and that’s the only way that I
understand the emotional field. So it is not free of being specific in some way.
The totally undefined center has no theme—none—and that brings something
unique. That center itself can actually not exist. Now, I mean that in the
illusionary sense, the maia sense. However, in the practice of life, it can seem
like it doesn’t exist. So the totally undefined Solar Plex Center, you have
somebody who has no connection to the emotional field. Think about what
that means. That’s autism. You can’t even understand the emotions that are in
somebody’s movement in their face. Can’t read it.
Remember, you have more neural activity in your Solar Plex than you do in
your brain. So much recognition and awareness is housed in the Solar Plex.
Now it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t operate all the time, that it’s not there all
the time, because of course it deals with transits.
Each of those centers that we’re looking at here, they each have seven gates. In
transits, you’re going to find it’s rare that those centers never have something
126 Channels By Type
affecting them so that there’s a built in thematic that comes with that totally
undefined center.
The Totally Open Spleen Can Mean beyond Fear into Death
Now if you have a child that has a splenic system like Dustin Hoffman, you
better be careful with that child. You see, they can be beyond fear. Not
fearless. Fearless is the other side of fearful. Beyond fear. This is the kind of
child that gets on his skateboard, looks down a huge vertical hill, and just goes.
There is nothing there that says to
them, “Hey, excuse me. You might
have some problems here. You got
no knee pads, you got no helmet, it’s
really steep, it’s a bad one.” It’s not
there. Beyond fear which can mean
into death. So it’s something for
them to understand.
And it means that in this design,
when you’re looking at somebody
who has a totally undefined Splenic
Center, they’re beyond not feeling good sometimes. In other words, they’re
just out of it all, not connected to the stream of fear coming into the body.
I have worked and I continue to work with people in medical fields, and one of
the most important things in the future as to the way in which we can look at
helping people and understanding them physically is that something that I’ve
gone over briefly in the gray course is to let people see that there is a chart and
a structure in the first 88 degrees after conception.
In the first 88 degrees after conception, the nine centers are built. And it is
during the building of these nine centers that the infrastructure of the vehicle is
established. Not every child with that kind of configuration would be autistic.
Research on Autism and the Undefined Solar Plex
I have two sisters in Hamburg—the Sternenbergs—they’re Human Design
analysts and teachers and they are both psychologists working with autistic
children and have been working with autistic children for about 20 years. And
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111122227777
they have records of 500 or 600 autistic children and there is something like
90% of them that have undefined Solar Plex Centers with either the 49, or the
19 at the other end. And they’ve been slowly building data on,—because not
everybody, mothers barely remember when their children are born let alone
when they made them but sometimes you get lucky.
So, Human Design is for a time in which conception and birth are controlled.
I don’t mean to upset anybody but that’s something that it’s really about and
until we get to a point where it’s really, truly, specific, exact, then we’re always
on the edge of things. Human Design itself; under each mind are colors and
below each color are tones and below the tones are bases. There’s a
tremendous amount of information about an individual that we don’t even deal
with now because human beings are stuck just at the surface.
So it’s one of the things to see that we have a structural theme that lies
underneath and it will tell us, for example, wherever the planetary positions are
at the moment that the Solar Plex Center is being built in the fetus in the first
88 degrees, this is going to be an indication of whether or not ultimately that
center is going to have a real problem in the way in which it functions and then
of course that comes out.
Totally Open Centers Can be Totally “Beyond”
So when you’re looking at totally undefined centers, recognize their uniqueness.
Somebody with a totally undefined Ajna Center can truly be beyond mind—
beyond mind. Somebody with a totally undefined Throat Center can be
beyond manifestation, beyond speaking, outside of it all.
The person with the totally undefined Ego can be beyond Ego. Not just Ego
this, but outside of it all. Like the undefined Sacral Center, beyond life itself,
outside of the life mechanism. And like the undefined Self, beyond direction,
beyond love. These are places that are there for everyone, and of course
they’re places for wisdom that is for perspective. Out of those totally open
centers comes the opportunity for a really clear comparison.
I know all nine gates of the Sacral. I’ve got a totally undefined Sacral. I know
those nine gates. I know them in all kinds of combinations. I have no theme
of my own. I’m beyond that. I have everybody else’s sexual theme. I have
128 Channels By Type
everybody else’s way of processing that energy. Out of that can come great
wisdom, but also deep identification.
I spent 38 years lost in the Sacral Center. I mean lost in there. You know,
cosmic red swimming pool, never got out. You drown in those swimming
pools, eh, I know. So pay attention to the totally undefined centers.
Okay, one more quick question. Anybody?
The Undefined Throat and the Pressure to Communicate
Student: The question’s actually in reference to my design. I’m a Generator
with an undefined Throat, I have five gates coming out of my Throat. And I
have a lot of pressure to speak all the time. I had the experience of sitting with
somebody with a very powerful Throat and the pressure is so strong to speak
that I found that I almost have to go to my undefined will center to stop this
speaking. That’s what it felt like. So am I going into willpower to stop the
flow?
Ra: No, no. Because that would be a situation where you were dealing with
somebody who also affected your Ego. So, you were using their will to try to
stop their Throat. That’s the way it works.
No, again this is the whole thing about what experimentation does. It is very
difficult. I know how difficult it is for people, particularly with undefined
Throats, and what kind of pressure is on them to communicate. And yet at the
same time, you cannot alleviate that pressure until you go through experiment
by experiment. In other words, each time you have the good fortune, because
it’s often a lucky situation, you don’t have a chance to explode. Somebody gets
to you first. And every time you get that opportunity to see what that’s like, it
really empowers your awareness.
It’s empowering you at a mechanical level because at the mechanical level,
there’s all kinds of little creatures saying, “See, see. See this is us. See, it
works.” And you get that and it keeps on reinforcing that process inside of
you.
Student: It is experience?
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111122229999
Ra: Yes, it is experience. That’s the real magic. The real magic to see is that
because it’s a seven-year program—that’s the one thing—it is going to school.
It’s seven years. So once you recognize that it’s a seven-year program, you have
to see that that’s not about you being on one plane for those seven years. It’s
not about that. It means that every moment, every day, every breath, that
you’re changing because that’s what happens to us in our movement - the cells
dying and being replaced.
Cellular Memory Reaches Critical Mass
Each experiment that is successful for you becomes ingrained as cellular
memory and that cellular memory grows until you reach the critical mass.
That’s the third to fourth year and then at that time you have more cells inside
of you that know what it’s like to go through the experiment and be successful
than those that are conditioned. And that’s the moment that it stops being a
full-time conscious job. That’s the moment that it starts becoming natural. It’s
like learning anything because this is the natural cycle of learning; that’s why we
get a seven-year itch. “Okay, I got it. I’m going now.” So it is that process
and to recognize that it’s not a static process nor is it a process in which you
have to go through it at the same rate or tempo as anybody else.
It’s Natural to Disappear from Design
There’s a lot of people who come to Design and disappear from Design. It’s a
very, very common thing. They come in, they get turned on, and then they
have to get out. It’s too much. They don’t know it’s too much. They just go
elsewhere. They might go two years, three years. It doesn’t make any
difference.
I’ve never had somebody in my life who I’ve dealt with who’s had Human
Design in their life, and no matter what their reaction, no matter how it ended
up, they never got rid of it. They always had to come back to it. They never
had any choice and they don’t. But everybody has a different timing and
everybody has a different rhythm. It’s true for all of you in the way in which
you process this knowledge.
It’s natural and it’s natural for you also to go through the stages of the seven-
year program as individuals—your unique program, not mine, not somebody
130 Channels By Type
else’s. Only the timeframe is the same because that’s the cellular mechanism.
But when you actually have that “aha, ahaaaa” that’s something else.
For some people it comes very quickly and for other people it comes at the
end. For most it comes around this cusp of three to four years where you
finally get into the full swing of what it’s like to be you. But that’s the magic.
Don’t worry about clients who walk away from you and you don’t hear from
them. And they don’t salivate all over you and tell you how wonderful you’ve
been and that you’ve changed their lives. Do not be concerned with that.
You’ll find out two years later from somebody who knows them, “That session
they had with you, it really changed their lives.” Because that’s what happens.
That’s what you get to hear, but it’s later. It’s different. Don’t expect that that
person in the moment is going to say, “Wow, I’m a Generator.” Yeah, you
don’t need that.
The Collective Process
We’re going to shift away from the individual creative process which we have
seen is all projected. It’s all related to the identity. It carries with it this patina
that we all know of the creative process, this mythology of the melancholic
artist, this mythology of the artist self-obsessed. And of course this is the
nature of any kind of creativity that’s rooted in the Self, that it is going to be
self-absorbed.
We know that is correct in terms of the nature of the individual because that’s
what individuality is all about. But the moment that we move away from the
individual creativity and individual creative channels and we move into the
collective process, boy is it different.
In individual circuitry what we have is the gift of empowerment. That is, the
mutative capacity to be able to empower others and it’s this mutative capacity
that’s considered to be creative, and that if you can’t get the mutation across
there’s no creativity. But it’s empowerment.

The Sensing Circuit:
The Abstract – Channel 35-36
The Abstract is Impersonal Sharing of Creativity
The abstract process of what we’re
going to start with here in the
collective, this is impersonal. It is
about the sharing of creativity. It is
about the creative experience. This
is a major theme. Whenever you are
looking at the abstract, several
things to keep in mind.
In the Next Vehicle the Abstract Process is Eliminated
According to the Voice, when the change comes, when we leave behind
forever these vehicles, which is about 1,300 years away, when we get finally to
ride in our next version of vehicles, vehicles for consciousness, the abstract
process will have been eliminated. It doesn’t exist.
The Stream of Desire
And when this new generation of children starts coming in to the world in
2027, these children are going to carry the mutative
potential of awareness in the Solar Plex, these children
where the awareness is going to awaken in the 55th gate.
Ultimately, before we leave these vehicles, the emotional
system in emotional beings will awaken to its potential as
an awareness except the stream that goes from 41 to 35. It
will never be, can never be aware—never. That’s why it’s
so chaotic, that’s why it’s ruled by crisis. It can never be
aware.
And think about the wave that you’re dealing with in the
abstract process. Remember how this wave works; it’s
important to keep in mind. The abstract emotional person—and it doesn’t
matter whether they have all the gates or not, as long as they have any gate of
the four—they are already in the thematics of the process.
132 Channels By Type
Gate 41 – The Only Initiating Codon, Fantasy, Hunger
The way that it works is that the 41 is a gate of fantasy. In terms of its genetic
relationship, the 41st gate is the only initiating codon. It starts all human
experience as fantasy. And this fantasy is a pressure.
We can ride a balloon around the world. It’s a
pressure. It’s a pressure to have an experience and
the pressure is rooted in the fantasy.
In other words, the fantasizing of the possibility of
having that experience is something that can actually
lead to the need, the drive—the desire is the best
word—to have this experience. After all, this is the stream of desire. But you
see, you enter into the Solar Plex and you enter into the complexity of the Solar
Plex motor. So that 41, that initiating codon, is pushing pressure like trying to
push a car up a hill. It wants to be able to get up that hill.
Gate 30 – Feelings, The Plateau
Now the fact of the matter is that if it’s only the 41st gate and there’s no 30, you
can stay at the bottom of the hill and dream about the top. You don’t have to
get there. But the moment you get to the emotional system, and you get to the
30th gate, the clinging fire, you get to the gate of feelings. And when you get
to this gate of feeling, what you get to is that experience now has become
emotional, and it is connected to that very emotional wave.
The 30th gate operates as a plateau. It’s not about going up any higher. The
moment that the fantasy becomes a feeling, you’ve reached the plateau and
you’re going to stay on that plateau.
Gate 36 – Inexperience, Crisis, The Need to Penetrate
And you’re going to stay on that plateau until you get to the 36th gate, the gate
of inexperience, the gate of crisis. Remember that this is the most sexual of
all streams. It is the true desire that moves a human specie. When you get to
the 36th gate, you get to the need to penetrate. Now that’s still the plateau.
From the 30 to the 36, you’re on a plateau.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111133333333
Gate 35 – Being Full and Crashing Down in the Wave
The moment that you have the opportunity for consummation in the 35th gate,
the moment that experience is there, you drop like a stone off the edge of that
plateau and go crashing down in the wave. Think
about the relationship between the 41 and the 35. The
41 is a gate of hunger. The 35 is a gate of being full.
Been there, done that.
If you have a 35 in your life, they’re a great cook who
never eats. They’re always full until suddenly they
realize they’re empty. And then they start all over
again climbing up the mountain of desire, getting to
the point of consummation and crashing down again.
In dealing with the emotional system, you have to see
what happens to people through that 30 and 36
experience. In other words, they’re going through the
emotional wave of hope and pain and they’re going through that wave as they
move through the plateau. Some moments they’re deeply hopeful “Oh I wish,
I wish, I wish”. And at other moments they are deeply disturbed by it, “I can’t,
I can’t, they won’t let me.”
Nothing is more important to humanity than the creative contribution of the
35-36. It is very, very important for us. It is what distinguishes human beings
from all other species.
Channel 33-13 – The Prodigal Shares Experience
See, at the end of the abstract process you have the 33-13, you have the
prodigal, and you have the prodigal that takes the information
of experience and shares that experience with those that can
never have it.
Never forget that human beings are deeply voyeuristic. It is
one of our gifts that we are able to learn about experience from
other people’s experience. We don’t actually have to have the
experience ourselves. We read books, we go to films, to the
theater. We can vicariously, voyeuristically take in the
experience, but the experience has to be there for us to take in and we always
134 Channels By Type
need those who are going to open up new experiential ways for us. For
without that, we do not learn what it truly is to be human and what the human
way is really all about.
We Collect and Codify Our Experience as Knowledge
We as a specie are driven by desire. We’re driven by desire. We are driven to
be experiential in the world, and we are driven to seek out the experience of
others. “What did you do yesterday?” “You have a good time last night?” It’s
part of our everyday language to try to find out what the experience of the
other was all about.
Think of the benefit to our specie in that we collect our experience. We codify
our experience as language, as history, as literature. Now we provide each
succeeding generation with an extraordinary resource of knowledge to start
with, to see how each successive generation has a head start in that sense.
We’re not like others species. We do not have to start from scratch each time.
We don’t. And this ability to be able to collectively collect our experience is
essential.
Channel 35-36 Brings on Crisis and Chaos
If you have a 35-36 in your life, you wish to hell that Hitler had gassed only 35-
36s. It would have been great. Get them the hell out of this world because
they’re a pain in the neck and they bring on believable crisis, transitoriness,
chaos into everybody’s life and they’re the great poisoners of the world. Talk
about the horror of poisoning the well, they poison wells all the time. That’s
their nature. Not their fault. We could still gas them innocently, but
nonetheless it’s not their fault.
The 35-36 is an emotional Manifesting channel. That’s quite a combination.
Here is a pure manifesting energy. Now what do we know about the
Manifestor? We know that the Manifestor is always going to meet punishment
and we know the Manifestor is angry. We know the Manifestor is angry before
they even act because they expect to meet resistance and the anger gives them
strength to meet it over and over and over again. They don’t ask for help, they
don’t ask for guidance. They just do it, and they just do it out of their
emotional wave.

We’ve already seen in basic analysis that the moment you have a defined Solar
Plex Center you have the authority in anybody’s chart. It’s an automatic
authority. It’s an automatic authority that says “No truth in the now. You’re
going to have to wait. You’re going have to sleep on it. There is no other
way.”
The 35-36 is Deeply Creative as a Potential
Now think about the 35-36 and its contribution to humanity. You see, this is a
deeply creative channel as a potential. It’s the creativity that’s says “I have been
there and I can tell you about it and save you the trouble.” It’s wonderful.
Wonderful story, at least for me.
Ra’s Experience with The Voice
One of those incredible experiences, I had just had my experience with the
Voice. It was three or four weeks later and it was a time of real depression for
me. Deep, deep depression. After all, I didn’t want to walk around telling
people I’d heard stuff from a voice and things like that. Weird.
And one day I was sitting on the side of the hill and I looked down and I could
see there’s a little path that ran down from my ruin that went all the way down
to the highway. And I could see in the distance a car, like one of these little
tiny cars down there; it stopped at the entrance to my pathway. I recognized
the car, it was a friend of mine and he’s somebody who was a scientist.
And I saw that out of the back of his car he had taken out some bundles and
he had put them down at the end of my little pathway and then he disappeared.
So yeah, I went down there. And there’s a magazine that’s published in
England—a very good magazine that’s called the New Scientist—and it’s the
only weekly magazine in the world that covers all of the latest things in science
on a week-by-week basis. And it’s written for scientists, written in that
language but has incredible information in it each week.
There were two bundles of these magazines—104 of them. Two years of
knowledge. So I take these two bundles and I drag them up to my fig tree, a
real freak. Sitting there with my ruin and here’s these two bundles of New
Scientist magazines. And I ripped open the first one and I opened up the
magazine and then I just started to tremble. .
136 Channels By Type
I started to laugh and I have never ever, ever, ever in my life laughed so much
so hard. I was in so much pain. I wanted to stop laughing because it hurt me
so much and I could not stop laughing. I kept on seeing these tens of millions
of scientists all over the planet spending their whole lives researching some
little minutiae. And there I am, this freak in the middle of nowhere and all of
this knowledge is put in front of me—all of it, for nothing. They were all
working for me. And I know, I spent a couple of weeks going through two
years of scientific evidence. It was great. All these little drones and slaves out
there. “Let’s get this to Ra.”
You see, the experiential way is extraordinary. With my kind of mind, I could
have spent my whole life, investigating fruit flies. I’ve been saved that. We’re
all saved that. You see, that’s the beauty of living in the whole. It’s the beauty
of recognizing that not all experiences are yours.
I often shock people terribly when they come to me for a mystical reading and
I just look at them and say, “Excuse me, but you’re not really mystical.” They
get really fucking upset. “What do you mean, I’m not mystical. I’ve done all
these things. I see images, voices talk to me, I channeled my grandmother.”
Well, what to do. It isn’t for everybody.
In Shared Experience We are Not Isolated
You all would have dropped dead the moment the Voice would have touched
you. You would have sizzled and burnt. Period. It’s not for everybody,
nothing is. That’s the beauty of being able to have shared experience; we’re not
isolated and lost in our own little perspective. We have the vast accumulation
of human intelligence which is really incredible, and we have it at our fingertips.
I sit down at night and I turn on the computer and I go on the web. I love
going into the brain of the world and there’s all these stuff out there. Anything
is available to you. Just write in neutrino and watch what happens. Go to one
of these search engines and just put in neutrino. It’s incredible.
Those of you who had the gray course, talk. The Voice told me about how
eventually the next process for us in terms of consciousness will take place on a
Moon of Uranus. It’s called Oberon.
So one night, I’m on the web and I go looking at some, I don’t know, NASA
photographs. And I went looking at their Moon collection and I’m out there in
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111133337777
space looking at different Moons. It was very nice. And
then I get to Oberon. I had a real shock. Because
written over the top of the picture of Oberon, which was
a gorgeous picture, written over the top is a statement,
that says, “Is this the Earth’s twin Moon?” I thought,
wow, that’s a weird thing to say.
New Experiences Bring Crisis, Chaos and Pain
Nonetheless, we have access to all of this experience. It’s what is so profound
about us. What our potential is, all of this is rooted in this stream. So at the
same time, at the personal level, it brings chaos and pain. It brings chaos and
pain, because after all, new experiences by their very nature are going to bring
crisis—anything new. That’s what the crisis means. Don’t take that to
extenuating lengths of description because you don’t have to. Those crises can
be very minor.
But anytime you enter into something new, there are always going to be aspects
of it that are going to be difficult, that are going to present problems. But
without this stream, we don’t have this gift, we don’t have the internet, and we
don’t have all these other things. They’re just not there and we don’t have
something else.
35-36s are Useful
You see, the 35-36 is walking along with a friend of theirs and they see a
mushroom growing by the side of the road, and they decide that they’re going
to eat it. And of course, because they’re emotional Manifestors and because
they don’t know anything about being an emotional Manifestor, they yank that
mushroom out of the ground, they stuff it in their mouth and drop dead.
Their friend goes back to the village and says, “By the way, don’t eat those
mushrooms.” See, 35-36s are useful. They are useful. Without them, we
wouldn’t know that you can’t eat that mushroom. Whether they survive it or
not, that’s what they’re here for. They’re here to save all of us the problem of
having to go through so many things because to be such a conscious creature,
it’s not possible alone to have what you need as far as knowledge is concerned
without tapping in into all of this field of experience.

The Difference between the 16-48 and the 35-36
It’s my joke about the difference between the 16-48 and the 35-36, is that the
16-48 gets introduced to a musical instrument, practices every day of their life,
becomes a master. The 35-36 is introduced to an instrument and quits after a
week. Has a crisis and quits. Tries the next instrument, has a crisis and quits.
Tries the next instrument, has a crisis and quits.
But, if you want to be musical and you don’t know what instrument to play,
don’t go to the logical master. They’re going to tell you that their instrument is
it because it’s the only instrument that they know, and for them it’s everything.
Go to the abstract, experiential. And they’ll say to you, “Well, I tried this and
it’s terrible. You might like that, that’s okay.” That’s what we need them for.
Therapy for 35-36s: Write or Retell Your Experience
As therapy for 35-36s, I always recommend that they write about their
experiences or retell them. After all, out of the 35-36 you have its relationship
to the 11-56 and the storytelling, to get people to believe you that yesterday you
saw the Lochness Monster and stuff like that.
But the reality is that it’s very, very important for them to get their experiences
out because their experiences, though they may be deeply uncomfortable for
them, are of value to the other. Because this is the way in which the human
community is guided to recognition and understanding of what it is to be
human in this life, what is it like to experience Midtown Manhattan. Now, you
don’t want everybody living there. You can get the information out. You can
pass it along.
So the 35-36 has to recognize its creative power. That its experiences need to
be correct for them, so that what they can then share has power, has impact.
You see, the moment that that experience is over for the abstract person, it
crashes. So the experience is everything.
The Experience is Not Personal, it is Experiential
That’s why people who, in terms of their sexual life or in terms of their
personal life, if they’re only oriented towards the abstract, it can be very
difficult for them because they don’t have this personal relationship with the
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111133339999
other. This is purely experiential. What’s it like doing it in a canoe? It’s
experiential, it’s not personal. And it’s important always to keep that in mind.
And because it’s not personal, one has to be very, very clear that the experience
is going to be the right experience to go through, over and over again with the
emotional person, it’s so important. We have a lot of, well, there’s a lot of
propaganda about how to control emotions. But of course, that’s not what this
knowledge is all about.
Emotions Have to be Expressed, not Controlled
Emotions, not only can they not be controlled—it’s detrimental—but the
reality is that emotions have to be expressed—have to. They are, after all, the
world authority. If you take the design of the world, if you take the design of
all of humanity, you’re going to end up with emotional authority.
If Emotional Authority is Clear, the Story Won’t be
Distorted
So one of those things to recognize is that only by being clear about the
emotional authority and how it operates mechanically, can the 35-36 have
experiences that are legitimately of value. Now, that’s no guarantee that they’re
good experiences. If you’re clear emotionally, you can kill somebody. It’s not
necessarily a nice experience, but it is correct if you’re clear. And that
experience is valid for retelling if it’s clear, because it does not distort what it is
to be a human being, and what we don’t want is distortion in the story.
“I watched my master levitate.” Give me a fucking break. And it gets retold
and retold and retold and retold as if it actually happened. And you see
whatever comes out of the experiential mouth, people listen to. That’s why
newspapers like the Star or the National Enquirer, that’s how they make a
living. They make a living teasing you with human experience. “This UFO
landed in my house and these two guys came out and they asked for milk.”
See, it’s the legitimacy that is so important. We have so much confusion in the
description of human experience and the more and more sophisticated we
became, the greater the dilemma was. For example, if you read the History of
Carthage, Carthage was an ancient North African Society that about 300-400
years before Christ was a dominant culture in the Mediterranean. And the
140 Channels By Type
Romans were just developing their power, and around 200 BC the Romans
went to war with the Carthaginians. They actually had three wars with them,
then eventually destroyed them.
And when they went over there not only did they destroy them as enemies but
they went over there and they put salt into the earth, they destroyed their
collection of tribal knowledge, they burnt their temples to the ground. In other
words, they obliterated the society. Three hundred years later you had Roman
historians writing about Carthage. Give me a break. They didn’t know
anything about it, and we don’t know anything about Carthage because of that.
It would be like Hitler writing the history of the Jews.
And you see the more sophisticated we’ve become, the more important it is for
us as a shared humanity to understand the true human experience, the more
verification we need. In early years around the middle the 18th century,
historians finally got together and said, “Look, we’re going to need three
different sources.” They made up their own rule and they made up that rule
because they realized that the human experience was not being translated
honestly. You see that all the time now.
Distortion of the Emotional Field: Conspiracies and
Lawyers
I watched this delightful Monica Circus, and when you watch the way
everybody describes the same thing. How many ways in which the human
experience can be described, how easy it is to distort all that. It’s incredibly
simple. You know saying ‘yes’ isn’t even saying yes anymore. You get into this
whole experiential mess and this is what you’re dealing with when you’re
dealing with an emotional system that’s not clear. That’s why you have a
society like America that is addicted to conspiracies, because nothing’s clear.
The moment that an experience happens, everybody says “Aha,” but these
answers on the surface, they’re not real. Nobody trusts that anymore. Nobody
trusts somebody when they say, “This is what happened.” That’s why you’ve
got so many lawyers in this country.
So one of the things to recognize is that that’s the distortion of the emotional
field. That’s the emotional field at work. The creativity of the 35-36, its ability
to truly be able to say, “I’ve been there and done that,” and its trustworthiness
in that expression is entirely connected to it living out its Type. This is, at its
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111144441111
purest level, an emotional Manifestor that has to wait out the wave before it
lets anybody know what it wants to do.
Think about how that works another way around. That 35-36, in having their
experience, once the experience is over,—remember that the experience for
them, that’s where they get the material they need. It isn’t an end in itself; the
experience is meant to end so that they can reflect on it, to be able to give back
that information.
Follow the Emotional Mechanic before Expression
And what that means is that for the emotional Manifestor, out of the 35-36,
not only is it a question of following the emotional mechanic before you enter
into the experience, but to follow the emotional mechanic before you express
your opinion about that whole experience, before you retell that experience,
before you share that experience with the other. You’re a 35-36 and you’ve just
done something for the first time, and you’re at the high end of your wave and
somebody says to you, “What’s it like?” and it’s totally distorted what you
describe, totally, because you’re only describing an aspect of it.
It’s like people who are emotional, who get a telephone call. Anybody
emotional getting a telephone call has to realize that they only hear according to
their wave. They can’t hear any other way. So you’re emotional and you’re
down and somebody tells you that you’re the Messiah and you only hear the
bad news because you’re conditioned by the nature of that wave.
The Crash Quality is Creative
So think about what it means to be a 35-36. What it means to be a 35-36 is to
get deeply into your desire. It’s not about eliminating it. It’s about living that
desire out through its up and down. It’s not about getting rid of all that, but
it’s about realizing that before you manifest that desire that you have to let the
other one know. No surprises. And you can only let them know after you’ve
gone through your wave, then you can let them know.
Going Down begins a Deeply Reflective Process
And when the experience is over and you crash, that crash is like melancholy.
And when I say that, I simply mean that the quality of that crash is creative.
It’s something that, of course, disturbs 35-36s because if they don’t recognize
142 Channels By Type
that, it feels like all these experiences are just painful and nothing else, or just
disappointing and nothing else.
The important thing to recognize is that when your experience is over, once the
exhilaration is over, once the orgasm has happened, that place of going down is
deeply reflective because that’s the place where you begin your process of
reflection.
The experience is out of you. It’s one of those things for you to see. It’s like
don’t comment on the food while you’re eating it. Wait until you’ve started
into your digestive process. This is the experiential way. Be in the eating.
Love it. Be right there in your desire. “Oh, all I wanted was sushi.” You can’t
keep on thinking that while you’re eating it, it’s insane. You have to be there in
the eating. But when it’s over, there is an automatic drop. The desire’s
fulfilled. You’re full. That’s the moment that the slow process of digestion
begins and the process of reflection.
The next morning when you wake up, you’re actually going to have a clear
impression of how good that meal was. But it’s the next morning, and it has
nothing to do with where you were at in your wave while you were having it
the night before. While you’re having it, if you’re in the high end of your wave,
you think it’s the best sushi you ever ate. And then you wake up the next
morning and somebody says, “Did you enjoy the meal last night?” And you
hear yourself say, “No. I didn’t like that and I didn’t like that.” But while you
were up in your wave, you didn’t notice. It comes after.
The Key to the Abstract Circuit is in its Tantra
That’s why it’s so important that the abstract emotional being enters into
experience correctly. Because if they enter
into that experience correctly, they are going
to be in the experience from the start and
that’s what matters. It’s the only thing that
matters. That’s why it’s so important when
you’re looking at the abstract circuit, the key
to the abstract circuit is in its tantra.
If you look at the 46-29, the channel of
succeeding where other people fail or failing
where other people succeed. And that
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111144443333
Channel of Discovery is not about discovering while you’re in it.
Whenever you need to know the essence, the meaning of something, look at its
first lines. Look at the first line of the 46: Art for art’s sake. Just be there. Be
in the experience. Be in the experience absolutely, totally absorbed in the
experience. That’s why it can be so upsetting for people.
The Whole Secret of Desire
You’re a 35-36 and you have a lover that you’ve just met, you make love with a
passion and a desire that’s extraordinary. Your partner thinks that they’re the
most wanted being on Earth. They have to worry about being devoured alive.
And then the orgasm comes and there’s death all around. It’s suddenly over.
Because, you see, the whole secret of desire, the whole secret of being abstract
is that you drop totally into the experience. Never question, never stop, never
look over your shoulder. Bury yourself in the experience, and when it’s over
and you come out on the other side. Then you can begin to reflect on it. “Ah,
that was great, or not”. But later, it’s always later.
We have a situation in which, like the 8-1 in the individual creative process, that
here we have a creative expression that has a voice. And considering that it is
the only abstract creative process, it automatically has its voice. That voice says
“I feel and usually I feel like a change.” That’s the voice. “I feel or not. I feel
like doing it because I’ve never done it. I don’t feel like doing it because I have
done it.”
Basic Formula for Parents of a 35-36
Now there’s a basic formula for parents who have a 35-36 child. That formula
is: your child does not have to repeat things. It is unhealthy for them to repeat
things. Now I’m talking about experiences.
So think about what happens to parents that have a 35-36 child and they put
the child into this after school program or that one or the next one or the next
one or the next one, and of course the child by its very nature doesn’t want to
be there. It has the experience and once it had the experience, its natural
mechanism is what’s next.

The 35-36 is Not a “Quitter”
And yet the conditioning of its family is, “You have to stay with this. You can’t
be a quitter.” They’re not quitters. These are not necessarily Sacral people.
Sacral people are quitters. The 35-36 is not a quitter. They are ‘do it once, get
it over, get the experience, leave it behind.’
So it means that these children are under a tremendous amount of pressure,
and pressure that is deeply unhealthy for them because they’re not here to
repeat things. They’re not here to end up “you practice your piano.” That’s a
killer. And remember what happens to anger when it’s emotionalized, it
becomes rage.
You come home, and they’ve done a ‘who’ on the piano, you know “whack.” I
don’t have to play anymore, it’s broken. Or they kill their music teacher. One
or the other, eh, no more. They don’t want to do that again. If you could
bring them home every day a different musician with a different instrument,
everything would be terrific, because that’s what they need.
The 36: Deeply Eclectic, No Depth
These are, by their very nature, deeply eclectic human beings. They have vast
potential and interest, but no depth. See that’s the difference between the 36
and the 48. And they’re very important to understand as mirrors within the
design, and we’ll see, because next we’ll meet the 16-48 as the other side of the
collective process of creativity.
The 48: I Have to Go Deep, Deep, Deep
They’re very different and yet at the same time they are mirrors of each other.
The 48 says: “I have to go deep, deep, deep because only if I go deep can
repetition be possible.” You understand. “Each step I can go deeper and that
makes it possible.” That’s the 48 saying more depth, more depth, more depth.
The 36: I Have to Penetrate it Only Once
The 36 says: “I only have to penetrate it once and then I go on to the next
thing.” That’s the 36’s depth. Its depth is to do it and then go on to the next
thing. Very, very important. So when you’re dealing with creativity that’s
coming out of the 35-36, you have to see that that needs to be nourished. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111144445555
Adult 35-36s are the Great Poisoners
The adults that you meet, these are the great poisoners. And I use that
terminology carefully. I’m somebody with an undefined emotional system so I
know the power of the emotional system to poison. It just can. And what I
mean by ‘poisoning’ is something that anybody with an undefined emotional
system understands. Your stomach gets into knots, you begin to tremble
inside, there is a slow or fast growing nausea that accompanies that and it can
take 24 hours to get the trembling out of your body. That’s poisoning and
nobody poisons better than an emotional Manifestor.
They can poison you instantaneously. And of course it’s a Catch-22 because
they don’t know who they are, and because they don’t understand their
emotional wave, that’s how they deal with resistance. You get in their way, they
poison you. And of course that creates all kinds of problems in their
relationships, enormous problems in their relationships, and it’s because they
are operating ignorantly out of their wave. Just jumping on that power.
Now the thing to be clear is that when I describe the voice of the 35 to you and
I say that the 35 says, “I feel, and usually I feel like a change,” that’s a
conditioned element there. It doesn’t mean that they have to do something. It
doesn’t mean they have to jump into the experience. And the older they get,
the easier it is because they can say, “Been there done that.” When they’re
young, it’s very difficult.
Only When Authority is Honored Can the Experience be
Legitimate
The only protection that they have is to understand the nature of their Type
and how it operates, and most important here is that emotional authority. You
see, we need the 35-36 to guide us through the experiential wave. We cannot,
as long as we are in these vehicles, we cannot do without them. We need them.
But what we want from them as a whole is that the experiences that they’re
going to tell us about that guide us, that those experiences are legitimate and
pure. That they’re clean. That they are not poisoned, and they’re only going to
be clear if those emotional beings are operating out of respect for their wave.
Think about the importance of what clarity really is.
I was having this discussion with Tom earlier about the complexities in finding
where the authority is in a chart. It’s one of those things to recognize about the
146 Channels By Type
whole business about being an abstract person is that only when the authority
is honored can the experience be legitimate. The authority has to be honored
in order for the experience to be legitimate.
Splenic Authority is the Only Inner Authority That Can be
Relied On
Now look, we have three different areas of ‘awareness,’ so-called. There’s only
one that’s really aware. That’s the Splenic Center. So if you look at or listen to
my discussions about the nature of authority, you’ll see that wherever there is a
defined Spleen, it is authoritative. Now it may operate through a Generator or
may operate through a Generator being conditioned by the emotional wave.
But it’s the only awareness that we have that can ever be truly relied on for
inner authority. Remember the mind never has inner authority.
The Spleen when it’s defined always has inner authority because it’s a pure and
true awareness. Now obviously that awareness operates according to your
Type. I’m somebody who is a single definition Ego Manifestor, but my
authority is my defined Spleen. I don’t have a Sacral that dominates me, or I
don’t have an emotional system that becomes the authority. I have this defined
Splenic Center, and that means that I don’t know anything until it
spontaneously comes out. It’s the only authority I have.
So as a Manifestor, in my clearing the way, it is never a plan or a strategy. It’s
not possible. It’s either going to happen or not, and it’s either going to be the
intuition in the moment that makes it happen or not. After all, Manifestors, as
a strategy, are designed to eliminate resistance. But as a Manifestor I can tell
you that they don’t have to. They're the only ones that are Manifestors. They
can just keep blowing people over. I mean they can and they do.
So the reality is that for the Splenic Center, that defined Splenic Center is
something that you can really rely on as an awareness in the now. It can be that
authority because that’s an awareness that we really can trust. It’s four and a
half million years old for us.
The Mind is Twice as Powerful as the Spleen
It’s been the heart of our awareness from the beginning of our specie. We
already know what kind of turmoil the mind brings to us and yet everybody
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111144447777
exalts the mind far above the Spleen. Now, the mind is twice as powerful as
the Spleen so it can blow the Spleen over.
You’re a splenic person and your Spleen tells you not to do something, your
mind can overload that immediately if you let it, if you allow it, if you’re
unaware. And then of course you pay the consequences, so you end up being
the splenic person who says, “I just knew it, I just knew it,” and usually while
they're lying in the hospital. “I just knew I shouldn’t have done that.” The
mind never has inner authority—never has inner authority. So it’s not like the
mind is an awareness that you can trust in your life. It isn't.
The Solar Plex is an Intelligence Program
Then you come to the Solar Plex where this potential of spirit awareness is
right at its cusp of coming up. And this motor that is the dominant theme of
the emotional system, that the moment you recognize that honoring the wave
is an intelligence program, it’s an awareness program because that’s what clarity
is.
You see, we all have a different kind of metabolism. I talked earlier about this
process of seven years, how different people operate at different levels, at
different ways of digesting. Emotional awareness, emotional clarity is a by-
product exclusively of time. You see, emotional people can be deeply
profound. As somebody who is so open emotionally as I am, I know how to
love them. I know their beauty. I know how wonderful they can be. I know
the deep, deep, deep pleasure that lies within the Solar Plex. Its joy for life, its
sexiness. It’s all of those things. It’s lovely, lovely, lovely.
The Wave is a Timing Mechanism for Clarity that Comes
Alive
However, that’s a sampling of a high end of a wave because it’s also many
other things. And you see, this perspective of moving through the wave, this is
a timing mechanism for clarity. It’s not like you’re being punished because
you're emotional. “You have to wait.” It’s not a punishment; it is the way the
awareness works. It is the way the clarity comes alive. Sleeping on this is not
enough, but it’s a start.
148 Channels By Type
And the whole thing for emotional people to recognize is that by waiting out
their wave, their experiences, particularly here in this context, that their
experiences are valid no matter whether they’re full of crisis or not, no matter
whether people get hurt or not, they're valid. They are correct because the
experience was entered into correctly.
Part of the 35-36s Creativity is Sexual Talent
Now one of the things to recognize about the 35-36 is that part of its creativity
is to be sexually creative. And it is the channel at the sexual level of the talent
for making love. It’s a talent for sexuality and that talent for sexuality is about
experience—it’s about experience.
Now, you don’t get the experience making love to the same person every day.
You don’t, unless you’re tribal and that’s okay for you; you don’t. You don’t
learn anything. So the experiential way says, “Okay, we have some experiences
to get here.” Out of that you get a good lover. That’s what it’s about. We are
enriched by our experiences—we’re enriched by them. Let them then be clear
experiences.
If you’ve got a 35-36 lover and they’re about to take you through a sexual
experience that you’ve never had before, if they’re clear in entering into that
experience, you’re going to have a wonderful time with them. You may,
depending on your conditioning, be very disappointed when it’s over because it
was fun doing it. And you’re going to have a lot of trouble convincing them
that they should do it again because they’ve done it already and it’s over. But it
turns out to be the kind of experience you remember. “That was great.”
Because that’s what it’s about.
But if that 35-36 is not clear, if they want you because they’re at the low end of
their wave and they’re needy, or they want you because they’re at the high end
of their wave and they can make you want them, you’re not going to end up
with that experience that’s says “Wow that was great.” You’re not. And when
they crash, they’re going to crash hard, because it was the wrong experience for
them. They did not enter into it correctly.

The Abstract Process is Full of Illness
Now, that’s very difficult when you’re dealing with horny, emotional people.
They’ll get at the high end of their wave and are ready for anything, and are
ready to jump, particularly when they’re young. “I want to try that.” Okay.
But you see, the moment that you’re not clear emotionally in entering into the
experience, it’s the moment that you open yourself up to illness, and the
abstract process is full of illness. It’s full of it, full of it. After all, it’s part of
the human experience. Don’t you watch all these doctor shows, all these
medical shows, all these carve up the body shows? “Okay, give me the
scalpel.” What is it, “ER”? Isn’t this the most popular show in America?
Don’t we just love all that?
You see, the Solar Plex Center presents us with all the modern problems. This
is diabetes. Diabetes is very common in America, a classic example. This is
prostate problems. Show me an American male who doesn’t have a prostate
problem. All of that is in the emotional system. The kidneys, the pancreas, the
prostate. Think about it.
If you’re an emotional person and you’re not waiting for the wave, you’re doing
damage to those things. At the first level of that damage in women, it’s
problems in their menstrual cycle—irregular cycle, painful cycle. All kinds of
difficulties inherent in that. In men, it’s bladder problems, starts immediately.
The next step of that is deterioration.
Diabetes in Gate 30 When obsessed with Finding Sweetness
The sweetest gate of all is the 30. I know, I’m a 41. I know the sweetness of
the 30. It can also be very sour, and it’s the place where diabetes exists or not.
It’s a source of it in the body. To be obsessed with finding sweetness in life
can be quite a disease if you’re not guided properly, and you can only be guided
by your Type.
Physical Health Problems Whether Defined or Not
There is an assumption that if you’re open, the not-self, what I teach you about
how the not-self takes in disease that does not belong to it, and of course gets
very ill and that is an obvious. But I don’t want you to think that just because
something in you is defined that it is not susceptible to physical health
problems. It is. Consistent problems, 24 hours a day all your life, because it is
150 Channels By Type
fixed and defined. And you’re at your physical peril when you don’t pay
attention to your Type.
Emotional people can have all kinds of very difficult medical problems,
nagging things, bad back most common. If you’ve got an undefined emotional
and you identify with the Solar Plexus, if you’ve got a defined emotional system
and you don’t wait for the wave, you’ve got lower back pain. Period.
And you can have yourself carved up. You can go to chiropractors, you can
have a built in masseuse and it isn’t going to make any difference. You’re still
going to have lower back pain because you’re not living out your nature.
You’re not living it out according to your Type. You’re not eliminating the
resistance that makes you unhealthy.
I try to, particularly with emotional people,—it’s one of my personal jokes that
if I can get emotional people to be awake, life is going to be much more
pleasant for me, which I think is terrific. So emotional people, wake up. You
know, make life easy for Ra. Then life would be nothing but pleasure and sex,
which is quite alright. And food, good food, one would assume.
Only Four Manifesting Channels
In dealing with the 35-36, and understanding that
there are only four Manifesting channels that are
really Manifesting channels—we don’t have a lot of
Manifesting channels—that it’s a dominant theme.
It’s everywhere around us. And when you go into a
bookstore or you go into a supermarket and there
are all these magazines and there are all these books,
that’s what you’re seeing. You’re seeing the
collective 35-36 experience.
The Illusion of America
America has just had a huge dose of that, sexual voyeurism at an
institutionalized, Supreme Court level. I loved all that. I thought that was
hilarious. It’s one of the nicest things that I’ve ever seen. The joke for me in
all of that, by the way, is that throughout all of that, a consistent two-thirds of
the American public said we don’t care and it was delightful to see that. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111155551111
You have this traditional right-wing consciousness in America that’s always
been there, some place. This is a country founded by Puritans. That
consciousness is underneath and that consciousness is saying: “No, no, no, no,
we Americans, we don’t do that. We don’t do any of that stuff. That’s all
perverse, that’s not real. We don’t do that, blah, blah, blah, blah.”
And there’s 66% of the American public saying, “Yes we do, we do all that. All
of us do that. We do that all the time, all the time, all the time. It’s nice, it’s
fun.” It was delightful to watch all that. And I would watch these pundits, the
talking heads, and they would get so uptight about this. “Well, this Ra is
running around” and I thought ‘oh wonderful.’ And there’s all these
Americans out there reading, “What did he do with the cigar?” They don’t care
about that other stuff. They don’t care at all. This is the illusion of America.
It’s one of the great illusions about this country. You see, because the moment
you lift off this kind of Puritan,—I had a great laugh.
I just put my young son into elementary school and he’s the son of a freak and
he’s lived all over the world and he’s lived in freak communities and all this
stuff. And then all of a sudden he’s in this elementary school and I had walked
by the classroom just as he had started his first day and they’re all standing up
there doing the pledge allegiance to the flag. And I see him standing there with
his hand on his heart and he’s looking around and he’s thinking, “What the hell
are these people doing? This is really weird.”
America’s got this real moral thing on the surface, but underneath, you know
right away that two-thirds of this country really doesn’t care about all that stuff.
They don’t care. That was a beautiful thing to watch.
The 35-36 is the Only Creative Channel That’s All about
Sex
You see, we can never separate the human way from sex. You can’t. You see,
this channel is the only creative channel that’s all about sex. It’s what it’s there
for. Oh yeah, sure it is about the experiential way, blah, blah, blah, blah but it’s
about sex. It’s about the desire for the other.
The deepest human way is that while you’re looking for an experience, you’re
looking for sex at the same time. That is the human way, that is what’s driving
us. We are driven by this desire and no matter how hard you try to cover that
152 Channels By Type
up and say that it’s not there, you can’t, because it’s the part of us that is so
truly human.
Not only that, but we have evolved that to a level that is really spooky. We’re
not like sheep that do it twice a year. “Alright it’s season.” We don’t have that.
We have that, 24 hours a day, all the time, endlessly, driving us. That’s the
whole thing to recognize about what it is to be human. See, what the gods
want from us is that we’re busy and we fuck. It’s what they want. It’s all
they’ve ever wanted. Go forth and multiply. It’s what they’ve always wanted.
Be busy about it.
Don’t Covet thy Neighbor’s Ass
And what’s so funny about that is that the moment you get away from the
abstract of that and you go into all the other areas, everybody’s saying, “Wait a
minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let’s make a rule. Okay.” You know the
tribe says “Let’s be monogamous. Okay. Let’s make that a rule. Okay. We’re
really not like that, are we? No, we’re not. Okay. Don’t covet thy neighbor’s
whatever.” That’s a great line in the Bible. Don’t covet thy neighbor’s ass.
When I was a kid and I read that, I thought, that’s really funny. And I can’t
stop coveting my neighbor’s ass because that’s the human way. There’s
nothing you can do about that. You get all these moral codes, coming from the
tribes saying (makes sound). They get heavy, eh. They circumcise you whether
you’re a man or a woman. They tell you can’t do it until you’re this. They put
zippers on you. They do everything. “Shhh, don’t do that.” It’s not the way it
works for children. But that’s not the way we’re designed.
There’s nothing in the 35-36 that says I’m making love to have children,
absolutely nothing—nothing. This is the illusion of the tribe, and of course the
tribe leads to the priesthood so the priesthood ingrains that. The priesthood
says, “They’re all bad. These people over there; we in the tribe, we’re not bad.
We are all ma and pa shops here,” because they don’t understand all that.
The Tribe Finds the Collective Disturbing
Why do you think the tribe finds the collective so disturbing? I mean, really
disturbing. They don’t mind individual sexuality because individual sexuality is
romantic. It can be very personal, it can be very profound, or it can be very
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111155553333
impersonal and distant. It’s okay. They can find a place for that. But
collective sexuality? Collective sexuality is really bizarre to the tribe, because it
destroys their families. It breaks up their homes. White people make love to
black people and Chinese people, and all of that’s horrendous to the tribe.
They can’t stand it.
And so what the tribe is always trying to do is control that collective. Why do
you think that people in the right wing, for example, in their little tribal
configurations are so upset by things like the internet? The only companies
that make money on the internet sell sex. The rest of it is all illusion right now.
You can buy stock in one of these funny things, but I tell you something, if you
want to make money on the web, get a good sex site and make money. And of
course that collective availability: “Here it is.” It’s terrifying to the tribe.
So it’s one of those things to understand about the crisis that the abstract
process brings with its desire. “I don’t want to stay on the farm anymore. I
want to go out there and do things.” And for every story of the little tribal boy
or girl who goes out into the world and makes good, that sells their
autobiographies at the local supermarket, you got thousands and millions of
tribal kids saying, “I want that too, I want that too, I want to do that, too.”
So the 35-36 in its creativity is an expression of two things: the deep need for
experience in humanity in order to provide a guideline for those who cannot be
the ones to do the experience. A guideline for others about the nature of what
it is to be human. But it can never be separated from the inherent sexuality
that’s in this stream. This stream is about sexual desire. That’s where the high
comes from.
The Magic: Being Alive in the Experience is a Miracle
The fact is that when a 35-36 drives an automobile at 700 miles an hour and
breaks the speed of sound, they get an orgasm. It’s like wow. You get this
incredible buzz, because that’s what the 35-36 experience is all about. And I
want to tell you something, and if they actually entered in correctly according to
their Type, they wouldn’t have to do it sexually all the time.
In other words, they wouldn’t have to go for the physical orgasm of the
sexuality as some kind of evidence that the experience has been validated.
They would get that out of the experience itself whether it was shoveling snow
154 Channels By Type
or washing the dishes. See, that’s the magic. The magic is that in being alive
any experience is a miracle.
Watching People Walk
I travel a lot. Stay in funny places sometimes and for many, many years, I
worked regularly in Amsterdam. I had an apartment that I stayed in, in the
center of the city. It’s called The Dam; it’s quite the busy place. And I had a
big huge window seat about three floors up and I would sit in that window seat
while I was waiting for clients and I would just look out the window and watch
people walk.
Now, there’s nothing funnier to me than watching people walk. It’s one of the
most the hilarious things that I know. Human beings are really funny creatures.
We’re not four-legged after all. If you look at most of mammalian life, you’ll
see that most of mammalian life is four-legged. It’s kind of easy to get around
on four legs.
But when you watch human beings and you watch this two-legged creature,
and you watch them walking without thinking about what they’re doing, you’ll
notice what’s actually happening is that mechanically they’re all throwing
themselves to the ground because that’s what your body does when it walks.
You’re throwing yourself to the ground. And fortunately, some mechanical
part of you sticks out a leg so that you don’t fall flat on your face so that you
can keep the momentum going.
Now, if you watch human beings walking down the street, and you just watch
them mechanically, they’re hilarious. It’s all in the mechanics of things. Get
away from the humanness of that and look into the mechanic of what it is.
You get the joke, but you also get see what’s going on.
Evil is the Emotional System Manifesting Incorrectly
The abstract experience, what it really is like to be human is something that
only comes out when it is responded to correctly, when it’s dealt with correctly.
Again, we go back to the surface and we go back to the simple, but you have to
keep on coming back to the Type because that is, in the end, the only
protection for us. And because we are dealing with so much anger and rage,
you have to see that the 35-36 brings out so much evil in the world. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111155555555
Now, I’m not a moralist so I don’t have a problem with evil. I don’t like it, but
I don’t have a problem with it moralistically. It is the direct result of the
emotional system manifesting incorrectly because it has devastating effects.
If you take somebody who’s an emotional Manifestor and you give them only
resistance in their life, there is a point at which their emotional system will turn
that anger into the kind of rage that’s absolutely horrifying and nothing to stop
it from coming out—nothing. The potential for violence is enormous.
Dealing with Emotionally Defined People
So, it’s one of those things that in your work in dealing with people who are
defined emotionally to bring them to the point of recognizing how profound
they are when they wait. See, I have emotional people in my life who have
been there for a very long time and I weed them out. There are certain
emotional people that I can never tolerate, so I don’t. But over time, through
my own process in finding those emotional systems that I can live with, they’re
educated, they learn about their own process.
An emotional person that waits to release that emotional energy, their impact is
really profound. I’m deeply sensitive to that. It’s very profound. That’s what
they’re here for. It is our future. It is out of that emotional clarity that
emotional awareness can emerge. And that emotional people, rather than
being seen as the great chaotic forces, they can be the forces of peace and bliss.
That’s what they’re here for.
The Ashram Story
That’s the joke and the sadness of the Ashram story. Think about what the
Ashram is really like. You bring a lot of people together in a community,
automatically you have emotional authority—automatically. You’re going to
have at least half of the people who are undefined emotionally. Otherwise,
they wouldn’t be attracted to it. And the other people that are in the Ashram
are going to be emotional, but because of the nature of the environment, their
emotions are smooth.
So imagine what it’s like to be with 2,000 people that are meditating and 800 of
them are emotional and they’re being quiet and still. You know what the rest
of those unemotional people feel like? Totally blissed out—totally blissed out.
156 Channels By Type
You see, they ran away from the world because they couldn’t stand what the
emotional world was doing to them. So they go into a world in which the
emotions are controlled by the very environment, and that out of that very
environment comes the possibility for them to get blissed out on that sweet
emotional wave.
Osho is a 10-57. I think of his Ashram. His 10-57: The individual creative
capacity to create an environment where behavior can bring self-love. And
then you have all of these unemotional people and what does the environment
do, it provides all kinds of opportunity for sexuality. All kinds of possibilities
for sexuality, and at the same time all of those people with the undefined
emotional centers are the ones that
are carrying the bliss level of the
group. They’re the ones that are
high as a kite. They’re the ones that
think it’s all incredible. They’re the
ones who I meet later who are
totally messed up.
Because you see the moment they
step out of that nice clean
emotional aura, everything becomes
devastating again. They’re not
enlightened. They’re not clear.
They still get poisoned. They still deal with all the pain. Nobody has taught
them correctly. That’s the whole point. Nobody’s taught them correctly.
Our Earth is Our Ashram
It’s not that the principle of the Ashram is wrong. It isn’t. But our Earth is
our Ashram, lest we forget. It’s not about some little corner of the planet. The
earth is our Ashram. And when everybody in this Ashram is emotionally clear,
we got a bliss state. Because that’s the way it works.
The Unemotional Must Guide and Educate the Emotional
So there’s a tremendous amount of education necessary for the emotionally
defined. The greatest work of our time is to make sure that they understand
that emotional mechanism. For themselves first, for everyone else second, but
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111155557777
most of all for the future. The moment that you start changing the way in
which the emotional field operates, you change the nature of the whole. It is
the authority of the totality. To influence that authority belongs to each and
every emotional being. And everyone who is unemotional has to be their
guide, has to remind them of where they are in their emotional wave, has to
remind them what it feels like taking in their emotional wave and at the same
time never blaming. No guilt, no blame, no shame.
It doesn’t matter whether somebody is emotional and they’re messed and they
hurt other people out of that. It’s not their fault. Truly, it is not their fault.
There’s nothing they can do. They are helpless in that. This is an incredible
motor. They’re helpless in that.
It’s not to say that they’re the villains. I make my jokes but they’re just jokes.
They’re not the villains. They’re uneducated and they need the advantage that
comes from that education not just for themselves, but for others. And you
can see how important that is when you’re dealing with the 35-36. You’re
dealing with the human creative experience and if that isn’t clear, then our
experience is not clear, our teachers are not clear. I know. I know how unclear
the teachers are because they don’t know who they are.
Every Mind Has Outer Authority
Remember the nature of outer authority. Every mind has outer authority.
Some minds have great outer authorities. It doesn’t mean that they’re clear. It
just means that their minds are valuable to others. What they are is beings
within themselves and the pain and the suffering within their own helplessness.
Not being able to understand why and how, that’s another story. Don’t judge
any of that on the surface. Be clear that if a human being is not living out their
Type, they are not clear, they are not correct, and they’re not going to get the
life that they deserve.
Example Chart of the Experiential Creativity
This is obviously an interesting example of the experiential and the experiential
creativity. It’s Paul McCartney’s chart (next page). Here is what that
experiential thing is all about and there is a lovely example of this. It’s a
wonderful example of this. When the Beatles broke up in 1970, Paul
McCartney released a solo album. I think it had cherries on the cover. I’m not
158 Channels By Type
certain of the image but something like that. And if you looked inside there,
you’d see that he did everything. He played every instrument, he sang all the
parts, he did the arranging. The
only thing he didn’t do was
record it. Now, this is the classic
Jack of all trades—classic—
having had the experience of
knowing all those things.
He was never the best bass
player. He knew how to play the
bass, he knew how to play the
piano, he knew how to play the
guitar, he knew a little bit of this,
a little bit of that, even drums in
all the songs in that album. In
other words, this is the classic 35-36 example—classic. That capacity through
experience, to gain many, many things—many, many things. And in some
cases, given one’s karma in life, one’s geometry in life, that the opportunity to
get that out, to be able to manifest that, to be able to put that out into the
world.
The Human Hormonal Experience: Desire Blinds Us
Now, that tells you something right away about the experiential way. It’s just
like the way that hormones work. And it’s something to understand the
relationship between the human life experience and the human hormonal
experience. In other words, everything about the experiential way becomes less
painful, less crisis-ridden with age.
If you know a 35-36 when they’re 18, whew. And you know a 35-36, the same
one, when they’re 48, very different. Very, very different in the way you would
feel or take in their emotional energy, because it takes time. And for most
emotional people, only when they pass their peak period of sexuality do they
begin to calm down a little bit. It’s very, very important. So, this need for
experience, it starts the moment you get sexual maturity in the person.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111155559999
Sexual Peak: I Don’t Want to Wait
Think about that. Think about how we’re guided in our life experience. In
other words, it really is only at the moment that you become sexually active that
you really have this deep, deep drive to go out into the world and have
experience. The average age of children leaving home is within a year of sexual
maturity. It’s a standard, it’s a classic. You know, running away, being driven
inside by desire to have the experience, “I don’t want to wait. I don’t want to
wait. I don’t want to wait.” That’s the mantra of manifesting emotions: “I
don’t want to wait. I don’t want to wait. I don’t want to wait. I just want to
do it and when I had it, I want to get it done. I don’t want to wait.”
And of course, we know what happens to them. They jump in and get burnt
and burnt and burnt and burnt and burnt. And it begins at that moment their
sexual life awakens.
The Sexual Way for Men
Now, the reality is that the sexual way of, according to the nature of the Sacral
Center, operates differently in men and women. That is a man reaches his
sexual peak at around 18 years of age. And for a woman it’s in the beginning
of her 30s.
Now, there’s a real discrepancy in terms of why there’s such this vast difference
between men and women and the way that they begin their lives together. It
has to do with all the stereotyping that has gone into male and female roles,
and all that stereotyping can really be seen clearly in that. At 18, the male is
driven to go out into the world and have experiences. They’re driven. That’s
their peak. They must go out there and have their experience.
Meanwhile, the female of the specie, goes to school, gets married, goes into
whatever the trip is of their culture and society, and suddenly wake up when
they’re 30 years old, at the peak of their energy and they look around them and
they say: “I want something new, I want something different. I want to get
out. This can’t be my life. I have this desire for this and that and the other.”
It’s very, very powerful.
And you can see what happens in those roles. In the male role, the experiential
human role and the drive for that starts earlier and it becomes overwhelming.
160 Channels By Type
And remember that desire blinds us. There’s nothing like emotional desire to
blind you to any kind of logical, rational thought; blows it away.
So, that 18-year old male, given that he’s raised with society’s manifesting
propaganda, you’re still to go out there and get the experience. You’re 18 and
you are a male and somebody is saying to you all the time, “Go out there and
get the experience. Go out there and taste that; see what it’s like. Jump in.
Get going. Get your life started. Try plastics, whatever.” That’s a Dustin
Hoffman joke. Those of you who know that, you get the trivia word for the
day. That is from The Graduate, I think. Yeah.
Women’s Experiential Process
It’s so different for a woman. It’s so different. You see, the gods are so really
tricky. They say, “Look, we need them to make children.” That’s the gods,
“We need them to make children.” And the gods were kind to the female of
the human specie. After all, in just about every single other specie, the moment
that a female stops being fertile, is the moment that she is next to death. That
is not true for human females who live longer than human males and have an
extraordinary life expectancy from birth.
But they get this trick of the gods, that in those first 30 years, they’re expected
to procreate because the 18-year old males have been hunting for sex ever
since, driven out there in their experiential way. You know, “Get in there. Get
your partner, get your mate.” What’s a man unless he has somebody to screw
every day when they’re 18. It’s truth. That’s their drive, that’s all they’re
looking for, is someone to come home to and go to bed with.
And there’s the women, who aren’t going to have that drive for the experience,
really take their lives, until after their Saturn return, when they’re into their 30s
and they end up bearing children because that’s the plan. And they end up
being very different because of that. That they come to their experience and
their need for experience later in their process.
And of course, one of the by-products of our time, that is, the by-product of
the post-second World War era in the West is that you really see that women at
thirty are taking enormous leaps into the world that they never did before.
They are releasing that experiential power in a different way because of the pill.
Because of the way in which now we can control reproductivity. An enormous
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111166661111
liberation. The liberation to be able to enter into the experience without being
further burdened.
I’ve noticed over my thousands of readings that women who come to me who
are younger that their Saturn return, 28½ years. They are the ones, that if they
have children, by the time they get to their Saturn return, they don’t want them
anymore. They don’t. They say, “Why did I have these kids? And why did I
have them with him?” which is the thing they say all the time. “Why did I have
them with him?” And then they get to that point when they’re 30 and they get
the buzz. They get this desire in them. “This is not my life.”
The real key comes when their youngest child is seven because that’s the
moment that the child technically, mechanically can survive in the world. And
that’s the moment they get this deep buzz inside of them, that “I’ve got to do
something different with my life.” And of course, given the privileges of our
time, women have been able to do that, to jump into that experiential way, to
jump into that desire and to live out that desire played.
But please keep in mind that difference, because it’s so important to the way in
which we’re designed to come together. And it’s why males seem to be much
more sexually aggressive. It starts earlier when they’re less mature. They’re less
mature.
In a woman, by the time she is 30 years old and she has borne children in her
life, there is a depth in her that no male ever has, let alone how old they are.
They never get that; never. And it means that the moment they’re ready to step
into the experiential world, they are a lot more solid within themselves as
beings. They’ve already seen their value in a very basic way - creators of life.
We’ll talk about that when we get to the 59-6, creators of life and nurturers of
life, but that’s not enough.
You see, I’m the mother’s son. Unless women rightfully take their role when
they’re 30 years old, nothing is going to change anything on this planet. They
cannot just stay home and tell their children. It’s not enough. It is wonderful
that they do, but it is not enough.
The fact of the matter that they start that desire stage later in their life means
that they are of enormous value to the rest of society in the kinds of
experiences that they will enter into. And the moment they are given the
opportunity to be emotionally clear and to understand how that emotional
162 Channels By Type
system truly operates, they will enter into experiences which are correct for
them. That by-product is beneficial.
Last 30 Years: Explosion of Female Experiences
Have you noticed the bookseller lists? Did you ever notice the change that has
taken place in the last 30 years? It’s absolutely incredible to me; incredible. I
used to read those lists and they were all males. They were always males. And
it was always the male retelling of the experience. And of course that’s
skewered. It’s male. And then all of a sudden in the last 30 years we have this
incredible explosion of female experience that everybody is getting access to.
And it is enlightening in the sense that it opens up what needs to be revealed in
the yin-yang of what we are, that that balance has to be addressed. It’s
interesting to watch that.
My favorite modern historian is Barbara Tuchman and here
is somebody that I met in the ‘70s. I have been fascinated
by history all my life. And I had read history written by
males for the last 2000 years. It was incredible to read this
woman. It was incredible to read.
Balancing of the Experiential Field: Yin-Yang Perspective
Because you see, as a male, I understand the male perspective. I am here to
learn the female perspective. I’m here to experience it as the other and in her
consciousness, through her consciousness I got to see a period of history that I
thought I really understood, but I didn’t. I understood it’s yangness but I did
not have the eyes, the yin eyes, to see it through that theme, in another way.
And of course that’s one of the things that we witness now in our time, this
balancing of the experiential field. Go back historically, and go back the last
2000 years. History has been written by men, exclusively.
The Piscean Age is Sick
The only time you hear about a woman is if she was a whore or a queen.
Otherwise, there is nothing; nothing. It tells you how sick the Piscean age is.
No joke. I look at the Piscean age, I think, “My God, we had to go through
this crap?” Because it’s so slanted. Oh yeah, we needed the yang to drive the
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111166663333
technological civilization that we would become, but there was a deep, deep
perspective missing—missing.
We Live in the Illusion of Male-Female
I would have loved to have heard what the females who laid down on Freud’s
couch had to say about their lives when Freud wasn’t in their aura; incredibly
different. And you see there’s no separation. There is none. We live the
illusion of this male-female. You see, the male in its arrogance forgets that it’s
a mutation of the female. It forgets that. It forgets that everything is basically
yin. It forgets that. It forgets that everything is basically form. I keep teaching
you that. This is the real truth.
So, it’s important for you to understand that you cannot expect a young woman
who has not yet passed her Saturn return to be ready, to really go out and
experience the world. It’s something to keep in mind. It’s very important. In
other words, that’s when their time is right to go out. And of course, what has
happened in the late 20th century is that we have a lot of women who give up
childbearing in that first Saturn cycle. They give it up because there are other
opportunities. They give it up because they have contraception. They give up
all those things. When they get to be 30, they decide that they have to have
children.
Whenever I meet women who haven’t had children in their first Saturn cycle,
there’s a deep need in them. It’s just hormones. It’s just the chemistry. They
keep saying to them “have a child, have a child, have a child.” And so, it’s
inside of them and becomes a conflict for them because at the same time, their
desire-experiential field is just kicking in. It’s not the time for them to be into
childbearing. It’s one of the things that have happened upside down, in that
sense, in the cycle we’re going through now.
So their process becomes very confused; so you have women in their 30s who
have children and careers at the same time. You have this conversation going
on throughout America. And of course, they can’t give up their career.
They’re in the time of their life where it’s everything for them, to be on the
experiential plane, to get their reward. That brings us to the most important
thing to understand about the abstract process and to understand abstract
creativity.
164 Channels By Type
Only the Abstract Circuit is Rooted in Expectation
Abstract creativity is rooted in expectation. Only the abstract circuit is rooted
in expectation. Logic is rooted in identification. That’s what we’ll see when we
get there. But the abstract, it’s all about expectation. “If I do this, I’ll get that.
If I can only have this experience, everything is going to be different. I know
that if I do that, then I’m going to get my reward.” Whatever the case may be.
Creative Channels are Expressions of the Circuit
And whether or not that abstract circuitry is in your mind or whether it is in
your body system, it doesn’t matter where it is. It doesn’t have to be in the 35-
36. Remember these creative channels are expressions of the circuit. In
genetic continuity, in every aspect of that circuit is expectation.
The expectation of the 64 that it doesn’t have to be confused; the expectation
of the 47 that it could actually make sense out of things; the expectation of the
11 that it has actually a good idea, that it could lead into something; the
expectation of the 56 that people are going to believe your story. It’s all
expectation. Everything in the abstract process is about expectation.
Expectation is Always the Projection, Not a Truth
Therein lies the trap because expectation leads to disappointment. Because the
expectation is always a projection, it can never be a truth. No matter how
many times an abstract person climbs the wave, falls off the other end, they still
keep on expecting that they’re going to have an experience that doesn’t do that.
They keep on expecting that instead of falling off the end, they’re going to live
happily ever after and ride off into the sunset as cosmic whatevers. That
expectation is deep, deep, deep, deep inside of the abstract process; deep.
When you’re down at the 41, the 41 knows the pressure. The 41 says:
“Oooh…… Oooh… I can fantasize this, but boy, can I really expect it to be as
good as I can fantasize?” You learn very quickly if you’re at either end of that
stream. The 35 says, “I’m less likely to fall for all of this because I have been
there and I don’t have the expectation. I have the expectation that it’s going to
be boring because I’ve been there.” But when you get in the middle of that,
the 30 and the 36, the expectation is profound. By the way, this doesn’t mean
that it isn’t in the others; it is. It’s in the whole thing.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111166665555
But in the 35-36, it’s unbelievably strong. This expectation that, “If I only can
have this experience, everything is going to be okay.” That’s why they always
crash. They always crash because instead of going higher, which is what they
expect, “Take me higher, take me higher, take me higher,” they go down after
the experience. And because they do not understand their nature, they blame
the other. “It’s your fault. If I had made love in a canoe with somebody else,
it would have worked and I’d still be flying. But you tipped the canoe. It’s
your fault.”
The Emotional System Invented Blame, Guilt and Shame
The abstract is full of blame. It’s full of blame. Remember that the experience
is emotionally guided so the experiences don’t work properly, the people are
not following their Type. The emotional system invented guilt and shame.
That’s what it does. It makes you feel so bloody uncomfortable. The moment
they’re disappointed, the moment that their experience hasn’t worked, they
dump that inside of you. And of course it makes them sick.
The whole thing about living out your Type is about being healthy. How
important it is for a human being to be healthy. And being healthy does not
mean that you live by expectation. You see, again we come back to the mystery
that is inherent in this stream in the 29-46. The 29-46 is basically existential. It
says “Be in the experience, be in the experience, don’t question it. Be there.
“Later. Later.”
You see the 46 is a gate of serendipity. It’s a gate of great good fortune. The
good fortune only comes if there is no expectation. The moment that there is
expectation, you can never satisfy it. Never. Never. Never. Never. Never.
So the whole thing for abstract people is that the moment they enter into
desire, they enter into an expectation about what that desire will bring them.
Stop. Don’t do that.
See the experience for what it is. The experience; nothing more. To be in the
experience is everything. And you see the difficulty in all of that is that there’s
no way that you can enter into an experience existentially, be in the experience
unless you enter correctly according to your Type. If you do then you’re there.
There’s no inherent conflict. There is no resistance to disturb you, to force you
to question your own actions. There is simply the drive and the power to fulfill
the process, to fulfill the desire. When it’s over, when it’s over and there is
166 Channels By Type
time, you can reflect. You can reflect for your own benefit, and you can reflect
for the benefit of others.
The Experiential Teacher
Think about what the experiential teacher is really good for. The experiential
teacher is there to remind you not to have false expectations. “I want to learn
how to play the violin.” “Listen fellow, if you want to spend the rest of your
life like this, play the violin. But if you expect to be Horowitz, without having
the crink in your neck, you’re missing something and you may not like that.
Don’t just have the blind expectation “Oh, I want to be the greatest.
Hmmmm.” And then you find out what’s that really like. I did.
My father put a violin in my hands when I was about eight years old. I was at
my most rebellious. That’s the last thing on earth that I wanted to do was to
live my life like this. It is just not possible.
But the expectation of being able to create beautiful music is another story.
But you can be blinded by the expectations. The real experiential teacher says
to you: “Look, you want to learn how to make music? Sure that’s great. But
it’s going to take you 25 years before you even know that you can play. So
don’t think that you’re going to be tomorrow’s rock star or tomorrow’s classical
great. It’s going to take you a lot of time. And most of the time nobody’s
going to notice, except you.”
The experiential teacher has great importance to us. The moment you hear
somebody creating expectations for you, you know this is the other side of the
experiential teacher; this is the distorted wave. And there are so many
motivators in this country, who motivate through fulfilling your expectations,
telling you that you can get those things.
Live Out Your Type to Get the Body That Belongs to You
I don’t know how many times a day I see ads for people to be thin. It’s
unbelievable. How many programs exist in this country to keep people thin?
How many people in this country are fat? It is an incredible thing. All you’ve
got to do is live out your Type, then you get the body that belongs to you. If
you’re living out your Type and you’re carrying weight on your body, it’s
perfect for you. But it has to be correct. Most human beings carry a body that
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111166667777
doesn’t belong to them, live in a body that they’ve distorted by identifying with
things that are not them. Always goes back to the same things: To be yourself
is to have your body, your life, health.
So this business of expectation and the abstract of something that is essential to
grasp because you can’t get rid of it. Understand, it’s genetic. You can’t get rid
of it, nobody can. That abstract process is driven by expectation. It says, “I’ve
got to have this experience.” And then we make up a reason, “Because, if I
have this experience, I’m going to know how to make love in a canoe, very
important to me in my life. It’s going to change everything, I’ll write a book
about it.”
It’s one of the things you notice these days. Any kind of experience, people
write about it. It doesn’t matter what it is. The largest trend in publishing is
biographies and autobiographies. They come out every day; zillions of them.
It’s not like all these lives are interesting. However, all these lives are
interesting. Experience is interesting.
Have you seen the Truman show? Yes. Well, it’s a classic example of that.
This is a delight. That’s what it’s all about. We want to see a human life, and
how it works, how they live, and what their experience is, and we can all talk
about it, we can all share it. I’ve met people in America and I’ve listened to
their conversations and they will talk about soap opera characters as if they
were talking about their children.
“Do you know what happened to Jane yesterday?”
“No. Tell me. What happened to Jane?”
“Well, yes, they found out she’s pregnant.”
“By who?”
“No, I didn’t do it.”
Human beings are like that. Our whole movie is that we want to know all
about life. Until we have these expectations, the experiences are only of value
to us if in going through the experience, we get our reward. Think about how
you condition your kids: “If you do that, and you do it well, I’ll give you this,
that or the other thing.”

Desire is Not about Expectation
Encouraging them through expectation. “If you graduate I’ll buy you a car. So
you can die in it.” Or whatever. All about expectation. So we’ve got to stop
seeing that this is not something for sale here. That the desire operates
naturally. And it’s not about expectation. The only expectation that you can
have is that the desire is possible. This is very important. See, that’s what a 41
knows: “Anything that I can fantasize I can have; anything. It’s always
possible.” Doesn’t mean it’s likely but it means it’s possible.
If it happens, it’s self-fulfilling in its desire. Perfect. But if from that position
of the 41, I say, “Oh, if I get that experience that I can fantasize, I will have
this, and this and this and this and this and this and this.” No way.
Creativity Rooted in a Motive
Because no matter how beautiful the experience is, no matter how fulfilling the
desire, the crash is going to be incredibly heavy, disappointment, “Wasn’t good
enough; wasn’t what I expected.” So, the first thing that you can see about this
kind of creativity is that it’s rooted in a motive.
“I will share my creative experience with you but I will share it with you out of
my motivation that I expect something in return.” Experiential teachers make
a lot of money. It’s what they do. There are all kinds of people on this planet
that are making money out of experience. They’ve been to a place, so they can
guide you to it. This kind of thing where they have the experience so they get
the advantage of that experience. And they know what to expect. No
expectation, but they know what to expect because they’ve been through the
experience.
So they’re very good at guiding others through that experience; that’s their job,
after all. These are our guides and historians when they’re healthy, and we need
them healthy. We need honest prodigals. We need honest stimulators. And by
honest, I only mean correct. It isn’t to say that somebody who has an
experience and who enters into that experience is going to tell you something
of value. It’s not necessarily true.
The advantage of having creative people who are experiential is that they cover
every possible area. And so we can ultimately get their advice, get their
direction, get their information to make things easier for us, so we don’t have
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111166669999
to start things from scratch. What it would be like to get a computer placed in
front of you and you have absolutely no instructions? Good luck. You can
have every kind of expectation that you’re going to have fun. But you need
somebody who’s been through the experience to guide you, otherwise you can’t
do it. You just can’t do it, we need these people. And we need them to be
clear. If they don’t have an expectation going in, what they share with us is of
much greater value. That’s all. It’s not distorted by their disappointment. And
that’s something that is very important to grasp, this whole business of
expectation in the abstract realm.
Q&A
People Who Come Out of Ashrams or Communes Crash
Student: I don’t know if it’s actually ok for a projector, but you said anybody
you knew who came out of an Osho commune was incredibly messed up.
Ra: No, I didn’t say everybody. Careful with “everybody’s”—it’s on tape.
What I did say is that the vast number of people that I’ve met,—and by the
way I’m not picking on Osho, I have hundreds of Sai Baba and Papaji people
and every kind of Ashram experience. I have all of that around me. And the
vast majority of these people that come out of those environments crash. They
crash when they get out. It’s not an accident that I’ve done 600-700 sannyasin
readings. They wouldn’t be searching for that and there wouldn’t be a need for
that if everything would have been fulfilled for them in their experience. That’s
not about blame by the way, nor is that a statement about the nature of the
teaching, because it isn’t. It is simply about the nature of what aura is and what
happens to us.
Student: Doesn’t the contrast of having had that bliss and then coming out,
isn’t that an advantage ultimately in understanding that emotional journey?
Ra: It’s a great advantage if you meet Ra Uru Hu. (laughter) Otherwise it’s
hell. If you meet Human Design, it’s a great advantage. I love working with
people who have been on the spiritual path once I can get past all of their
gobbly goop and then get down to the basics. They’re extraordinary people,
obviously because they’ve been open in their life to many, many things. This
intimate connection to things of the light. And that’s my whole point about
the form, it’s like polishing a crystal. The light shines through it better. .
170 Channels By Type
When people come to me, the potential for light is in them in deep, particularly
people who have been on a spiritual journey in their life. But without the
recognition and the acceptance of their form, that light cannot shine. And of
course by shining what I mean is that it is their life rather than their idea. That
it is their being rather than their hope; that they are a living light unto
themselves and of course that is the potential in awakening to your form. And
again it is the difference.
The Piscean Age Never Had the Facts
For me, Osho is what I affectionately call the last guru because he really is a
symbol of the closing of the Piscean age, what it means to be in love with your
master. What it means to be in that kind of philosophical, conceptual
environment. And yet at the same time, the Aquarian age is very different. I
am an Aquarian; I don’t want all of you hanging out in my face. I don’t want
all of that. I’m not interested in all of that. I’m interested in you grasping what
this means and then living that out in your own lives. Because the Aquarian
says, “Thank you very much; it’s all very nice here. Go ahead. Bye-bye. Don’t
bother me.”
This is all about fact, and you can’t do that as a Piscean. Pisceans never had the
facts. They just didn’t have the facts. If you don’t have the facts, you can’t do
it. So, we’ve come to a point where we’re on the cusp of an age that has lasted
for thousands of years that’s coming to an end. There’s still lots of time.
That’s why we have this fundamentalism. Why we have all this stuff is that the
Piscean age is coming to an end and all these Pisceans are holding on for dear
life. They’re saying “I don’t want to give up my belief. I don’t want to give up
my faith. I don’t trust the future. I don’t trust technology. I don’t trust all of
that stuff.”
The Aquarian Age Takes the Candy Out of Your Mouth
But of course the Aquarian is coming and saying: “Look, yes. It’s nice all of
that stuff soothed you for the last 2,000 years but let’s take the candy out of
your mouth and the dream out of your eye and give you truly a divine life.
Because the Divine life is in the form, it’s in these vehicles.” This is my
birthday present.
My birthday present is this vehicle. It’s the most extraordinary gift of all gifts.
It is greater than anything about me. It is greater than anything that moves
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111177771111
through me because everything that moves through me moves through this
gift.
It’s an incredible thing and to be alive is an incredible thing; to be alive and
conscious, unbelievable thing. And to be as intelligent as we are as beings;
extraordinary. But the honoring of the form, that’s everything, because without
that, all of our advantages, all of our other gifts, all of our intelligence, just
become pain for us.
Those people that came out of those kinds of environment, the Ashrams,
whatever, where they got to live out, at least momentarily, the dream of what
it’s like to be in pure communion with the other. But, you see, I know the
Ashram is the world. That the dream can never live alone, and it can only live
through the form, and it has to live through the entire form.
So for all of us, as we move along and we prepare the way,—because that’s
what we’re doing, we’re transition generations, particularly here at the
beginning of the 21st century where we’ve moved so rapidly out of the belief
world of the Piscean era.
Only in the last several hundred years do we have the kind of science that can
stand opposed to the faith on the other side. We’re coming into this deep
Aquarian basis, in which everything is laid out and it’s clear; everything. That’s
what it’s about. And it begins for us with our forms.
As I teach you the genetic code, the scientists are writing the genetic code.
We’re doing all of this. This is the point, to get to the point where you see like
Crick said, “I’m sorry to offend anybody but they’re going to find out that free
will is genetic.” It’s just all a mechanism. So the only way in which we’re really
going to see the beauty of the light is through the form.
I play a dark game, you all know that. I play the form game. I tease at the
devil’s game, but I’m no devil. I’m much older than all of that stuff. The fact
of the matter is that I’m both. I’ve always been both. I will always be both.
This is the magic of what it is to be alive, to be the light in form and then you
shine. Then everything about you shines. That’s what all is about. That’s what
we’re here for. I play the dark side to remind people that you have to get to the
form. I’m not going to give you all this slippery, slick, sweet light stuff. You’ve
been getting that for 2,000 years. It’s not about that.
172 Channels By Type
It’s about seeing that if you really want to be spiritual, come in here, into God’s
house, this place, here. And accept it for what it is and stop your bullshit and
your arrogance, your vanity, your fears and just let it be what it is. Out of that
you discover real beauty. Resistance brings ugliness. That’s one of the things
that carries along with resistance so you have to fight with people and argue
with them. You have to struggle with everything. It’s not about that.
So many people are frightened that form takes away from them the light.
They’re nuts. They wouldn’t even know there was light if it wasn’t for the
form. The light is only an illusion of the form. In the end, it’s all form. So,
come to the form. And those of you that have this dream inside of you, this
dream of the light, get to see it realized. But you get to see it realized after
accepting the simple laws of your form. Then you get it. Then the light comes
out.
Electromagnetics: 35-36s Make Great Traveling Partners
Student: Will there be any discussions in these channel courses about how the
channels operate electromagnetically?
Ra: You mean how they operate in terms of relationships electromagnetically.
No. No, they won’t be because they really belong to partnership. However,
it’s important to recognize clearly that if you have the 36 and you don’t have
the 35, as an example, then, what gets brought into your life is the potential to
be able to manifest desire, and it means desire then becomes enormously
exciting. You’re always looking for that experience. You’re always looking to
fulfill that desire.
However, the only way in which that can work, whether that 36 is in a defined
center or it’s not defined or whatever the case may be, it goes back to the
individual Type. In other words, in entering into a relationship, if you enter
into that relationship correctly, then that experiential process could be healthy
for the two of you, as a shared experience, but again it has to be entered into in
a healthy way.
One of the things that I tell 35-56s who are electromagnetic as couples is that
they need to travel together. One of the things about the 35-36, because it’s
inherently sexual, is that there’s only so many places in so many positions in the
house. After you’ve done the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom, the
bedroom, then the 35-36 starts getting bored because they need new
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111177773333
experiences. So, traveling is very exciting for them. They can go into a hotel
room, or to the beach, and they have a different kind of an environment to live
out their desire experience. And 35-36s make great traveling partners.
I know a lot of couples, for example, who are 35-36s, who have a very difficult
life in their home life. They have a lot of problems and they have a lot of
conflicts in their sexuality, because of the volatility of that kind of combination.
And one of the things that I always suggest to them is that these are the kind of
people that they should only have sex when they’re travelling together. Then
it’s incredibly exciting for them, incredibly exciting. Because it’s something
totally, it’s exactly what they need, they need to get out, and they need to get
into movement, transitoriness, going along and doing their thing.
I had one couple that I did years ago who are 35-36 electromagnetic and
suddenly she turned to him and she said, “That’s why you like taking the
trains.” They would take sleeper cars to go on vacations. He loved making
love in the train. The rattle and rattle and rattle and all that stuff. He loved it.
The rocking back and forth and going around the corners. That was his thing.
She had this embarrassed-look on her face.
The whole thing about understanding mechanics of sexuality,—I will talk about
that when I teach that again in the fall. But sexuality is something that’s so
profound in our lives and to really understand how your sexuality works is
unbelievably liberating, because you can see what the 35-36 brings into our
lives. It brings in this sexual pressure in our lives. And that means we’re not
here to avoid it and we’re not here to be hurt by it. We’re here to have the
right sexual experiences in our life and everybody is entitled to them. How we
enter into them is everything, but once we enter into them, then we can live
them out correctly.
And by living out sexuality correctly means that you don’t have what all of us
have carried with us in our lives. The discomfort with the sexual experiences
that we never should have had, had we really lived out our nature that really
weren’t for us. That really brought a lot of pain into our lives or we brought
pain to somebody else’s life. And then it gives sex a bad name.
It gives sexuality a bad name. It gives the tribe the chance to say, “You see?
See? That’s what it brings you. Brings you trouble, AIDS, disease, hurts your
reputation, blah, blah, blah. You’ll never be remembered as a good president”
174 Channels By Type
Ha-ha-ha…loved that one. Oh yes, that’s great. They’re going to remember
him forever; forever. He’s the sexiest president America ever had. Kennedy
fucked whores; at least, this guy plays around. They’ll remember him because
sex is great. And everybody loves it. Everybody’s quiet. “Shhh… Shhh…
don’t say that. Don’t tell them,” but it’s true.
Is the Design Affected by Different Conception and Birth
places?
Student: Somebody is conceived in Japan and then nine months later, he’s
born in New York. How does that affect the Design data?
Ra: It doesn’t affect the design data, but what it does do is that if you looked
at the conception chart—again, this has to do with other depths of
knowledge—it does have an impact on the conception; there is no question.
And of course, the first 88 degrees of the Sun is where the centers are built. So
that means that being conceived on one side of the pond, if you actually looked
at that time, if you actually looked at the conception being in Japan, you would
have some differences.
So the actual place of conception, because that’s a separate chart, is something
that, of course, is significant. So for somebody’s birth chart who was born in
Japan, if I was doing their medical chart, in other words, if I was dealing with
them at an infrastructure level, I would be doing their conception chart for the
local wherever that was, which would
be New York. Yes, it does make a
difference.
Student: Is it possible to look at
Dustin’s chart? We were looking at
the 25-51 channel of creativity.
When he makes a Generator
response, that Generator response is
very complex in a sense.
Ra: Very, very profound.
Student: Supposing that he doesn’t have the 2-14, that he doesn’t have that
kind of connection to the Self Center…
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111177775555
Ra: So he would be a triple split you mean.
Student: He would be a triple split, but he’s still a Generator. And his
creativity then, even though that creativity is a projected channel…
Ra: It would still be recognized as long as he lives out his generating. The
only thing that changes in that is that what’s guiding his authority is different.
The moment that you have the 2-14, it links all the gates in the G Center plus
the Ego in its channel. So of course, there are a lot of different elements that
are adding to the voice of the Sacral, helping the Sacral make its basic decision.
If you take away the 2-14, then you are left with just the 3-60, the 52 and the
54, in other words, in the case of the 34 being there and the 5 being there.
So what you would have is a different kind of background to that voice coming
out of the Sacral. It would no longer be a voice that’s guided by the direction,
or the initiating capacity of that direction. It would not be about the role of
giving direction to other people. In other words, that wouldn’t be built into the
response of Sacral. The Sacral wouldn’t be saying, “Aha, I can give these
people direction and initiate them.”
Now, it can be mutative. And because it’s mutative, “I will probably get
attention, and it’s something for me to focus on,” but it doesn’t give the rest of
the information. So that’s where you see the real difference. Again, if you’re
living out your Type, it doesn’t matter if you are a split, a triple split, doesn’t
matter what the configuration is, doesn’t matter whether it’s conscious or
unconscious or all of this stuff.
Please recognize that. Because of genetic continuity, when you live out the
mechanics of your Type, everything else falls into place, all of it. So as a
Generator in that situation being a triple split, those two aspects that need to be
recognized as projected elements, the initiating capacity and the quality of that
abstract mind, those things will be recognized because the Sacral is never going
to go, “Aha” to anybody who can’t recognize it.
See, this is about the beauty of mechanics. The moment you begin to trust the
mechanisms that are within you, you will see they don’t make mistakes. Your
mind may not understand that, why you’re going, aha or un-un in a given
situation but it doesn’t have to. That’s one of the things about learning to take
away authority from your mind. Those moments, like as a Generator, when
you go, “Aha,” and when your mind is screaming, “Why?” Ignore it.
176 Channels By Type
It’s one of the great lessons for your mind. It shuts up quickly. It says, “Well, I
can’t do anything about this one. We’ll try next time. We’ll keep on trying to
get back our authority that’s been taken away from us.” So very, very
important. If you follow the Type through the genetic continuity, all of these
other things open up, they open up.
Think about it this way. If you are a triple split, I tell you, go to a public place
where you can be private because it’s good for you. In other words, it hooks
up your split. Now think about what happens when you meet somebody,
you’re triple split, they come up to you and say, “I’ve got this great new
restaurant, would you like to come with me?” “Uh-huh.”
They’re going to meet somebody, for example, that will take them to a public
place where all of a sudden, all those other aspects get hooked up, or that the
person that comes into their aura automatically hooks up those aspects. In
other words, it always comes out.
But the key is, they got to enter into it correctly according to their Type and
then those other aspects of their nature are all going to fall into place. It’s just
basic mechanics. And so from your level, you’re here to provide this
knowledge for a whole new generation of people.
So you need to understand every single one of these aspects uniquely and
separately. How you went through your whole process, learning the gates,
dealing with the lines, learning about definition, learning about all these things
step-by-step-by-step-by-step, until you finally get to a point that all of that is
the material, but the truth is the Type.
Type Takes Away the Need to Understand
I couldn’t give you Type at the beginning. Then you would be people who use
Human Design, but don’t know it, because that’s what Type does. It takes
away the need to understand, and you see, that’s the whole point. The global
popularization of Human Design will be based on that; it will be based on the
simple; it will be based on not needing to understand. That’s your job.
You’re here to take those who get turned onto a deeper level of awareness, to
open up the real self to them. And in your work, you have to leave them with
the deepest impression of their Type, their authority, if they have it.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111177777777
You know my readings, you know what I do. I take people through their
overview. I never leave the Type alone, ever; I’m always going back to it; I’m
always reminding them of it while I take them through the basic surface of
their design. But that’s the thing to leave them because they need that,
otherwise it doesn’t mean anything, otherwise it’s too confusing, otherwise it’s
too many numbers and gates and lines and things and blah, blah, blah.
And they’ve just had a reading after all; they’re not students of Human Design.
They’re not there to be students of Human Design. They’re there to be helped;
they’re asking for help. You have to give them what they’re asking for, give
them their Type, be clear about their design. Give them their Type, give them
something to work with, give them the experiment that can change their life.
Don’t just let them walk away saying, “That’s interesting.” You have to awaken
them. That’s all.
The Understanding Circuit: Logic – Channel 16-
48
The Creative Process: Logic
The creative process as it applies to the logic system is something that has
enormous impact on all of our lives. Whenever you’re looking at logic, you
have to recognize that the understanding circuit represents the only way in
which everyone can get access to something that is reliable.
In other words, we are very dependent on the logic process to educate us and
to be able to prepare us
for the future, which is
what the logic process is
all about. The logic
process is about:
preparation for the future,
the ability to be able to
establish patterns and to
be able to establish that
patterns are reliable and out of the reliability of those patterns, to be able to
project securely into the future. That’s what understanding is all about.
178 Channels By Type
It is appropriate and very important to notice the difference between the
collective-creative processes. The easiest thing in the world is to get
experience. After all, the fact that the creative experiential way is a manifesting
and an emotional Manifesting channel, you know that that can be released at
any given moment. That experience is something that’s a dime a dozen, that
there are all kinds of experiences that are available all the time, that we have a
complexity that’s out there for us and we can jump into anything.
The 16-48 is the Purest Creative Channel
But to become a master, that’s tough, and it’s tough for a very obvious reason.
If you look at the 16-48, which is the purest creative channel, and if you look at
that Throat connected to the Spleen, what you have in that, instantaneously, is
that you’ve got projection. This is a projected channel.
It’s not a dime a dozen; it can’t happen all the time. As a matter of fact, it’s
excruciatingly difficult for that true talent to come out because it’s not about
the talent being expressed; it has a voice after all. It is about what logical talent
actually represents. Logical talent represents the capacity to be able to be
focused and concentrated and to be able to repeat endlessly the same thing
over and over and over again in a perfecting process.
The Root of Talent is the 18-58
The root of talent, the root of the 16-48 is
the 18-58. Now the 18-58 being the
Channel of Judgment and a design of
insatiability, is there in order to guide the
talent process which is about perfecting
what can never be perfected, never.
You can be the greatest of masters of anything, and there
will always be a place within you that you recognize that
there’s still somewhere to go. Life is short, after all. Show
me a 300-year master, and I’ll show you a better master
than an 80-year-old master because it is about repetition and time. It is about
that endless process of examining the patterns and working with the patterns.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111177779999
See, when you look at the Throat and the mystery of the Throat, the mystery of
manifestation, and you look at the logical aspects in the Throat, if you look at
the 17-62, the 31-7, the 16-48, they are all projected elements. In other words,
none of those possibilities of logic can simply just jump out there, they can’t.
And because of that, we have, what we call, bureaucracies.
Logic is Starved
We have endless, endless discussions about action. It goes on forever, and
everybody who wants to get their experiment done is going around begging for
energy, begging for money. Logic is starved.
When we get to looking at the Generating channels, we will come to the 15-5
to the channel of being in the flow, Channel of Rhythm. At the back of The
Book of Letters, there is a monograph on the design of forms, which is what
Human Design is part of. And in that Design of Forms, if you look at the
various different forms whether they’re mammalian or reptilian or whatever
they may be, you will see that there is only one channel that is in common, only
one, that’s the 15-5.
All forms of life from the single cell onward, all of them meet in that channel,
all of them. It’s a universal principle of life as we know it, and it means that the
ability to be able to express mastery is essential for us.
This 15-5, which is rooted in the 15’s love of humanity, is that
without the ability to master things that humanity cannot be
properly guided into the future. And that if you look at the 31-7,
you’ll see that the guidance that’s possible for humanity,
ultimately, is something that has to be elected. That is, the 31-7
is projected, and it has to get its energy from somewhere. And it
means that the skills in the 31-7, those are skills that we’re only
going to appreciate if they’re masterly.
Logical Talent’s Invitation is for Your Life’s Work
We do this pan job on leaders whether they’re good or bad or whatever the
case may be, and we’re deeply impressed with those who seem to be very
skillful. It is part of what logic is about. It’s not about the abstract process of
just jumping into an experience whether you’re prepared for it or not, whether
180 Channels By Type
you need it or not; it’s very different. And it also means that for logical talent
the invitation—because it’s a projected element—is so important. It has a
much greater consequence than the invitation to the abstract side.
Because experience is so easy to get, there are so many possible invitations, and
it doesn’t matter whether one of them or the other doesn’t work out for you
because there are more experiences to be had. But the fact of the matter is that
the moment that you enter into the logical process, that invitation is an
invitation to life’s work.
It’s not an invitation to being a musician, it’s an invitation to being a specific
musician. You learn how to play the clarinet, and you play it every day for the
rest of your life. And if you’re lucky, by the time you’re in your 40s, somebody
will recognize you as a master because that’s what it’s all about. And it’s so
important to understand that the invitation to logic is an invitation that has to
be very, very, very profound because it’s something that you have to take in for
your life.
Two Splenic Forms of Creativity
Think about the nature of the channel itself. You see, this is a talent that is
coming out of the Splenic system. It’s directly out of the Spleen, and of course,
it has its relationship in that sense to the 10-57. In other
words, these are two clear splenic forms of creativity. In
other words, they’re fundamentally healthy. And that the
Splenic Center, our body’s laundry, our cleansing
mechanism, is also our health vehicle; it’s our immune
system.
Mastery Makes Us Feel Good
So when you look at the nature of talent or at the nature of perfected form,
you’re talking about creativity that is fundamentally healthy, and it’s
fundamentally healthy when it operates correctly. Now the fact of the matter is
that the abstract way is never fundamentally healthy, it just isn’t. It’s on the
other side of the track. So when you’re dealing with the immune system, you
have to see that one of the reasons why we have such a deep appreciation of
mastery is that it makes us feel good.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111188881111
When you hear a fine musician play, or you look at a great painting, or you
watch a good film, it makes you feel good. This is the beauty of this kind of
art, in that it is strictly out of the immune system. It also means that for the
person who engages in the process of mastery, that this is fundamentally a
healthy life. So often, when you look at the great masters whether they are
great painters or musicians, they’re having children at 80. They live forever.
My heroes, people like Bunuel, they put him in his grave when he was near 90,
he was creating up to the last moment; Picasso, all of these people. And you
can see very clearly that it’s fundamentally healthy to be on this track of endless
perfecting, but how bitter it can be. Because, you see, it doesn’t have the same
opportunities as the abstract process; it doesn’t have these opportunities to
simply just manifest. It can’t just generate. It needs to have the recognition,
and it needs to have recognition that really works.
The 16-48 Only Has No Real Power to Practice
Now think about a child that only has the 16-48 and has nothing else in their
design. You cannot invite that child to be a piano player; you’re going to
torture them. They have no consistent access to energy, and this is a solo
instrument. They’ll do great when their teacher is sitting beside them, if their
teacher happens to motorize them. But the moment the teacher is gone, there
is no power to practice, none. Oh, yeah, there are transits, but there’s no real
power there.
The Collective is Not Personal
And what comes out of that is a real bitterness, “I can’t play. I’m not good
enough,” all of this rooted in the genetic continuity of logic, and the genetic
continuity of logic is always saying the same thing, “I’m not good enough.” A
lot of people take that seriously. They take it personally. This is not a personal
circuit. I want you to understand very, very clearly that nothing that operates
out of the collective is personal, nor can it be, because the moment you make
the collective personal, you’ve got yourself a handful of problems.
182 Channels By Type
The Self-Flagellation of the Logic Process
The 18-58 that has this extraordinary gift to always know what needs to be
fixed and challenged, but that’s a collective gift. If they turn that into
something personal, they’re never happy with themselves, they’re never happy
with anybody around them, and everybody thinks that they’re just a big bitch,
period. So inherent in the logic process is this self-flagellation.
You walk up to a person who has that logic stream anywhere from the 58 to
the 16, and you pat them on the back, and you tell them, “Hey, you’re great.”
And what’s the first thing that comes out of their mouth, “Yes, but…this could
have been better; that could have been better; they could have been better,”
and so forth and so on.
There is never this sense of fulfillment or satisfaction in the logic process. And
only when you recognize that that’s not personal; it’s not personal. The fact
that it may not be good enough is not that you are not good enough. This is a
prod, a deep genetic prod that says there’s nothing more important in our life
than secure patterns, and that we’re never going to rest on our laurels, and that
we have to keep on going and keep on perfecting because that’s the only way.
And don’t take it personally, just do it.
The 48 is the Most Frustrating of All Gates
This is not personal. This is the most difficult thing for anyone carrying any
kind of logic in their design. If you look at the logic activations, you’ll see that
those are parts of you that always feel like you’re not good enough.
Remember, the great theme of the 16-48 is inadequacy. The 48th gate, the gate
of the well, the gate of depth of profundity, it’s actually a gate of solutions. It’s
a gate of black magic. It’s the most frustrating of all gates.
That 48th gate is sitting there and saying, “I have the solution; I have the
solution,” and it feels deeply inadequate if it can’t get that solution
experimented with. Please give me enough straw, I’ll turn it into gold. Yeah,
yeah, always looking for the energy.
Human Design and the BodyGraph is full of symmetries. The parallel between
the abstract process from the 41 to the 35 and the logic process from the 58 to
the 16. We saw that the ultimate theme to be dealt with in the abstract process
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111188883333
is the theme of expectation. In other words, that the expectation is the
damming ingredient in experience.
Symmetries between the Abstract and Logic Sides
All experiences would be valuable if we did not have expectations about them.
The moment that you establish an expectation, you limit the value of the
experience because it’s never going to meet your expectation, never. So you
might as well give up the expectation and just be in the experience, so that later
you can reflect, and that reflection is of value.
The Logic Process Mastery is Rooted in Identification
When we go to the mirror on the other side, and we go to the 16th gate, what
we get to is the gate of identification. So where everything about the abstract
process is rooted in expectation, everything in the logic process is rooted in
identification. Now of course, this is an obvious difference. You see, in order
for talent to work and in order for talent to be recognized, one has to be deeply
identified with the process—deeply identified.
In the east, with this whole load of Atman Guru stuff, no mind stuff, all of
these generalizations that come out of Brahmin philosophy, one of their
bugaboos is identification. Guru says, “Don’t identify.” What to say. I’m cold
so I could get real nasty today. You can’t be a master unless you’re identified.
It’s a great joke. You have to be identified with what you are mastering; it has
to be everything for you.
The Trick is Not to be Identified with the Identification
And you see, the trick—there is always a trick—is not to be identified with the
identification. That’s the trick. And of course, that’s the trick about everything
having to do with the BodyGraph because after all, you’re only here to live out
your Type. In that way, you’re not identified with the identification, the
identification is simply you. That’s your Type. If I’m not identified,—I have a
great deal, though I have no logical definition in my design, I have seven
different planets that are in logical gates. If I were not identified with Human
Design, I could not be a master of it.
184 Channels By Type
That’s the only thing in my life that I’ve ever stayed with, and I’ve been at it
now, and I’m in my 13th year. And
I am identified with the values of Ra Uru Hu
Human Design and its
effectiveness, and out of that
identification comes the capacity
to focus and continue to master.
Those of you that have been
students of mine for years now
recognize that that’s an ongoing
process; I’m always refining my
teaching. I never sit at the same
level in the way in which I give out
information. It’s an ongoing process of identifying with the knowledge and
finding a way to master it to make it possible to share it.
Without the identification, it wouldn’t be possible. And yet, I’m not identified
with that. In other words, that’s an aspect of my nature. It’s the way it
functions. It’s the way my Type functions. So it’s one of those things to
recognize: don’t get caught up in seeing the dogma of anything as you because
it’s not. I can show you every philosophical and religious thought in Design. I
can show you the places where all those different things come out. They’re all
there.
And identification is the theme on one side, and expectation is the theme on
the other side. It is not about you resisting what is mechanical. Without the
identification, there is no mastery.
Non-motorized 16-48s Talent Comes Out Communally
So the first thing to recognize about that, and we begin with dealing with
children, that 16-48 child that we looked at that had no other definition, that
child is somebody that can be encouraged to enter into communal art.
Now by the way, when I speak specifically of the arts, it is not a limitation on
that. Please understand that we need to have people who are skilled in being
whatever, politicians, mechanics, doctors. It doesn’t make any difference.
Talent is something that’s open in many, many ways. But the fact of the matter
is that if you have somebody who has the 16-48 and it’s not connected to a
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111188885555
motor, their talent is only going to come out communally. If you’re their
parent, rather than putting pressure on them that’s only going to result in
bitterness by trying to get them to perfect something on their own that they
don’t necessarily have access to the energy, is you have to be able to encourage
them to enter into communal activities.
I had a client of my mine in Berlin a couple of years ago, not simply a client but
somebody who is an organizer for my teaching and readings and lectures and
things in the city. And he is a 16-48, and it’s cut off from the 59-6. And he
studied to be a ballet dancer and became a very good one and was a member of
the Munich in Germany, their ballet company. And he had dreamed all his life
of a solo career. And any of you who know anything about dance, particularly
about ballet, know how much effort that takes, how much hours and time and
work to be able to perfect that.
The fact is that he was a chorus dancer, and that’s where he was the best. And
every once in a while, he’d get his opportunities to do a solo piece or whatever,
but it was never enough to get him that level of his career. And he became
very bitter and quit, moved away, opened up a New Age kind of center in
Berlin and left dancing behind.
So when I did his reading, it was incredible for this man. Suddenly, that
bitterness all started to just peel away. The recognition of why he could not be
a solo dancer, it wasn’t because he didn’t have the talent; it was just mechanical.
His greatest performance would be when he danced with the greatest dancers,
and he knew that. I said to him, “The better your partner, the better the
dancers you’re working with, the better you’re going to be.” He said, “Oh,
that’s true.” Best reviews when he was dancing with people who were really
good. They hooked him up; they gave him a chance to shine.
Now that could be anything, obviously. It could be a scientist in group
research; it could be anything. But it’s so important to recognize these things
because as a parent or as a guide of young people, particularly between the age
of 12 and 18 where they’re beginning to get an idea of where or what or maybe
what’s interesting for them, it’s so important to be able to guide them away
from those things that are going to be so disturbing.
And of course, not knowing that, because that child has an aura, the moment
that child steps into your body, if you’re that child’s parent, and that child’s got
the 16-48, you say, “My child’s talented.” You take it in in the aura; you can
186 Channels By Type
smell it. And usually, when you take it in in the aura, you’re giving them a
motor at the same time. And around you, they’re really creative. Without
understanding how it works, you invite them into things that are not correct for
them because you don’t know.
The 16-48 Connected to a Motor is a Manifestor
It’s very different if you have a child that has the 16-48 and it’s connected to a
motor. And the moment that the 16-48 is connected to a motor, you have a
Manifestor. There is nothing more attractive on this whole planet than a
logical person who can manifest. It has incredible power. It’s what
everybody’s looking for.
And when you have a child that has this kind of configuration where that
Channel of Talent is connected to a motor, then it’s very important to see that
you can invite them to just about anything. Built into them is that capacity to
get in there and stay with it over and over and over again. Unless there is a
deep identification, there’s no way to do that, none, because without that it’s
just not possible. It’s not just a matter of saying, “You can do this. Go ahead,”
because then the contribution to society—and the most important thing about
logic is the contribution to society—is not effective.
The 16-48 Expresses What the Experiment Should Be
Think about the voice of the 16. The voice of the 16 says, “I experiment or
not.” And the first thing to recognize about the 16-48 is that it is able to
express what the experiment should be. This is one of the favorite words of
logical people: should. You SHOULD read this book; you SHOULD change
your life. SHOULD, WOULD, COULD, MIGHT—typical logical
expressions. It COULD have been better; it SHOULD have been better; it
WOULD have been better if.
Collective Finger Pointing
You see, both the logical process and the abstract process is full of finger
pointing. You’re a 16-48, you’re identified with your experimental solution
because that’s what the 16-48 is, experimental solution. You’re identified with
that solution, and you don’t get the energy. You know how many proposals are
submitted to the American government every year by people who are looking
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111188887777
for money? They all have their experimental solutions, the new mousetrap,
whatever it happens to be, and then they don’t get the energy. No one sends
them a fat check and says, “Do try.”
They stick out their finger like this, “I could have if they…”, “I would have if
they…”, “They should have.” At the same time while they’re pointing the
finger outward, the other hand is whipping them on the back, “If I had done it
differently…” “Only if I had done it differently, they would have acted
differently.” And that bitterness stays there for a whole life. I’ve met people in
their 70s who are still bitter about what could have happened when they were
25. Still bitter.
16-48s Need the Special Gift of Energy from Others
To identify with an experiment means that you have to have a specific gift, and
that the specific gift necessary to all 16-48s is the ability to be able to get energy
from others by being able to reasonably express what their experiment is and
how it could, would or might work. That’s the most important gift inherent in
the 16. The 62 can give you the details; the 31 can lead. But only the 16 can
get the energy necessary to go out there and do the experiment, and it’s out of
their power of identification and their ability to express it that makes a
difference.
Repetition is Key: Knocking on the Door
These are people that can be deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply persistent, deeply
identified. Remember that repetition is the key to the logical process, so they
keep on knocking at your door, and they keep on knocking at your door, and
they keep on knocking at your door. And every time you see them, they talk
about the same thing, and they keep on knocking at your door, and they drive
you crazy. And if you don’t support their effort, if you don’t think that what
they’ve got is a great experiment, they point their finger at you, “People like
you stop this from happening, people like you with no vision who can’t see
how important this is. Get out of my life.”
It’s so hard to get energy for the logic process; it’s the irony. And you see, the
difficulty lies in many of the things we’ve been discussing up till now which has
to do with the intelligence and the need for complexity in the human
consciousness. Have you ever seen a proposal that people make for their
188 Channels By Type
experiment? It’s like trying to read a computer manual. It makes you crazy.
They turn the simplest thing into the most complex stuff out of fear of
inadequacy. You know that if they don’t put everything in there, if they don’t
show that everything is there, then they’re going to be refused.
Lines of the 16: The Talent of Recognizing others’ Talents
One of the things to be clear about the 16-48, like all projected channels, is that
not only is it a matter of the channel being recognized, but be clear that the
channel itself brings the gift of recognition. If you look at the 16, you will see
that there are lines that are specifically about recognizing the talents of others
as a talent.
The 16-48 is Talented at Raising Funds for Others
And one of the most important talents of the 16-48 is to know how to raise
money, to recognize who has the talent to use the energy properly in order to
succeed. And they’re great fundraisers, totally identified with the process. And
they’re often much more successful at raising money for others than they
would be raising money for themselves because they don’t suffer from personal
inadequacy.
I have the 48 twice with Neptune. Now I never felt inadequate as a man, but I
always felt inadequate in terms of my depth. I had no idea what was there,
couldn’t access it, used every drug in the world to try to get there, couldn’t find
it, and always felt like there was something missing.
The 48: Inadequacy Makes it Impossible to Sit on Their
Laurels
Anybody who carries the 48, no matter how skilled they are, no matter what
stage in their life they’re at, it’s impossible for them to sit back on their laurels,
sit back on their heels because there is a fear that it will instantly become
inadequate if they don’t keep on keeping on. It’s like you buy a computer
today, you’re not buying it for life; you’re going to have to get another one in
two years. You can’t just give up and say, “All right, this is my computer for
life.” You’ll be in the Stone Age in three years.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111188889999
So the logical person, no matter how much they achieve in their process, they
never stop feeling inadequate. Go up to one of these great masters, whoever
they were, the Horowitzes, the Pablo Casals, whatever it is, and you go up to
them at 75 years of age in which they’re recognized geniuses of their
instrument, and you go up to them, and then you ask them, “Is it okay? You
feel complete?” And they look at you like you’re nuts, “No, no, no, that piece I
played last night, oh, that was terrible.” Everybody in the audience is going
nuts. They think it’s incredible. And that 48 is saying, “Well, you know, yeah, I
could have done better. I really didn’t feel good about my performance.” They
die that way. They even feel inadequate dying. “Can I really be identified with
this? Is it possible?”
Logic is Obsessed with Energy
Symmetry. The 36th gate, it likes to fuck and so does the 48 but in a different
way. In other words, it likes to get you because it wants your energy. And so it
works very hard at that, to seduce you with its depth, because only when it can
bring somebody to recognize the intrinsic value of the depth can it get access
to the energy. Wherever you see logic, one of the things that human beings
suffer from is this sense of material inadequacy. It’s one of the most common
things, and nobody seems ever to have enough, which is all part of the logic
process the way that works.
Logic is obsessed with energy, and of course, money is just another term for
energy. It’s obsessed with it, and that’s not personal. Don’t confuse this now.
It’s not like being tribal where money is the essence of life. It’s different; it’s
not personal. It’s not about raising your kids and paying taxes and all this stuff.
It’s about getting access to money, constantly being concerned about being
financed.
You look at the American democratic system and the way it operates now.
Now you have a purely collective system here in which the 31-7 is the
archetype. In other words, the power to lead is governed by the energy that is
available. And of course, you can see that archetype played out in what is
called fundraising. In other words, in order to actually become a logical leader,
just like becoming a logical artist, you need access to energy. And logical
leaders cannot even become leaders unless they gather up enough energy in the
first place. That energy is always saying, “We are here to back up your
identification, your experiment, your solution.”
190 Channels By Type
It’s impossible to get elected in the United States unless you have millions and
millions of dollars available to you—millions. This is the whole absurdity of
the logical process, that because it’s so difficult to get energy, energy becomes
the obsession. Everybody in the logical process, everybody now is looking for
grants; everybody is looking for money. The larger our societies, the more
complex they are, the more demands that are made by the logical community
for money.
Charities are Collective, Not Tribal
Where do you think charities come from? Charities aren’t tribal; they’re
collective. The world’s full of logical do-gooders, and they run around raising
money to save beavers and eagles, and it’s what they do, and they become
identified with it. See, the collective has no real power other than money. It’s
one of the funny things about the collective. And the moment that the
collective doesn’t have money, the tribe eliminates it because the tribe has
much deeper bonds.
So the collective survives by being able to get access to money. Look at the ads
on television and particularly information ads, not so much product-related
things or politicians running ads on television. So all of this business about
logical talent is deeply connected with money, and it means that part of the
process now is that in order to be able to get any logical skill, you’ve got to pay
through the nose. Aren’t you paying through the nose for a logical skill?
This is the logic business. The logic business says, “Tough to get energy for
logic, pay for it.” So instead of having the ability of logical talent being
naturally supported and backed, what we have is it all costs money and lots of
it. If you raise kids, you know what that costs. This kind of class and this kind
of thing and that kind of thing, and all of them want money. So the whole
business of perfection has a financial tag to it.
Think about an artist, and I’ll stay with music for a while. When you think
about an artist, has great skills, and they don’t get recognized. Now if they
don’t get recognized, they don’t have the material capacity to be able to
continue with their art. If you’re going to be a great musician, you’re going to
have to play five, six hours a day. It’s hard to have a job and do that.
You need to be supported. And if nobody recognizes you, and you don’t have
access to the cash, you can’t do that. So Pablo Casals becomes a plumber or
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111199991111
whatever, and the career never gets recognized, and nobody gets to enjoy the
beauty of it, and nobody gets to feel wonderful while that music is out there.
Parents Pay for the Logical Process
So one of the things to be very, very clear about is that the moment that you
have a child that has a 16-48 or is dominated by the logical process, you better
have a good job because you’re going to have to pay for all of that. And you
see, that’s why so much talent goes unrecognized.
You see, built into any parent that has a logical child is the fear of the expense.
It’s true; it’s just the way it is. “You mean I have to give all this energy to this,
and all I hear are these squeaks coming out.” It’s like a parent who has a kid
who wants to be a drummer. That will make you insane. You’re going to go
through nine years paying thousands of dollars to hear them rattling the walls.
So the parent of the logical child has to look at that. And of course, what
happens is that this is why they’re so much trouble in getting identification out.
I had that process in my own life. I grew up in a musical family; everybody
studied the piano, so I studied the piano, and I didn’t like my teacher, so I quit.
And then I studied the violin, and I quit. And then I asked my father, because
I fell in love with the guitar, if he would give me lessons. He said, “No.”
The Solution to Financing Talent
And of course, this happens all the time to children with talent because the
talent cannot necessarily develop on its own. There are cases, of course, that it
does. But the fact of the matter is that the vast majority of families—and I’m
not talking specifically of America, I’m just talking generally—do not have the
resources to finance logical talent, they just don’t. Now the solution to that is a
difficult solution. Aside from the obvious things that we talk about in Type,
but just outside of that in terms of society, that the solution, of course, is that
the collective establishes for the benefit of those that are creative, opportunities
that they don’t have to pay for.
That’s the real job of the collective. In other words, that you have national
schools of the arts, whatever they may be like so many socialist countries do in
Europe, in which it’s not necessary for parents to put out enormous sums of
money in an experiment after all. It’s just an experiment. 10 years of piano
192 Channels By Type
lessons, and then the kid becomes a junky, I mean forget it. It’s an experiment.
You don’t really know that it’s going to work. And until the collective
establishes institutions, because that’s what the collective does, it establishes
institutions, unless it establishes institutions that provide that kind of
energizing, then we’re not going to have a genuine, clear pool of talent
anywhere. This is the whole thing.
Material in life is directly related to the way in which you enter into things
according to your Type. The fact of the matter is that if everybody lived out
their Type, everybody would have more revenue, everybody. Because when
you live out your Type, you get your terms. When you get your terms, you’re
going to do better. And it’s one of those things to recognize clearly that the
burden that most human beings feel about the financial plane is a misplaced
burden.
You Only Get Rich through the Not-Self
If you truly live out your Type, you’re not going to have a problem surviving in
this life. That isn’t to say that you’re going to become Bill Gates. You only get
that rich through the not-self. That’s one of the jokes. And if one day he kills
himself, which is there in his design, you’ll understand that all that money
doesn’t mean dick, nothing. So one of the things about being able to relax with
life,—remember I started by pointing out that the logical circuitry is rooted in
the 15-5 which is universal in all forms of life. All those other forms of life that
have the 15-5, they’re not busy worrying about their financial life. I don’t mean
to make a joke about it, but dogs and cats and whatever.
That 15-5 in them finds a natural rhythm, a logical pattern for survival. It’s
what it does. And because they are deeply identified with being dog, they have
no choice, they have no problem in terms of feeding themselves other than
when human beings get in the way. Nature, naturally, has a way of dealing with
material, it just does. That isn’t to say that some of those creatures don’t
survive, but the reality is that it’s not a question, and it does not need be a
question for us. And yet, we’ve turned it into the biggest question of all.
This whole business about having enough. You’re only going to get what is
correct for you by entering into things correctly. And the moment that you
enter into things according to your Type, you always have the advantage of
establishing the terms. You always have a way of guaranteeing that you are
going to get what you need. And since everyone has a purpose, if you’re living
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111199993333
out your design, you’re going to see that you’re going to have the resources
necessary for you.
No Immediate Return on Investment
That 16-48, whatever their definition happens to be otherwise, the nature of
their Type, by living out their Type, they’re going to get their opportunity.
They’re going to get the invitations that will offer energy to them, so that they
can begin the process of developing their talent. Now aside from the nature of
the prodigy, which is an exception, the return on investment comes late. It’s
like if you see somebody who has artistic potential and you invest in that. In
other words, you help them out, you provide them with enough money, so that
they can go to the best schools, whatever. Every once in a while, they’ll give
you a painting.
If they’re really good, 30 years later, you can sell those paintings for a hell of a
lot more money than you invested. But it’s not about an immediate return on
investment. It is a collective exercise for the benefit of the collective, and the
collective needs to have art around it. Remember the theme of the second
gate, first line: Aesthetics whether inborn or acquired is the natural pathway of
evolution for humanity. We need our beauty.
It’s not enough for us to have logically talented leaders. It just leads to a sterile
life if that’s all there is without art. And as long as humans have been on this
earth, they’ve been making marking somewhere. They discovered last year that
Neanderthals were musicians, which is extraordinary. They couldn’t speak;
they didn’t have the dropped larynx that Homo sapiens have, but they could
play flutes. They made bone flutes.
Art is a part of us. Beauty is an essential ingredient in our lives. And the
support of creativity is absolutely essential, and that’s a collective responsibility.
The tribe doesn’t want you to be a painter; the tribe wants you to be a farmer,
wants you to be a worker, wants you to be somebody who is providing physical
stuff for the community. The collective demands the art; it demands the
vision. And the art of the collective is always saying, “No matter where we are
now, there is beauty available to us.”

Their Greatest Joy
I’m always reminded of,—I have many Russian friends that I know and
particularly in Vienna who lived for many years under the rigid communist
system. And their greatest joy was to receive mimeographed chapters of books
while they were being written. So you would have some writer somewhere, and
every time he would finish a chapter, he would smuggle it over to somebody
who had an illegal mimeograph machine who would then mimeograph off the
chapters.
They would make 10 or 12 copies. They couldn’t afford any more because it
would attract the attention of the government because of the paper being used.
And then they would hand them around secretly. For many of these people,
many of the ones that I know are very creative beings, that was the only joy in
their lives. It was the only joy that suddenly there was this little bit of creativity
and art. And of course, as a collective exercise, it was examining their society.
It was food for them, and it made them feel wonderful.
We could not imagine what it’s like to live in this society without any creativity
around us, without the collective advantages of creativity. How many
Americans escape the horror and boredom of their lives by dropping in on the
tube? Not that that’s particularly creative but nonetheless. We need it,
otherwise we would be killing each other, really.
Funding Logic – Corruption and Greasing
Art is very soothing; it makes you feel good. And so we need to nurture our
collective artists, which means we need to come up with the money.
Everything about perfecting society is about having enough material, and our
greatest dilemma is that there’s an awful lot of skilled logical people who raise
funds for things that are not deserving. What do they call that here, the
government auditing agency? It’s an agency that examines how various
departments operate in the country.
General Accounting Office. Thank you. And they discover the most
incredible things, a million dollars given to examine the nature of dust. You
name it, there’s somebody who’s hustled those bucks. And of course, it isn’t
that we lack the resources to be able to support creativity at the logical level.
It’s that so much of that goes to things that are of no value whatsoever because
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111199995555
you’ve got a very good 16 mouthpiece that gets the money. It’s their cousin
that does the dust examining, whatever the case may be.
See, the true nature of corruption in modern society is all about this. It’s how it
works. It’s what we call greasing. You want to sell me 25 airplanes? You give
me $10 million in my Swiss account, and I’ll see what I can do for you. All of
this is out of this need for the energy. And so not only do we have a lot of
logical people who are raising money for strange things, because they live out
their not-self, so their very activity is not correct.
But at the same time, you have people who are fundamentally honest, who are
so bitter and frustrated that nobody recognizes their creativity that they’re ready
to bribe to get an opportunity. They’re ready to cheat to get the opportunity.
They keep a lot of it quiet, but there’s probably maybe a thousand cases a year
in America of scientists that produce false material, false evidence in order to
continue to get their grants from universities or whatever the case may be.
This is where you get that kind of distortion.
So it’s not about everybody has to suddenly dig into their pockets, and we have
to be taxed for this. It’s about recognizing that the whole collective process
because it doesn’t operate cleanly, it doesn’t operate according to its Type, that
real talent is often overlooked and lost. And that the only things that get out
there are things that are deeply financed, which means that we get a lot of stuff
that’s just simply mediocre.
You’ve watched this politically for years where if somebody can spend $20
million where normally you only spend $1 million, that $20 million putting their
face, their bit, their story on television all the time, the fact that they can get all
of those resources gives them an opportunity, and that opportunity isn’t
necessarily based on their skills; it isn’t. And if you look at the way the media
operates, what do they track now? They track money. It’s astonishing to me.
I pick up the newspaper, and you go to the political section, and what they’re
talking about is Al Gore got $7 million in the month of April or March or
whatever it was. Dan Quayle got a million. Now I think that’s incredible; I
think that’s incredible. He’s America’s living joke. Somebody gave this guy a
million bucks. Maybe he inflated that and put it in himself, I don’t know but
anyway.
196 Channels By Type
The fact of the matter is that they’re not tracking skill. They’re not tracking
capacity. They’re not even tracking what’s being offered as a logical program,
what the talent is. They’re tracking money. “Well, this one has a head start to
becoming president; they’ve got $7 million.” And this is the logic process; it’s a
funny thing.
So you really have to understand something about being able to get the talent
out that is necessary to keep us all alive, and to keep us healthy and feeling
good, and to keep us assured that the patterns are correct, that we don’t have to
feel insecure, that the bus will come, that the heat will work.
The Collective is Inherently Social
One of the things to recognize about the nature of collective circuitry to begin
with is, of course, that it is circuitry that
is about sharing. And of the obvious,
something that you get to see very early
in your Human Design work is that,
given that there are three social channels
and that two of them are tribal and one
of them is individual, that the collective
has no social channels.
And of course the reason the collective
has no social channels is that every
channel that’s in the collective is social
by its very nature. So whether that’s
abstract or whether that’s logical, it’s
inherently social because it’s rooted in the keynote of sharing and that sharing
is fundamentally social.
Collective Talent Channels Operate Best as
Electromagnetics
It’s one of the things about—and this is specifically about talent channels—is
that the collective talent channels operate best as electromagnetics. The
likelihood in any electromagnetic, the likelihood of two people coming
together, it is rare that when people come together they remain Projectors as a
couple. It’s rare. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. It does happen. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111199997777
But the reality is that the moment you bring those aspects together, particularly
on the logic side, you’re more likely to get access to energy that way. And so
that collective process of sharing can be deeply, deeply effective.
The same thing is true for the 35-36 in the sense that if you have the whole
channel and you’re an emotional Manifestor, the only element that can protect
you is your own awareness. If you don’t enter into things correctly, you’re
going to be exploding all over the place. With an electromagnetic connection,
there is a basic difference. It takes the two to tango and so they may not be as
quick at jumping into things.
Shared Experience is Trusted More Than Individual
Experience
The other thing is that they have the shared experience. Now one of the things
about shared experience is that we trust shared experience more than we trust
individual experience. Remember that part
of the abstract process is the 11-56, and this
is all about believing and belief systems.
And it’s absolutely essential for an abstract
person that they are believed, in the same
way that it’s absolutely essential for a logic
person that they are understood.
When somebody’s a 35-36 and they have an
experience, and it’s their experience and
only their experience, it’s very, very difficult
for them to get other people to believe in
them. But the moment you have a shared
experience, you have witnesses, and the whole nature of the abstract process is
the presence of the witness. This is the 33-13. This is the Channel of the
Prodigal. This is where the witness resides. And in the genetic continuity of
the whole circuit, it is to the advantage of the abstract to have shared
experience.
So that when you say you’ve seen a UFO and you see it alone, it’s a lot harder
to get people to believe you. If there’s two of you, it makes it easier and so
forth and so on. Whether it’s true or not is not the point. The point is that the
abstract is always looking for others to believe its experience and to believe in
them. This is where you get these collective television ministries. They’re not
198 Channels By Type
tribal. This is not the local parish priest. These are collective ministries and
they say, “Believe in me and believe in this experience, and by the way, send
money.”
So when you come to the logical side, rather than simply being a protection as
it is on the abstract, the electromagnetic of the 35-36, then it becomes really an
essential ingredient. It’s a way of guaranteeing that there’s going to be energy
available to get the creativity out.
Classis Example: Lennon and McCartney
And of course Lennon and McCartney are a classic example of that. It’s a
classic example of an electromagnetic connection in the 16-48 and the result of
that is feel good music that deeply has influenced the collective. And that they
didn’t have to go around looking for energy.
They had it in coming together through that channel in meeting, they got
access to it. You can see clearly that that access comes in many directions. The
moment that the two of them are together, they’re very, very powerful,
motorized talent.
John Lennon Paul McCartney
So, something to keep in mind about the nature of the logical process is that it
is often encouraged by being social, and that there is greater success potential in
the logical process by developing those sharing skills that can bring in the right
kinds of associations to make those things work.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 111199999999
Mick Jagger Could Never Have a Solo Career
I had the experience near the end of the summer before I left Ibiza for here.
One of my neighbors on the island was the daughter of Mick Jagger and he
came to visit. He was on tour in
Mick Jagger Spain in Barcelona. And I did his
design for him and he’s the
Throat, and only the Throat, to
the identity. He’s got the 31-7
and the 33-13 and he has nothing
else. You know, the big lips. It’s
his powerful Throat.
And of course one of the things
to recognize about that is that
this is a self-projected identity,
and it’s a self-projected identity
through the voice. Now there
isn’t one of us who cannot turn on the radio and hear a Stones song and not
recognize Mick Jagger’s voice. That’s what he is recognized for. But this man
could never have a solo career—never, never. It’s not possible.
He always needed the other energy around in order for manifestation to really
take place, and he understood that. A basic in his nature is the recognition that
he works best in that social environment, the modern context of that being the
band, or what used to be the ensemble, or whatever names you want to give all
these things, that is, the communal process.
So meeting electromagnetically, because the question was asked earlier about
the importance of the electromagnetic connection, is that in the collective arts,
it’s absolutely essential. It makes the experience more believable on the
abstract side and provides the essential energy necessary on the logic side.
Now look, if you’ve got your own energy, it means you don’t have to sell
yourself, you don’t have to give away the family store in order to get your
opportunity to get your creativity out. It means that the energy is inherent. It’s
there.
So again, it goes back to this very important recognition as a parent, that when
you’re looking at collective creativity in your children, whether that’s 35-36 or
200 Channels By Type
either one, whether that’s the 16-48 or either one, is that they have to be
encouraged to look at forms of creativity possible for them that are social in
nature. Only individuals are designed to be lone wolves. The collective is not,
and it’s really essential to see that.
And of course the moment you get the opportunity to bring the 16-48 into an
energy field, what you do get is that potential for mastery. That endless
repetition that’s going to produce exactly, exactly what that process is all about.
In other words, the skills to be able to recognize at a very, very profound level
what the pattern is. When you have more than one person involved in that
logical process, the strength of the pattern and the ability to be able to establish
the pattern is enhanced, because otherwise it’s all a money trip.
Who You Know is Important for Collective Talent
One of the most important things about collective talent is something that’s
called ‘who you know.’ I had this very strange experience many years ago in
Germany living with a friend of mine who was a very talented human being.
Somebody, by the way, who had the 16-48. A guitar player, a songwriter, a
singer. He had all the ingredients of stardom. He was very handsome. He had
an incredibly charming way about him. He had all this talent. He sang like an
angel. Bitter all his life. Never recognized. I mean, never recognized.
And always complaining about all these other people who didn’t have,—he
knew so many people that were in the business. And he would talk about how
they got there because they knew that person, or they knew that person, or they
knew that person, because in the end, it is who you know when it comes to the
collective arts. It’s who you know. And again, this is the social theme that’s
involved.
If you’re some kind of nut out there in boonie land with your collective theory
that you think is going to change the world, and your cousin, uncle, nephew,
brother or whatever happens to be in government, you get it. You get it
because you know that person. And in knowing that person, you get your
opportunity without resistance to be able to present your case. And if you’re
really identified with it and you’ve got your theory, they’re going to be open to
you getting that.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222200001111
The Nurturing of Social Skills
So one of the things is the nurturing of social skills. You see, that is the
collective’s most important responsibility, the development of social skills to
learn how to share. You talk to any child psychologist and they’re going to tell
you about teaching your children how to share their toys, all this kind of stuff,
that sharing. But of course, you have to see that in a proper context. If you’re
tribal, you don’t share. “Don’t you touch my toy, I’ll kill you. It’s mine, it’s not
yours.”
You can watch children as they grow up, they go through first the tribal stage:
mine, mine. And then they get to the collective stage, “Okay I’ll share it with
you but it’s still mine.” So this development of social skills is very, very
important.
The collective creative person can never afford to ignore or to deny or decline
the social involvement necessary for their careers. How many painters have to
put up with opening evening vernissages where they have to smile at the damn
clients? They have to go through that whole process of being the artist. They
smile nice and blah, blah, blah. They have to.
Book signings. These poor bastards sitting behind these desks signing one
after the other. “I loved your book.” But without that social context, it doesn’t
work. In other words, the collective thrives on social interaction, and
collective art thrives on social interaction.
So if you’re logical and if you have a lot of logical activation, you’ve got to work
on your social skills because they’re essential. Remember, you’re always
looking for something. The logical creative being is always looking for money.
It’s always looking for backing. It’s always looking for somebody to share
their identification, and it can’t just be a hit or miss process for them. They’re
identified with it. They’re focused on it. They’re out to get it from anyone,
anywhere.
So the development of their social skills means that they’re going to have easier
access, and they’re going to have greater opportunities. You can really see this
in class-oriented societies. In England, for example, the old boy connection.
You all go to the same fine school and you all end up with connections. So
you’re a complete jerk and useless, but you’ve been rooming with people whose
202 Channels By Type
parents own this and that and that and that and whatever, and all of a sudden
you have any kind of opportunity you want.
The Abstract Social Process
And it’s one of those things to recognize about the collective process. The
collective process is always built on those kind of social interactions. They’re
the basis of getting it going. And while you’re developing your skills, which
remember take a long time, you can have any experience in the moment and be
inexperienced going into it and you’re rewarded for being inexperienced going
into. You get your experience.
The Logical Social Process
But if you’re logical, you have to put in years and years and years and years of
effort to get there, which means that after somebody has been backing you up
for ten years, and you’re still not at it, you better have good social skills with
them. Because you’re going to need that, because without those social skills
they’re not going to be able to continue to identify with your project and you
need them to do that.
So one of the things to see underneath the surface of these two collective
creative channels is that the real secret there is about social skills. That’s the
real secret. It is a talent for social skills. The 16.5 is a leader. It’s a talent for
social skills. It’s the ability to be able to recognize in the other, and to
recognize who you can work with, who could be a backer, who can be just
somebody who stands and applauds for you, who is somebody that gives you
that sense that you’re not inadequate. The social skills are as important as the
creative results.
The Teacher is More Important Than What They’re Learning
And that comes to something that is even more significant. In the training of
any collective creative person who their teacher is, is more important than what
they’re learning. It’s the teacher, it’s the trainer. You see, nothing collective
works well without good human social skills, nothing. Without human social
skills, collective processes get bankrupted no matter how talented, no matter
how creative, no matter how valuable, because it’s about people. And the
collective process is about opening up to all, because it’s a collective field. And
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222200003333
it means that without the capacity to have clear, quality social skills you get
stuck. You lose the backing necessary.
So that social element that is part of the collective process, you have to see that
every single channel that is in the abstract or in the understanding circuit, every
single one of those channels, are social by nature, and their prime success is
rooted in learning how to be social first. Learning how to work within the
collective environment. Learning what it means to be able to share. Learning
what it means to be able to share appreciation.
You can see that when a troop of actors comes to the edge of the stage at the
end of a performance. This lovely picture of all of them holding hands and
bowing at the same time, this collective joy in a collective artistic experience
and sharing that equally. Not having to be the one that stands alone in front of
the curtain and says, “I am everything,” but to recognize that their gifts come
out of the collective process.
As we’ve advanced over the last several hundred years, we’ve had rapid changes
in the way in which the arts operate and the ways in which we’re entertained.
And you can see that at the end of the 19th Century, the most sophisticated and
collective we had become was opera. In other words, we had many, many
different kinds of skills and creativity brought together into one particular
medium whether it was painting the sets or playing the instruments in the pit,
or being an actor or a singer or whatever the case may be; many, many forms
were brought together.
This is our movement. That’s why the motion picture and as a corollary,
television, dominate our lives because they are pure collective entertainment.
They’re collective processes. Any time you need confirmation of that, wait
until the end of a movie you’re watching and then count the names. Some of
these movies you’ve got five minutes of roll, 1,000 people, 2,000 people
working on a project. This is collective art at its very best and it truly demands
social skills, otherwise it doesn’t work.
Every Logic Gate is Inherently Critical
And remember that the whole thing about the collective process is that the
logic side of the process is always based on criticism. Every logic gate is
inherently critical, always. So built into the social nature of the collective is
204 Channels By Type
mutual criticism. These are the people who want you to tell them that what
they did was bad so they can do it better.
They need that in the same way that they need people to be able to say to them,
“You’ve done well,” which they won’t believe any way because they’ll always
have their inner aspect that says “Well, yes but this could have been better and
that could have been better,” and it’s this ongoing process.
Talent is Lost through Lack of Social Graces
So the criticism that’s inherent here is that unless these beings are operating
correctly according to their Type, and unless they have developed their social
skills, they’re constantly going to be caught up in criticism and it becomes a
dominant theme. As in this logic creativity, a dominant theme of their
bitterness is their criticism of everyone else and themselves. So much talent is
lost through lack of social skills and social graces—just lost.
And then you end up with people that nobody wants to work with. “Oh no,
we can’t have this person here. They’re always whining and they’re always
complaining, and there’s always something wrong.” And this is one of the
things that happens when talent is not recognized. The talent then becomes a
talent for bitterness, a talent for criticism. That’s not a moral question. It’s not
like that’s bad, but the reality is that it’s not pleasant to anybody else in that
social environment.
The collective process operates best, operates best, when everybody is
operating according to Type and everyone has social skills. That’s when it
really works. When you love to work with somebody, when you love to share
the end result of that work with somebody, this is a beautiful experience.
But the fact of the matter is that you have so many people, so many people
who just end up being bitter that that was overlooked in their life. What they
often don’t see is that they, themselves, are not open socially. That they’re
deeply restricted socially. That they think that those people around them aren’t
good enough for them, don’t see how important they are or how great their
skills are, whatever the case may be.
In my lifetime I’ve had three rock and roll bands and there’s nothing more
outrageous than dealing with five or six musicians at a time. They’re either
drunk or depressed or lost or confused, whatever the case may be. And as long
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222200005555
as the social skills are there, it can work. As long as there is a relatively good
feeling amongst the people that are involved in that project together.
But it’s astonishing what happens when two of them in a group don’t get along.
The whole thing falls apart. The whole thing falls apart. And if you’re the
audience on the outside, you can’t tell. But boy oh boy, if you’re on the inside,
do you ever know it, because the creativity has lost something. It doesn’t work
and unless that person leaves, you’re never going to get it back. It just gets
worse.
And then all of a sudden instead of this mutual appreciation of the process in
which the criticism is positive and productive, “We need to change this, we
need to work on that, you do your thing, blah, blah, blah.” Instead of that, it
becomes criticism all the time. “Why do you have to have that long of a solo in
that place.” This kind of thing in which there starts to get this button pushing
that the collective process is about.
Social Channels Needed in Tribal and Individual Circuits
We often forget in Design, because we’re given an upfront terminology: social
channels. That we forget that the social channels are there in the individual and
tribal circuit because they are basically not social at all and they need to have
specific social channels in order to bring that capacity into their lives.
The individual without the 12-22 has no way of being able to meet the
collective or the tribe without getting stoned. The tribe cannot function unless
it develops social intimacy, unless it develops community, and those two
aspects of intimacy and community are essential, otherwise the tribe doesn’t
function. They have to have those social elements; they have to be dominant
themes.
But in the collective process, everything’s like that. It’s as social as you can
possibly get. And of course when I say ‘it’s as social as you can possibly get,’
remember we’re dealing with a dualistic system. It’s as anti-social.
The Anti-Social Dilemma in the Collective Process
What happens to the creative being who becomes bitter? They become anti-
social. “I don’t want to be with those people. They don’t appreciate me. I
206 Channels By Type
don’t want to make music for anybody any more. I don’t want anybody to hear
me. They don’t really hear what I’m playing. I don’t want to go out, I don’t get
along with people. Nobody sees me for who I am.” This anti-social aspect of
the collective channels. And you really have to see that this is a real basic
dilemma in the collective process, the social-anti-social.
The success through the social when one can be identified and can be allowed
to apply energy to creativity and that increases the social capacity, like these
stories of people who come together on a project and fall in love with each
other. You get this incredible intimacy out of the creative process together and
that intimacy just grows and can become very personal rather than just being
collective as a nature.
But the moment you have that collective process that’s not operating according
to its Type, that’s not entering into things correctly, it begins to see that people
are not good for them. They don’t like people. They blame humanity for
being lousy and stupid and pointless. They blame everybody, and that blame
becomes their anti-social nature and it’s practically impossible to get them out
of that when it comes late in their life and they’re unaware of their processing.
The Vicious, Critical, Cynical Talent of Logic
See, every single one of us according to our definition, recognize that we can
either be accepted for it or not. The collective person is deeply concerned
about that. Deeply concerned about somebody in their social environment
accepting them and accepting their creativity, embracing it because that’s what
the collective is about. And of course out of that collective process we get
professional criticism, people who have a talent to criticize others, often quite
bitterly, which funny enough, human beings like.
I read a lot of reviews. I read reviews rather than seeing a lot of movies. And
you can always tell when somebody’s got an axe to grind and they stick that
knife in really deep. This is real collective stuff. They really give it to you. And
of course criticism can be exalted into a vicious art. The cynicism that’s in the
16, this deep sarcasm that can be there. Oh yeah, you’re really talented. I mean
vicious. And the whole thing about the collective process is that it is rooted in
the social, and if the social doesn’t operate properly, the negative field around
that does not make it possible for the creativity to come out.

Smiling is a Social Tool
Why the hell do you think politicians smile all the time? The only time they
don’t smile is when somebody’s dead. But basically they smile all the time.
“I’m social, I’m friendly, you can identify with my smile, how nice, had my
teeth capped yesterday. I look great, don’t I?” Just to be able to maintain this
collective social patina. You see it all the time. It’s a tool.
So, not forgetting the social importance of collective channels is very important
and you can take it anywhere. Don’t just leave it there in either that 16-48 or
the 35-36. See how that works.
If you’re an 11-56 and you have a gift of ideas and the capacity to be able to
stimulate others, to be a good storyteller, who the hell are you going to tell a
story to? You need somebody to tell the story to. So you have to have the
social skills, otherwise there’s nobody to tell the story to. Otherwise the
experience is useless. You only had the experience mechanically to be able to
share it. “Oh, I have to tell you what I did today.” How many people say that
almost every day? “Oh, I can’t wait to tell you what happened.” Social skills,
otherwise it doesn’t work.
Without Social Skills There’s no love of Humanity
The 15-5 being in the flow. You’re going to do that alone? This is a magnetic
channel. It is the tantra that brings people to guidance and
leadership in the 31-7. It’s not for the 15-5 alone. It’s there to
act as an energized field and bring other people into the flow, but
they’ve got to be there. Without the social skills, there’s nobody,
there’s no love of humanity. There’s nobody to love.
If there’s a 15 and there’s nobody in your flow, there’s no love of
humanity anymore. After all, like all dualistic processes, these
gates of love, like any gate, have their dualistic opposite. The
love of humanity becomes the hatred of humanity, bitterness
about humanity, that humanity does not follow its flow, in this
case in the 15-5 frustration, because the 15-5 is generative. It
means that that 15-5 has to be asked, and they’re not going to be
asked if they haven’t had social skills in the first place because there’s nobody
to ask them.

Teach Your Collective Children To Share
It doesn’t matter where you go, the underlying theme in the collective process
is fundamentally social. So remember your collective children. Teach your
collective children to share. Teach your collective children that the combined
effort is something for them to recognize that they will be respected for, that
they will not be lost in the crowd, that that is their only way to make a true
contribution, and that by working with others they will get the recognition that
they deserve. They will get their opportunities, they will get their backing.
So it means that those social skills have to be developed at a very early age.
That’s why the collective adult that comes to Human Design is mostly anti-
social—mostly. Years and years and years of the collective process being
ignored, not being backed.
The disappointment in not being seen for what one is, human beings not living
out their true nature. And so you have this huge anti-social power that says no,
no, no, no. I don’t want to work with all those people. I don’t want to have
anything to do with all that. I only have this friend over here and this over
here.
The Collective Transcends the Tribal Prejudice
And if you’re collective, the whole world is there for you. Everyone is there for
you. If it’s not for the social skills of the collective, we are nothing but a racist
culture. The tribe is inherently racist, the tribe is inherently prejudicial. Only
the collective, and all of us as modern citizens truly respect what the collective
has done for us, because the collective has allowed us to transcend the tribal
level to be able to see that somebody who does not come from our tribe is
somebody that can be worthy and valuable to us. That somebody who doesn’t
come from our tribe can be our friend.
No greater experiment has ever taken place than in North America where you
have all of these tribes mixed together, and all of them mixed together under a
collective patina. They’re all Americans regardless of what the hyphen is.
French-American, African-American, whatever the hyphen is.
The collective, through its social skills, makes it possible to say that I can be
friends with somebody who’s black or yellow. The collective process says that
they’re not really different. They just have a different environment. They can
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222200009999
have a different culture. But you see, the collective at its purest is about the
other being as just a being. That’s why we have collective human rights to try
to establish a quality of respect for all humans regardless of where they come
from.
We see what tribalism is. We’re watching that daily on CNN. You know,
you’ve got a bunch of human beings that have forced a million people to leave
their homes, they’ve been robbed, and thousands of women now that are being
raped. There’s all kinds of stuff going on and it’s just because they’re the other
tribe and we hate them. We hate them.
And then you have this big collective NATO made up of all these various
tribes and communities and you have this war between the collective and the
tribe. Oh, the Serbians hate that collective. You better believe that. Hate it.
This is the major tension point of our time is the struggle between the
collective and the tribal. The collective concept of science as opposed to the
tribal concept of faith. There are all kinds of fundamental conflicts that exist
between the collective and the tribe, and the collective only succeeds by being
social. It’s the only way that it can succeed, otherwise it doesn’t work. And the
moment that it can’t be social is the moment that the tribe continues to
dominate.
This is the most important thing. So it doesn’t matter where the activation is in
the collective process. If you’re dealing with children, you have to see that you
have to teach them and guide them into social skills, that it’s absolutely
essential, and for them to learn how to share and to recognize that in sharing
they will get the reward.
But when you’re dealing with adults who have strong collective definition, they
themselves have to realize that their gifts and their potentials are not going to
come out unless they release their tribal prejudices and open themselves up to
the collective social field.
You can’t just say, “I only will get my energy from this kind of person because
I don’t want to get my energy from that kind of person.” Being collective is
not caring. The writing of the very first book in Human Design was financed
by a gangster. I didn’t have any qualms in taking that collective backing. It’s
not about you saying, “I will only be social with this or that,” and of course
that’s the collective magic.

We know that there’s an enormous amount of hypocrisy tied up in all of that.
We know that it is the hypocrisy of the collective language. “I’m not
prejudiced.” But that’s collective language, that we know that even in this
experiment of the United States that the collective language is lovely, but the
reality is tribal. And it’s only when that collective really operates purely that
we’re going to be able to have a global connection that’s clean, that is not
aggressive. It is one of the essential ingredients for us. So all of you collective
defined people, be nice.
So far in terms of dealing with creative channels, the first thing that we’ve seen
is the individual creativity. In the individual creativity, we have three different
versions of that creativity. And then we’ve looked at the collective creative
process, both the abstract and the logical. There are two of those. And now
we come to the final stage, we come to the tribal channels of creativity of
which there are two.

Tribal Circuitry—Two Channels of Creativity
Tribal Creativity Serves the Needs of the Tribe
The tribe. Everything about the tribe is based on their keynote of support.
Tribal circuitry is about support. It is about a deep involvement and that tribal
creativity is there to serve the tribe. Tribal creativity is intended to be as
productive and valuable to the tribe as any other activity within the tribe. In
other words, if you’re going to be a painter in the tribe, you’re probably going
to be a sign painter rather than being an artist because a sign painter brings
value to the tribe in their efforts.
Ego Creativity as a Product of Willpower
In other words, the creativity that is inherent in the tribe is creativity that serves
the needs of the tribe, and need is a keynote when it comes to the tribe and
when it comes to any kind of tribal creativity. The nature of the tribal circuitry
is that its focus point, rather than being the Throat, is the Ego, and that here
what you’re looking at is Ego creativity. And it is the only example, other than
the 51-25, of Ego creativity—creativity as a result of willpower. In other
words, creativity that’s not a product of the muse, but a product of willpower.
The moment that creativity is subject to the muse, that’s the moment that it
cannot consistently serve. And tribal creativity is meant to consistently serve.
The tribe is not going to put up with an artist that’s not productive. It’s not
going to put up with somebody who has to go through a long learning process
before they can see the benefits of it. And the tribe will only support tribal
creativity when it sees that it is to its advantage and it enhances the values
inherent in whatever that tribal community happens to be.
The 44-26: Surrender, The Transmitter
So here at this stage we’re going
to look at the 44-26, the
Channel of Surrender a design
of being a transmitter. A classic
example of that is someone
who creates tribal creative
212 Channels By Type
materials and those materials are there to serve the tribe. The fact that the
materials can have an aesthetic value that one considers artistic is beside the
point. It’s beside the point. The value of it is how successful it is in getting the
tribe to use the creativity. That’s what it’s about.
Possessiveness, Exaggeration, Trickery
And that that creative expression brings values to the tribe. In other words, it’s
something worthwhile having, and having is very important because everything
about the tribe is about possessiveness. What I have, what I don’t have, what
we have, what we don’t have.
Think about how the tribe actually operates. The creativity of the tribe is an
active exaggeration. One of the most important aspects of the tribe is
trickery. The tribe is inherently conservative. They don’t like change. They
don’t want new things if the old thing works. And one of the gifts of tribal
creativity is to give everyone the impression that what’s new is better than
what’s old. Now that’s an exaggeration. However, the tribe will not accept
anything unless it’s been exaggerated, and the tribe will never jump into
something unless it’s fooled.
The 26th Gate: Manipulation of Memory, Trickery
The 26th gate, the taming power of the great. This is the pure manipulation of
memory. This is the gate of the trickster. This is the gate of the salesperson.
This is the gate of the marketer.
And as we all know, tribal marketing is rooted
in its exaggeration in order to trick people to
leave their conservatism behind and enter
into something new, and the tribe has to be
tricked. So what you do is you tell them there
is a new feature and that new feature is absolutely incredible. Now, it may not
be absolutely incredible. However, if you can manage to trick the tribe into
thinking they need that, they’ll buy it, and the tribe isn’t going to take anything
into its life unless it needs it which means that you’ve got to trick them.

The Unusual Capacity: Deeply Destructive T Cells
The 44-26 has an unusual capacity and it has a capacity that, in some degree, is
related to the 16-48. What we’ve seen in the logical process and in logical
creativity is that because logical creativity is rooted in the Splenic system that it
can be inherently healthy.
One of the most dynamically, potentially healthy channels in the BodyGraph is
the 44-26, the 44th gate coming out of the immune system itself. At the same
time, meeting the 26th gate at the other end, which is the gate of the thymus
gland—the gate where our T cells are produced, the T cells that are absolutely
essential for us in being able to combat alien viruses, bacteria, whatever. It is
the 44-26, that in a prenatal stage, in a conceptual stage, actually begins the
development of the immune system itself.
The thymus gland orchestrates the development of the immune system. So the
26-44 carries with it very, very health benefits. But it carries something
interesting. You see, the 44th gate is the pure lymphic system. It’s an alert
system, and the 44th gate itself, a gate of alertness, is a gate that’s there to be
able to recognize what needs to controlled, what needs to be manipulated, in
order to get the tribe involved in something.
But when you’re dealing with the 26th gate by itself, you have to recognize that
the 26th gate, because it is the place where the T cells are, is that it can be deeply
destructive—deeply destructive, but not deeply destructive in the negative
sense that we understand that. Deeply destructive in the positive sense of what
a T cell is. The T cell is one of the great warriors that this planet has ever seen.
It eats the enemy alive. Kills them instantaneously, swallows them down.
Creativity That Works Best When it’s Destroying
Something
So the fact of the matter is that when you’re dealing with the 44-26, you’re
dealing with an unusual creativity, because it’s a creativity that only works best
when it’s destroying something. Think about that. It only works best when it’s
destroying something and replacing it with something new.
How many times have you looked at an advertisement on television and it says
“new” or “new and improved,” or “brand new and improved,” or “super brand
new and improved?” And it goes on and on and on and on. And what that’s
214 Channels By Type
actually saying is, “This is new, the old stuff’s crap, forget it.” Same brand
name. Forget the old stuff.
Negative Advertising
So one of the inherent capacities in the 44-26 is the destruction of tribal
standards and their replacement with a new standard. When the Ego tries to
destroy something, it better have a good replacement. You see, this is not
anarchy. This is about the recognition that you can only succeed with the tribe
if you can replace what they already have. So what we get out of that is
negative advertising.
The Pepsi Cola/Coca-Cola challenge. “Coke tastes like that, but I like Pepsi.”
Only in America. You never see this in Europe. Only in America do you see
commercials in which the competitors are displayed on screen and shown to be
not a value. “This is a terrible product and you shouldn’t have been using this.
Ours is better. It picks up more liquid, it does more of this, it does more of
that,” whatever the case may be.
No Other Creativity Only Survives on Replacement
No other creativity has this capacity. No other creativity only survives on
replacement—no other creativity. So it’s an essential ingredient to recognize
that the 44-26 can only be successful by knocking something. They can only be
successful when they see out of their creativity that what somebody already has
isn’t good enough, they can do better. And part of doing better is to convince
them that what they have isn’t good enough. Otherwise, you’d never have a
car market.
You would never have any of these things. These products that have lasted 30
or 40 years, they’ve gone through all kinds of different updating because if you
don’t update them they die. If you don’t come along a year later and say “new
and improved,” you die.
So built into the tribe is a recognition that what they have is replaceable. This
is the conditioning of tribal creativity. Tribal creativity says, “This is the
product you get today, but I’m going to come back tomorrow and give you a
new version so that I can keep you interested in this product.” You can keep
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222211115555
the same product. You can write “new” on the box and have the same stuff
inside and it will still keep the tribe going.
The 44-26 Cannot Start from Scratch
It isn’t necessarily about their discernment; it’s built in mechanically to the
tribe. We started off as a deeply tribal specie, and of course the evolution is
evident within the tribe. Things replace things. Things get updated. So the 44-
26 cannot start from scratch. It is not there to invent something. It is not
there to create something out of nothing. It isn’t. It has to have something to
replace in order to be successful.
The second thing, when you’re looking at the 44-26, what you’re looking at is
projection. It’s a projected element which means that it needs to be
recognized, but it needs to be recognized for its capacity to improve something
or replace something. Just being recognized for its talent doesn’t matter,
doesn’t matter.
The Art of Transmitting a New Standard
And of course, this is one of the dilemmas for people who carry this energy is
that because it’s creative and because creativity is lumped together, these seven
different aspects of creativity lumped together, that this idea that their art
should be appreciated, or their creativity should be appreciated is something
that disturbs them. They can become quite bitter about that because their role
is to replace. Their role is not to be a great artist. It’s different. Their art is in
their capacity to be able to transmit to the community a new standard. And the
moment that they can replace something, that’s the moment that they’re
successful.
The moment that somebody gives up astrology and gets into Human Design,
someone with the 44-26 can be successful because that’s what it’s about.
That’s the real success. It’s always about replacing something. It’s always
about somebody coming in and saying, “I used to think that it was this way and
that way and that way, but now I’ve got this.” This is new and this is what’s so
impressive about this creativity.
216 Channels By Type
This channel’s got a funny name. This Channel of Surrender. I can’t tell you
how many times I’ve been asked by people, “What the hell does that mean?
Why is this the Channel of Surrender?”
Abstract Logic Praises, the Tribe Appreciates
In the community, the community is not interested in praising its own. It’s not.
It will appreciate its own. Praise is another story. Praise comes out of the
logical process. It comes out of the abstract process. It doesn’t come out of
the tribe. How many people who have tribal definition who always complain
about not being really appreciated. They are. But not in a way that’s
demonstrative because within the tribe it is expected of you, expected.
Tribal Creativity Surrenders its Ego to Have Impact on the
Tribe
The creativity in the 44-26 has to surrender its Ego, and it has to surrender its
Ego in order to have impact on the tribe. You see, without the surrender of
the Ego—appreciate my art—if you don’t surrender that, you can’t transmit.
You can’t transmit. See, the tribe doesn’t care about artists.
Take the local tribe to see an abstract exhibition somewhere. They’re not
interested in all that. They’re much more impressed by a beautiful billboard.
It’s functional—it’s functional. It has value to them. That’s real art for them.
That’s what the tribe loves.
You take in the materials that have been produced. As a tribe, you’re only
interested in the practical value of the material you’ve been given. In other
words, does the information allow you to replace what was there before? It is
secondary to note that it’s pretty. It’s secondary to note that it is beautifully
done. If you couldn’t make sense out of it, if you couldn’t use the material, it
wouldn’t make a damn difference whether it was beautiful or not. In other
words, that’s not the criteria. The criteria in the collective creativity, that
criteria demands the best. The criteria of the tribe demands effectiveness.
This is where we get graphic art. This is where the best propagandas are.
These are the manipulators of society. But it means that their primary
responsibility is the transmission itself. That’s the whole thing. In other words,
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222211117777
you can’t just replace something by saying its bad. That’s the collective’s job.
They’re the big critics. They say it’s good or it’s bad.
That is not what it’s about in the tribe. It isn’t about that. It’s only about ‘can I
get the message across. Can I get the tribe to recognize that what I’m telling
them about is better than what they have?’ That’s the whole story.
Ineffective Replacement of the Old Fails
44-26s who try to popularize things that do not effectively replace the old order
fail. And you have endless numbers of human beings that are occupied now in
the world doing nothing but tribal work. Trying to get people to give up the
old for something improved. And remember, it’s not so much ‘give up the old
for something new,’ it’s ‘give up the old for something that’s an improvement
over the old that’s going to be good for you.’ Remember that this is coming
out of the lymphatic system.
Creativity Rooted in the Fear of the Past in the 44
The mystery of this kind of creativity can be seen in the fear that’s rooted in the
44. See, the 44 is afraid of yesterday. This is the fear of the past. That fear of
the past keeps them attuned to things that did not, could not work. And so
what they’re trying to do is eliminate the failures of the past by improving on
something, but it’s not just the improvement. Remember that. They have to
be able to get to the tribe. And you can only get to the tribe by letting them
know that this is the best thing that they can do. Give up the old and take the
new. Give up your old refrigerator, this one’s more improved.
And you can see that the creativity in the 44-26 is really something quite unique
because of course they have to deal many times with very, very mundane
things, ugly useless products that somebody needs somewhere that they have to
be able to create an aura around that that says this is what you need to improve
your whatever, the new kind of garden hose or whatever the case may be.
And there are zillions of people who are employed in media agencies, and
advertising agencies who spend endless, endless hours trying to manipulate the
tribe into trying something that’s new and improved. And people spend
fortunes on that in order to be able to get that transmission out.
218 Channels By Type
Because it is tribal and it is part of the stream of instinct that runs from the 54,
there are a number of things to keep in mind about this creativity. It is
creativity as business and it can never be any other way. If a 44 or 26 cannot
make money from their improvements, they’re finished in life. They have to be
in business. It is a creative business orientation.
Tribal Art Only Works for a Business
What often happens is how many graphic artists experiment with trying to be
painters and it doesn’t work. They’re incredible at being able to illustrate or
design what can reach and touch the tribe but the moment they try to make
that personal art, the moment they try to turn that into collective art, it does
not work. It’s very different. It only works if it’s a business.
Reward A Child with the 44-26
Now if you’ve got a child that has the 44-26, pay them for their creativity. No
joke. Reward them for that creative work, so you say “We need to have a
mailbox. Design that mailbox for me. I’ll pay you for it,” whatever the case
may be. But the reality is that theirs is a
creativity that has to be directly rewarded
because if it’s not a business, it isn’t going to
work.
If you’re looking at the collective artist, the
collective artist can do without money as long
as their work is supported, somebody is ready to back them, to help them out.
That doesn’t mean they’re necessarily going to feed them. It’s not like you got
a job, it’s a kind of charity and one becomes dependent on it.
The individual creativity doesn’t want to have anything to do with anybody.
Just wants to be able to live out their own process and whether or not that
makes money for them is moot. But that’s not true in the tribe. Tribal
creativity works at its best when it’s highly rewarded, and the greater the
reward, the better the creativity. And the greater the reward, the better the
capacity to be able to trick the tribe. Now when I say trick, I don’t mean that
in a bad sense. I’m a 26 gate. I’m a trickster. It’s something to trick somebody
into taking in what they otherwise wouldn’t take in.

Imagine what a supermarket in America would look like if advertising was
illegal. How many products do you think will be there? Your selection is going
to be down to practically nothing. You have to create the interest. That’s the
gift of the tribal artist, to get people interested in products, services, whatever
the case may be. But that’s their gift to hook them. You see, all the other
creative aspects are waiting for somebody to see that they’re creative. They’re
waiting for it.
The 44-26 isn’t waiting for that. That’s not what they’re about. What they’re
about is trying to get other people hooked. That’s their gift, get them hooked.
And of course they need to know what to replace the old order with. That isn’t
necessarily their gift.
The Right Invitation Provides the Energy for Life
The 44-26, because it is a projected element, has to wait for the right invitation.
And like everything having to do with projected elements that the right
invitation in this case is not an invitation that comes every other day, but it is
the invitation that can be an invitation for life. Ultimately, all Projectors are
looking for that. They’re looking for the recognition that will allow them to
fulfill themselves based on that energy being provided for them for life. The
moment that the 44-26 can prove that it can hook people, it’s going to be
successful.
The 44-26 Child – The Mundane Creativity IN the World
What do you do with a 44-26 child? These children, not only do they have to
recognize that the gift they have is part of being in the world. This is one of
the great differences between the individual process of creativity which can be
outside of the world, and the tribal creativity which is very much in the world.
It is mundane. That’s its beauty. And it tells you something about human
beings. It tells you that they have to be hooked. Otherwise they don’t come.
I used to tell this story when I originally taught about the 44-26 how the 26
walks into a bar early in the evening and starts telling their friends about the
great day they had fishing. They say you know I caught a fish this big and just
as they’re doing that the 44 comes in to the bar and you can literally watch their
hands come closer together.
220 Channels By Type
This movement, it’s all about what is truly mundane, what is really here. You
see, the trick is not a delusion and the false trickster gets punished in the end
because that’s not what’s expected. The trick is simply to get their attention.
The trick is to be able to get them to grasp for just a moment that there’s
something that can be better for them. That’s the whole creativity.
The 44-26s Responsibility: Creating Wealth within the
Tribe
So it means that all of that operates in the world, and it means that the 44-26
has a responsibility, that in hooking people creates wealth. That’s what that’s
all about, wealth within the tribe. It’s the only thing the tribe is interested in.
The tribe needs to make sure that the community continues to thrive. That
there is a tax base for schools and police and all of these other things that are
part of community.
Now, of course, the economy becomes absolutely stagnant if there’s nothing
new and improved. Everybody buys a refrigerator in 1955, there’s nothing new
and improved. They still got the same old refrigerators. That means nobody is
spending money, certainly not on refrigerators, and the person that runs the
refrigerator store has long gone bankrupt because everybody stayed with their
refrigerators and nobody bought new ones.
Now it isn’t like those old refrigerators are bad, Y2K aside. It doesn’t mean
that they’re bad. As a matter of fact, those refrigerators can be operating
absolutely perfectly and have long ago paid for themselves and don’t need to be
replaced at all. This is where the tricky stuff comes in. Because the tribe says
“No, no, no, no, no, no, you can’t stay with that old refrigerator, you crazy?
That’s an old refrigerator. You need an improved refrigerator, and if you
don’t buy this improved refrigerator, my business is going under and I have
four employees. And where they shop, they’re going to have less money,” and
so forth and so forth and so on because the tribe is incestuous.
All the money is moving around within the tribe and it keeps it alive. So this is
the grease that turns the wheel. You know, endlessly, endlessly, endlessly. You
can see that there isn’t a single product in the world now that isn’t driven by
this law. Because if you don’t new and improve, you don’t continue to make
money, you don’t continue to sell products, you don’t continue to benefit the
society that you’re in; nothing, stagnate.

See, everything about the tribe is a self-fulfilling economic wheel. Everybody
feeding everybody else. And it means that the tribe, inherently, is geared
towards getting more and more and more sophisticated. Now it’s a slow
process with the tribe but the reality is that the more sophisticated the 44-26 is,
the greater potential there is to bring to the tribe new standards of whatever.
Whether that is refrigerators or that is their consciousness. So it is a totally
different kind of process.
Stagnation Can Happen so Quickly
The fear of the past is the fear of getting stuck in stagnation. The tribe can
stagnate so quickly. Its genetic pool can stagnate so quickly, and without this
revitalization, nothing happens. Surrender to the fact that new and improved is
a way of life. Surrender to that. You have no choice. This is what keeps
everything going. So now we have a new and improved Rave I’Ching. It’s not
like the old book is shit—you can still use it. But new and improved creates
things, creates energy, interest, and it is improved, handier.
The New and Improved is Stuck in Our Genes – Evolution
You can go through that whole 26 category of marketing advantages. You
don’t have to burn the old ones. But the fact is that even though you have the
old ones, suckers that you are, you buy new ones. New and improved. See and
he did it tricky bastard that he is. Next year when he brings out a 3D version,
you’ll buy that too because you want the new and improved because that’s the
game and we’re stuck in it. It’s our genes. It’s just all built into us.
The Competition for New and Improved Weapons
It’s not that we’re making that up. It’s not like we’re creating this ourselves.
It’s a by-product of our very existence. It’s a by-product of our life. New and
improved is everything. It’s actually evolution. It is this ongoing development.
It’s the 26th gate that creates new weapons of destruction. “I got a new and
improved bomb this week. It’ll kill eight zillion people in 30 seconds. Ain’t
that great? Let’s build a few. New and improved.”
We’ve been doing new and improved with weapons since we were banging
people on the head with rocks and then we put the rocks on the end of the
222 Channels By Type
stick and we fired it at them. And then that wasn’t good enough, you need
something new and improved. Do you know how many guns are available in
America that are new and improved? You got plastic ones that they can’t
detect in airports. New and improved. You got Teflon bullets, new and
improved. People buy them.
And it’s one of the things to recognize about the 26: Never forget its
destructive power. I am doing my very best in this life to destroy many things,
many things. Destroy them and replace them. That’s the power of the 26. It’s
also what makes them dangerous. They have a gift of being able to destroy and
that means that when you’re dealing with the tribe, destruction is directly
related to other tribes. “We’re going to be new and improved because they’re
not. Let me be a conquistador with a horse. Let me scare the hell out of these
Mayans. New and improved warrior.”
And the moment that you change the technology, the results are incredible. 85
soldiers conquer an empire, a couple of horses. New and improved. We’ve
been doing that ever since, and you see the tribe is the source of all our
weaponry. That’s where it is. This whole business about gun control that you
have in America, I love that wonderful bumper sticker that says “You can only
take my guns away from me if I’m dead,” that kind of stuff. That’s the tribe.
That’s the tribe and the tribe does not want to give up its weapons.
The funniest picture I have ever seen in my life, funniest picture, it happened
only a couple of years ago. It was in Albania and Albania had some kind of
civil war inside, they all went crazy and nuts. And there was this incredible
anarchy everywhere. I turned on CNN and there’s this picture of an Albanian
farmer with a tractor and behind the tractor he’s dragging a jet fighter that he’s
looted from an Air Force base. And here’s the little farmer and he’s got this
old MIG 11 or something towing it behind his tractor. And I thought what the
hell is he going to do with it? He’s going to bomb his neighbors? What is he
going to do with that?
New and improved. New and improved. “You got a gun? Come over here
and let me show you what I got in my garage. This is really improved.”
Incredible picture. It was like what the hell is he going to do with that? The
whole country was looted of goods, guns, arms, ammunition.
All of this is also in the 44-26. We need to have a neutron bomb. We need,
need is the keynote of the tribe, we need to have an anti-missile defense
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222222223333
mechanism. That’s the new improved weapon of our time ever since Reagan
and Star Wars and all that stuff. And you say you need it. When the tribe gets
tricked into needing something, boy does it cost money. Is it ever expensive.
You know what it costs to develop an anti-missile system? It’s beyond ones
imagination to imagine that much money for a new and improved weapon, but
you see this is the tribe and its deep fears. So at the same time that the tribe
and its creativity is a value to the tribe, that brings the tribe into more and more
sophisticated products and services, constantly refreshing them, constantly
bringing new resources into the cash boxes of the community, at the same time
it’s paranoid as hell.
The 44 says “I’m on alert. While I’m improving my tribe, I’m also going to
improve our defense system. Again, remember what I told you about the
immune system and its relationship here to the thymus gland. It’s not just
about being new and improved because that’s good for people. In effect, it is a
competition to be the best new and improved so that no other tribe can
challenge you and take away the very resources that you have and are enjoying.
Yeah, you see a modern business without a security system and a security
guard? It doesn’t exist.
The Tribe is Incredibly Violent
Hand in hand with tribal development comes tribal militarism—hand in hand.
It’s one of those jokes that if it weren’t for the Second World War, we would
still have a long way to go in medicine. After all, long way to go. We had
millions and millions of bodies to work on. Millions of organs to play with.
The reality is that the very militarism brings benefits as well. It brings benefits
in the way that we care for each other. It brings health benefits. War has
always been good for medicine, always.
That’s the 26 and its T cell saying, “Let’s go to war and see who’s really
immune and let’s get new and improved skills out of that.” Instant surgical
operating units on the battlefield so that we can fix up our wounded and make
them new and improved. And don’t tribes love their soldiers? These three
guys that are sitting over there in Yugoslavia and there’s all these yellow
ribbons around trees and everybody in that community is saying, “Why don’t
we nuke ‘em. Let’s just nuke ‘em.” The tribe is incredibly violent—it’s
incredibly violent.

If you don’t smell good, you’re in trouble with them. If you don’t look like
them, you’re in trouble with them. So this capacity for improvement, you’ll
have to see that it’s a double-edge sword. In the end, at the highest possible
level is the transmission of information to the tribe that is self-protecting, self-
protecting.
Out of the 26-44 you get all the medicine advertising, all the medical
advertising. By the way, they’re really hilarious now. I haven’t lived in North
America in 15 years. I’m having a lot of fun with medical ads on TV which
seem to be everywhere. They’re hilarious. I mean they’re really hilarious.
I love this one, it is a funny ad. This is for bald guys and it says, “I’ll take this
and blah, blah, blah and you’re going to grow wads of hair on your head. New
and improved wads of hair,” which of course is going to make you much more
successful in life and blah, blah, blah and all of that stuff. And then comes, I
love this stuff, then comes the disclaimers at the end. Pregnant women should
never touch the package. Can you imagine? “Never touch the package, it’s
going to kill you.” New and improved, eh. Wonderful stuff.
It’s why you have such an incredible fetish here in America with products.
Because you’ve got some of the most affluent transmitters in the world who are
constantly being financed to get you into stuff—constantly. There are also
enormous collapses in that, I guess the best one was Coca-Cola who tried to
introduce a new Coca-Cola and it crashed. It’s very rare that that happens. It
just crashed. And then they had to bring out an old new version. What do
they call it—Classic? “Have a new classic.” Yeah, because it’s a formula.
You watch any product that you have, it doesn’t matter what it is, you watch
any product that you have and you will see that it’s on a consistent program of
improvement. You have a new basic training. This is an ongoing business of
the 44-26. Keep on keeping people stimulated and involved is what they’re all
about.
The nature of the violence inherent in the 26. The 26 is able, more than any
other gate, will go to war. The 26 is the great jingoist and the 26 goes to war
for only one reason. Either their resources are being threatened or they covet
their neighbor’s ass. And they want their resources because they think that will
be an improvement.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222222225555
A Child with Only the 26
If you have a child that has the 26 gate by itself, you have to recognize this
inherent capacity to be violent. Not only to be violent but to want to improve
on it. The best thing to do with 26s, like what my father did, he put me into
boxing for ten years. New and improved. Keep on working at it. Get the
violence out, get the aggression out. And it’s essential to understand that 26s
need that outlet and need to grow in that.
When the 44-26 is there complete as a definition it is different, but what it does
represent is that the 26 is ready to fight for its right to transmit what’s new and
improved. In other words, they will really go to war to get something out. Do
you have a war on drugs in this country? It’s the same kind of thing. They will
literally take that violent analogy to its extreme. “I will improve them or die or
I will improve them and kill them improving them.”
The Ego, the 26th gate is the gate of the Egoist. “I know, I am right.” This
strong powerful I in the Ego. Many people confuse the 51 and the 26. This
idea that the 51 is brave and courageous, but the 51 is not violent. The 26 is.
It’s inherent in its nature. And it’s important to understand that’s not
moralistic. That is, the fact of the matter that there is violence in the 26 is the
power of the T cell. Every 26 carries this unbelievable warrior within them that
is ready to eat you alive if it must.
And so this creative energy is more aggressive than any creative energy we
know. If you are a painter, a logical painter, you’re never going to go
hammering after your audience. You wouldn’t do that. You’d feel terrible.
We’d all feel kind of funny. You’re even embarrassed that other people want
to put up all kinds of pictures of you and put you in magazines and all that
stuff.
The 44-26s Type Makes a Difference
But the 44-26 is going to go there and is going to fight tooth and nail along the
line to get their thing out. That’s their power. Now obviously it’s going to
make a difference according to their Type. If you’re a 44-26 and that is
something that either generates or manifests, it’s going to be very different than
if it’s a pure projection. In other words, that the aggression is going to be seen
in the 44-26 that gets to the Throat. There you’re going to see the capacity to
be able to manifest that energy. Get it out. .
226 Channels By Type
Material Righteousness
Or the quick and sometimes violent response of the generating 44-26,
particularly if it goes through the 50-27, because the 50th gate is the gate of the
law. The righteousness. There is nothing more righteous than a 44-26. It’s
righteousness that guides them. It’s the opposite of the 40-37 in which one is
looking for spiritual righteousness. This is material righteousness. This is the
re-improvement that is necessary. This is what we need. This is what’s going
to make a difference.
I’m astonished at how many things the American public is told that they
absolutely must have and how aggressively that is put in their face. Hour after
hour after hour after hour pumping that in front of them and pushing that in
their face. And it’s one of the major differences because this is associated with
our commercial material interest, because the 44-26 only succeeds as a business
they’re very aggressive in their work. That’s their success. Always racing away
from the failures of the past and moving towards the promise of the future.
And there’s always a promise in what they offer.
It’s one thing to see an ad that says new and improved, it’s another thing to get
the product and try it out. Their job is to get you to the door to buy the
product and one of the greatest dilemmas for 44-26s is that they put a great
deal of their creative energy and their talent into products that don’t stand up
to scrutiny. That becomes a very, very bitter thing for them and out of that
comes their violent reaction to why it did not work.
They’re very good at just slamming things around just out of that bitterness
that nobody recognizes that new and improved is what it’s all about. “Why stay
with that old thing. How dumb you are to stay with that old thing. You
bloody stupid fool staying with that old refrigerator when you can have this
brand new one.”
The Gift of a True Transmitter
It’s so funny how many people in the tribe get talked into all these new things
that they can’t even operate. It’s hilarious. They get all of these things and
they just don’t know how they work. That’s the whole thing about the gift of a
true transmitter. It’s not only the aggressive power to be able to place the new
and improved in front of the audience, but the integrity that what they’re
seducing the tribe into works; works and has value and is essential. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222222227777
This is one of the keys. You have an awful lot of transmission that goes on for
things that really aren’t of any real value. And out of that just comes the
natural bitterness that can come to any kind of projected channel.
Stream of Instinct
This stream that runs from the 54, this stream is all about instinct. This is the
stream of instinct. And what the 44-26 is going to be transmitting, what they
will be aggressive about, what they will in fact work
at replacing is all going to be conditioned by the
Spleen and nothing else.
In other words, if that 44-26 is living out their
Type, again this is the essential ingredient, if they’re
living out their Type then what comes out of that is
a profound capacity because that’s what it’s all
about. If they live out their Type they are going
then to be able to transmit. But by living out their Type, they open themselves
up to the mechanism that makes it work. That is a splenic mechanism. Now
obviously we can have other situations in which the authority can change. In
other words, we can have Solar Plex authority which automatically would be
the main authority.
The 44-26 with Solar Plex Authority
But think about the situation where somebody has a defined Spleen to the Ego,
the 44-26, and at the same time they may have, let’s say the Channel of
Intimacy the 59-6. Now the fact that their
authority is, they are an emotional
Generator.
The moment we have a defined Sacral
generating capacity, the moment we have
a defined Solar Plex Center that’s the
authority. But if that person is truly living
out their Type, if they’re waiting for somebody to come to them, that projected
element, the 44-26, that splenic system will respond in the moment
spontaneously to any approach by anybody else.
228 Channels By Type
And because of genetic continuity, it will be part of the information that will be
used as an authority through the Solar Plex system, but it’s always a matter of
waiting for that Spleen to give you the instinctive ‘go ahead.’ Because
remember it’s about health.
Splenic Authority: It is Healthy to Do or Not
Whenever there is Splenic authority, that authority is only saying ‘this is healthy
to do’ or ‘this is not healthy to do’. That’s all it’s ever saying. So the moment
there is a possibility to be creative in the replacement of something, it’s a key
then. It’s a key to be able to recognize whether it’s healthy to do or not.
You see, any product that brings people something that they really value makes
them feel good. Let’s not forget the feel good. It’s really important. Last year
I got a new, improved computer. I really appreciated it. That was lovely. Now
my other computer before that can do the same stuff, sort of, it was just kind
of slow and cranky. Then one really appreciates it and it makes one feel good.
We love to get new and improved stuff that works. It makes us feel good.
That’s the power of this tribal creativity. It’s there to make you feel good.
Tribal Creativity: Status
Status. We saw clearly that creativity at the individual level is about style.
Creativity at the tribal level is about status. You don’t want to be the last one
on the block to have a Mercedes, do you? It’s about status. It’s about
transmitting to the tribe that they’re going to stand a head taller if they use this
product because that’s a status product because everybody knows it’s terrific.
“You have one of those? Wow.” The tribe loves that stuff. The tribe invented
the class system. This is what the tribe did.
The Class System
This was the by-product of tribalism as the class system. So if you want to see
the most racist societies on Earth, you go to India you go to Japan, and you see
this vast class system within the tribe.
So the tribe naturally is driven by status and that status that they’re driven by is
used by the creative tribal exponents, to get them up to that level to turn them
on and say: “Listen, you can be, you can have.” And we do our very, very best
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222222229999
all of us to have our status objects. The success of the tribe. It’s not enough to
just have this generic product that’s kind of for the other side of the tracks. “I
want to have that label stuck right on my butt so that everybody can see that
Calvin and I are friends. Don’t I have status?” This is how they sell us.
44-26 Children Need to See How Class Operates
So it’s one of those things to see in the development of children that have this
kind of potential in them that they really need to see how class operates. They
need to see these various strata within the society in order to be able to see how
to get people interested in moving from this to that and what makes the
difference; what is the difference in class. That goes on all the time. So the
tribe motivates us that way. It’s one of the ways that they really sell their
products.
That’s why at a certain point the more expensive something is, the more status
it has. It’s not enough to just get a pair of denim. You’ve got to get some
designer jeans that are going to cost you $600. And I mean they fade and rip
just like the others. It’s the same stuff.
Years ago, because my family was in the clothing business, I had to go out and
take a look at a factory and it was a factory that was making jeans. And they all
looked the same to me until I noticed that they all had different labels. It was
really funny. It was the same damn jeans. Yeah, there’s this extra little stitch
on this pocket and there might be a little star on that pocket. But, it was the
same workers in the same factory. And they’re making jeans and some of those
jeans are going out and they’re going to sell for $10 and some are going to sell
for $100. It’s exactly the same jeans but one of them has status.
And of course status is an illusion created by the 44-26. They create that
illusion by putting the sexiest, most incredible people into their jeans and put
them in front of you in ads and tell you “You too can be as beautiful as this.”
New and improved. “We’re going to sell you.”
How many hair colors are available on the market? This changing of your
status to rise up in class. Now you’re all in the same game except the status
here is now intellectual and spiritual. “I do Human Design. Yeah, I know
more than you do.” Status is in everything. It’s in everything and that’s the
way that the tribe works. Otherwise, there’s no place to go.

Remember that the tribe begins with the 54. It begins with the marrying
maiden. The concubine that wants to become empress. “Recognize me, let me
climb the ladder, let me get all the way up to the top.” Everything about the
tribe is that way.
So not only is the gift of the 44-26 to replace, and by replacing keep the
economy going because that’s essential in their work is to keep all of that going,
but at the same time they create our class structure. They ingrain it in us so
that there are places for us to get to, that we can climb that ladder. And all
along the way there’s somebody offering us product or service that’ll help us
rise up in class.
I fly in a lot of airplanes and you know there are some hilarious, hilarious
magazines. And these airplane magazines are the best because they always have
motivational sections in them where they sell motivational products. And I
love these motivational products. They’re hilarious. Why anybody would buy
that, I don’t know.
You get a huge picture of some dolphin breaking water and it’s some kind of
catch phrase like, ‘you too can whatever.’ I don’t know. Hours and hours,—
my favorite one is, you can be a cultured person in 24 hours. It blows my
mind. It blows my mind.
All the great books of the world synthesized into four-page units. “Read
Dostoyevsky in four pages. Learn the essence of relativity in four pages.” You
get the whole thing. Not only that, but along with that they give you a glossary
of sophisticated language to use in certain situations, like tourists get
guidebooks where it says ‘where is the toilet’ and you can do that in like five or
six languages.
This is how to say something so somebody assumes that you’re in a higher class
than you actually are. It’s incredible. People buy it. They buy it tape after tape
after tape after tape. 24 hours later, they’re cultured. After all, that’s what
they’ve been told. You see, the tribe loves that. That’s what the tribe wants.
Everybody in the tribe dreams of being king and queen, because it’s in the
tribe. Everybody in the tribe dreams of being king and queen, everybody.
And everything about being a tribal person is being conditioned that there is a
way for you to get there even if you have to kill. .

Kind Hearts and Coronets
Did you ever see that wonderful Alex Guinness movie “Kind Hearts and
Coronets”? This is a great film from the 50s in which he plays 14 or 15
different characters, and he’s 15th in line to the throne of England. And he
decides he’s going to kill everybody in his way so that he can be the king. And
it’s hilariously funny as he goes about figuring out ways to kill all these people
who were in line. This is the tribe. You can see that in the business of families
at the core of the tribe where who gets what.
And, if you have siblings and your parents drop dead, look out. “No, that’s for
me. That’s not for you, that’s for me. They never would have given that to
you” and so forth and so on. You know the claims of the tribe, the rising up in
class of the tribe. Never forget these things and never forget who brings us
that.

The 59-6: Reproductive Creativity
It’s Not like Painting a Picture
I saved sex for last. Good way to finish the afternoon. I hope I arouse all of
you with my prurient
approach. Tribal creativity is
what keeps us all going.
We’ve already seen that the
creativity inherent in the 44-
26 is driving us to continue
our improving business and
keep us deeply connected to
each other financially and materially and all the things that comes with it, the
establishment of class and all of these things.
But when you get to the 59-6, the last of our seven creative channels, you get to
a creativity that is inherently reproductive. It’s the real thing. It’s about as
creative as you can possibly imagine. There is truly nothing more creative than
that. It is the capacity to create life itself.
And of course the whole thing about the tribe is that it can never really claim to
be the artist. Remember that. Tribal creativity is not about that. Only an
individual like me will turn to their kids and say, “You got great genes from
me.” I tell that to Sarah all the time. “You got all these great genes from me.”
The tribe does not operate in that way, in other words, it’s not about,—and the
dilemma in the reproduction of children is the possessiveness that comes with
it. “I created this being, it’s mine, and I’m going to do what I like with it ‘cause
it’s mine. I made it.” Well, it’s not like painting a picture.
The Most Complex of All Creative Channels
The 59-6 is the most complex of all the creative channels because of its very
structure. You’re dealing with emotional generation. I made the comment
yesterday about how many women will say, “Why did I have children with that
man?” And it’s one of the most common things that I meet is that kind of
statement.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222233333333
Nothing Dumber Than the 59-6
There is nothing dumber than the 59-6. Nothing blinder; it’s only creative as in
terms of its results. It creates life, but that’s a biological, physical game. And
we’re designed to do that. There isn’t anybody who doesn’t come into this
world that has a capacity to be creative at this level. It’s there for all of us. You
don’t need a degree to make love. You don’t need to have all of that backing
and you don’t need to have all that talent and so forth and so on.
Sex is sex and it starts all on its own. It gets you going. The hormones pop up
and there you go. So it’s not like you can say, “Hey you know, I’m really
creative.” Second thing. The joke I didn’t tell you is even funnier.
The 59: Sexual Strategy
First of all, the emotional system. Look at what you’re dealing with when
you’re dealing with the Sacral and the emotional system. You’re dealing with
the two cores of our sexuality. The Sacral system releases the genetic code for
sexual mating; in other words, sexual strategy. We’ve looked at that in the
sexuality course that we did, the first part when we looked at the fact that each
of those six lines of the 59 represent a different kind of strategy. (Ed. Note: The
Sexual Strategy Roles/Lines are discussed in the Manifesting and Generating Channels
Book.)
Line Themes of Gate 59
Beginning with the first line that’s the caveman or the cavewoman, you go out
there, whack ‘em over the head, drag them home. And the second line is
about shyness; you have to have the other come to you and break down your
barrier. And the third line is kind of anarchistic; you get in and get out. And
the fourth line is that you can only make love to them if they’re a friend. And
the fifth line is you’ve got to seduce them, or seduce them into seducing you.
And the sixth line is ‘fuck like hell and give up early.’ And then sit on the
fence and watch everybody else. So we have these strategies that are inherent
in the 59th gate in these six lines. These are the sexual strategies.
234 Channels By Type
The Sacral is Sexual, The Solar Plex is Sexy
On the other side, you have the 6th gate and the emotional system and that’s
where the sexy part is. A sexual strategy is never sexy by itself. When you
meet somebody and they have a defined Sacral and they don’t have a defined
emotional system, you’re not going to find them sexy; they may be sexual. But
they’re not sexy. Sexy comes out of the
emotional system. Sexy is where the
pleasure wave is. And this is the wave that
you get to pick up.
But sexual is right there in the Sacral
Center. ‘Sexual’ meaning that built into us
is a genetic system that says we must
reproduce, whether we do or we don’t. It is a genetic imperative. If everybody
stops having children, human beings are finished. So it’s a fundamental
imperative in us.
My whole thing about people entering into things correctly,—I have a deep
concern about children. I have had that most of my life. The fact of the
matter is that our sexual bonding is so chaotic that the by-product is that
children come into the world in which they are not properly loved or
nourished. Can’t be, because of the tensions that exist between the very people
that brought them into the world, and those tensions exist because those
people were not clear in entering into their relationship. Not clear. There is
nothing dumber than reproductive sexuality.
Oh, it’s beautiful creatively. I’ve watched my children come into the world.
It’s really incredible. I think that’s one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever
witnessed. It wasn’t as if I was patting myself on the back and saying, “Boy,
that’s a good one, you did well this time.” Just the creative experience to see
life come into the world and to recognize that it is a part of us. Oh, that’s very
nice.
Nothing is More Important: Enter into a Relationship
Correctly
But the way the 59-6 operates is so dumb. That even though bringing life into
the world is beautiful because it keeps the specie going, the sexual relationships
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222233335555
derived out of the sexual bonding are disasters. And of course, there is nothing
more distorting than that.
How many people in my generation have had broken families who have created
broken families, who have left children, who end up with all kinds of complex
family situations and structures, all of which is out of the nature of how they
entered into the relationship in the first place. Nothing is more important for
you as a human being to be able to enter correctly into a relationship with the
other; nothing more important. Everything begins with the correctness of that
entry.
Reproduction is about Playing Hard to Get – Not Today
If you are somebody that has the 59-6, you are an emotional Generator. And
the 59-6 standing there by itself alone—I love simplicity. I love the joke and
the irony of simplicity. The 59-6 is an emotional Generator by itself. The
strategy of an emotional Generator is to play hard to get.
Anytime I meet an emotional Generator, I always tell them the same thing
because that’s the way it works mechanically. “You are a Generator, so you
need to respond, which means that you need somebody else to do the
initiating. But in the moment that you respond, ‘I’d love to make love to you,’
and the more you respond, ‘hmm’ is also the moment you have to say, ‘But not
today.’”
How many emotional Generators are capable of that? It's hilarious; they are
not, not unless they have somebody who knows what they are like, not possible
for them. Now look, if they wait, they go, “Hmm, it would be very nice but
not today. Call me tomorrow. Call me the next day.” The next time they
come in and say, “I’d love to make love to you. Is that okay?” “You want to
make love?” and they go, “Um huh.” Then it's okay.
But think about the joke. Reproduction is about playing hard to get. I will say
it again, so the light bulbs go off. Reproduction is about playing hard to get;
it's written in the mechanics law. Nobody plays hard to get in that game,
nobody. The moment you have the Sacral system connected to the emotional
system, boy, you’re ready. And anybody that steps into that aura, boy, are they
ready.

Its Dynamic Level is at Ages 14 to 25
And how difficult it is because most of this is taking place at its dynamic level
between the age of 14 and 25. This is when all that’s taking place. This is
when people jump blindly. Don’t play hard to get, jump blindly, on the blind
energy of the emotional system, and then they end up for the next 20 years
raising children and saying, “I don’t why I had kids with this one.” This
doesn’t work.
What Pair Bonding IS For
By the time you are at a point where it is your age, you have already gone
through all that stuff, you’ve already been caught up in that. I was caught up in
that. I know how that works. You jump blindly into the energy. The by-
product of that is a life that has a right to be nourished, protected, educated,
loved, and has the right to have two role models in its life. It's not about
monogamy. It’s about the binary reality. It’s about what pair bonding is for.
The Distorted Nourishing Environment
Without that first seven years of being able to see clearly the yin and the yang,
the yin and the yang of which you are a part of, there is no healthy
development, because it's an essential ingredient. And yet, at the same time,
millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of children don’t have that
advantage. They just don’t. And even in those societies where the
relationships cannot end, the pain and the anger and the frustration and all of
the stuff that’s there in the relationship distorts the nourishing environment.
It's gone.
This is the defense circuit, and the defense circuit says two things. On the 59-6
side, it says, “We must reproduce in order to keep this specie alive.” And the
other side, the 50-27 preservation says very clearly, “Once they are in the
world, we must care for them for seven years minimum, must nurture them,
provide for them, educate them, give them the necessary foundation to be
good citizens so they, too, can grow up to make more and nourish those
more,” on and on and on.

The 59 and 6 Transits Bring Divorce Conditioning
Every 250 years, we have a cycle of Pluto that brings disruption into
relationships. So, ever since the Second World War, we have had Pluto transits
to the 59 and to the 6 in Virgo, that whole Pluto and Virgo generation, in
which the standard of relationships has been turned upside down because it
brings nothing but divorce. And we also had in our era both Neptune and
Uranus passing through Virgo. So we have a vast number of human beings
that have been conditioned from birth to get divorced. It’s there, designed to
break relationships, designed to walk away from them.
The Genetic Advantage
Now, some of that has genetic advantages. The genetic advantage is that
you’re white, you have a love affair with a black, and you get a brown—the
genetic advantage. You spread the gene pool; you open up all kinds of
possibilities. But you see, these generations now that have been coming into
the world since the mid-70s, very different. They don't want to be as messed
up as their parents. They don’t want to have lousy relationships that break
down. They don’t want to get divorced. This is the reaction to all of that.
They want stable relationships. They want a real family. They want all that
stuff.
The Secret to Love and Sex
The only way they’re going to get it, and the only way they’re going to get it in a
way that feels good for them, is when they honor what that channel says, “You
can never ever, ever make love to somebody unless you’ve played hard to get
first,” which means you take your time. You don’t jump; there is no reason to
jump. The moment that you jump into things, you lose all perspective; it's
gone. I am undefined emotionally. I jump into an emotional wave, I know you
can drown in there, I know that. I’m going to make sure I can swim. I’m
going to take my time.
This is the secret to love; it's the secret to sex. You can screw like rabbits, but
wait till you get there. Take your time going in. If you take your time going in,
you’re always going to see the warning signs along the way. Those things that
can say to you, “Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,
maybe not this time, ok.” It might not work. It gives you the chance. You
see, it's different for us. When we looked at the collective abstract, we saw that
238 Channels By Type
the collective abstract is really very much about just sex, and sex is not
reproductive; it's just about sex. It’s just about pleasure.
But the moment that you’re dealing with the 59-6, the 59-6 is always saying
that the by-product of this sexuality can be a life. That’s the criteria. The by-
product of this sexuality can be a life, and that life has to be looked after. How
many deadbeat fathers are there? It's endless. How many people don’t
support, don’t care, walk away, all this stuff that’s part of our time? It's
absolutely essential to see that if you don’t enter into a relationship correctly
that can be a reproductive relationship, it's only going to end up in bitterness or
anger or frustration, and the whole purpose is turned upside down.
These children do not get a chance to be properly nurtured. So this business
about playing hard to get, this is an essential ingredient in love, essential. And
it's not just because you’re a Generator or you’re a man of,—it doesn’t matter
what your Type is. The Type matters in terms of how you enter into that
relationship. But even if you enter into it correctly, don’t be in such a hurry.
You don’t have to be.
Passion Grows from Non-consummation
As an individual, I understand the nature of passion, and passion is something
that doesn’t exist if you consummate right away; it doesn’t. It doesn’t work
that way. Passion grows from non-consummation, that’s what passion is all
about. Passion becomes overwhelming through non-consummation. That’s
its beauty. And the same is true for desire. How much sweeter the fulfillment
of the desire when one is clear entering into the experience. It's just about a
time mechanism. This is the essential nature of emotional authority.
Emotional authority says, “Things take time for clarity to emerge.”
Fool for Love without Self Love
Human beings, they don’t love themselves, so they’re fools for love because
they don’t love themselves. And the moment it seems that somebody is
attracted to them, and it's possible to have a relationship, because they do not
love themselves, they are ready to jump blindly into the hope of love, blindly.
Even while they are going in knowing that it isn't going to work, they will
blindly leap in because they do not love themselves, and anybody that gives
them the impression that they can love them, wow, it's like whoooah. .
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222233339999
Remember, everything about the tribe is about tricks. It’s such a trick to say to
somebody, “I love you.” Oh, that’s a trick; they don’t love themselves. It's
very impressive to people, “You love me?” What did Ms. Piggy say? “Really?
You love me? Is that possible? You love me? I’ve never loved me; I never
found anything in me that was lovable. You love me? You can do anything to
me. Go ahead.”
Recognize Who You Are
Human beings, funny creatures. They don’t love themselves, so they jump at
anything that smells like love. And of course, the by-product of that can be
children, and those children end up in environments that are absolutely
unhealthy for them. They have to get really lucky, you start off that way. See,
everything about what it is for us to live with the other is about the inherent
honesty of recognizing who we are, what we are, and how we work.
When you look at somebody and you see their nature, and you see their design,
you can see clearly the rules for them, the way that the game works, what their
strategy is, what your own strategy is, what it means for the two of you to live
out your Type. Those things take time to clarify.
Think about what it's like to be an emotional person. You’re an emotional
person, you’re always going up and down on your wave; you fool people all the
time both ways. You make them feel wonderful because you can take them up;
you make them feel horrible because you can take them down. Recognize that.
And that’s where the sexiness is and the pleasure is. If you’re not honest with
your perspective lover about the nature of what you are, you end up with a
horror story. How many emotional people attract the other, get into a
relationship with them only to go down in their wave and be punished for it?
You see, suddenly, they thought they were loved, they go down in their wave,
and they recognize they are being hated; devastating. And they thought they
had a really good relationship. It’s all illusion.
Because the emotional system, the sexual system, the pleasure system is in the
Solar Plex Center, and because it's operating in that wave, how easy it is for the
perspective to be distorted. It's incredibly easy. So if you’re emotional, and
you have somebody that wants to make love to you, you can always say to
them, “You want to make love to me because I’m in a good mood.” It’ll blow
their mind. .
240 Channels By Type
“I’m making you feel good right now. You want me to make you feel real bad?
Because I can, and I will because I’m emotional, and it's not my fault. And if
you just like me now when I am up, I don’t want to have anything to do with
you because you’ve got to like me when I am down. And I have to be able to
tolerate you when I am down.”
“And so before I jump into bed with you, I’m going to wait. I’m going to see
what kind of a being you are in relationship to me. And it's not because I’m
not interested in you, I am, otherwise I wouldn’t tell you all this. I’m telling
you this so you know what kind of a being I am. I’ve already suffered enough
from people who jump on my wave and think I’m like that every day of my life,
only to have them turn against me and blame me.”
People with defined emotional systems get blamed a lot. It's about honesty in a
relationship, in any kind of relationship. This Sacral to the emotional system is
absolutely clear in what it says: play hard to get. It simply means that you
cannot jump the first time, and it means that you have to have the integrity to
be able to explain yourself to someone, to be able to tell them how you work.
Clarity Eliminates the Mess
When all of that is laid out beforehand, it is so easy to have a clean relationship;
clean. We’ve got this illusion that sex is dirty. Now, I know how that’s
commonly used, but I want to use that in a different context. It's a mess if you
are not clear. It’s just a mess, and clarity eliminates that mess. It's the same
thing of a genetic strategy.
If you’ve got a genetic strategy of the second line, of shyness, where your
sexual strategy is that the other person has to break down your barrier. Well,
you’ve got to make them work at it, and you’ve got to tell them that’s the way
you are, “You want something from me, come and get it, come and ask for it,
knock on my door. I’m not going to offer it to you. You don’t get anything
like that from me because that’s not the way I am. I’m a second line strategy.
You’ve got to call on me.”
The Right Tools for Honesty
You see, we don’t know how to be honest in our relationships because we’ve
never had the right tools. Our attempts at being honest have been the attempts
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222244441111
of the not-self, to be honest, which is a joke all in itself. What this knowledge
does for us is provide us with opportunities for true clarity and honesty in our
relationships, and you can't get that honesty and clarity out after
consummation. It doesn’t work. You’ve got to get it out before
consummation, so that everybody knows what they are dealing with.
It is astonishing to discover how different that kind of relationship can be. It's
not blinded; it's not driven simply by the sexuality. It is based on a mutual
understanding and respect, otherwise, what are relationships good for if they
don’t have that as the basis. I’ve made love to hundreds of women that I never
even knew—no respect for all of that. From the time that I got involved with
Human Design, my relationship with the other changed radically. It wasn’t just
this blind tumbling. With my totally undefined Sacral and undefined emotions,
it was very easy for me when I was unaware to simply fall into these things,
only to wake up the next day and just walk away because it wasn’t for me. It
wasn’t real. It wasn’t honest. It was just the energy of the moment.
So we had a whole generation running around like that. You see, honesty
comes before you jump. There is no other way, none. It will never work any
other way. If you’re somebody that is purely abstract, and sex is just something
that is essential as an ingredient, then you’re going to jump into things. And it's
actually not so bad as long as you entered into it clearly. You wait for your
emotional wave, for the clarity, because it's not personal. But the 59-6, oh,
that’s personal. This is the tribe; this is intimacy.
Intimacy Has a Limited Timeframe
I can remember the horror in my tribal family. I was the first child in my
extended family to get divorced—whoa, heavy business. It's not about telling
people that when they mate with somebody that they mate for life, and this is
the only way and that you cannot get separated from them and so forth and so
on. It's about recognizing that if you enter into relationships correctly, they
have their perfect time span. This is very important to understand. Intimacy
has a timeframe connected to it. If you enter intimacy correctly, you will get
the benefits of it, the beauty of it, but it's on a timeframe. It doesn’t mean it's
going to last forever.
242 Channels By Type
Not all reproductive sexuality is meant to be monogamous; it isn't. And there
is nothing wrong with the ending of a relationship that was entered into
correctly. This is very important to understand. It's not about saying, “If you
enter into correctly, you never have to leave.” It's not true. Mutation is a part
of our lives, and there are so many couples that are perfect for each other when
they’re young, and who, by the time they’re near their midlife, discover that
they’re not at all. And it's not because there is something wrong with either
one of them. It’s because there is a natural timing mechanism to intimacy,
natural.
It’s Just Geometry
That’s my joke about love, that if you wake up in the morning, and you see
somebody there, it must be love. This is geometry. And if you keep seeing
that face every day, it must be love. That’s geometry. And then one day, they
are not there anymore. The love is over. This whole business about writing
love songs, love poetry, all of this stuff, it's because the one thing that we’ve
never, ever, ever been able to accept about the nature of love and sexuality is
that the timeframes are limited, that the timings are limited, that we do not
know why we enter into a relationship with somebody, and we do not know
why we go out.
How many of you have had love affairs that suddenly just end? For no
perceptible reason, other than you can make one up; geometries come to an
end. It's like walking into a room and seeing somebody, and your eyes go
bubble, bubble, geometry. It's just geometry. We’re not in charge of how long
we’re with somebody.
What is essential for us is to recognize that we must enter into our bonds with
others with clarity on the remote chance that somebody is going to get
pregnant. Because if you’ve entered into it correctly, if you are clear to each
other about your nature, the chances of being able to nurture that child are
much, much, much greater. And of course, the natural benefit derived from
that.
The Hippies Children are Very Insecure
The children of the hippie generation, they’re very insecure. And if you go
back 100 years, you’ll find that none of those kids were basically insecure. They
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222244443333
had powerful support systems, grandmas and grandpas living in the same
house, all kinds of siblings, local communities that stayed the same, everybody,
your brother had the same teacher that you had and your sister and your cousin
and your uncle and your father and your grandfather.
Children of the hippie generation don’t have that. They don’t have that natural
sense of security, and that natural sense of security translates into their love
relationships. Their assumption is that the relationships are inherently unstable.
How many kids of that generation have heard their parents howl, smack,
scream? You name it. So this whole business about being honest in entering
into relationships is an essential knowledge.
What Pubescent Children Need to Understand
Now look, this is where Human Design for young people is absolutely
essential. The moment you have a child in your life or somebody that you
know in your life who reaches sexual maturity, who reaches puberty, they have
to understand this. It’s essential for them, so that they can learn in their life
how to have proper relationships and not end up getting messed up.
It's not about keeping them virgins; it's not about any of this stuff. It’s about
them understanding what the basis of love has to be, which is time in before
you jump. You have to be able to feel the other person out; you have to be
clear about your nature and their nature, so that you can see that whether or
not it's going to be the best relationship you ever had, at least it's going to be a
viable relationship, that it's not going to be frivolous and painful. And the tribe
does not make love idly.
The Tribal Sexual Bargain
It's not like being collective. The tribe is designed to make love as part of its
bargain. The bargain is, “We are together. We’re here to produce children, so
let's make a couple of them. And then after we’ve made a couple of them, let's
masturbate each other for the rest of our lives.”
They have all these sexual bargains because it's all part of a bargain. And we’re
only going to have one child because that’s all we can afford, or we’re only
going to have two or whatever the case may be. There are all of these bargains.
And when I deal with people that have the 40-37, and I talk to them about
244 Channels By Type
their relationships, a wonderful encounter. Men are basically very dumb, so I
rarely get men as a percentage as clients, say there’re about 25% of the people I
meet.
And every once in a while, one of these dumb men gets hustled into my
presence, and I blow their minds because they are the best ones for me. They
are the ones I have the most fun with is the dumb males, the guys like me who
never would have paid any attention to any of this stuff. And I drag them in
there, and I hammer them. And I had this guy who came in on one of these
circumstances, and he came because he was really concerned about his
relationship. And somebody had told him that I could really help him and
blah, blah, blah and all the stuff.
And he tried desperately to get out of it once he had made the appointment.
Twice he tried to cancel and all this kind of stuff, until finally, he got in there.
And of course, by the time I was finished with him, he was like, “You’ve got to
do my wife, my dog, my cat.” But he has the 40-37, and he says to me, “What
do I do?” I said, “Have a prenuptial agreement, the tribe.”
Everybody Should Have an Honest Pre-Nuptial Agreement
Everything about the 40-37, which is the Channel of Community, and sexually
the bridge and the groom, all of that is about the inherent bargain that exists in
the tribe. And that bargain is that when I say prenuptial agreement, I don’t care
about the legality. I’m not talking about that; I’m not talking about the formal
prenuptial. What I’m talking about is that every relationship should have a
prenuptial agreement. That agreement is an agreement based on the honesty of
revealing who you are to the other. Now before you make the commitment,
the agreement is there, because otherwise, you’re always trying to change the
rules as you go along, and it's a disaster.
Loyalty in a Tribal Relationship is Important
There is something else. There is only one thing that’s important in a tribal
relationship, loyalty. Just about every relationship that you can imagine
breaking up has a theme of broken loyalties in it, unfairness in it. Now you see,
you can be loyal and promiscuous at the same time as long as you reveal that in
the beginning.
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222244445555
“You’re never going to be able to completely hold my attention. If you can
accept that, we can have a great relationship, otherwise forget it.” You can't say
that afterwards when they catch you in bed with their best friend. They flip
out, “You’re unloyal; you’re not fair; deal is over; game is over; I’m finished; I
walk.” You see, the moment that you understand how the tribe really operates,
you have to see that the reproductive love, the bonding with the other, the
form, family, home, whatever it may be, you’ve got to have the agreement there
in the beginning before you get in.
Then when your partner breaks the agreement, you can point the finger at
them tribally and say to them, “You broke the agreement. You’re not being
fair; you’re the one,” and then they can deal with it. But if the partner goes
ahead and breaks an unwritten law, you have all kinds of problems in trying to
correct that. You can’t say to them, “But look, you agreed coming in that you
were going to do the garbage, and I was going to do the dishes. You can't
change that now. This was our agreement coming in. This is the way that we
were going to do things together. If you want to restructure our arrangement,
then let's restructure everything because there are things I’d like to add now,
too.”
Everything about our tribal bond is rooted in getting the information out,
getting the deal out, letting everybody see what's there. And the moment that
the tribe can agree to something, the moment the tribal lovers agree to
something, then it works, but you’ve got to do all that first.
Now in the old days, that was easy. It was easy because most societies based
on the 50-27 have very, very strict rules for bringing males and females
together, strict rules. So you’re not allowed to even hold hands for the first
couple of weeks. You shouldn’t even really stare at each other for a couple of
weeks. And you had all these rules in order to create this opportunity to be
able to feel out the other, in order to see what they’re like, and at the same
time, to build the excitement.
People forget how exciting it is not to jump, they forget that. It's astonishing.
It's much more exciting to go to the threshold and back away. All kinds of
things bubble out of that, and it gives you time to be more clear; it gives you
time to be clear in the relationship. These are the only kind of relationships
that work.

Now when you are dealing with adults, and you’re dealing with people that are
already into relationships that they did not enter into correctly, then you have
all kinds of problems. This is one of the dilemmas of getting knowledge late in
your process, knowledge that’s essential for you when you should have been a
child and had it then. So the only way to deal with that as an adult is that as
you begin each new relationship in your life, practice what this mechanic tells
you, to be truly creative as a reproductive being, to be truly creative in intimacy.
The ground rules have to be established first. The recognition of the other has
to be established first. The acceptance of each other has to be established first.
And don’t think that that is a painful restraint, it's not. You’ll discover that that
way of doing things in relationship builds excitement, builds passion, builds
desire, makes it much more delicious when you finally do consummate the
relationship. And by the way, it doesn’t have to be just sexual; it doesn’t have
to be between male and female.
The Rules Operate at Every Level of Intimacy
This is a Channel of Intimacy. You can operate it at every level of intimate
relationship. One of the gifts of a 59-6 is that they can break into your aura
easily. These are aura busters. And the fact that they can break into your aura
means that you can end up getting lost in that so quickly. Whoooah. See,
we’re not here to leap into things. When it comes to relationships, when it
comes to bonding, we’re not here to jump into things.
It's deeply dangerous for us. Sexuality is not ruled by the Spleen, has nothing
to do with the Splenic system, nothing. Only the Splenic system has a right to
guide us spontaneously. Our sexuality is conditioned by the emotional system,
operating in its wave, conditioned by the Sacral waiting to respond. After all,
that’s where the Sacral noises come from, is from sex. That’s why so many
people who are Generators have a lot of difficulty in being respected as
Generators because they grunt and groan.
I have this wonderful experience with my son Loki. He is a Generator; he is an
emotional Generator, and he growls. I mean he growls. And when he gets
angry, he really growls. And I can see the expression on people’s faces.
Somebody’s over at the house and there is Loki growling. For me, that’s cool,
he is a Sacral person. The average parent is saying, “Don’t do that, don’t do
that, ssh, ssh. You’re not an animal. They make noises like that.”

Sacral Sounds are Not Respected
How many Sacral people at dinnertime, soups on, “Hmmmmm,” and
everybody around the table is saying, “Do you have to do that? What is the
matter with you?” The Sacral sounds are not respected. We hide it behind
bathroom doors and bedroom doors. That’s what we do; we don’t want to
hear all that stuff. It makes it difficult for Generators because everybody says
to a Generator when they go, “Hmm-mmm,” they say “What did you say,
excuse me? Would you say that in words for me? Would you stop being a
Generator and manifest for me please? I don’t want to hear all that stuff. It's
kind of sexy and dirty. Don’t make those sounds while you’re having soup,
you’re upsetting your father.” It's true, what to do?
See, without clarity, we end up with a lot of problems, we just do. And within
the tribe, it is one of those things that is absolutely essential for us. It is the
basis of all society and civilization. It's how we’re able to deal with each other
at the tribal level and ultimately, how we’re able to deal with each other at the
basic bonding level of male/female, and in order for us to have more
successful relationships, which means that you have much more complete
beings.
We’re Designed to Find Completion in the Other
I’m a yang, yang male. There is no way that I can be complete without some
kind of yin force in my life, it's not possible. We’re not designed to be apart,
separate from the other. Only in the Tao do we get to see what the life process
is truly about. We’re designed to bond; we’re designed to be attracted to the
other, and we’re designed to find completion in the other. We’re shaped that
way. Males fit into females, we’re designed that way.
Lack of Self Love Keeps You from Good Relationships
And it's one of those things to see that at that very, very basic level of what a
relationship is, that’s where you’ve got to start. And you see, the difficulty lies
in your lack of love for yourself. That’s the difficulty. That’s the one thing that
truly keeps you from having really good relationships is that you don’t love
yourself, so you’re ready to jump the moment you think somebody might care
about you.

It's incredible to see how many people will do that. “Oh, I don’t really like
him, or I don’t really like her, but they really like me. And I took them in
because they really like me, but I don’t really like them.” The world is filled
with people who can't stand themselves, and so they desperately become
dependent on somebody else in their life to make them feel loved. And they
never entered into the relationship properly. They don’t really know
themselves or the other, and they only suffer in their bond. And if they do
happen to have children, those children suffer as well as a result of it.
We’re here to clean up the act. It begins with our personal relationships. It
begins with clarity in our personal relationships, and it begins with just
honoring what this mechanic says. This is an emotional Generator. It has to
be asked, and then it has to say, “That’s nice. Let's try it another time.” And it
has to be asked again. It has to be clear. It has to go through its wave. It has
to play hard to get.
And whether you’re emotional or not, or Sacral defined or not, that’s not the
point. The point is that this great act of creativity, this great potential of
creativity in us, only is truly beautiful, only is truly creative when we enter into
that bond correctly, when we lay out all the terms beforehand, when we’re clear
about ourselves and the other. Then we can enter into that bond. And then
whether that bond lasts an evening, a week, a month, a year, a lifetime is not
the point. Entering into it correctly is mutually beneficial. Exiting it correctly
is mutually beneficial. It’s not about having to stay there. It’s about going in
correctly, and going into relationships correctly means “Wait, don’t jump.”
That’s okay for adults who have been burned over and over again and know
that makes sense. It’s not okay for kids; they don’t know that. And the Sacral
and the emotional system are incredibly powerful. It’s not about saying to your
child, “You’re too young to make love,” nonsense. It’s not about that.
It’s about telling them how love for them, how sexuality for them can be
valuable, in that you enter into it correctly, that you take your time before you
jump. Then it’s okay; then it’s correct. And that’s the education that’s
absolutely necessary for them. Yeah, teach your children well.

Q & A
If You Have Only One Channel
Student: If you have only one channel like I do, is everything concentrated?
You have two channels—you have different aspects of yourself. If you only
have one are you more concentrated?
Ra: Yes, obviously. In other words, that’s the only theme that you can operate
out of reliably, so therefore it becomes a dominant theme for you. But also, at
the same time, to recognize that somebody, for example, that will have two
channels connected to each other, that also becomes one theme, and they
become fixed in that. It just is larger, that there’s more different variables that
exist in all of that. But yes, obviously, there is a deeper focus for you, in that
sense.
The people that are the most scattered are people who are triple and quadruple
splits because not only do they have many different channels, but they have
those many different channels operating independently of each other. And in
that sense, there is a confusion of material that’s available for them. So in the
sense of having that single channel, yes, everything for you operates out of that
theme.
Electromagnetics in a Circuit
Student: And the bit that’s missing, like I have the 16-48 but don’t have the 18.
Is that missing gate,—I feel attracted to judging.
Ra: Oh, yeah, absolutely. One of the things to keep in mind about the nature
of channels is that in the same way that you can have an electromagnetic
connection within a channel, you can have an electromagnetic connection
between channels in a circuit. So for example, I have a lot of 28-38s in my life
because I have the 20-57. In other words, that’s an electromagnetic. I don’t
have the 28-38; somebody comes along with the 28-38. I have the other end of
that stream. So you’re attracted to that, and you’re always attracted to what
you’re not.

Fooling Your Genes – Natural Allies in the Circuit
So whatever you have in a given circuit, what you don’t have is going to be
attractive to you because of course, that is our genetic process, that we’re
always going to be attracted to what we’re not. And it’s one of the things that I
taught in the early years about understanding the nature of genetic strategy is
that you can fool your genes, in that sense, by being excited and interested in
somebody that has a channel that adds to your circuit. In other words, it’s
better for you to have an interest in the 18-58 than it would be to have an
interest in the 28-38 because that’s for the individual process.
So, you’re meeting natural allies within the circuitry, and those natural allies
obviously are both beneficial to you, and you’re beneficial to them. For you,
the 18-58s seek you out, so that they can get to the Throat, and they can get
that possibility to manifest. At the same time, you become fascinated by their
process because it’s what you’re not. Anyone else?
Communication between Types
Student: What about a Generator and a Generator, or a Generator and a
Projector and they have a business together. Who starts?
Ra: Oh, I see what you’re saying. When they’re both Projectors, and when
they’re together, they’re a Manifestor and a Generator. So in other words, the
fact of the matter is that if you have two Generators, they can each ask each
other. And the moment that they’re together, you’ll find that nine times out of
10, they’re Manifestors. Just about every relationship when it comes together
has either a manifesting potential, an emotional authority or a Sacral that’s
defined. So the moment that you bring Types together, they become
something else, what the bible called “the beast with two backs.”
The moment that you are in an aura with somebody, you lose your identity.
You stop being yourself. You become the thing that you are with the other,
which is greater than what the two of you are separately. So two Generators
together may be Manifestors and can manifest questions to each other. What’s
important is that each of them recognizes that the other needs to respond to
stimulus in order for it to be correct.
So, I know many couples who are Generator couples. So one Generator says
to the other, “You feel like dinner?” and they go, “Um huh.” And the other
IIIInnnnttttrrrroooodddduuuuccccttttiiiioooonnnn aaaannnndddd CCCCrrrreeeeaaaattttiiiivvvveeee CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss 222255551111
one says, “Do you feel like dinner?” and they go, “Um huh,” and then they can
go, eat. That’s the way it works. So it’s not about who does that first and all
that kind of stuff. But it’s one of those things to recognize that anybody can
ask anybody else, and that the moment that you bring most of these
combinations together, you’ll recognize immediately that the vast majority are
instantaneously Manifestors. That’s the way we’re designed. That’s what the
gods do to us.
The gods say, “Look, you have to wait. No, you don’t. You see that person
there? If we bring the two of you together, you don’t have to wait anymore;
you can work, work, work. And by the way, because you’re going to come
together, and you’re going to work, work, work, you might as well have some
kids.” So at least they work, work, work as productive. It’s a god’s game. So
the moment that you come together in a relationship, you get to see all of these
things. The Sacral gets defined, the Throat gets defined, the emotions get
defined most of the time.
Yo Quiero
And then you can see how we’re designed. We’re designed to need the other in
order to manifest. Spanish is an interesting language. In Spanish, you never
say to somebody, “I love you.” You say, “Yo quiero (I need you),” very
different. You would never say, “I love you,” you say, “I need you.” This is
the program. “I need you because when you’re with me, we become
Manifestors. That’s great. Let’s go, buy a house.” That’s the whole thing;
that’s the trap. So if you don’t understand what you are going in, and if you
don’t set it up properly, you get hooked into the trap and off you go,
manifesting like hell. We’re meant to go forth and multiply. Be busy.
So remember this game that’s out there. Enter into your relationships
cautiously. Enter into them open. That’s one of the things about this
knowledge. It gives us a chance truly to be able to say to somebody, “This is
what I am,” and to be able to awaken in them, because you have the skills and
the knowledge, to be able to awaken in them an understanding of themselves.
And if you know this knowledge, you’re never going to be able to get into a
relationship with somebody who doesn’t. You’re going to have to educate
them, otherwise it’s never going to work, and you really have to see that. So
you begin the experiment of this process of being very, very clear and selective
in your relationships. Don’t jump. Make sure that you get the stuff out. Make

sure that you get a chance to be clear in your bargain beforehand, and then you
can enter into love for as long as it lasts. That’s all.
We have completed a process of taking a look at the creative channels and
seeing the creative channels and the fact that they are the natural expressions of
the circuits that they belong to. But it is not to say that they are of greater
significance than any other channel.
The whole business of duality is the business of comparison and do not get
stuck in the comparison business here because it isn’t going to do you any
good. Every single one of these channels has their own intrinsic value and
power and it is important not to get involved in comparing one to the other.
