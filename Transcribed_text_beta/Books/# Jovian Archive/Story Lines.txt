Table of Contents
INTRODUCTION TO THE STORY LINES
The 'Story Line' is derived from the Design and Personality Nodes. The Nodes
represent both Environment and Perspective. It is the platform for maturation and
preparation for fulfillment of purpose. In this special program, you will discover the
themes of your 'Story Line' and its importance in establishing a correct and attuned
life.
This online 4-lecture course was originally taught in February 2010 by Ra Uru Hu.
All original illustrations are included.

Lecture One
Left/Left
Hello to everyone. It wasn't so much that it was unexpected as
it was a surprise for me to see that of the four lectures, even
taking into account people who are subscribed to the series,
that by far there are more people registered—I think there are
28 people registered—for the Left/Left than any of the other
groups, and I found that to be rather interesting.
The Four Arrows
But anyway, let's get into our journey together. For those of you who are not famili-
ar with it, this is a Maia Mechanics Advanced Imaging chart. It is a tool that is used
by PHS Practitioners and Rave Psychologists and provides a very profound graphic
layout of information at very deep levels of Human Design. That is, levels that go
beneath the line of the substructure. I will start with this image because it is really
what this is all about. That is, story line is an aspect of Variable and Variable are
these four arrows. These four arrows are a byproduct, whether they‘re Left or Right,
of the tonal information that lies underneath.

A Digital Book for Students
Everything about these four arrows is that they ultimately are about nothing less
than cognition and ultimately about awareness. And these four aspects of the way
cognition operates in our lives are broken down basically into two sections. That is,
what is above, and what is above is the brain and the mind. And what is below,
which is known as the Independent Variable and what is called ―story line‖, what is
below is the magic of the life itself. Above the brain and the mind, yes, but the brain
and the mind within the life, and it is the life that is the story.
Dependent Variable Brain Mind
Independent Variable Story Line
Story Line is the Foundation for the Fulfillment of Purpose
Everything about what it is to be correct in this life is really about being able to es-
tablish your story line, to live it because it is the foundation of the fulfillment of pur-
pose. When we look at the development of a nine-centered being, we nine-centered
beings, there is a very simple thing to keep in mind. If you go from birth to approx-
imately 30 years of age, the point at which you have your Saturn return, in this pe-
riod the only thing that really matters is that this being, this particular being, is going
to be treated as an emotional Generator and is going to be treated with the respect
of being an emotional Generator, an emotional Manifesting Generator, in fact. And
that they‘re going to be fed correctly according to their dietary regimen.
Now, if they‘re fed correctly and they are raised correctly according to their nature,
this is the perfection of the first 30 years. It is from 30 to 50, from the Saturn to the
Kiron that we have this phase we call the story line, and it is here that the environ-
ment and the perspective have to be established. And it is this environment-
perspective journey that lays the foundation for the post Kiron flowering of the nine-
centered being. In other words, this is where you lay the foundation for the fulfill-
ment of your purpose. It is here that you find yourself on your cross, literally, and

that you begin to live out what is the construct that is your particular, your unique,
differentiation.
The Experiment of Strategy and Authority
So everything about the story line is that the story line is an extraordinary thing.
This is an overview. It's really about grasping something about what it means to
surrender as a being. When you enter into the experiment of Strategy and Authori-
ty, you enter into a process in which you allow your vehicle's consciousness, your
body's awareness system, to finally be in control of how it navigates on this plane.
It changes a lot of things. It begins to change the way in which you can look at the
world. But looking at the world is not something that is random. The thing about
mechanics that‘s so incredible is that mechanics literally just lay it out and say here
is the framework. Can you live the framework? Can you surrender to being correct,
because it‘s not like you have anything to do. It isn‘t. It‘s about surrendering to the
mechanics themselves. It‘s what Strategy and Authority brings you.
Dietary Regimen
The moment that you enter into that experiment of operating according to your
Strategy and Authority, this is when you begin to develop your brain system. And
the most important thing in the development of the brain system, particularly in
beings like us who were born conditioned is that you transform the way in which you
take nutrition into your body. There is nothing more important if you are really,
truly interested in transforming your life. It begins with what you put in your body
and what are the circumstances or the conditions upon which you take things into
your body.
Everything about dietary regimen, which is the basis of PHS, is to align the brain
system to differentiation, to align it to its particular sensory capacity, to establish a
brain that is ready to fulfill the potential eventually of mind and awareness. And
once one is operating correctly and eating correctly, then you enter into the most
important stage. That is, putting all of that into the flow of life itself.
The Nodes of the Moon
When I first started my teaching process in 1992 I was very much Sun/Earth
oriented, the importance of introducing the concept of the cross, of understanding
the dynamics of the Personality as a costume that one wears in order to achieve
purpose, to be able to see the magic of that and to be able to set the foundation for
being able to understand the nature of the graph itself. But as I matured in my
process as a teacher, more and more the realization that the form principle rides
along the rails that the Nodes provide, that the Nodes are truly an extraordinary

thing, because of all the things that we see in this graphing, they are something that
have no material to them.
They are positional. They are the Nodes of the Moon, the apogee and perigee of the
Moon. They are just positions. They let in the neutrino ocean of the universe. They
let in the neutrino ocean of the totality, what I call the bi-verse, all of those neigh-
boring stars and their streams that feed the neutrino ocean that penetrates us mo-
ment by moment. It is the Nodes that are a portal to this trans-cellular information.
It really is an alignment for the relative eternalness of our Personality crystal to this
endless line of movement, because it's what the Nodes represent, the magic of this
movement that in the end we call life, because it is life, this movement.
The Natural Order
So, when we look at the Nodes, when we look at the story line we're looking at
something that's really extraordinary from the mechanical perspective. We can see
our place in the natural order. And there is a natural order. I'm a great admirer of
Lao Tzu. Not so much for all the stuff he wrote, quite frankly, but for the awareness
that was there. Here was a seven-centered being that understood that there was a
natural order that was being forsaken by the addiction of mental authority. And he
understood that a long, long, long time ago. This was an extraordinary awareness.
He saw it. There was nothing to be done about it. There was no way to change the
way the wheel turns. The wheel just turns.
The Variable Grid
What you‘re looking at here is a portion of a Variable grid where all the 16 Variables
are laid out. The 16 Variables
actually form four families.
These families are linked by
their story lines (circled in
green.) They all have the same
story line, but you'll notice that
each and every one of them has
a very different brain/mind sys-
tem. Amongst you who are
here are those who share in
common these particular story
lines. Yet at the same time, you
experience them in a very dif-
ferent way because we expe-
rience life through our Perso-
nality consciousness, because
that's who we think we think we
are.

Lecture One
Left/Left Storyline
So, it's important to keep in mind that there are different ways in which this story
line is perceived at the consciousness level. But it is at the physical quality, the way
in which the life is intended to unfold, that there are deep similarities here. What
you look at when you're looking at a Variable is you're looking at a grid that‘s being
laid out that shows us the nine-centered natural order. That sounds really sweet,
doesn‘t it? We‘re never going to get there. It would require all of humanity to be
able to function correctly and according to its nature, and so forth and so on. None
of that is even remotely possible even if you're deranged.
One of the things to understanding about the Variable grid is that the advantage in
recognizing one's place in this natural order is simply being able to place oneself
there mechanically and live it. And what the grid shows you is the fractal connec-
tions that you have, that these are beings who share with you the same story line,
but again from a different consciousness level, because when you put all the Va-
riables together you get the consciousness field the way it was intended to operate,
the way it's designed to operate. But it's never a given.
What you get to have is what Human Design is so good at is that you get to have
your personal map. You get to have a signpost. I'm a great promoter of signposts
as ways of keeping the Personality consciousness content to recognize that a journey
is being made to keep the mind involved in watching the movie instead of trying to
interfere with the movie.
What You Do Defines You
Let's think about what it means to be Left/Left. What you do defines you. Think
about that. That‘s what it is to have a Left/Left story line. What you do defines you.
What you do gives you your focus. And it is your focus that defines you. Now, think
about that for a moment. We're looking at a generic here, a generalization, after all.
If we look at all of the Left/Left beings on the planet, story line beings on the planet,
we‘re going to have about 1.7 billion. And I guarantee you that that‘s 1.7 billion
people who are not content with what
they do and don't like being defined by
what they do and would prefer to be
defined by something else that that do,
that they can't do, or aren‘t allowed to
do, or aren‘t equipped to do, whatever
the case may be.
Think about it this way; let‘s talk about
the design for a moment. If we‘re on
the Design side, we see that we've got
this Left-ness (larger image next page.)
And we see that the keynote for this
Left-ness is called Observed. What
that literally means, because again
when you're dealing with the Design Node you‘re dealing with environment. You can

see the environments described down here in the keynotes. And that environment is
not necessarily a place. It is a quality of place. Environments, that is, the environ-
ments of Human Design can be found in any location, but they‘re found in different
aspects of that location.
Environments
Environment is to the Outside of the Body what Dietary Regimen does for
the Inside
Environment is to the outside of your body what dietary regimen does for the inside.
This is nourishment. We're not here to be buffered by resistance in our life on the
outside world. We're here to navigate and glide along through the maia, but this
gliding through the maia is something that is determined by whether we‘re operating
correctly, are we making decisions correctly, and are we making them out of the
right environment, because your environment does a number of things.

Lecture One
Left/Left Storyline
Environment Nourishes Your Connection to the Outside World
The first thing that your environment does is that it nourishes your connection to the
outside world. In other words, it helps eliminate resistance with those beings that
you're going to meet environmentally. That environment adds to the quality of your
life. And when you're reducing resistance you're adding to your longevity. If you‘re
going to take the nine-centered journey, you‘d better be healthy.
The nine-centered journey is about coming into your flowering when you turn 50.
We're not seven-centered beings where the game is over at 25, and that was most
of our history. This is about us only getting to that place where we‘re equipped; this
is a complex existence, a complex maia that we‘re actually equipped to be able to
fulfill the potential that‘s there uniquely in each of us. So you need to be healthy.
Active and Focused in the Environment
Healthy isn't just your concerns for your own vehicle. It‘s about who's in your life.
And it's about where you are, because if you're not in the right environment then
you're not protected. And beyond the health issues of that; if you're not in the right
place, you're not going to see what you're here to see. And this is focused seeing.
This is somebody who's here to be active and focused in their environment. You‘re
the kind of person that if you go into a place and it makes you feel like you need to
fall asleep, get the hell out of there. It will kill you.
And when I say be active in your environment, it‘s going to depend on your design
what that activity actually means. If you‘re somebody with three channels from the
Root to the Spleen, either you‘ve got a bicycle that you're running or you‘ve got an
environment where you're out there and you're hiking and doing whatever it is that
you're doing. If you‘re a Projector, that active environment can be totally different.
It can be you sitting quite still at a desk while your fingers are active. Again, it will
depend on your design.
After all, I'm giving you a very, very broad generic here so you can understand the
thematic of it. But when you begin to descend into all of the nuances and there are
more nuances that I have laid out here, you get down to the extraordinary differen-
tiation that is you. But like anything else in Human Design, it is the surface that
always carries the truth. The Left/Left is a being that needs to be active and fo-
cused; and what they do is important to them. It defines them.
What the Mind Sees is What Feeds the Mind and its Potential Awareness
It means that if you're the greatest actor or actress and you're working in the local
bar, it's a very, very painful thing. It‘s all about recognizing that these are beings

THE STORY LINES

that are very much identified by what they do. And this is not a personality problem,
please grasp that. This is something very important to understand. This is mecha-
nical. Everything about
Variable is getting to this
place here, awareness.
And what feeds the mind
and its potential awareness
is what the mind sees.
Each and every one of us
has an attunement to that.
Each and every one of us
has a unique thing that we‘re really here to be able to see, to be able to pass on, so
that it can be translated into a concept that can be expressed as outer authority,
that awareness.
The Left/Left being, the quality of their awareness is derived from their work. It‘s
derived from what they do. Think of the opposite, the Right/Right. The Right/Right
can have any kind of job, because the job isn‘t the point. Existence is what is being
taken in. They're never going to be defined by what they do. They are only going to
be defined by what they deliver when they are required to deliver.
The Left/Left is to be Deeply Focused
The Left/Left is here to be focused. This is the ultimate
strategic story line, deeply focused. So you need to
find that thing that's right for you. It‘s not just a mat-
ter of being in the right place. You can see that this
person's environment is Valleys. And when you're
looking at environment, the first thing you‘ll notice in
environment is that there are upper environments and
there are lower environments. The lower environ-
ments are called ‗hardscape‘ and these are fundamen-
tally urban. And the upper are called ‗landscape‘ and
these are fundamentally rural.
The Valley Environment
Neither one is exclusive because you can have smaller
hardscape communities that can be very suitable to
Valley people. Valley people are people that need to
be low down. So for example, if you're living in a city
and you're in an apartment complex you live on the
first floor and not the 27th because you‘re a Valley
person. Valley people are the kind of people that
adore sidewalk cafés, as an example, to be in a place where there is this flow that
goes by.

Lecture One
Left/Left Storyline
It really is about the movement of information and energy, different people, much
more potential for—valleys traditionally are places where you have most of the major
cities of the world because through the valleys runs the rivers and along the rivers
are built the cities. This is where the flow of information moves where things pass
back and forth. So, there are things about this being and its specific environment,
but whatever that is, they have to be active in that environment. That is, that's
where they need to find their work.
After Age 30 One Needs to Establish the Correct Environment
Remember how the scale goes; zero to 30 this doesn't matter, but the moment you
get to 30, the moment you‘re there to establish your adult life, this is the moment
that you need to establish it in the environment that is correct for you. Obviously,
many people who come to Human Design are long past their 30th birthday. And this
knowledge was never intended as a repair kit for the conditioned. It was intended as
a knowledge base for the future for children. There's nothing we can do, any of us
including myself—it is always my joke. I'm in my 23rd year in Human Design and I'm
still fundamentally a baby if I look at it from that scale.
And obviously you can't. You do the best you can at every level that you can. Be-
cause it is mechanical, there is a road map, and the sooner that you find your way to
what is correct for you the better. The other thing is, please understand something--
If you're just discovering about environment now, the only way that you can go to an
environment that is correct for you is that you go there according to Strategy and
Authority, not because I say so and you think it's interesting, because that's some-
thing that's really very important to grasp.
A Natural Timing
It has to be correct. All of these things that are involved in this process have to be
correct. It has to be for you. There is a timing for things. There is a natural timing
that is there for anyone who is involved in a process like this. So, it is not something
to place into your mind as a pressure system for your mind to take control and tell
you we should do this now or we should move now or whatever. Allow the informa-
tion to settle into your system and wait for it naturally to be correct for you to do
such things.
Nonetheless, to be to be on this Left side is to understand that your activity is very
important for you. This is something that simply becomes a key. And it says there
is an environment where it's correct for you. So for example, this is somebody that
is not going to do well on the high ground. Their ability to maintain their activity,
the closer they are to sea level, the more energy they're actually going to have as
being, literally the more energy they're going to have.

Meeting the Correct People
This is an environment that nurtures their well-being, but it's more than that. When
they‘re in that place where there is this movement and flow where they can be part
of that frequency, that's where they meet those beings that they're intended to
meet. These are not the kind of people that meet people from around the corner.
That's not what they're for. Valley people are people who meet people who come
from the next neighborhood or the next town or the next city over the next country
or the next continent. In other words, it‘s a way of connecting that in the modern
sense is a much more networking sense to it given the modern constructs that have.
Seeing Correctly
Something to recognize is that all of these upper themes are deeply related to our
particular time in terms of their importance for us and the importance of bringing
them out, bringing people into the right environment so that they can meet the right
beings. But more than that, that they can see correctly, and seeing is an incredible
thing. We‘re all here to have a unique perspective that ultimately is the foundation
of our outer authority, all of us. What we‘re all about is this potential in us to fulfill
the unique possibility of life. It‘s what's so beautiful.
It‘s not that this is a world of drones, that it's all sheep and that's the way that it
goes. It‘s tnot o like that. It really isn‘t. It is clear to me that nine-centered beings
are the ultimate construct. We have this fabulous potential to be able to fulfill our
possibility. It‘s just an incredible thing. It‘s just there. And the mechanics are there.
So it‘s just a matter of living that out. And when you live that out it takes time, after
all. This is one of the constraints. The natural framework for developing our whole
perception of life, our combination of the experiential and our cognitive development
is something that takes 20 years. It‘s a 20-year platform to establish that aware-
ness.
The Radical Approach
So again, these things take time. So, the sooner that we get there—this is why I‘ve
taken to calling these things a radical approach, because the only thing you can real-
ly do is deal with this in a radical way, get involved, discover for yourself first and
foremost that Strategy and Authority makes a difference in your life. It's the first
thing.
And when you're ready, experiment with your dietary regimen because this is the
mechanism you're going to need to be able to house and express awareness. You
need your brain system and your body, your physical body, to operate as well as it
possibly can. After all, it is to your benefit in the end. And then environment.
These are the physical aspects: Strategy and Authority, dietary regimen, environ-
ment. This is the thing that aligns your vehicle to what's correct.

The Filter of Your Seeing
The moment that your vehicle is aligned is the moment that your eyes open up to
their way of seeing. It‘s not what, in that sense, you see, but it is the filter of your
seeing. You filter for things. We all see with a different filter. We all see different
aspects of the spectrum. We see them differently. When we're looking at these
different views, what we get to see is we go from the very primary view filtering only
those themes of survival, those themes of fear, those themes of not knowing, all of
those themes ultimately to the personal themes at the top in which everything is
seen in almost a narcissistic way. Everything is seen through the lens of the own
being‘s experience, different ways of filtering the world around us. Each of us has a
unique way of filtering that world.
Now, here is where we get to the beginnings of the magic of being aware, truly.
When I first began my mystical process I had a lot of friends here in Ibiza who were
very much into all kinds of Eastern spiritual trips. I watched that movie very careful-
ly. It was so clear to me that there was no real meaning for the word they were
trying to describe because nobody really knew how to get there. They just sort of
had a sense of it if they came across it.
Awareness is Mundane
I don't think that awareness is a magical thing. I think awareness is a mundane
thing. I think it‘s ordinary and I think we have to wake up to that fact that it‘s ordi-

nary. It belongs to us. It‘s our right to be aware. It is only homogenization condi-
tioning that has veiled what is our innate awareness. You see it in the baby's eyes
when it comes into the world. I have a young grandson and he‘s at that stage, I
guess he‘s nearly four months old now, where you look at those eyes and it's an
incredible thing. You see this innate, it‘s just there, the awareness consciousness,
the crystal is at work. It‘s filtering. There is not yet this dense veil of the Personali-
ty consciousness that enfolds it.
And everything about the mechanics in Human Design is about being able to take
from mechanics and learn from them and apply them and provide tools. It's what
we do in Human Design is provide tools based on the mechanics. Here is a tool to
discover awareness. Now that's something to say, isn‘t it, but it is an incredible tool.
Views are Based on Color
Let me explain to you how it works. You can
see that the views we have, just like the
environments we have, are based on Color.
Color is in the substructure just below the
line (black arrow) and there are six Colors
below each line.
One of the things that is so extraordinary
about Color, and it is one of those things
that makes the life in essence possible, is
that Color ‗transfers.‘ What that means is
that if you look at the Color construct, the 6,
like with the line construct, like with harmo-
nies and resonances in lines, that we have
harmonies that are here in Colors.
Color Harmonies
So for example, the 1st Color and the 4th
Color are harmonies (blue arc) and the 2
and the 5 (red arc) and the 3 and the 6
(green arc.) Now, what happens is that the
way in which we look at the world is always
moving in a binary and it's moving in a bi-
nary not gradually back and forth, but like a seesaw.
We live in a duality. This is the yin/yang, RNA/DNA. This is the bi-verse, this is the
duality. It‘s all dualistic. There is no singularity to the way in which we perceive.
There is no singularity in the way in which we filter because of what is called ‗distrac-
tion.‘

Distraction
When we're looking at our perspective and we're looking at the way in which Color
transfers, at this level here we call this distraction, being distracted. Here is this
person; they‘ve got a 3rd Color view. They‘re
here to filter with the Power view. That is, bas-
ically they're here to see winners and losers,
who‘s winning, who‘s losing. And they care
about those things because it‘s what they're
looking at and that's what they're going to feed
their mind with.
In other words, they can have the inner truth
about who can be a winner and who could be a
loser or why someone is a winner and someone
is a loser or why an idea can be a winner or
loser and on and on and on. It‘s all about the
measurement game. The distraction is to see
things personally. Not looking out in the world
and keeping score, not caring at all, looking at
the world through one's own concerns, the distraction. Now, I said this is a tool for
awareness. Think about how incredible this is.
Like anything in Human Design, in Human Design they point out something, you‘re
this, you‘re that, you‘ve got this or that; you realize very quickly ―indeed I do.‖ This
is just the mechanical display. Okay, so you take a look at it at this level. You've
got a dominant perspective, you here to really keep score. The other side of that is
you get pulled away from paying attention to that outside world and who's up and
who's down and who's in and who's out and you get lost in your own personal stuff
and it's that personal stuff that you begin to organize in your mind and get con-
cerned about.
You can watch that happen to you. If you're this person and you understand this,
that you have these two perspectives, one is healthy for you and the other is not so
much that it‘s unhealthy, it‘s only unhealthy if you‘re lost in it. It is healthy in the
sense that because we live in that binary, you do need the distance. It‘s good for
you to pull back to the personal as a way of distancing yourself from only seeing that
outside contest. Yet at the same time, it's the outside contest that's there to define
the way in which you as being, as a mind, are going to conceptualize.
Passenger Consciousness
I teach something called ‗passenger consciousness.‘ That's what we are. The Perso-
nality crystal is a passenger in the vehicle, a vehicle that's determined by the Design
crystal and the Monopole. The Personality crystal doesn't even sit in the physical

body itself. It sits outside of the physical body above the scalp. It‘s never even
really in the movie. It isn‘t.
And everything about the nature of the Personality crystal is that the Personality
crystal is in essence experiencing the whole form principle from the outside. That‘s
not just body. That‘s us as beings. It‘s always very clear to me that passenger con-
sciousness I watch, ‗Ra,‘ the whole thing, the mind, the vehicle, the life, the whole
thing, because that's the entertainment, that is what this is all about.
And it‘s about understanding that it is only when you are surrendered to being cor-
rect that you can begin to connect yourself to your passenger consciousness, that
you begin to sit behind the veil of the Personality and watch your Personality at
work. The moment that you watch that shift, there you are with your mind busy
with what it naturally likes to be busy with and all of a sudden the distraction comes
in, you get warped into the internal thing and in that moment you catch it.
And the first thing you‘ve got to ask yourself is one of those wonderful questions,
―who caught that?‖ The passenger is there. And you can experience not the pas-
senger, but yourself, because that's what we are. Ultimately we are an expression of
that Personality crystal in the way in which it filters the experience of our existence.
We‘ve always been at this very dense level where it's our Personality that we‘re con-
nected to and our Personality trying to connect to our vehicle. What a mess that
makes with the mind making decisions for you instead of being behind that Personal-
ity veil and allowing the Personality to be what it is in its correctness, because that's
so much a part of the beauty of what it is to be you.
A Focused View
Here we‘re dealing with a focused Left/Left
perspective. It‘s focused on these things.
Here is a case where the distraction is going
to be very obvious, because it goes from
one deep focus to another deep focus. But
because this is the story line, it says that the
wisdom, the intelligence that you're going to
develop is an intelligence in which what you
are doing, that doing in your life is correct
for you, because it is through this doing that
you're defined as a being, because it's this
doing in your focus , whatever that focus
happens to be, that inner truth is going to
be in relationship to that focus. Those de-
tails are going to be in relationship to that
focus. So, if you're not doing the right thing
and you're not doing it in the right place,
you‘re a long, long, long way from being
aware; a long journey.

Outer Authority
When Human Design came into the world, it came into the world in order to protect
the individual, protect the individual from being seduced and manipulated by others,
protect the individual from being trapped in that. Mechanics say something very
obvious. The point of cognition, the whole point of cognition is to allow us to be able
to express outer authority, everything about cognition.
Yet, outer authority is the most distorted thing that we have on the planet, because
we don't have beings who are correct. We don't have beings who operate correctly.
We don't have beings who are connected to each other correctly. We don‘t have
beings in the right place who are seeing the way they‘re here to see. We don't have
beings who know the difference between what is their view and what is the distrac-
tion.
And because most human beings are not-self, most human beings are totally ab-
sorbed in the way in which their perspective distracts and their minds end up dealing
with stuff and working with stuff that doesn't mean anything and does not enrich the
consciousness field and does not offer the potential of true outer authority. It
doesn‘t.
What You Do in Life is the Most Important Decision
So, the thing about being Left/Left and something really deeply to understand is that
what you do in this life is the most important decision you make, not who you‘re
with, but what you do. And this is something that those of you particularly who are
carrying this Left/Left, if you look at what you are doing and it is not fulfilling for
you, that it is not something you want to be identified with, it's time for change,
because everything about being Left/Left is that what you do defines you.
By the way, it doesn‘t have to be a job in the obvious sense of the word; it‘s what
you do with your life. Literally, it‘s what you do with your time and your energy, this
is what defines you. And it has to be correct for you. Those of you that think, well,
you can say this for all of us, it‘s not true. It really isn‘t. This is a Left/Left thing.
Your activity is not to be wasted. That‘s the other thing to understand about your
activity level, it‘s not to be wasted on those things that are not part of your focus.
Your energy is for your focus. Your activity is for your focus.
In the Correct Environment You get Your Perspective
And in the right environment you get your perspective. I call this the seat. It lays
the foundation for the passenger, for passenger consciousness to come into exis-
tence. The journey begins with the beautiful surface of Human Design, that is,
The Story Lines is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

15
THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
Strategy and Authority because what Strategy and Authority does if you get into it is
that it takes away the power to make decisions from your mind. It just does. It
doesn‘t stop your mind from being mind. Mind is mind, but it no longer can make
those decisions. It changes its quality.
It also means that your mind suddenly is more open than it's ever been before, be-
cause the mind closes in order to control its destiny. The mind begins to open up
when it no longer feels like it has to be responsible for every breath. The longer
you're in that process of surrendering the decision-making to who you are, this is
automatically aligning your whole vehicle to a different frequency.
Transforming Your Awareness
Every step along the way in this transformation process is a transformation in your
awareness. You begin by transforming the way in which you see yourself as an indi-
vidual. The next step is the way in which you define yourself as a being according to
what you take into your body. Again, there is no subject that is more profound in
Human Design than dietary regimen, because dietary regimen is the one thing that
really says—I told that story many times.
I couldn't understand, I work with so many intelligent people and they get to a cer-
tain point and they could not break through, and it wasn't for lack of trying or lack of
intelligence. There are limitations on the conditioned mind. There are just limita-
tions. As long as the mind is conditioned—and that conditioning is both psychologi-
cal and physical, and the physical conditioning is a byproduct of food. Food is the
first conditioning system. It‘s the first thing that conditions human beings is the food
and how the food is given to them and what food is given to them. This is one of the
revolutionary differences about how to raise a nine-centered child according to their
dietary regimen because it makes an incredible difference in their brain system de-
velopment.
Fine-Tuning the Vehicle
So anyone that is going to enter into this journey, you have to understand that not
only are you trying to fine-tune your consciousness here, you've got to fine-tune the
apparatus. You‘ve got to fine-tune the vehicle. And it begins with eating correctly,
when it's correct for you to do so. Again, not under the pressure of thinking I have
to or I should. This is something that has to be correct for you, because it's not
something to be dabbled with. It is something that you take into your life.
And it changes your life, as every step in Human Design does. From sleeping in your
own aura to eating your unusual way or different way to being somebody who is very
aware of their environment, because environment is the thing that makes your life
healthy, not your body, per se, but your life healthy. This is a beautiful thing. I am
so fortunate, I am so lucky to have the environment that I do because I have learnt

the lessons of not being in my environment. Those are lessons that once you learn
them, you will not make the same mistake.
Link Nodes
Your environment is such an extraordinary place, not simply for what it is. And you
can see they are generalizations. They‘re fundamentally just various aspects of the
quality of life in different places, but they make an enormous difference to us, be-
cause not only do they give us this addi-
tional protection and vitality for our life
process, but they point us here. And they
point us here because the Nodes are
linked. They‘re called ‗Link Nodes‘ (gold
stars.) And the moment that your envi-
ronment is correct, like stepping into the
right position, automatically your eyes open up to the right world. You get to see
what you‘re here to see from the perspective that you're here to see it, in the envi-
ronment that you're here to see it, in the environment that brings the conditions and
the people that you're here to see in that way.
Being Conscious of the Way You See
This is your story line. It is here that you develop the tools of awareness. And you
develop the tools of awareness by being conscious of the way you see. If you don't
have to be afraid of what's going to happen to you tomorrow, then you can be con-
scious of the way you see, because your mind needs something to do. And being
conscious of the way you see is an extraordinary thing for your mind to do. Just to
catch it; when you catch it the first time, you wait and feel what that's like. That‘s a
very odd experience.
It‘s one thing to see the mechanics of your vehicle, the way in which you get it seen
in Design, but this is a mechanic of the way in which who you think you are oper-
ates, your mind, the way in which your mind is taking in the way you see. And it's
not like it's up to you, that fluctuation in the transference, that distraction between
one view to the next. It‘s just a prana. You can't fix it or change it. But the mo-
ment that you're aware of it, in that moment you've transcended it. In that moment
you're no longer trapped in its bargain and its game. You are a witness. You are
passenger consciousness.
This is what opens the door. For me, it‘s the most incredible tool that there is in
Human Design. There are wonderful tools that have been developed out of the me-
chanics. But I watch so many human beings looking, searching deeply for aware-
ness. And to be able to see mechanically how clearly it can be lived out by anyone
for me is something that is very beautiful. And to come into contact with what is the
highest level of potential consciousness in our system, because that is what our pas-

sengers are, is to finally free ourselves from being embedded in the journey that we
have and truly be able to see it.
Seeing Feeds the Personality its Outer Authority
It‘s out of that seeing that the passenger consciousness feeds the Personality its
outer authority, literally, that expression that can come out of any being who is
unique, that offers a unique wisdom. I talk so often about what it is to be a nine-
centered being, to being fulfilled as a nine-centered being in relationship with the
other; the theme is communion. It is the communion of awareness, that communion
of awareness that runs along the fractal lines, that communion of awareness that
builds the consciousness field, the unique perceptions of unique beings expressed
with awareness.
Once the mind is truly free from being a controlling agent in your life, it can finally
be truthful, honest. And that its honest expression, no matter what it is, can simply
be taken in and accepted by the other for its correctness. It‘s not like every other
authority that a being is going to have, correct as they may be, may be somebody's
cup of tea. You get to see that in the Variable grid that not everyone connects easily
in terms of the way in which awareness will flow.
We are Here to be Deeply Cognitive Creatures
But we are designed to have communion with those that are correct for us to have
communion with. And it is this expansion of awareness that ultimately is our role.
We're here to be deeply, deeply cognitive creatures. And no matter in the end what
the potentials are of brain
and mind, that it‘s here along
this line, along this move-
ment, that the life is really
made. It is the life that we
surrender to.
That is what Strategy and
Authority does for you. It allows you to surrender your life, to let go. Your life itself
may not surrender to anything, but you have surrendered to your life. Let your life
live out its movie. Allow it the beauty of being what it was intended it to be. And
you do that by treating it correctly; nothing more, nothing less. There's nothing for
you to do. You‘re just here to live the correctness of what you are.
Seven Years of Deconditioning
Day by day, moment by moment, everything about this process takes time. It takes
seven years to do the primary deconditioning at the cellular level. Seven years. It

Left/Left Storyline
takes seven years to begin to understand what it means to be correct as a nine-
centered being. It takes time. And it means there's no time to waste. There isn't.
It means that every step that you take in your process, the more radical your ap-
proach in this process, the greater the opportunity there is there for you to be able
to live out your possibility. It‘s such sweet thing in the end.
Left/Left: Defined by What You Do
So, Left/Left, there's only one thing that matters. You are defined by what you do.
So, do what is correct for you to do and do not settle or accept anything less, be-
cause you rob yourself of your future. And do so in an environment that is correct
for you and then find out what your perspective, your view is, and what your distrac-
tion is and sit back in your movie and wait for it and catch it. It‘s an enormous step.
The seven-centered being in all of its spiritual practices, that was the thing it longed
for the most. But they didn‘t know how to get there. They weren‘t equipped for it, it
wasn‘t them. It wasn‘t their time. It is ours.
A Love for the Process
What I get to see after all these years and particularly beings that I've known for a
long time who have been involved in Design, there is a love that has to be there. It
begins with the obvious. Human Design is what it is because it works. Otherwise,
all of this would be pointless anyway. It works. And out of that it works comes a
certain kind of love. It's a love for the process.
In a way it‘s a seduction. It is a seduction to go deeper and deeper and deeper and
deeper into the process so that one can complete it and it‘s what we‘re here for. We
are here not to live out our cross, but literally to have our cross define us. We are
here to live out the full potential of our profile, our design, all of these things. We
are here to live all of this out. We‘re here to live out the magic that's there in a sin-
gle human being, real magic. And we‘re here to live it out in its perfection, and not
settle for anything less.
So when you begin to feel that love—I don‘t know what to call it—the joy, pleasure
that comes with each of the little steps that bring you closer and closer to the fulfill-
ment of your process, this is such a beautiful thing. And it‘s mechanical, so you
don't have to make anything up and you don't have to pray and you don‘t have to do
any mantras. You just have to live right. Live in a way that has certain simple basic
mechanical rules. Honor the rules and watch the movie.
Well, I hope you enjoyed that. And thanks to all of you for being a part of this. All
of you, you take care and yes, Left/Left away you go. Bye for now.

Hello and welcome to all of you and welcome to Story Lines.
What you're looking at is a Maia Mechanics Imaging graph.
This is an imaging tool for Human Design that‘s used in PHS
and Rave Psychology. And what it provides us with is an in-
credible depth of information, information that can be used
holistically for really the benefit of the being to be able to really
see all of the underlying themes that are inherent in what it is truly to be them.

THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
Variable is About Awareness
One of the keys to this holistic perspective is what's called Variable. Variable is real-
ly an extraordinary thing. Variable is about awareness in the same way that type is
about form. That is, the moment you begin the process of recognizing your type and
living the experience of the experiment of your Strategy and Authority is the mo-
ment that you really begin the awareness journey. And the awareness journey is
here.
Tone is About Cognitive Architecture
What you're looking at here, what we call Variable, is these four arrows. These four
arrows obviously pointing Left or Right,
and in this case we‘re going to look at
this combination of Left and Right
Nodes. What we're looking at is that
that Left-ness and Right-ness is always
being conditioned by what's called Tone.
We have sub–
structure. That
is, you have a line
and beneath the
line are Colors
and beneath the
Colors are Tones
and finally at the very root of every activation is a Base. The
energy is really actually moving this way.
So, we're looking at the underlying themes and Tone is about our cognitive architec-
ture. It really is the essence of it. You can even see the mirror of it in that the
graphic of Tone is this very distinctive triangle, this part of the Human Design graph-
ic. And it is this architecture, this cognitive architecture that gets laid out in four
different parts. And when we‘re looking at Variable, Variable divides into two
groups. The upper group, which is called the Dependent Variable, is made up of the
Sun/Earths and this is about the brain system and this is about the mind.
The Independent Variable
Then we have the Inde-
pendent Variable and you
notice the difference there Dependent Variable
because it‘s sig–nificant,
above is the Dependent Independent Variable
and below is the Indepen-
dent Variable. This Inde-
pendent Variable that is below is the Nodes and they represent the life itself. And

Left/Right Storyline
they represent the way in which the form is intended to operate in the life itself. It‘s
where we get this theme that we use in Variable called story line, this relationship
between the Design Nodes and the Personality Nodes.
The first thing is to grasp what it is to be a nine-centered being, what we are. We‘re
not very good examples of it, including myself. And I say that simply that we were
all born and raised deep into our lives as conditioned beings. And no matter at what
level, I am 23 years in this process, it is never going to be the same as what is poss-
ible for those babies that I know now who over the last years have been coming into
the world with Human Design parents who are going to be raised this way and never
have to deal with the conditioning dilemmas that we have to deal with.
The Nine-Centered Being
One of the things that I've often talked about is that Human Design was not given to
me to be some kind of repair manual. It‘s about guidelines for the development of a
nine-centered being and how a nine-centered being from the very beginning of its
life can operate properly. It's important when thinking about the nine-centered be-
ing to simply understand its tripartite life process, this three-part life process that
has its accents in Saturn and Kiron.
Basically what you get is that from zero to approximately the 30 to the Saturn, that‘s
what you're looking at is the child stage of the nine-centered being. We don't often
consider 30-year-olds children unless they‘re men because usually they‘re still rather
childish, but nonetheless, the reality is that the nine-centered being is basically
young, let's put it that way, in their first 30 years.
The Refinement of the Brain System
And in this first 30 years, the only thing that matters is that they are fed correctly,
dietary regimen. This particular being happens to be a caveman/cavewoman, the
kind of person that needs to eat one thing at a time and that eating one thing at a
time is a thing that is going to be healthiest for its brain system and going to allow
its brain system to differentiate so that its sense of smell, that‘s this 1st Tone, has an
acute capacity. This is all about the refinement of the brain system.
But again, the theme is always about cognition, this acute capacity to smell beyond
the obvious of aroma, to smell a rat, to smell success, to smell this or that, whatever
the case may be, that all this is a potential tool in this brain system when it‘s nou-
rished correctly. So, that‘s the first 30 years, nourishing it correctly and treating the
being according to their nature.
Here we‘re dealing with an emotional Manifesting Generator, split definition. This is
a child that needs to be raised according to its nature, needs to be raised so that it is
respected as a being and also to understand its nature, because without that there

there. So this combination of eating correctly, the correct dietary regimen to en-
courage the proper development, the dietary regimen is directly connected in babies
to neural expansion. It is something that is exceedingly important, along with being
raised according to your nature.
The Saturn Return to the Kiron Return
The next step in that tripartite process is when you get to that Saturn. That Saturn
to Kiron, the Saturn return and the Kiron return, two very special markers for us.
Here we are; we‘re Uranian creatures. Here‘s Uranus over here. On these vehicles,
this is the basic guar-
antee. If it was com-
ing out of a manufac-
turer, a manufacturer
would say it‘s de-
signed for a minimum
of 84 years, literally.
Birth Saturn Kiron Uranus
0 30 50 84 This is what it means
to have a Uranian
body. We don't have Saturnian bodies anymore. The seven-centered being was
Saturnian with its body; they were old. That‘s why so much of life took place so
early in the seven-centered being‘s life. This is our trip to the 84.
So, when we get to 30, this space here between 30 and 50, 51 because that's the
time of the Kiron return, this is the core of the life. And what I mean by the core of
the life is that this is where the story of the life is truly established. This is where in
combination of the environment and the perspective that the foundation of the
awareness of this being, the way in which it operates through the experiential life
over these 20 years sets the foundation for this period here, the so-called flowering;
this period where at this point one truly is ready to be oneself.
It is so complex, after all. And what we're talking about is the development of an
outer authority and true awareness, that is, the unique differentiated awareness that
is possible in any human being. So, this story line, where the life is established, that
basically what it does is that it is placing you within positionally what is your place in
the natural order even though the natural order doesn't exist anymore, and the nat-
ural order doesn't exist anymore.
Lao Tzu and the Natural Order
This is something that I mentioned in the first class about Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu‘s aware-
ness as a seven-centered being was understanding that mind was going to distort
the natural order until it disappeared. And again there‘s nothing to stop that; the
wheel turns. But here what we're seeing is that in the nine-centered being there is a
natural order. And not a natural order that is disappearing, but a natural order that
in a sense is established every time any being is in the right place operating correct-

ly. It is the possibility for individuals to be able to fulfill themselves even if the spe-
cies cannot, by at least they being in the right place at the right time for the seren-
dipity of the perfection of what their life can be. There‘s real magic in the story line.
Laying the Foundation for Awareness
And what the storyline is talking about in this natural order is that it really is saying
there is an absolutely correct environment for you out of which your differentiated
perspective, your unique way of looking at things is going to be exalted. This lays
the foundation for awareness.
This story line, this move-
ment going across, is really
an incredible thing, because it
is the foundation of what life
is.
The first thing that really is so
essential to understand about
what it is to be us is that
there is a way in which we
can simply surrender into a
mechanism that is going to
bring us to that fulfillment.
And it's simply about being
aware of what those mechan-
isms are and then watching it happen, because it isn't about making it happen. I
don‘t think there is anything more important for me to share with you than to say to
you, don't listen to what I'm telling you. Listen to your Strategy and Authority.
That is, any of the stages of transformation that are there in Variable, whether it is
dietary regimen or environment or beginning the process of experimenting with pas-
senger consciousness, are things that you can only approach when truly you're ready
to approach them. It‘s one of the most important things to understand. Everybody
has their timing.
But in order to get anywhere in this journey, it is not just a matter of Strategy and
Authority because frankly it is not sufficient. It is sufficient to give you a better life
than you had before and it will certainly take you through seven years of decondi-
tioning that will get you to a different place. But it isn't going to bring you the com-
plete process. This is for those that are really ready to journey all the way to that
place of awareness. It isn‘t for anybody.
One of the things that I really understand about what I've seen over the years, stu-
dents of mine, my own process over decades now, is it really has to be a very, very
deep part of you that this is what life is about for you. And everything about your
life is simply about what you're to experience, rather than being here to be con-
cerned about. It is this deep concern that we have from the mental plane about the

nature of our lives and the insecurities inherent in them that drag us away from
awareness every moment of every day.
One of the things about Human Design in Strategy and Authority is that that is the
greatest gift that it brings you, that it takes this decision-making control mechanism
away from your mind. It‘s the very beginning of things happening for you that are
correct for you.
Do Without Doing and Everything Gets Done
So, in understanding this journey we‘re about to take here in my going through this
story line, I really want you to grasp something so profound about all that is to see
that as you enter into each mechanism and surrender to it, you can just watch. The
Druid‘s had a great saying: Do without doing and everything gets done. It‘s one of
those sayings that nobody really understands, it just sounds good. It sounds good
until it actually is there and you recognize it, because this is what we're about. It‘s
not about the body not doing and nothing gets done, it‘s about the mind not doing
and everything gets done. The mind does not have to be in charge. The mind does
not have to decide.
The moment the mind isn‘t deciding, you get to see that everything just falls into
place, because everything is naturally correct for you. The big step is to understand
this transition, this transition from above, the brain/mind system, and being dropped
into a life, because that's what it is, because the Nodes are magical. The Nodes are
positional, they're not objects.
This is the neutrino feed that‘s coming from the stellar field. This is an ancient, an-
cient, ancient line of geometry that we‘re traveling along. And each of us have a
unique way in which we travel along this line of geometry, a way that allows us to
ultimately interpret experience in a certain way, to filter the experiential world in
what ends up being called our ‗perspective‘. It is this incredible movement in space
and it is what we call life, because here's where life is set.
Saturn to Kiron: Establishing the Foundation of Who You Are
It is this moment at 30, at the Saturn, until this close of this journey at the Kiron,
that here the foundation of what you are as a being, is intended to be established,
who you are, the way in which you operate in the world, the way in which you see.
All of that is to be established in this zone so that when the close of this comes, you
are ready to be fully occupied here in the process of translating the experiential phe-
nomena uniquely as yourself. And obviously uniquely as yourself without the agenda
of a mind that's trying to be in charge of everything.

The Variable Grid
So there is this place in this natural order. This is a one-quarter view of the Variable
grid of the 16 Variables. Here you can see that what unites these four different Va-
riables is the fact that they have the same storyline. And amongst us, and those of
you that are downloading this, are
different variations of this story line
in terms of the way in which it is
experienced as a Personality con-
sciousness. In other words, the
body has its life, but the Personality
has a unique way of looking at it.
One of the important things to re-
member about these Variable fami-
lies is that these Variable families
have an important connection to
each other. One of those essential
things to grasp in the natural order
of things is that there is a funda-
mental fractal layout to the way in which were intended to connect and share outer
authority. The fact is that these four families in the way in which experientially they
operate, their storylines, lay a foundation for sharing different perspectives on the
same kinds of processes. And together obviously a very enriched recognition or
enriched awareness field.
The Left and the Right, we have a combination here. We don't have a sameness.
There are four basic variations. There are the two that are the same, the Left/Lefts
and the Right/Rights. And here is the Left/Right and the other being the Right/Left.
They‘re very different from each other. There is no middle ground between the Left
and the Right. There really isn‘t. These are very, very different ways in which any-
thing is processed. They are the black and the white, the on and the off switch,
they‘re very much a profound aspect of the yin/yang of things in this bi-verse.
The Left Environment: Being Busy and Being Observed
When you're looking here at combination like this in
the story line, what it's saying first of all is about
the environment. The environment—you can see
that this is Left and the keynote is Observed. Basi-
cally what this means that these are beings that are
here to be observed by others. In other words,
they are here to be busy. Not busy observing any-
body else, but being busy and being observed in the
sense that they are the ones who are totally occu-

pied and in their activity they are able to catch the attention of the other. But
they‘re here to be busy. And they're here to be active in their environment.
You have a Left environment and you go into a room and it makes you drowsy, that‘s
a dangerous place. It‘s not a healthy place for you to be. Environments are there to
nurture your activity. Now, there's something again to understand about the theme
of activity. There are many different kinds of activity. This happens to be my story
line.
So I'm a Left/Right. I am not somebody—it would be a joke for anybody to describe
me as being physically active. I'm a single motor ego Manifestor. I have three open
motors. I use my energy sparingly.
At the same time I'm busy all the time. That is, I am very busy in my environment
and I‘m busy most of the time sitting still. My fingers may be busy and so forth and
so on, working with computers or whatever the case may be, but the reality is that
my physical body isn‘t being active, but I'm still being physically active in the envi-
ronment.
So, it‘s important to distinguish these things. Again, the way in which this is evi-
denced is in the individuality of somebody's design. There are people that are de-
signed to be very physically active and people who obviously for example, a Projec-
tor who isn‘t necessary designed to be active, there are these different ways in which
you can understand how activity can be interpreted. So, don't get carried away with
thinking that it means a lot of running around and these kinds of things.
Environment
In looking at a Left environment, here in this case environment is determined by the
Color. And you can see that there are six Colors. You can see that the bottom
three, the lower are called hardscape and the upper three are called landscape.
Basically it‘s the general difference between urban and rural. Yet at the same time,
there are many variations on those themes. For example, if you have Shores envi-
ronmentally, you need to be near water. You could actually be in a very urban envi-
ronment, yet at the same time be by the shores and that would be correct for you.
So again, it's important to recognize that these are very general keynotes. My work
in teaching all of this has been deconstructing these keynotes down into all their
possibilities. For example, if you're a Mountain person, it doesn't necessarily mean
that you have to live in the mountains. It would be nice, but at the same time, if
your job, your work, demands that you're in a community or that's what you like,
being in a city, it's better for you to be on the high floors in terms of where you
work, in terms of where you live. In other words, these values can be decon-
structed.

Environment Nurtures Your Life
But at the same time, being in the right environment is something that is extraordi-
nary. For this being, being near water is something that's going to be very impor-
tant for them. This is something that I know so deeply. I'm a Shore person and I've
been very, very lucky. I was born on an island, Montréal is an island in the St. Law-
rence River, I was born on an island, I‘ve lived most of my life on islands and have
lived on this island that I‘m now for a quarter of a century. I've just been very lucky
that I‘ve been by the shores.
The one time, because I've had some years of travel because of Human Design, the
one time that I left the shores, and my partner happens to be shores, we nearly lost
our child. It was one of the great lessons for me about paying respect to your envi-
ronment because it is something that deeply, deeply nourishes one's life. Dietary
regimen nurtures your body, but your environment nurtures your life. It protects
you.
It is in those environments that truly you are going to be healthiest, that you‘re
going to meet the right people that are there for you, that you're not going to have
to deal with resistance that breaks down your system and brings the possibility of
deterioration that is not healthy for a nine-centered being. We need to be healthy in
order to live the full potential of our 84-year minimum. This is what we are here for.
It is something that is so important to all of us. Our lives are not intended to be
measured in the same way that the seven-centered life was measured. We're here
to measure it according to our standards. And the best part of our life is our maturi-
ty. This is when we are capable of the most profound unique awareness. And it's
not about our desire for it or our natural intelligence for it, it‘s about mechanical
things. It's just mechanical things. It's about understanding that here's your map to
your place in the natural order, go there and watch and see what happened. That's
all, because that's what it's for.
And again remember,
this is an overview.
There are deep levels of
this. There is the ob-
vious of the general
themes that are there in
those Nodes themselves,
where this environment,
what is important in this
environment, what are the themes in the environment, and then what it leads to,
because what it leads to is the foundation of everything that the religions and all the
various spiritual movements have been seeking.

The Mechanics Strip Away All the Hyperbole
I‘m a mechanic. I may be a mystic, but I‘m a mechanic. It‘s the mechanics that
give me a sense of wonder, because it strips away all the hyperbole and the bullshit.
It strips away all the fakers. It takes away all of those beings that claim something
for somebody else. You can‘t claim anything for anybody else. And you can‘t tell
anybody. They have to get there themselves.
And they have to get there through their own truth. There isn't any other way.
There isn't. It‘s what makes this whole process so extraordinary, because you're on
your own. Yes, there are going to be people that will have the same Left/Right over-
all story line as you, but your gates, your lines, your Color, your Tone; nah.
We’re Differentiated Beings
We‘re differentiated beings. And unless you trust in your process you can‘t see. And
if you can‘t see, there is no point. I watched a whole generation of human beings go
searching, so many of them. I was here in the middle of it watching this constant
flow of western young people to the east looking for the mysteries, looking for the
truth, looking for the answer, looking for enlightenment, looking for awareness, and
they came back richer for the experience. But that's all. They did not come back
with what they sought, because they could not find it that way. You don't find it that
way. You can never find this truth at any master‘s feet. It's not the way that it
works.
It‘s why there is a manual. It‘s why this knowledge for whatever one wants to pre-
sume, the forces have laid out this knowledge so that we would never have to be
that seven-centered model of dependency, that we could live out the perfection of
our own process. This is what mechanics give you. It says here is the process, so if
you're paying attention, you‘ll see it. You'll see it. You‘ll experience it.
The Mind and Fear
It all goes back to the mind. It goes back to fear. It‘s what I see all the time in
human beings. I don‘t just see it, I smell it. It's fear. It is that fear of tomorrow. It
is that fear of not being able to do this, do that, get this, get that, escape this, and
find that. It‘s the mind totally controlling the being. And the Personality is just a
mechanism. If you're going to let this mechanism control you, you‘re going to get
what it gives you. You‘re never going to be able to stand behind that veil and expe-
rience the beauty of what it is to be a truly cognitive being, because this what we
are.
Everything about our existence is that our existence is a receptor. Our existence is
here as a kind of test tube for the Personality to suss out. This is what the passen-
ger consciousnesses is about. It is about filtering and exploring and investigating
and experiencing existence, not getting lost in the thing itself so that nothing is seen

and that the weight of the process becomes unbearable. It's about lightness and
freedom.
And you don't get that by wishing it, you get that by just simply living correctly.
That's the magic of having a manual and the mechanics. It's about following your
Strategy and Authority. It‘s about eating according to your dietary regimen and
living in your environment.
The Right Sees Peripherally
And at the moment that you're living in your environment, something really incredi-
ble happens. Because what happens is that you align yourself to what you‘re here
for. In order for us to be able to conceptualize, first we must see. Yes, the mind‘s a
lovely thing; very nice. But first we must see. It is physical, this seeing. And we all
see in a unique way. And here in this Left/Right combination you have in this Right
seeing and this Right seeing
sees what others don't see
because it sees peripherally.
It just sees.
And it sees it through a
unique a filter. We each
have a view. And it is that
view that is unique to our
differentiation. It‘s through
that view, that's what we can
master. We can master that
way of seeing on this road,
from environment to pers-
pective in those years that
are there to develop this.
We‘re here to specialize.
We‘re here to specialize in
the peripheral visual expe-
rience of seeing provocation and tension, of seeing struggle, these themes that are
here in this gate. And seeing them through a unique view, in this case the power
view, seeing the struggle to win, those that fail and lose, what works and what
doesn't work, keeping score, keeping score in the world of is there spirit, is there
purpose, and being able to see uniquely in that way and that becomes the founda-
tion of the awareness.
We’re Here for Outer Authority
But of what value is the awareness if it does not have its unique database of infor-
mation. It just doesn‘t happen. It ends up with a distorted mind. It never gets to

display its unique wisdom, because that‘s what we‘re here for, for outer authority.
The Throat with its eleven gates speaks volumes about what humans are about.
We‘re here to commune. And there is nothing like it. You know that right now. To
take in outer authority that has awareness in it is different. It‘s what we‘re about.
It‘s what we're here to share with each other. Each of us with our unique differen-
tiated perspective on existence, framed through our story line.
And by being in that correct environment, this is how you get there. It‘s like a tun-
ing fork. It‘s like a compass lining you up. It just sets you in the right direction to
develop this. Oh, what it is to be us. I think one of the most amazing things that
I've taught in my career is conception knowledge, the first 88° of life from the time
of birth. You get to see the way in which the mechanism unfolds. It‘s just a me-
chanism. This is the thing that is so extraordinary for me. You look at the very be-
ginning of life and the only thing there is the Design crystal and the Monopole build-
ing the fetus, building the instrument of existence.
Even when they call the Personality in, what is your Design date, that moment when
the Personality enters into the auric field of the vehicle, it‘s never allowed in. It's
always on the outside. It‘s the same thing when we die. The Design crystal and
Monopole come together and leave the body. And the body immediately begins to
decay and rot. The Personality crystal is just left behind. It‘s never really a part of it
at all.
Passenger Consciousness
And at the very core of what I teach is something called passenger consciousness.
Passenger consciousness is about experiencing the crystal, which is us, and not ex-
periencing through the Personality, which is a construct of the form. The Personality
in being attached to the vehicle, in the density of the maia, the passenger gets lost
and the Personality dominates. The Personality has all this power and all these roles
from the beginning. It decides this and that and all these things. It takes control of
life and therefore it has to take control of the consequences. And it's an endless
cycle. And the passenger is lost. And the life becomes the Personality‘s trip. In that
truly there is no awareness.
The Personality being outside of the body is something to keep in mind. It is some-
thing that it is deeply profound to take into your system. The Personality crystal is
relatively eternal. It began with the big bang. It is something quite extraordinary.
And it is at the threshold of filtering the most incredible life program ever; that‘s us.
Because that‘s what it does. It filters a life experience.
Color and Transference
What I love so much about mechanics is that they can take you there where no phi-
losophy can. Let me give you an example—Color. Color is really an extraordinary
thing. Color is the first level beneath a line. There are six potential Colors beneath
The Story Lines is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

32
Lecture Two
Left/Right Storyline
the line; six potential Tones beneath the Color and five potential Bases beneath the
Tone, the substructure. When you're looking at Color and you're looking at this 6,
Color is very, very interesting, because it is through Color that the information of the
neutrino going through the crystal gets transferred to us. It really is the dispatcher
of information.
The 3rd Color View: Power
And because it has this role, it has a transference frequency. It transfers. Color is
always shifting. And it shifts harmonically; the 4 and the 1, the 2 and the 5, the 3
and the 6. So, the moment that you have somebody like this being here, they‘ve got
a 3rd Color view. So here's the 3rd Color
view. It‘s called Power. Now, everything
about these people is that their perspec-
tive, their way of looking out at the world—
remember this is somebody that sees what
others don't see, because they see a huge
periphery. They see everything that's there
in front of them within that filtering con-
text.
And what they're looking at is who's got it
and who doesn't, keeping score, who‘s
winning, who‘s losing. And who‘s winning
and losing in who found the spirit and who
didn‘t, or who found their purpose and who
didn‘t, because this is inherent in the 39th
and the 38th gates as part of those channels and pressure is out of the Root center
pointed up. This is somebody that really sees the world and sees it under pressure,
and sees the winners and losers when they‘re by the shore, when they‘re eating
correctly, when they're operating correctly as a being.
Okay, so they're here to see the winners and
losers. But remember, something happens to
Color. It always transfers. And there is no
middle ground. It's like a seesaw. It‘s really
one or the other, basically. It's the black and
the white, the on and the off switch. And it
means that when you're in this mode, you‘re
in this mode and this thing doesn't exist. And
when you get into this mode, this disappears.
So what happens to this person? They are
here to see the winners and losers in the
potential struggles and the obstacles and all
of that stuff that is inherent in the way in
which their Nodes work. And they‘re here to
The Story Lines is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

THE STORY LINES

see it on the outside and see the periphery. But they will distract to seeing things
personally, seeing things through their own process, no longer looking to see what's
going on out there and losing track of it. In the moment that happens, their mind
gets taken with them because the mind has this perception as its platform. It builds
its conceptualizing on what is being perceived.
Noticing is Awareness
So think about what happens. There you are, you're operating correctly, you're not
caughtIn your mind‘s trip, you're in the right environment, and you‘re paying atten-
tion. And while you're paying attention, you notice that your mind is doing what it
normally does. You‘re watching it think about those things on the outside, watching
the ―this and that‖ relative to the nature inherent in this filtering mechanism and
then all of a sudden it goes like this and it distracts. And because you‘re paying
attention, you notice that you‘ve suddenly shifted from those concerns about the
outside world to suddenly your own internalized , a complete shift and you notice it
when it happens. That is called awareness.
You can even call it enlightened if you feel like it, because that is what it is. That's
what those terms are about, because you have to ask yourself a question, a very,
very deep question when that happens to you and you watch that distraction take
place. Who's watching? This is passenger consciousness. You're here to watch your
Personality. You're not here to be embedded in it. You‘re not here to get rid of a
distraction. By the way, it wouldn't be healthy to get rid of it. It is a balance. Being
dualistic, it's always good to have a little bit of the other side. It‘s just being aware.
It‘s not about getting rid of it.
It‘s about seeing that what you're really here to conceptualize is about that who's up
and who's down in the outside world, and what you learn from that because there's
so much you can learn, where purpose can be found, where spirit can be found, or
not. And yet, at the same time it's healthy for you not to forget about you and to
see things within your own context, to have time to think about those things as well.
But they are not the dynamic theme. And the more you watch, the more you see
that the natural balance in the seesaw will be there. Is it going to be like this? Or is
it going to be like this?
Awareness is Seeing Life Function Deep with the Mechanism
Story line—so think about what mechanics give you. The moment you start watch-
ing your own distraction, this is the moment that you can begin to live your cross,
you can begin to live your profile, you can begin to live your life, because it's the
moment you are free of interference and it‘s the moment that you‘re being aware.
We call awareness seeing what's happening on the outside. That‘s not awareness.
Awareness is seeing life itself functioning from deep, deep, deep within the mechan-
ism to that outside. It's an amazing thing to understand that your mind that you

think is so a nothingness in a way is so mechanical, is so rigid is so fixed, because it
is. It‘s only when we align ourselves to that, that's when we get the reward for be-
ing a unique creature, because we‘re all here to specialize.
What You Do Should Not Distract You
Now, let's get back to some basics for a moment. Let‘s think about this. You've got
this Left active environment and you've got peripheral vision. So the first thing to
understand about what you do is that it's important that what you do is not distract
you. Think about that for a moment. Think about what I'm really saying. In other
words, it's very important for people who are Left/Right to have those kinds of things
that they do that they do on automatic pilot, the things you do that don't require
your attention, everything
from operating things to
whatever it is, busy fingers,
the kinds of things that you
do repetitively, the kinds of
things you don't have to
think too much about.
Most of the work that I do
during the day for example
on the computer is just in
many ways repetitive and
predictable. It doesn't
require any kind of heavy
brain lifting, or whatever.
It doesn't distract me. So
my mind is free to be peri-
pheral, to look out in the
world and to look out in the
many ways that I can see. And it‘s something to understand those of you that ac-
tually have this particular configuration is that the moment, for example, like when
you're starting a job.
Let's say that you‘re somebody who is Left/Right and you're starting a job. The
moment you're starting that job is the moment that your awareness diminishes.
Your awareness diminishes because your focus is being locked into the things that
you have to do in your activity that is not something where you're naturally intended
to be focused on and so you end up not being able to be aware of what's literally
going on around you.
It's very important that the work that you do is something that is repetitive and
doesn't require you to spend a lot of time giving it real attention so that your mind,
your visual life can be free. And when you think about perspective as a visual thing,
recognize that it doesn't stop with the fact that you have to be looking at something

that is interesting. You can be sitting in your room looking at the wall. You're still
going to be processing all kinds of information through your particular filter.
Less Distraction, More Exalted the Potential of Your Awareness
One of those things to grasp about what it is to be a Left/Right story line is that the
less distraction you have in your work, the more exalted the potential of your aware-
ness. So finding ways to do things efficiently, to work out mechanisms to be able to
just move through things so that you don't have to give a lot of your attention to
something, that is going to be very, very important.
It always will come down to the basics. What you do is not a decision that your mind
can ever make for you. It‘s just not the way that it works. And everything about
what it means to be environmentally correct is that the environment is always con-
nected to the activity that you're going to do or the level of activity or the lack of it
that is necessary for you in your life for you to be healthy. It's healthy for these
beings, these Left environment beings, to be active in their environment, whether
physically active as I described or otherwise active.
Yet at the same time, to really be clear that that activity is not what they're about.
It isn't. The activity simply sets up the potential for them to be able to get the re-
sources they need in life, while at the same time being able to expand their aware-
ness. They need to have those things where they can have that advantage of being
able to let their mind float, if you will, and move away from what it is they're doing
at the conscious level. It‘s very, very important for these being. So, it's something
to keep in mind.
Two Ways to Approach Human Design
The other thing is obvious. There are two ways to approach Human Design. Most
newcomers approach Human Design for the potential advantages of their Strategy
and Authority. And that's something that's good. It's healthy. Anybody who enters
into that catalyst is at least giving themselves an opportunity to really make a differ-
ence in their life. For many of them that's sufficient. It helps them, obviously. It‘s
easier for them to understand themselves and to be able to make decisions, to be
able to see their relationship to others, very basic things that add to the quality of
life.
It takes seven years to decondition at the cellular level. But in order to take the
other path in Human Design, not simply ―my life is better now, thank you very much,
I understand things better.‖ But to actually fulfill the potential of what it is to be a
nine-centered being, what it is to be truly different. Then you have to take this jour-
ney. And the journey is one that requires a discipline that can only be there out of a
love of the process itself. I think that like all processes it has its ―this and that.‖ It
would only be natural for it to be dichotomous in the way in which it affects us in

times that are difficult and times that are easy, but it's always expanding your
awareness, always.
Nothing to Hope For, but Patience in the Process
It is the first time that human beings truly have a way in which they can nurture
their vehicles uniquely. Dietary regimen, PHS is a revolution all of itself to be able to
truly nourish yourself in a way that is correct for you in order to enhance your cogni-
tion, your brain system, your body. It's an incredible gift. And when you bring to
that a recognition of environment, everything is put into place. There is nothing
here that you have to hope for, truly.
You do have to be patient. It‘s like any process. Everything takes time. But you
don't have to be hopeful that you will get a result. They are there. It's about living
it. This is the deep end of the pool. This is the deep end of the experiment, to nou-
rish yourself correctly, to live environmentally correctly and to start paying attention
to your Personality and its dynamics, because you'll discover something about your
Personality. It belongs to your body, and you are the passenger. You are outside of
that. You do not have to be embedded in it. It is there for your entertainment, your
enlightenment, your awareness.
It is to be grasped, understood, respected and watched. And it‘s to be used and
used well, so that mind can be used in a way in which outer authority is expressed
and finally we have a consciousness field that isn't just smart. It's aware. And that
we can begin to have relationships not based on having the same agreements about
this and that, but being able to commune with others who are unique and with
something unique to share, as you do.
Pay Attention to Your Mind
This is what we‘re here for. And you can get to that mechanically. The most impor-
tant exercise of all, once you do the physical things, is to pay attention to your mind.
Watch for distraction. Find out what your distraction is, what your view is and sit
back and watch. It‘s an incredible thing to see, because the moment you see it, and
you will see it, you have to realize that this is something that was written out in a
lecture, in a manual, in the book, it‘s just a mechanism. You don't have to be at-
tached to that mechanism in the way in which you had been in your life assuming it
was you. It's not you. It‘s what you live through.
We Live through Our Forms
We live through these forms. We experience life through these forms. And these
forms are holistic. They are Personality and body. We live through it. And you can
only do that A) when your mind is never in control and B) when you're watching it do

its thing. What a beautiful thing to be a passenger and to watch the unfolding of
your life in the way in which it was intended to unfold.
And because all of these things are laid out mechanically, and those of you that are
interested can always get in touch with either a PHS Practitioner or a Rave Psycholo-
gist, dig into the details. The moment that you have all of that laid out, it doesn't
mean that there's anything to do. It gives you all of those things that you can watch
and see. You can just see them unfold, because that's what they do.
We are Not in Charge
We‘re so used to thinking that we run life. This is the mind. Mind is so busy thinking
it runs everything. It doesn‘t run anything; nothing. We‘re not in charge of any of
this. This is all the Personality and its distortion field trying to make things up in
order to give it a sense that maybe, perhaps, it could control something. It doesn‘t.
And all you have to do is just follow some mechanical things and sit back and watch.
And you get to this incredible place, this place of the passenger, this place of this
thing that is watching, that you realize is watching and yet it's so deep at the root of
all experience that the best that we can do is experience it.
Meeting Your Passenger
It‘s a magical thing. It‘s ancient. It's our ancientness. It‘s what we're really here to
be in touch with. I always find it kind of a black joke of people and their interest in
past lives. And here we are all of us endowed with Personality crystals that are 15
billion years old. And most human beings never are even aware that it's there. I tell
you; the moment that you catch yourself in distraction you'll meet your passenger.
That's what this is all about. And it gives you the courage that you need to complete
the process, to stay disciplined in this journey, because it requires that.
Self-Love
And it only grows out of one thing. It grows out of the growth of self-love. The
moment that you trust in your nature and you allow it to guide you, it is a joy to see
what happens and it's exciting to ride that journey into its potential, beautiful, beau-
tiful potential. And no dream, no hope, just a program, just a plan that‘s there that
lies in the mechanics. All it takes is the spirit of readiness and good fortune. And I
wish that to all of you.
Thank you for participating in this. I hope you enjoyed it. And until next time, all of
you take care. Bye for now.

Right/Left
Hello and welcome to all of you and welcome to story lines. Let‘s get this started.
Everything about what it is to be us, that is, what it is to be a
nine-centered being is that we are here to be aware. The basic
construct is that the infrastructure of what makes us what we
are in the holistic sense is all rooted in cognition.
The graphing that you're looking at, Maia Mechanics Advanced
Imaging, was developed for Primary Health System and Rave
Psychology in order to be able to display the infrastructure. Infrastructure is some-
thing that is so deeply important about the nature of who we are because in fact we
do not start at the surface, the way people are taught Human Design, but we are
imprinted from the Base up, from Base to Tone to Color to line to gate to channel. It
is this infrastructure that gives us a unique way of looking at what it is to be us, a
different kind of mechanical perspective.

Variable is to Awareness what Type is to Form
And that perspective has a name. We call it Variable. Variable is to awareness what
type is to form. In other words, Variable lays out the mechanics for the expression
or the ultimate expression of awareness. That's really quite something to think
about. That is, a mechanical way in which the differentiated awareness can and will
express itself given that the mechanics are correct. It always comes back to the
mechanics. It‘s like being a musician. You may have an incredible musical spirit,
but if you miss the notes there is a real problem.
The mechanics are essential in order for the spirit to be released, in order for the art
to be released. And it is so in terms of Human Design that Human Design is a way
of attuning ourselves. It is refinement in our frequency and the constant refinement
of our frequency ultimately results in awareness.
The Variable Arrows
This theme of Variable, Variable you can see (below) is constructed on these arrows
and these arrows are indicators of what
we refer to as Left-ness and Right-ness.
So here you can see the Right and here
you can see the Left. And they are de-
rived from Tone. On the way up, in
terms of the way in which we are im-
printed, Tone represents literally the
interior of the crystal. That is, the crys-
tals of consciousness, the Design crystal,
the Personality crystal. It is when the neutrino frequency and the neutrino itself is
moving through the crystal is that here is where the cognitive architecture literally
expresses itself.
The Dependent Variable
And we have these four places in
which cognitive architecture is ex-
pressed at the surface and is ex-
pressed through these symbols of
Variable. We are nothing but cognitive
creatures. It is what we are here for.
And when you're looking at this grid
and you're looking at Variable, recog-
nize that Variable is something that is
divided into two different kinds of as-
pects of Variable.

Right/Left Storyline
Above is the Dependent Variable (see page 2.) The combination of the Sun/Earths,
both Design and Personality. This represents the brain system, the Design side
Sun/Earth, brain system. And over here the Personality Sun/Earth mind. So this is
the brain-mind part of Variable.
The Independent Variable
Below we have the Independent Variable which is made up of the Design and Perso-
nality Nodes. Now, the Nodes are really extraordinary. In the way in which the Sun
and Earth are always moving direct, the Nodes are moving mostly retrograde.
Where the Sun and the Earth are deeply impactive objects in our lives, the Nodes
represent nothing more than positioning in the heavens.
The Nodes are extraordinary. They are a window on the neutrino ocean, a neutrino
ocean that is saturated with solar influence, the 70% plus of neutrinos we receive
directly from the sun, and therefore the sun's power in our lives. But the Nodes
represent something really different. It is information that arrives from outside of
our solar shell, or our solar system, as it‘s referred to in astronomy.
Everything is Moving
What we have here with the Nodes, this window, is we have this line, this trajectory,
this geometry, this movement in space. It‘s the most basic thing to grasp about the
maia is that everything in the maia is moving. Nothing is still. No matter what the
illusion of stillness, nothing is still. Everything, everything is moving. And we have
been moving from the beginning. We know that the initiating point that they refer to
as the Big Bang that out of that came a uni-directional movement. It's all we have
been doing for 15 billion years. And at the very beginning with the Personality crys-
tals that we carry, who we think we are, that is, the passenger behind the veil of
who we think we are, those crystals have been traveling along that trajectory for
billions of years. It is an old line and an old journey.
One of the most beautiful things for me about the nature of the Nodes themselves is
that they represent almost this majestic tale of ―it-ness,‖ the movement of con-
sciousness, and in that movement mutation and through that mutation serendipity
and out of that serendipity well, you end up with a place like Earth and us. And
we‘re all caught in the geometry.
The Foundation of the Story Line
What you get to see in the Nodes, the Independent Variable, is that this is the life.
Think of yourself as, let‘s play, a demon. And you want to get into a body and go for
a ride. We have all kinds of stories in our mythologies about these kinds of things,
being taken over, avatars, all that stuff. But you see, this is something to grasp

THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
about the nature of being is that you've got this brain-mind system that is dropped
into a life and the life determines everything. It determines everything. It is, from
here to here, the foundation of this story line where the nine-centered being is in-
tended to mature.
Our Conditioning Began with Food Conditioning
We are a tripartite program; zero to 30, to the Saturn return that fundamentally
what is important is that we eat correctly and that we are treated correctly. It‘s
what all of us missed. Our conditioning began at our mother's breast. It is where it
all began and it began with food conditioning. And we were all deeply, deeply condi-
tioned by the time that we had reached our first cellular cycle of seven years. One of
the most important things about
being able to take advantage of
something like the story line as a
mechanical way to awareness is
that your body has to be ready
for that, that your brain system
has to be ready for that. It's
essential.
And everything about what it is to
be correct on this plane beyond
the catalyst of Strategy and Au-
thority, that is, the game chan-
ger, is that you refine the way in
which you take nutrition into your
body in order to awaken the cog-
nitive focus that is there for you
as a being. This triangular symbol, the symbol of Tone, the mirror of the triangle
that you see in the BodyGraph, the architecture that fits into this holistic form re-
leases the potential of consciousness. It is here this 1 that the mystery of the poten-
tial of this being begins to awaken. It begins with their sense of smell, because this
is the sense that is here.
We are to be Differentiated in our Refinement
Everything about us is that we are here to be differentiated in our refinement, every-
thing that is revealed in mechanics as a unique application to a being depending on
their database. Each of us has a very differentiated way in which we're here to fulfill
our purpose but fulfill our purpose we are here to do. And it is not something to
wish or hope for. It‘s simply something to grasp that the mechanics are here and
that the best that you can do is somebody who started their life conditioned is to
grab onto this is radically as you possibly can.

Right/Left Storyline
Again, always my proviso in all of that is to grasp that the knowledge and myself, we
can be very seductive. What you do in this life is not up to anything that seduces
you; it's up to what is correct for you in terms of your Strategy, your Authority be-
cause there is a timing for all of these things. The average nine-centered being that
is going to emerge in this world, babies who are already being raised accordingly by
Human Design aware parents, these children, that first 30 years, 30 years of eating
correctly, of developing that sensory capacity, and being treated as a Generator,
being respected as a Generator, being given the opportunity to live their life, grow
up as themselves, not grow up or grow into something that is conditioned.
Saturn to Kiron: Living Out Your Story Line
By the time you get to that Saturn, you open a phase that leads to Kiron. That is,
between 30 and 50 years of age. These 20 years are deeply important to the devel-
opment of the nine-centered being because it's during these 20 years that you get to
live out your story line. And your story line begins with environment. This is the
finishing touch, if you will, the perfection of the physical processes. Where the
Sun/Earth are about the mechanism of the brain and its system, that everything
about the Nodes is fitting that into a life in the world that‘s in action, being able to
handle the dense maia.
It‘s not enough to be correct on the inside, or to be correct alone in a cave some-
where, because we are not alone. The moment that there is the other, the moment
there is the program is the moment that all of the conditioning elements open up.
It‘s through the form principle that awareness can emerge. It is the greatest lesson
of Human Design. Before anything, get the form right.
The Correct Environment Protects You
And environment provides you with two things that are deeply important to provide
you with quality of life. Quality of life is literally about providing you with an envi-
ronment that is as nurturing for you as a life force, as your dietary regimen as nur-
turing for your internal system and its need for correct nutrition.
Environment provides you with a kind of protection in terms of the way in which you
meet others. When you're in your correct environment there is less resistance in
your process. And less resistance in a lifetime adds up to youthfulness, because the
elimination of all of that resistance is eliminating an enormous amount of deteriorat-
ing pressure on the system itself.
We are Uranian Beings
One of the things I repeat over and over again about trying to grasp what it is to be
a nine-centered being, we are a vehicle that's designed for a minimum of 84 years.

THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
We are Uranian beings. We‘re not here for the short haul. We‘re not here for the
30-year program of the seven-centered being. It's not what we‘re about. And yet at
the same time, the fact that the mechanism is designed for that minimum doesn't
necessarily mean that you can get it there in a healthy way. We already know, be-
cause the evidence is overwhelming, that we're living in an age of great age. Gener-
ations now, there are thousands and thousands of people in the United States today
that are over 100. Never before have we had this kind of longevity.
My mother is 98 years old. These things are really amazing. And one of the things
to grasp about these vehicles is that they will give us good service, incredible physi-
cal service, if we treat the form correctly. And it isn't the obvious of what people
think, exercise and this and that. It isn't. It is about being you. It's about following
whatever your differentiated program happens to be, because everybody's unique.
Environment Brings Quality of Life
But the thing to grasp about environment, the first level of environment, is that envi-
ronment brings you quality of life. And it's this quality of life that is so, so important,
because it's important for you physically. If you‘re not healthy it's very, very difficult
to spend your time transforming your process consciously. It is a deep distraction to
be unhealthy. And it is not what these vehicles are for. They‘re intended to be ab-
solutely perfect at maintaining the integrity of the system as long as they're operat-
ed correctly.
The Perspective
But there is a second thing that environment does. And it's the magical thing that is
there in the Nodes. In the advanced studies in Human Design, in Holistic Analysis
studies, we work with something
called the Link Nodes. Basically
the Link Nodes are agents of the
Monopole. And it's literally hold-
ing us together in the illusion of
that separateness. There is a
unique bond that exists here, that
the moment that this is correct is
the moment that this is aligned,
and this is your perspective. In
other words, the moment that you
click the pieces together and they
fit in—Strategy and Authority,
dietary regimen, environment—
automatically the perspective
locks in. And this is the foundation for the awareness process.

Lecture Three
Right/Left Storyline
Now, there‘s something to think about. What I understand about the nature of the
nine-centered being is that the nine-centered being is here to live the privilege of a
life determined by awareness. It's always been part of our mythologies, our fanta-
sies, our concepts about various spiritual messengers and the like, a life that is dedi-
cated to a higher level of consciousness, a life that‘s dedicated to a higher level of
consciousness because the mundane plane is not a concern.
The Nine-Centered Natural Order
You see we have a very different kind of destiny, a transformation in the way in
which we commune. As seven-centered beings we were caught between our ani-
malness and our evolving humanness, our connections to the other, the way in which
we dealt with reproduction, sexuality, gender roles, all of those things. We‘re nine-
centered beings in which despite the fact that we may come from a similar gender or
a similar race has nothing to do with Human Design, because Human Design is only
about the unique individual. It isn't about anything else.
And each unique individual has a responsibility in the perfection of their differentia-
tion to express their unique authority. That‘s what it's about. And in order for a
human being, a nine-centered human being, to have the life that is correct for it, it
needs to be in the right place in the nine-centered natural order.
The Variable Grid
This is from the Variable grid, the 16 different Variables and the way in which they
are laid out. It is one of my things that I enjoy so much about the synthesis in Hu-
man Design, the continuity through traditions both exoteric and esoteric. The magic
square is an extraordinary thing. And
Variable is a magic square and there
is great wonders in such things. Any
of you who have a Variable mat, and
they‘re around that you can look at,
it's quite something to ponder, be-
cause what you're looking at is the
way in which we‘re intended to be
organized. It isn't going to happen.
So it‘s not about seeing it from that
perspective, because again it is not
the point.
The point is about recognizing that
when you are in the correct place
within that construct, that natural order, that you‘re aligned to a process that is
going to bring about your differentiation. But not only that, it allows us to see very,
very deep relationships that we have, connections that we have with others that you
would never otherwise see. It‘s one of the first things to do if you have a collection

of charts and you know their Variables and you have your family and you have
friends, whatever you can add together, and then you just place them on the map
and you begin to see some very interesting things. It‘s one of the joys of Variable
actually.
Fractal Connections to Others
Here you can see a commonality and the commonality is that we're dealing with
Right/Left, Right/Left, Right/Left, and Right/Left. In other words, there are four
variations in four different families that have this overall theme of the way in which
their story line, their physical life, but their brain-mind system is different. And
there is a unique bond that exists between these beings in terms of the receptivity
and recognition of the nature of the other's life. Despite the fact that the way in
which they interpret it and the way in which they themselves experience it is quite
different. It is an underlying fractal connection, a geometric connection to others.
The Right: Observer/Passive
Let's get down to our story for today. Right/Left—and you can almost feel the ten-
sion. If it was two magnets, the way they would be pushing each other away. Let‘s
think about what we‘re actually looking at. Let‘s think about the Right. Let‘s look at
the keynote of the Right. The keynote of the Right is Observer. It means that this
being here, that their environment is an environment in which fundamentally they
are there to be passive.
The beings that have the
Right environment are
the beings that are here
to display all the symp-
toms of laziness, lack of
motivation. When I say
that, part of that I'm
saying with humor. That
is, being misread as
those things.
And these are beings that
because of conditioning
around them are going to
be forced to be active
beyond the point that it's
healthy for them. The
environments that truly
nurture them are environments in which they can be relaxed. Because what they're
here to do is they're here to take everything in in a deeply focused way; everything.
This is the observer. They‘re there in the environment not to be impacted in that
sense by the environment, but to be part of the environment to take advantage of

Right/Left Storyline
what they can see in that environment, what they can meet in that environment,
what they can watch in that environment.
Environment Theme is based on Color
Everything has to come to them. They‘re cave people. When you look at this theme
of environment, what we're looking at is a theme that is based on Color. And there
are six Colors. You can see that the bottom colors are lower and are called
hardscape, and the upper three are called landscape. They‘re basically the differ-
ence between what is urban and what is rural, but they can be deconstructed. In
other words, you can be still be in the Valley environment by being in the bottom
floor of a building in a city rather than being on a high floor. In other words, there
are ways in which the values that are here as keynotes can be deconstructed.
The Cave Environment
Take the example that we have here of somebody who is a cave person. One of the
things about cave people is their sleep problems, and it starts in childhood. You put
a cave child in their bedroom and there are two doors, one that leads in and out of
the room and the other one goes to a bathroom, a closet, whatever it may be, and in
some cases, three doors in these rooms. That child is going to have a very disturbed
sleep pattern, is going to have nightmares. There's going to be a lot of fear in their
process. And it's simply because they feel deeply insecure.
Cave people are at their best when there's one door. My advice to parents who have
cave children is do put one of these room dividers in front of the view from the
child's bed so that they cannot see if there's other doors so they cannot see them. It
totally makes it different in their sleep pattern.
So cave people need their secure environment. There are modern variations, to sit
in your car, whatever the case may be, moving caves. But it's really about a need
for security. And that need for security means you do need to protect yourself. This
person does need to protect himself. And in that cave they can relax. And they can
relax and do what they do best.
And the way in which they observe, because everything about them being in this
laid-back mode, it doesn't mean they don't do anything. Please understand that.
But there is a totally different frequency to a Right being who is in the right environ-
ment; they are not going to be very active. They're not. And they‘re going to take
things in a much easier or a slower pace. They control the door. It‘s one of the
things that‘s very important for them is that control of the door.
Here is somebody who has real ambition, somebody who's here to really start things.
And yet at the same time, this ambition and starting of things can only take place in
their cave when they‘re correct, and only take place not when they're focused on
that, on doing something in the cave, but grasping that whatever they are doing as

long as they are allowing themselves that being relaxed, they‘re going to be able to
take in what they need to focus on.
These are the kinds of people that could be a jeweler, as an example, somebody that
has not a lot of physical activity, activity nonetheless, it is work. Yet at the same
time, needs to be very, very calm, very relaxed and deeply focused at the same
time. There are many, many variations of this combination. It can be virtual, that
stillness and the deep focus on a specific subject, obviously, that is going to be on
the other side.
Again, when we get to this side we get to something that is really different. We
finally cross the boundary of dealing with just form principle. This is a very, very
important boundary line. In many ways, it‘s the moment that you truly leave behind
the remnants of seven-centered homogenization, truly. Because once the vehicle in
the various aspects of maintaining it, once the vehicle is properly maintained and
respected, there is no longer that need for the mind to be absorbed with the life
process.
Awareness takes Time
One of the reasons it takes time, awareness isn‘t something that just is there. It‘s
so obvious in the nine-centered being, its life pattern, it takes 20 years to set the
foundation for awareness, 20 years of being in the right place looking in the right
way to lay that foundation for that quality of awareness that is a potential in a being.
But this process of attuning your body is actually the thing that makes the difference
psychologically. Every step that you take on the physical side of Design is a step in
which you move further and further away from the chance that your mind is going to
be able to take control again of your life.
The further you move away from that, the sooner the mind begins to find its true
purpose. Mind is such a beautiful thing. To be all caught up in this low level mun-
dane Personality distortion is an enormous waste of what mind is. These steps that
you go through, the Strategy and Authority, the dietary regimen, by the time you
get to those stages, dietary regimen and environment, you‘ve been deep enough in
this process to have shed a lot of the mental assumptions that had ruled your life.
Mind has to be Free of its False Responsibility
The mind has to be free of its false responsibility to guide you in order for the mind
to become aware. It has to. And it doesn't mean that your mind stops being exactly
what it is for you right now. It doesn't mean that has to change. What has to
change is it cannot tell you what to do. That‘s the boundary line, because I watch
people in the form principle, I watch forms transformed and Personalities struggle.
It is all about getting to this place where you can allow mind to really find its way.

Perspective
And you don't have to hope for that and you don't have to dream of that. This is
what I am always in awe of, of what mechanics brings is that perhaps the most awe-
some of the mechanical tools that are
there in Design begins with your pers-
pective, because it actually opens up a
way for you to lock your mind into
correct perspective, and a perspective
that is not conditioned by your Perso-
nality. It's not.
Let‘s think about how that works.
We‘ve got a focused way of looking at
things, a focused perspective. When
we're looking at perspective, again
we're looking at Color. But there‘s
something to grasp about Color. It‘s
very different on the Design side than
on the Personality side. On the Design side, Color fixes. So, if you've got a 1st Color
cave person, you never get transferred over to being a 4th Color mountain person
and wanting to be in the mountains instead, because it fixes.
4th Color Perspective: Want
But it does not fix on the Personality side. It doesn‘t. Our Personality consciousness
is here to be attuned into the bi-verse, to duality. And the way in which our aware-
ness program operates is dualistic in order to give us depth in order to give us pers-
pective. So when you're looking at
these Colors and it's the Colors that
determine what the key is, what the
key perspective is, in this case it is
seeing what is missing in the world.
It's seeing Want. It‘s seeing what's
missing. It can be an extraordinary
gift and deeply, deeply influential. It is
a way of seeing.
And yet, Color on the Personality side
moves. This movement we call dis-
traction. When that 4 gets pulled over
to the 1 and starts thinking about sur-
vival, starts being concerned and fear-
ful about things, starts worrying about this and that in terms of what it's seeing, and
seeing issues that are not what it is about. This movement, this distraction is nor-
mal. It isn't to be gotten rid of. It isn't to be fixed. It operates a lot like a seesaw in
the sense that you have one level of the distracted element, in that case it would be

the 1, and the ideal is that is the way the seesaw works. Most of the thought
process is being conditioned from here rather than here.
Think about what that means. Up here (yellow star) is where the Personality
Sun/Earth is, where the mind is, where you conceptualize and where the motivation
is for conceptualization. But conceptualization, to form concepts, those concepts,
has to arise out of something. What they arise out of is our perspective, a perspec-
tive that is rooted in environment in which we are healthy and correct in that envi-
ronment.
Laying the Foundation for Conceptualization
Whatever is going on here lays the foundation for the way in which the conceptualiz-
ing is going to unfold. So if you're not in the right place and you don't see correctly,
you're thinking about stuff that you're not good at thinking about because that‘s
basically the way it works. The moment that environmentally you‘re correct and
your perspective is correct is the moment you're offering to your conceptualizing
potential precisely what you're good at, precisely what you are good at not just
simply thinking about, conceptualizing, but ultimately expressing that as your outer
authority.
So, this zone over here, what happens to you is that if you're operating correctly,
then that 4 (Personality Node Color, pink star) is what‘s going to dominate. It's
going to be the basic foundation of the way in which you are going to look at things
and conceptualize them. But, if you are not correct and you get stuck in your dis-
traction, then you end up offering up to your conceptualizing field all of these things

Right/Left Storyline
that you're not here to be thinking about, that you're not very good at thinking about
and of course, in the not-self, you make all these decisions based on stuff like that.
Distraction
So, it‘s very interesting to understand this mechanism
because it opens up an incredible doorway; the 1 to
the 4, the 2 and the 5 and their relationship, the 3 and
the 6. Now, think about something. Each and every
one of us has a unique movement. For example, I‘m
here to see through the 6 and my distraction is the 3.
So, I'm here to see things through my very personal
lens. And the distraction is for me to be keeping score
and looking at the losers and the winners.
I can always tell when I'm being distracted, always.
This is something that I've been watching now for
years and it's a very funny movie. I watch myself
being pulled out of what is my envelope and being
dragged out into thinking about the winner and loser in
this and that as if it has any kind of importance and finding my mind actually think-
ing about that, conceptualizing it. And of course, it's not what I'm about. It isn't.
I'm about the unique expression of my particular awareness out of this unique
frame. Yet at the same time, if I only had that I'd be very one-dimensional, because
I wouldn't have the harmony, the other side, and be able to see what is going on out
there. Because it‘s very nice to be caught up in the higher awareness and blah,
blah, blah of my personal perspective, but I can't fail to recognize that there are
those that are suffering, that there are those that are not doing well on this plane. It
gives me that perspective.
It's not a bad thing. It's only a problem when it becomes what you think is impor-
tant, rather than recognizing it for what it is. It is something that keeps you aligned
in terms of your conceptualizing so that there is depth in the way in which you look
at things. But you can watch it happen. You can watch it happen consciously. Each
and every one of you has a unique perspective, a specific Color. And there is its
harmony, the distraction. The themes are very basic.
Who Noticed?
Just watch, because if you're paying attention to that—and understand something
really profound, you can‘t pay attention to that if your mind is concerned about all
the things that you're worried about, because it just doesn't work that way because
you're not going to notice because you‘re deep in the conditioning. But the moment
that you do notice, and I'm not the only one who has noticed, the moment that you
The Story Lines is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
do notice because it‘s there and you will recognize it, in that moment you‘re aware.
And there is this absolutely fabulous question that comes with it: Who noticed?
The Personality Crystal
Everything about awareness is coming to grips with what we are. We are passenger
consciousness. There is no more beautiful work than looking at the first 88° of life.
It‘s a great study for anybody who's interested in such things. From conception, the
building of the framework, and there you have the Design crystal and Magnetic Mo-
nopole, there‘s no Personality crystal. There isn‘t going to be a Personality crystal
for many months. This is the cabal of the form principle, the Design and the Mono-
pole working together to build the form to keep it on its track, to align it to its life.
At some point the Personality crystal gets called. The Personality crystal isn't even
allowed to enter into the form principle itself. It‘s held in the aura. It is above the
scalp. It is not part of what appears to be our holistic body. It's an outsider. It's
like that when we die. At the moment of biological death the Design crystal and the
Monopole link together, leave the body and leave the Personality crystal behind.
Watching Your Personality
There‘s something to grasp about this Personality crystal. This is truly the most
ancient ―I‖ you could imagine, and it's yours. It‘s your ―I‖ and it goes back forever,
literally forever. This is what the Personality crystal is. It is here to filter conscious-
ness. It is here to experience cognitive awareness. It‘s what it‘s here for. In that
moment when you notice yourself transferred, what you're noticing is your Personali-
ty. You're watching your Personality, the passenger. This is what we‘re all about.
We‘re so used with the Personality just to look out of eyes and watch the world that
way. But this is watching the world from behind at the Personality, just watching it.
And you can watch it.
You don't have to do anything. When you‘re correct, life just unfolds, truly. The
whole ancient symbol of a lotus, these magnificent clichés of the past, they carry
such deep truths because it is what it is. It's an unfolding. And there is no reason
for any human being who has access to this knowledge not to be able to fulfill the
mechanical requirements. It doesn't take any special mystical gift.
I have always noticed from the moment that I began my journey, the one thing that
could make me angry as a Manifestor was somebody trying to exalt awareness into
some kind of incredible, unattainable, enlightened field and all that stuff that goes
with all that. I could feel the rage, because it‘s such a terrible lie and it is so igno-
rant.

Right/Left Storyline
Awareness is Our Right
Awareness is our right. It is a mundane thing. It's the Personality getting in the way
that creates all of this delusion. The moment that you're behind that Personality,
just allowing your life to be lived out without interference, it‘s the moment that
you're aware. It‘s the moment that you're on your cross. It's the moment that you
live the costume of your profile and your design and your lines and you watch it.
You embrace it deeply as the magic, because this is such a wonderful place to be,
the passenger, so free.
Right-Ness
And this focus in this being, this focus in those of you that have this Left, this is a
real focus. This is what conceptually you're here to bring. Out of this capacity of
yours, this Right-ness of yours, to be able to take in, to be deeply connected to the
environment that you're in and through that to be able to have the perspective ne-
cessary. Remember again, you can be in a room with the door closed and no win-
dows. It doesn‘t mean you're not seeing. This isn‘t just about visual sight. It is
about perspective. It is about the way in which the whole frame of the life move-
ment points outwards, the way you take in what is out there.
It always goes back to the basics. No matter how sophisticated the intelligence,
Human Design is a simple thing. It can't be anything else. It‘s the natural way for
us as nine-centered beings to live. These are simple things. They are basics. You
eat correctly; you act correctly, or treated correctly as a child you learn to act cor-
rectly that when the time is correct that you enter into your story line as a being that
is whole. We‘ve had to go through this whole long deconstruction, break things
apart, shatter things. The cruelty of what conditioning has laid on every one. And
that most human beings will never get out of that. They will never get to that place
in which they can see the distraction.
Dedication, Discipline and Love
And all it takes is the dedication and discipline and the love. You‘ve got to love the
process. This is part of the magic. Human Design, despite the fact that it's simple,
doesn't attract fools. It attracts very bright people. There is so much here to stimu-
late the mind, the awareness. There is so much here that‘s possible when you get
your physical trip on this plane together. Most human beings are just rigidly stuck in
the dilemmas of being on the material plane. And it‘s because the mind is not
equipped to deal with that. It‘s why we have billions and billions of people that are
hungry, because the mind is not equipped to deal with that.

And it's only when we surrender to our nature, we are not killers and grumblers like
the seven-centered being. This is not what we do. It‘s not what we‘re about. We're
not here to be threatened by the world we live in. We‘re here to navigate it. This is
what this is all about. It is only when you can let go in that navigation, when you
can set the automatic pilot, that you can put your feet up and you can begin to take
in the panorama of what existence is, because it‘s magnificent.
Simple things; bowing down to the body and just allowing it to take you where it can
take you. When I first started my work as a teacher in Design, I obviously had to
put a great deal of stress on the Sun/Earths, people understanding the two calcula-
tions and the emergence of crosses out of that, all of these various things. And
though the Nodes were part of my earliest teaching, I taught something called the
Cross of Life, the Sun above, the Earth below and the Nodes on either side.
A Mechanical Gateway to Transcendent Consciousness
It‘s only over the last six years, seven years that it has struck me how profound this
is. Because here is a mechanical gateway to what so many beings have sought,
transcendent consciousness, and something that doesn't require a drug, a master. It
doesn't require any of those things. It‘s why all those things existed because every-
body was trying to get there to know how, didn't know what it really was. It was
always based on a model rather than understanding that it's unique in its expression
each time. Oh, the beauty of that.
So, here in this Right/Left-ness, to really settle into the security and the comfort and
the feeling of relaxation in your environment, meet the world there and you will see
with that acuteness, and you will see in the world that you look at what's missing.
You'll see what is lacking. You'll see it through the themes of your Personality
Nodes, through the themes of the 38 of the 39, this search for purpose and spirit.
You will have your unique way to lay the foundation for your mind and what it can
grasp and what it can share. You see how wonderful it is to recognize that in a way
each and every one of us has a goal that amounts to a unique awareness, a unique
awareness, because only we are equipped for it.
We are Here to Establish Unique Truths
That is how for me in looking at what it is to be, how beautiful it is to recognize that.
It‘s just normal for a nine-centered being. It‘s just simply there. The knowledge is
new. It‘s 23 years in the world. This is a whole variation of a species that‘s slowly,
slowly waking up to its nature. And in waking up to our nature, we‘re surrounded by
the remnants of the seven-centered world, its religions, its philosophies, its concepts
none of which truly suit any of us, because we are here to establish unique truths
and to live in an age in which the material plane does not determine the theme of
life, but is simply a platform for the process of living. It‘s something truly different.

Right/Left Storyline
This is what we‘re here to live. And it‘s why I always talk about time, because trust
grows over time. Human Design will show you over and over and over again it can
be trusted. And every time you trust in the knowledge as it applies to you uniquely,
and each time you recognize you get the confirmation that you need for the process
that you've entered into, you move closer and closer to surrendering to your form so
that you can ultimately spend your time paying attention to your Personality, watch-
ing it, enjoying it, seeing what it is, and through that perception seeing not just
yourself, but the other in the world around you in a totally different way.
The Life Form is What We’re Here to Experience
I‘m a mechanic, but I‘m a mystic. All of this came as a mystical thing. My relation-
ship to passenger consciousness and to the Personality crystal is a mystical thing for
me. That's the real magic. That crystal has lived through forms through time. It is
not atomic. It isn't anything like this form that's talking to you and the way it thinks
and what it does, because your Personality crystal is in that sense alien. It‘s dark
matter. It does not function in the same way as the atomic material that it rides.
And I never forget that. I never forget that I'm not just simply a passenger latched
onto a life form, but the life form is what I'm here to investigate. The life form is
what I'm here to experience. That's a totally different place to come from.
And you begin slowly to get to your variation of that place because we are all unique.
When you begin to recognize the mechanics of your Personality, when you move
away from the mechanics of your mind, you begin to see the mechanics of your body
and you begin to see the mechanics of your mind. It‘s an amazing thing, that these
are just patterns. They‘re just patterns. And you can free yourself in accepting that.
It‘s not like you can change those mechanisms. But you can experience them in an
incredibly profound way.
All right, I hope you enjoyed that. Enjoy your journey. Until whenever, all of you,
you take care. Bye for now.

Right/Right
Hello and welcome to all of you and nice that you are here. One of the most ex-
traordinary things about Variable is the nature of the Right and
what Right-ness means and how important it is for us in terms
of the time we live in and the times we are moving towards,
that Right-ness is something that is recognized, that is grasped,
that is respected and has an opportunity to be able to emerge
and flower in a way which it was intended.
Story Line is Derived from Variable
Here in this particular grouping we're looking at the Right/Right. Before I get into
that let me give you a basic backdrop of this. Story line is something that is derived
from Variable. And Variable is something that can be seen in AI Imaging. That is,
this is a tool that‘s used for PHS Practitioners, Rave Psychologists to be able to look
at the deep levels that are there in somebody's design. At this particular level, one
of the key ingredients is working with substructure. Basically we are imprinted from
the Base up. So, from Base to Tone to Color to line to gate, this is the way in which
our programming operates.
Tone: The Cognitive Architecture
Tone is something that is really extraordinary. These arrows (see next page) that
make up Variable are rooted directly to Tone. And Tone, you can see by the very
design of it in its mirroring of the overall triangular design (circled) of the BodyGraph
that this is where the real mystery of life is because this is where the inner architec-
ture is, the cognitive architecture. At the very core of what we are, at the very core
of our programming, we are here to be cognitive creatures. We are here to be
aware.
In fact, there has never been a more sophisticated vehicle for the potential of cogni-
tion than the nine-centered vehicle, never. As a matter of fact, this vehicle, this
construct is simply built for awareness. However, it's new. I think that so much of
its newness is that without the infrastructure to understand what it really means to
be one of these nine-centered creatures, one gets helplessly lost in the homogenized

maia and never gets the opportunity to live out the beauty of what it is to be a nine-
centered being.
Anyway to go back to cognition, everything about us is cognition and we have these
four places (circled) in which cognition is determined. These four places basically
represent four steps in transformation in a human being. All of this is catalyzed by
Strategy and Authority. You follow your Strategy and Authority and once you have
entered into that process and that process is correct for you, because after all it is
your process, you‘re the one that has to recognize its validity. It has to work for
you. And the moment that you're at that stage, that's really the moment if you are
truly after the fulfillment of your purpose on this plane, the next step is to come to
grips with what is demanded in terms of the physical system.
Variable is Divided into Two Parts
Variable is divided in half, into two parts. The upper part is called the Dependent
Variable and this Dependent Variable up here is made up of the Design Sun and
Earth, that's the brain; and the Personality Sun and Earth, that's the mind. So you
have the brain-mind system that is above. And below what you have is the Inde-
pendent Variable. The Independent Variable is about the life itself, the physical life
itself. It is here that we have story line. That is, the relationship that is here be-
tween the Design Nodes and the Personality Nodes.

Right/Right Storyline
Everything about us is about the fact that, given mechanics, there are ways in which
we can align ourselves to the frequencies that are correct for us. To align ourselves
to those frequencies is a matter of mechanics. The mechanics begin with the vehicle
itself. Everything about what it is to be us is about understanding that the nine-
centered being is here to live a different kind of life.
The Right/Right is Connected to the Future
As a matter of fact, every one of you who are part of this program who carry the
Right/Right, it is almost a time of desperation to be correct because in fact, you're
given a story line that is deeply connected to the way we‘re intended to be, our fu-
ture, and yet still caught in the seven-centered philosophies and religions, the ho-
mogenized world that we live in, a world in which your uniqueness is not something
that is valued.
It is really important to grasp how profound is the possibility that is there in mechan-
ics to be able to live out what is correct for this particular form. And one of the main
themes is to recognize that we're not here to be lost on the material plane, densely
caught up in the maia. We‘re not, because we're not here to be caught up in the
mind‘s trap.
Strategy and Authority
Everything begins with Strategy and Authority because Strategy and Authority is the
first thing that's ever been in existence that can take the power of decision-making
from the mind. You think about that, because it is a fact. It is the only thing that
will take decision-making away from the mind, because after all, what could replace
the mind? There has never been replacement. We have a replacement.
We are a Binary Consciousness
One of the most interesting things about Human Design coming into the world was
its binary nature to begin with, to recognize that we are a binary consciousness. We
are not a singular consciousness at all. As a matter of fact, one of the things I like to
remind students of is that you‘ve got 88° of the sun between these two calculations.
They‘re very different.
Not only -are Design and Personality different, they‘re different in very, very pro-
found levels. One of them I'll show you today. So, we have two ways in which we
are conscious. We are binary consciousness. And our dilemma is that everything
has been placed on the shoulders of the Personality, which has led to the dysfunction
of us as nine-centered beings.

THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
The brain system, the mind; it‘s one of these oddities that we have that we have to
deal with in terms of the nature of mind is that it defines our existence. It defines
everything, doesn't it? It‘s what you rely on for feedback on a moment-by-moment,
breath-by-breath basis that connects you to this illusion of being alive and conscious.
Mind has this enormous capacity.
The Nodes are Gateways
But it's something to grasp about this brain-mind system that that's what it is. It‘s a
brain-mind system. It‘s still. It‘s waiting for something to happen. What it's waiting
for is life. That‘s what the Nodes are. For me they are as magical as anything can
be. They‘re like a compass, aligning us to an ancient geometry of ours that goes
back to the very beginning of time itself. The Nodes are gateways. They‘re posi-
tions. They‘re just gateways. The neutrino ocean pouring through and pouring
through from beyond the solar system, the solar shell that so deeply programs us,
our solar earth configurations.
But the Nodes are our rail line; they are our mystical path from the past to the fu-
ture. It is an incredible thing. And we ride that; truly we do. And that brain and
mind system is dropped into a life program, a life program that is conditioned by
those Nodes. It‘s the beginning of being able to establish a certain clarity in your
awareness, to begin to recognize that the body, that the life is not yours. And what I
hope to show you is that the mind is not yours either. It‘s not any of those. It is
simply what you‘re a passenger in, what your passenger of.
The Nodes: Environment and Perspective
So, when you're looking at the Nodes themselves you're looking at something very
special. They represent two things. They represent environment and they represent
perspective. and built into that is something really to grasp about how profound the
form principle really is.
You start off on your way. The first thing to understand is that following your Strat-
egy and Authority is certainly going to eliminate basic burdens from your life. You
go through a seven-year cellular deconditioning process. You're going to come out
of the other side of that a healthier and better human being in terms of the way in
which you see yourself and you live.
Self Love
Yet, that's not all that's possible. It's a wonderful thing, but there's so much more
that's possible. But to get to that place that's when you have to descend into anoth-
er level of whether you can do such a thing for yourself. You can do such a thing for
yourself. It‘s why I talk about enlightened selfishness, self love, because if you can-

Right/Right Storyline
not do it for yourself, it cannot be done. It‘s one thing to experiment with your
Strategy and Authority; it's another thing to go to work on correcting your form.
And it is only when the form is correct, and I will show you the mechanics of it, is
only when the form is correct that there is this potential for transcendent awareness.
PHS is the Key to the Transformation of the Physical Life
But it comes out of the mechanism being correct and the mechanism is twofold.
That brain needs to be properly fed. This is one of the things to recognize about
Primary Health System. Primary Health System is the key to the transformation of
the physical life, because the moment that you start taking proper nutrition into your
system you‘re not just changing the way in which your physical body operates.
You‘re changing not only the way in which your brain system operates, but you're
actually differentiating in that you begin to put the nutrition to work in those areas
that differentiate you. And in this case, for example, the differentiation is this deep
potential for inner vision, this extraordinary depth of brain that‘s there, this capacity
for storage that is inherent in that and the development of that, the growth of that.
There is something to understand about us. The mechanics is really a manual. It‘s a
manual to the way in which these things are built, the way in which they work and
the way in which to maintain them. And then there are all of these nuances, all of
these differentiated possibilities of what we get in a vast population pool, all of the
potentials that arise out of all these possibilities. And yet, to be clear about some-
thing, it is a mechanism. It's a mechanism.
So, if you are bringing the right nutrition into your vehicle, that's the moment that
you're going to bring out the heightened sensory capacity that is there. In order to
be able to express higher levels of consciousness and awareness, you have to be
able to do so out of a brain system that is attuned to that, is aligned to that.
These are vehicles. It is a frequency. The distortion in most people's lives can be
measured as a frequency distortion, the way in which the Monopole captures the
information from the crystals; the distortion frequency that leads to people being
homogenized and not-self. You follow your Strategy and Authority, you begin to
align yourself to what is the correct frequency, but the body is filled with deep condi-
tioning, physically, psychologically, cellularly.
Time and Loving the Journey
It takes time. The only reward for patience is patience. It takes time. That‘s why
you have to love the journey. You have to love the journey. And you can't love the
journey on faith, on hope. You love the journey for the realizations that you have as
you go along process.
The most profound thing that happens to people who get involved in Design and get

thing they discover is that while they‘re working on their form, they‘re already
watching their awareness be transformed, because it is. Because the more you align
yourself to what is correct for you, the further your mind is away from making the
decisions in your life, the more intelligent and aware you become.
This is one of the things about understanding the nature of mind that mind is bur-
dened with the maia in trying to control it. As long as the mind is trying to control
the maia, the mind is not an advantage. It‘s a disadvantage. It‘s why the form
principle is so important because it is the only alternative. We are a binary con-
sciousness. And it's about putting the responsibilities where they belong.
Pregnancy
At the moment of conception for the first 88° of life, that is movement of the
Sun, so approximate the first trimester of a pregnancy, there are only the Monopole
and the Design crystal. They built the vehicle. It's their vehicle. The Design crystal
is there to operate the form, and the Monopole is there to give it its direction. It
holds it together and it gives it its direction. That‘s life. That fetus, that vehicle, is
all the responsibility of the Design crystal and the Monopole.
88° of the Sun before birth when the neo-cortex is ready, the Personality crystal gets
called in. It isn't even in the body. It‘s above the scalp. The Personality crystal is a
passenger in a vehicle that was prepared for it. You're in a vehicle that was pre-
pared for you. It is not your vehicle, truly it is not. The Personality that this vehicle
has that you identify with, this is the vehicle. The mind that you identify with, this is
the vehicle. It‘s all the vehicle.
This is the grandest joke of all. This is why we are here to be passenger conscious-
ness. And through allowing the vehicle to operate according to the correct guidance,
we navigate correctly on this plane, we eliminate the resistance, we follow our diffe-
rentiated line, we fulfill our potential.
The Real Nine-Centered Life has Three Parts
Now, if you're looking at a real nine-centered life, the real nine-centered life has
three parts. From birth to Saturn, about 30 years; dietary regimen, eat correctly, all
of us were conditioned the moment we came into the world by food. Our children do
not have to be; our grandchildren do not have to be conditioned by food. And for
those first 30 years, food and who you are as a being, this emotional Manifesting
Generator and what it means to raise an emotional Manifesting Generator so that
they are correct within themselves, feel good about what it is to be them, under-
stand their nature, fed correctly.
It's from Saturn to Kiron, this 20-year interregnum in the middle is where the story
line is, this movement between the environment and the perspective, this combina-
tion that is here. It‘s when you get to this age, when you get your Saturn return,

Right/Right Storyline
that it's time for you to enter into the correct environment, because it is that envi-
ronment that is going to nurture you on the outside in the way in which your dietary
regimen is going to nourish you on the inside. It‘s going to provide you with quality
of life.
It‘s going to allow you not simply to be able to develop and mature in a healthy way
so that you can have a full Uranian lifespan, but at the moment that you are envi-
ronmentally correct, physically correct and correct in the way in which you operate,
you‘re automatically aligned to your correct perspective, to be in the right orienta-
tion, to see what only you are here to see. And it‘s this very seeing that ultimately
gets translated into the concepts that will be part of your thought process that will be
what you can deliver as other authority.
Variable Maps the Way Humanity is Grouped into Consciousness Fields
Variable is an interesting thing. Variable represents a kind of map. It‘s a way of
being able to see the way humanity is grouped into consciousness fields and the way
we‘re intended to operate in these consciousness fields. There has always been a
natural order. It‘s something that Lao Tzu understood. He saw that the seven-
centered mind was going to end the natural order. As nine-centered beings, we
cannot restore that order that's been lost. We cannot. However, we can find our
place where we should be in the natural order in order for us to attune ourselves,
align ourselves to precisely the right frequency.
This is one of the things that is so deeply profound about Variable, because it is
about cognition, consciousness awareness, because it is the individual mapping for
the themes of consciousness and awareness that to see them in the grid, to see
them in the Variable grid and the magic square of the Variable grid is to see a whole
new movement and network of consciousness.
The Evolutionary Movement
You can see that every single one of these four
examples of this cognitive family all have the
Right/Right in the Nodes. Now, not all of them
are all Right, which is the extreme—the all Left
is up here(circle, upper left corner). This is the
evolutionary movement, this movement that is
going from the all Left to the all Right. This is
what the future is about. It actually has a future
that has a binary structure to it. It has a future
that is moving this way in which is the move-
ment towards humans in the future, nine-
centered humans like us, and this movement here which is the movement to nine-
centered Raves in the future, which will come after 2027. Two lines of movement all
moving towards Right-ness.

The Difference between the Left and Right
Now, let‘s think about the difference between Left-ness and Right-ness. At the sim-
plest level, everything about Left is that Left is deeply, deeply, deeply strategic.
Everything in Left-ness is strategic; everything about Left-ness has a purpose. His-
torically it is an aspect genetically that we have inherited from the seven-centered
being. They were only strategic. We are this
and that. We have one foot in the past and one
foot in the future, because we are an interreg-
num, we are a transitionary form. We are the
midwives of the nine-centered process that's
leading to the rave.
Right-ness is new and it's different. When I say
it‘s new, it's been here before. That is, it was
here in the time of the Neanderthals. Neander-
thals were five-centered Right beings. Our re-
cent ancestors, our recent human ancestors were seven-centered Left beings. So we
are carrying both sets of information. Yet, when you look at somebody who has the
Right/Right as a story line, what you're looking at is that this is a life that's intended
to embrace our modernness, what we are as a nine-center being. It‘s very different
for those beings who would have this Left/Left. They can still keep a connection to
the seven-centered way of living.
But this is not true if you're Right/Right. There is only deep, deep conditioning and
the Right is more deeply conditioned than the Left. We live in a Left dominated
world, the way our children are educated, the way in which job descriptions, and the
way in which all kinds of things on this planet operate, they‘re almost exclusively
strategic. The receptive has only in the last a couple of centuries begun to be recog-
nized as a sort of the arty, something different. It's not really the same.
Environment is Determined by Color
Let's take a look. The first thing to understand about environment, first of all, the
way in which we are intended, the environments we‘re intended to live in, the way
we‘re intended to filter experience, are conditioned by Color. That is, the theme
below the line. It is Color that actually transfers information to the holistic life. So,
Color is a very important agent. And here you can see that Color determines the six
different kinds of environments and these environments are divided in half between
the hardscape and the landscape, between the basically urban and the basically ru-
ral.
Again, something to keep in mind, these keynotes can be deconstructed. So, there
are ways in which any place on the planet, let‘s say any city on the planet, you can
find the six variations of environment in that one place. In other words, these values

Lecture Four
Right/Right Storyline
can be deconstructed. The mountains can be the top of a building where the valley
can be ground floor. The shore can be having an apartment on the edge of a park.
There are all kinds of variations that are possible in terms of understanding this not
places per se, though that obviously is an aspect of it, but understanding these as
themes and seeing them as environmental themes. So, depending on what your
Color is in terms your Design Nodes, that Color is going to fix and it's going to de-
termine what is the correct environment for you.
The Right Environment Keynote is Observer
Now, we're dealing with a Right environment. I want you to think about this. The
keynote is Observer. The Right being takes advantage of their environment. What I
mean by that is that their environment feeds them. If you're a Left environment
person, your environment is where you do your thing. That‘s different. The envi-
ronment almost is pointless, in the sense that you're into your thing.
But if you're Right, your environment is something that you're taking in very deeply.
So that your environment needs to provide you with that stimulation relative to what
that is. Here you can see Nodes that are connected with Inner Truth and The Pre-
ponderance of the Small, Detail in thinking about things. Here is a classic situation
in which you're dealing with somebody who needs their environment to inspire them.
So the environment for these Right beings becomes very important.
It's also important to understand that the Right being, as an observer, cannot be
distracted by their own activity. The Right being is an observer and cannot be dis-
tracted by their own activity. So the quality of activity in the Right environment is
one that has to be really not one that takes a lot of attention. It‘s not Left that
needs to be focused on. It‘s just something that is a natural flow.
The Correct Environment Reduces Resistance
But the real key is the recognition of how
important the environment is as the inspi-
ration. This is what being Right in envi-
ronment is all about. This is a mountain
being. Ideally this could really be about
mountains. In other words, somebody that
would really flourish physically, because
everything about being in the Right envi-
ronment is that it reduces resistance, it
increases the quality of life, and of course it
aligns you to the potential of being aware.

THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
So, the environment is something that's very important. The mountains, the high
ground for this person becomes the place that inspires them. It‘s at the high ground
that they can really begin to look for the inner truth, that they can really find the
detail. They need to be above things rather than deep inside of them. They need to
have that kind of environmental advantage. And they‘re there to be the observer of
it. They‘re there to take it in.
So, their environment invites that. And it doesn't matter whether it's their personal
environment, their work environment, their social environments, whatever the case
may be. And to recognize that when you're dealing with the upper Colors and you're
dealing with the upper environments, they‘re very broad. Mountains, the high
ground; the high ground at the top of a building, the high ground in the mountains
themselves, the city that‘s high up in the mountains, the village that‘s high up in the
mountains. It can be any number of places per se, but the theme being on the high
ground, this is what leads to the observing of the truths that are possible here.
What You Do Does Not Matter
If you're going to be Right/Right as a story line in this life, what you do does not
matter. If you have any reaction to that, it‘s because you've grown up in a world
conditioned by the strategic Left. When I started this series of lectures yesterday, I
started with the Left/Left and I started with what you do defines you. That was my
line to the Left/Left. And here we are Right/Right. And what you do does not define
you. It does not. There is no thing that defines you.
Surrender
This is one of the most beautiful things about the Right-ness and its relationship to
where we‘re going. You cannot live the purity of a Right story line unless you‘ve
surrendered completely to your vehicle. Your mind will drive you crazy otherwise.
To have a Right/Right story line is about surrender. It‘s about allowing everything to
unfold for you.
And it does not mean that anything that you have to do at any time in order to pro-
vide for yourself and it's something you've entered into correctly that truly it does
not matter what it is because it will never be the point for you, because the point for
you is that you are taking things at an extraordinarily deep level, and ultimately you
are seeing things in a way that nobody else can see.
The Doorway to Awareness
This is the magic of Right-ness. This is what Right-ness brings us to. And the mo-
ment that we‘re operating correctly, again, the themes, the dietary regimen, always
Strategy and Authority, that there is an extraordinary relationship that is here in this

Right/Right Storyline
construct. That is, this Independent Variable. The Independent Variable is made up
of Link Nodes. The Link Nodes act as
agents of the Monopole to hold us together
in the illusion of our separateness, literally.
And so, it is something to grasp about the
perfection of the form principle. From
Strategy and Authority to dietary regimen
to being in the right environment, when these things click into place, when the form
is aligned to its correctness, this doorway
opens up. And this is the doorway to
awareness itself, to the transformation of
consciousness.
The thing that I so deeply appreciate
about Human Design is that mechanically
it provides a way to what so many have sought and failed to discover, because they
didn‘t‘ know how to get there. It‘s a wonderful thing to know how to get some-
where. It‘s a wonderful thing to have a map and to be able to recognize as you go
along the signposts that say, yes, I am getting there.
In the Story Line You Plant Your Cross
This is an enormous transformation. This is a huge step, because this is the very
foundation of what it is to be us. It is here in the story line that you plant your
cross. That the cross itself begins to define who you are as a being, that you begin
to live out the pure essence of your profile. This is your maturity. This is the place
where you frame what is going to be the post-Kirionian flowering of your life. And
this is something that happens when you align yourself correctly environmentally so
that your perception, the way you see things, the way you filter experience is cor-
rect.
Color Transference and Distraction
Again, we‘re dealing with Color. But I
mentioned earlier the difference between
Design and Personality. Take Color for
example. When we're looking at Color and
we‘re looking on the Design side, we see
that this is a 4th Color, this is fixed. This is
a mountain being. It's only the mountain,
in that sense thematically, that is correct
for them as an environment.

67
THE STORY LINES
A Digital Book for Students
But when we come over to the Personality side, Color is
different, because here Color is moving. It‘s called transfe-
rence. Now Color moves on this side, but it gets fixed by
the original imprint. But here Color is never fixed. It's
always moving. And it moves in harmonics: the 1 to the 4,
the 2 to the 5, the 3 to the 6. It moves in harmonics. And
that harmonic movement in our view is called distraction.
We have a pure view, here, Probability, and we have a
distraction, here, possibility.
Probability and Possibility
Now, think about what that's like. Here is this person and the way that they are
supposed to see, the way they're here to filter experience is that they‘re here to see
it in terms of probabilities. Now, probability isn‘t cer-
tainty, but probability is a good bet. In other words,
probability is what they're all about. They‘re here to
see what's probable or not.
Now, look at the distraction, the transference that takes
place. They get distracted to possibility. They can get
confused. They can begin to think of a possibility as a
probability, and begin to think that that's going to be a
probability. And of course, as not-self with the mind
being what it is, making decisions based on those
things. Now, here is somebody that when they are correct in their form principle,
when they‘re environmentally correct, it aligns them to their correct perspective.
That correct perspective is to see probability.
Now, the probability should be most of the way they see, not the only way they see.
It's very important to understand our awareness is based on a binary tension. And
that it's essential that probability sees possibility, learns not to be confused, and
helps them in that sense to grasp even better what is probable. The dilemma is the
not-self, because there is no control over this mechanism. None. It moves.
Perspective Lays the Foundation for the Way We Conceptualize
What happens is that this here, perspective, our view, is what lays the foundation for
the way in which we conceptualize (see the illustration on the next page.) It lays the
foundation for the way in which the mind is going to think, what it's going to think
about and ultimately how it's going to express itself. That's what you get. So, it's
deeply dependent on what is offered to it as material. If you're not correct, if all of
this is just the not-self, you‘re not operating in a way in which you‘re using the tools

that are there for you for your benefit. It means literally that you're not giving your
mind what it's designed to be an expert at, what it‘s designed uniquely to work with.
Outer Authority
Environment Perspective
binary tension
Perspective
Distraction
Seeing Peripherally
Now, think about the situation here, two Rights. This is about seeing peripherally.
Everything about the Right/Right story line is that you're here to absorb and you're
here to allow life to come to you. This is the whole magic of being a Right being.
The one thing you don't have to be concerned with the moment you're truly following
your Strategy and Authority, is where your life is taking you. It‘s taking you precise-
ly where you need to go. All you have to do is just sit back and do what you do
best, which is to take in the experience.
There will be a time when we‘re deeply dependent on the Right because these are
the beings that store. At the brain-mind level, they have enormous capacities for
storage of information, of concepts. At the life level, it‘s this capacity to take in the
full richness of the life experience. These are deep, deep, deep masters of what it is
to be here in the maia. That‘s what they're here to bring forward to their mental
The Story Lines is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

THE STORY LINES

system, this way of grasping, of taking in the maia, of being able to grasp the nature
of beginnings, ambition, all of these things that are inherent in the information that
is there and being able to see the probabilities in that, and being able to see proba-
bilities that nobody else can see.
Right-ness is Determined by the Correctness of the Other
The magic of Right-ness; but everything about Right-ness is determined by the cor-
rectness of not just itself, but the other. If you‘re a Right being, it is the other that
draws from your well, all that depth. It‘s the other that takes advantage of your
environment so that you can take them in, that environment of yours that allows you
to be able to absorb, to observe, to get to the inner truth, to get the facts by taking
in what‘s there, processing it, seeing it and seeing the probabilities and laying the
foundation for what you can express out of that as a concept.
Now look, all of seven-centered religiosity, spirituality, mysticism has all sought this
transcendent consciousness. And one of the things that I take offense at is the as-
sumption that this is special. I look at the seven-centered being in the same way
that I look at my dog, honestly I do. That is, they‘re another species. I don't think
intellectually my dog will ever be impressed by me and I think that's true for the
seven-centered being. There is a limitation. We all have limitations. We have ours.
We‘ve got a nine-centered limitation. It's our limitation.
The Nine-Centered Being is a Perfect Mechanism
What‘s clear to me is that the nine-centered being is a perfect mechanism, perfect in
the sense that it embodies for each unique being the possibility of perfection, that
that can be achieved mechanically. It is something that is really astounding when
you think about it, that the transcendent awareness that was such a wonder to the
seven-centered being is and should be nothing more than a mundane normal thing
for what it is to be us. This is the real truth. We are here to be aware. We are de-
signed for awareness. We‘re designed to be cognitive. And you cannot indulge in
the higher levels of consciousness if you're stuck on a mundane plane in your mental
trip. You can't.
The only way that you can liberate the mind is when the mind can be fully absorbed
in a new process, a process ultimately that leads to the breakthrough of real aware-
ness. And it begins here with perspective. And it begins here with this phenomenon
of movement that's called distraction.
Probability Distraction
Think about this being. They‘re here to see things specifically in terms of probability.
And seeing things in probability leads them to think the way they do. In other

Lecture Four
Right/Right Storyline
words, they think about what is probable. Now, every once in a while they get stuck
in possibility. Now, anything is possible. Literally, anything is possible. It's a totally
different way of thinking about something. And here is somebody that is supposed
to be here most of the time thinking about the probable, not getting lost in the poss-
ible because it‘s everywhere.
Now, think about this person understanding that this is a mechanical phenomenon
that their mind is going to do this. That it‘s going to change perspective on them.
And it's going to change perspective on them without warning. They may be in the
middle of a conversation with somebody and their mind jumps from probability to
possibility. There are all kinds of ways in which this emerges. It‘s just something
that is going to happen and it's going to happen throughout the life. And it's a me-
chanical thing. It‘s a pattern that your mind is attuned to. That is, your mind is an
expression of that pattern.
Okay, so what happens? You get to see it take place. You notice it. You notice it
because one of the beautiful things about Personality consciousness is that we do
learn, and the learning has a quantum impact on the way in which we see. You take
the information into your system and then, lo and behold, you get to see it. You get
to see that moment, experience that moment, where the distraction takes place.
Passenger Consciousness
Well, that's quite something. That's awareness. That is what awareness is, because
who noticed? This is the whole point. It‘s about passenger consciousness. It is
about the ancient incredible filtering mechanisms that our Personality crystal is. It‘s
what we're here for. Not to take in life crudely through the eyes, but to take in life
from behind the Personality to see what we are here to be passenger of. It is not us.
It is not you. Your mind belongs to your vehicle. It is a mechanical byproduct of it.
That's why it can be such an incredible satori to actually watch your mind follow the
pattern that‘s written on a piece of paper that says your mind is going to shift from
to this and it just does. That‘s just the mechanism. The passenger is not that. The
passenger is experiencing that. And the moment you stop being connected to the
density of your Personality, you can actually pay attention and you can catch it and
you can begin to live it, to live passenger consciousness, to allow your vehicle to live
its life, because it's operated correctly. And then to be able to flower in awareness,
because the mind is liberated, it is free. And the perspective is totally different to be
behind that veil.
Trust Your Strategy and Authority
And for Right beings and for those of you that are carrying specifically, because there
are other variations in terms of the Dependent Variable on top, for those of you that
have the Right/Right story line, trust deeply your Strategy and your Authority to take
The Story Lines is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

THE STORY LINES

you to the activity that is correct for you. Don't be concerned about what it is. How
much it pays. I'm being quite serious about this. It‘s really something to grasp.
Everything about being correct begins with the decisions, the basic decisions that
Strategy and Authority rule. It‘s so important for a Right being not to get caught in
all the Left propaganda about what you should do with your life and what you need
to do with your time and what activities you should be busy with and what things are
of value to do and aren‘t of value to do, all that stuff; forget it. Forget it. It truly
has nothing to do with you. It only distorts your life.
Surrender to what it is to be somebody who has such a modern, such a futuristic life
line. You need to just surrender to that in order to be able to fulfill its deep poten-
tial. And you do this through the body. And once you've done it through the body,
then you can pay attention and you can discover the beauty of what it is to be aware
on this plane. We have special opportunities. It is a deep privilege to have access to
the manual just to be able to see how it works, just to be able to see that each and
every one of us have our own journey. And that we each can have a signpost that
we need to reaffirm for us in our process this movement over time, because it does
take time, everything does.
The Homogenized World is Just Mental Suffering
When I was filled with wonder of the knowledge 23 years ago, it is nothing like what
it is today. It is an extraordinary thing to live this, to live it, to give up all of this
mental pain, because it's just mental pain. This homogenized world is nothing but
mental suffering. And it's so easy to leave that behind because the vehicle will guide
you, it will do its job. And if you‘re a Right being, you have nothing else but your
Strategy and Authority to trust; nothing else.
Deriving Wisdom by Taking In While the Doing Gets Done
You cannot work it out strategically. It's not what you're about. It is a different kind
of life. It‘s a life in which instead of you looking for life, life comes to you. It‘s the
readiness to embrace life. It‘s the most beautiful things about the Right/Right story
line. It is a life that embraces living it. That is there to take everything in, and when
I say everything, obviously relative to its slice of the maia. But it is there to take it
in deeply and densely, while at the same time being very at ease in the physical
dimension, able to float through this plane.
The Right is not here to be condemned for its Right-ness. But, we are living in a
strategic world. That's what the not-self is and it‘s deeply distorting. It takes a lot
of courage to be unique. It does. To be a Right/Right story line, to know that what
you do does not define you can be a deep liberation or a pain in the neck when it
comes to dealing with all these people in your life who have some kind of expectation
about what they think they think you should be or you should do or what your mind
can do with all of that.

Right/Right Storyline
The deeper the Right-ness is in your Variable, the more profound the need to sur-
render quickly to your form principle. You can't afford to allow your mind to try to
control your life because the mind does that strategically. This is what Lao Tzu was
complaining about in terms of the natural order being lost by the seven-centered
mind. It's what mind does. Mind is always planning. It‘s always conniving. It's
always got something up its sleeve. This is mind. This is not what it is to be Right.
It‘s not.
So, the real thing is to get past the psychological barrier and to allow your Authority
to take you to that place that is correct for you, whatever it may be. But remember-
ing that for you, it is not what to do. It is the wisdom you derive by taking in while
the doing gets done. That is what makes you special.
All right, well, to all of you, it‘s been an interesting journey over these couple of
days. It was nice to be able to share it with you. I hope it‘s been edifying. What to
say; I wish you all a pleasant day or evening wherever you happen to be. And until
we meet again, all of you take care. Bye for now.
