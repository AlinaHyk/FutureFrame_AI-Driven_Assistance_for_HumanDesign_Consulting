International Human Design School Manuals and Texts
This book is a transcript of The Channels Course by Ra Uru Hu that was held in Taos, New
Mexico in 1999. The Manifestor & Generator Channels Course was held on April 8-13, 1999,
and the Projector Channels Course was held April 15-18, 1999.
Including over 40 hours of lectures on all the channels in a Human Design chart, Ra also gives an
in-depth view of how each channel adds to the overall nature of the circuit of which it is part. He
discusses at length what quality each channel demonstrates about the entire circuit.
NNNNooootttteeee: Numeric separators – Channels are indicated with a hyphen, like 20-34. A gate and its
line are indicated with a period, like 34.2. Profiles are indicated with a slash, like 5/1.
Color coding: Blue indicates either a Manifesting channel or an individual circuit. Green
indicates a Collective circuit. Red indicates a Generated channel. And burgundy indicates a
Tribal circuit.

The Projected Channels
The Nature of Projection
The nature of projection. In our process of living through a program like this,
courses like this, it dawns on you that given that most of this takes place with
the Sun in 42, we’re in a completion process. Basically, this is a kind of
umbrella in which we're looking at all of the various things that we've learned in
design and we see how to bring them all together, and bring them all together
under the general framework of Types and channels operating through their
Type.
The Mind
Mental Bitterness is the By-product of Anxiety
We're going to look at the mind today. It is the great projection field. And
when you understand that the fundamental theme of projection is bitterness,
the bitterness of not being recognized, you can see that the true theme of mind
is bitterness, and that bitterness is the by-product of anxiety. Remember that
human intelligence, awareness, is driven by fear. It's one of the ironies of life.
The Splenic Center, the fear, the very deep primal fears of the body in survival,
and out of that comes our taste and our intuition and our instincts.
When we get to the mental plane, there is no physical survival that is a
question. This is not a primal concern. The intelligent
mind is something that came late in our process. In terms
of the nature of the BodyGraph, the mind, though
pressurized, is not pressurized by a motor. It has no outlet
other than the Throat, other than the capacity to be able to
articulate or communicate. It is truly a powerless
awareness.
Remember that genetically we're always attracted and
fascinated and ultimately obsessed with what we're not. The projected mind
that can never be the doer is obsessed with being the doer. It yearns to act. It
longs to be the driving force of the life. Human beings are very different than
the rest of the evolved life on this planet. It's clear to see that when you look at
11112222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
the design of forms and you look at the relationship in terms of the matrix of
what it is to be a Rave and the matrix of what it is to be a chicken or a dog,
there is a deep complexity to us. Deep.
From the Nose to the Eyes
The mind, because it cannot act, when it became our dominant field about
90,000 years ago, we went away from that splenic awareness that dominated all
forms of life and dominated us as a form of life. The fear of survival being the
only awareness that's a result, the awareness to keep us alive, to keep us out of
danger, to keep us alert,—and we went from the nose to the eyes.
When you look at the functional brain mechanic, biological mechanic, in order
for us to be able to see, and in order for us to be able to see in the way that we
see, an enormous amount of energy was transferred. An enormous amount of
wiring was changed in order to bring that kind of capacity to our specie to be
able to live in a visual world. One of the great illusions we have is that our eyes
will protect us, and of course, it's not true. It's our nose. We have this illusion
of the capacity and function of mind that's just a joke.
Fear of Mind is Anxiety Which Operates Only Three Ways
Now think about what happens in mind. The fear of mind is what we call
anxiety and the anxiety is very clear to understand. That anxiety operates only
in three ways. We have three streams operating through the mind. No tribe.
And when I say that, I let you keep that for a meditation. What the hell does
that really mean? Because it's a fascinating thing to look at.
The Anxiety of the Abstract Mind 64-47
When you're dealing at the mental plane, you have the collective and you have
the individual mind. The collective
mind has two forms of the same
anxiety.
The anxiety of the abstract mind is:
Can I make sense out of life? And
in making sense out of life or sense
Projected Channels and Circuitry 13
out of something, can I share that with others and stimulate them with it or get
them to believe me?
The Mind’s Illusion that it Controls the Body
Now, the anxiety is if you can't make sense out of something then you become
anxious. Mental anxiety is one of the most powerful themes that we have.
Remember that the Ajna Center is the seat of the pituitary glands, and the
pituitary glands are the master endocrine glands. They are the control room of
your whole body, the anterior and posterior pituitary. The outside of the body
and the inside of the body. This is the master playground. It's why there's an
illusion in mind that mind controls the body, but it doesn't. It doesn't. It is a
simultaneous experiencing system. It is there in the body, but doesn't control
it.
So if you can't make sense out of something and you're an abstract person,
you're going to be full of anxiety. And that anxiety is going to result in you
thinking that nobody believes you. Paranoia. This is the source of
psychological paranoia. “Nobody believes me. And everybody is looking for
me.” Crazy people, when they say, "Everybody's looking at me." This is the
11-56. "Everybody's looking at me and they think I'm crazy and they don't
believe me. They don't believe that I'm Napoleon now. They don't believe
me.”
The Anxiety of the Logical Mind 63-4 Cooks the
Books
On the logic side, the anxiety is that you cannot come up with an answer.
Because on the logic side,
obviously, you need to
understand, and so your doubts
need to be answered. And if you
can't come up with an answer,
you're full of anxiety, and you end
up saying “I don't understand. I
don't understand why I keep losing my job. I don't understand why my dog
keeps peeing on my leg. I don't understand and I'm full of anxiety."
11114444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
The 17-62 Anxiety wants Others to Understand
Human beings are funny, no? The 17-62 says, "I need to be able to reasonably
get other people to understand me, and I'm anxious as hell if I can't reasonably
get people to understand me.
Then I become unreasonable,
or they seem to be
unreasonable." This is the
place where the facts can get
manipulated out of the anxiety.
“They're not going to
understand my formula. They don't understand my formula. Let me cheat the
facts.” So these are our embezzlers. The cookers of books. They're great at
that. Good deal makers. They can play around with the formula. They can
play around with the facts.
Of course, when they play around with the formula and they play around with
the facts, they live an anxious life; paranoia. Isn't the mind a great place? So if
they don't understand you and you cook the books, even though they seem to
understand you, you spend the rest of your life anxious that they're going to
catch you.
Never Forget the Frequencies in Awareness
The frequencies in awareness. I don't talk about it a lot because, of course, I
don't do basic trainings or advanced trainings anymore so I don't get into that
language. But never forget these frequencies. The splenic system operates in
the now. It's existential, which means it's ultimately very weak. If you don't
pay attention to it the first time, you don't get it. But when you get to the mind
you have to see that the frequency, unlike the Solar Plex which is a wave, the
frequency of the mind is all time. It's all time. Never forget that. It's all time.
You see, you can have a spontaneous "anxious moment" – a spontaneous fear.
But it's gone then. It's over. You have it and it's gone. If you're emotional,
you’ll go through the wave of your nervousness. That's the fear of the
emotional side, but anxiety can stay with you all your life. So the moment that
you cook the books, you have to live with the anxiety for the rest of your life
and you can't escape it because it's your mind. And because we think that our
minds run our lives, what we do is cook the books mentally, and then we try to
live it out. And of course, the whole deep bitterness comes with that.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 15
There are a lot of people, for example, who would like to cook the books who
can't. Because every time they try, they just can't seem to do it, because they
may not have the ability to motorize that. It may not be something recognized
in them. It may not be something invited to come out. It will depend on their
Type. It will depend on their authority.
So the thing to recognize about the collective fear of anxiety is that that anxiety
is very powerful. If one cannot stimulate others with one's beliefs, the anxiety
is very powerful. The more somebody tries to convince you of something,—
that wonderful line in the 55 from Shakespeare, "Me think he doth protest too
much." One has to be careful.
The Collective Circuits are Social
The collective process. What it's really trying to do is get rid of its paranoia and
its anxiety by finding those that it can share its
conceptualizations with. And again, this comes
Collective Circuitry
back to the very important recognition that
collective circuitry is, by its very nature, social.
You can actually say that the understanding
circuit and the abstract circuit are social circuits
in nature, as we would describe the 12-22 or
the 6-59 or the 40-37 as social channels.
That’s why people share their opinions. That's
why people share their ideas. Whether we
want them or not, they're going to share them
with us. That's why we share our anxieties with each other. It's why we share
our beliefs with each other. It's why we share our theories with each other
because these are naturally social processes. It is the beauty of what mind is.
Everything about the nature of mind is so that we can enrich our collective
understanding of what it is to be human.
Communication is Our Greatest Gift
That's what mind is for, so that we are not alone in our experience. It is
through the facility of mind and through the capacity of the Throat Center that
we are not alone, that we are never alone. It is one of the true things that bind
us. And it binds us in the same way that satellites now bind the internet, high
11116666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
tech world that we live in. This is only an extension beyond ourselves, but this
is naturally what's been there from the moment that we could communicate in
language to each other.
You see, this is our greatness as a species. It's our greatness. We're not the
fastest, we're not the strongest, we're not the biggest—we're none of those
things. But our gift is that through communication, we can educate each other,
and it is the capacity of human beings to educate trans-generationally, trans-
millennial education. I can still go back and read the words written thousands
of years ago. We have this vast, collective memory that is the by-product of the
genius of human intelligence. That stuff's great. That's why I love mind.
That's why I love the experience of being able to share at this level of
awareness. This is the beauty of mind. To talk about what it is to be us. To
share our experiences with each other. To share the life process with each
other, because it enriches every succeeding generation.
The clearer we are about understanding human experience, the clearer we are
about the nature of the body and how it operates and all of those things—the
more profound the awareness of the whole. The moment that we take mind,
and take it away from its primary duty, which is to be able to express what is
going on in our lives, and we turn it into an engine of direction, and we turn it
into a pseudo-motor, that we say to it, "You run our lives,” and everything is
chaos, then the real capacity of mind is lost. It's lost, because it's occupied with
trying to control life and it ends up being deeply bitter and full of anxiety.
It's so essential to understand that when you know your Type, and if you have
authority in your design—because both those things operate as an authority in
life—if you live out that Type, then your mind will naturally take its place in the
proper order and in the proper hierarchy within you. You know, like those old
gangster movies—your mind is your mouthpiece. The old gangsters always
had a lawyer that did the upfront stuff.
The mind is there to express what you're going through, and it can also
elaborate upon your own decision making process based on your Type and
authority. The moment that you're living that out, your mind really is going to
be free of anxiety, and that means free of something else: migraine headaches,
eye disease, vision disturbance, facial tics; you name it, it's all there.

If you were living according to your Type, the reality is that you're always going
to be a healthier human being. To be healthy at the mental level is absolutely
essential. We know the disruption that can happen at the mundane plane and
people who do not understand their design. When they suffer from mental
anxiety and it's their mind that’s dictating what they do. The outcome is
obvious; we see that all around us, it's going on all the time. It's utter chaos
and it's often violent. What we do for the mental programs in therapy. What
we do to the mind. What we do to drug it. What we do to try to alleviate it
from its anxiety by doing chemical manipulations. It's not like that’s doing
anything. And it's not necessary.
Think about all the pressure that's in a mind like that. It's open. It has the two
collective possibilities in the Throat for expression, the 56 and the 62. It only
has one activation above in the Head Center. Open Ajna. When that person
comes to me, and I'm doing a reading for that person, they're an archetype of
saying, "Look, you don't write the
script. Your mind is open, things
are flooding through. All kinds of
information is passing by. There
are certain things that you
resonate to that you think are
really your thoughts. They're not.
You're just processing the mental
plane. And then what happens to
you?”
“What happens to you is you get
stuck on something, whatever it
happens to be. It’s a transit; it's a
person in your life. And you get stuck on something and you think mentally
that's the thing that you want to do. Now, not only can you not express it—
because the expression is inconsistent anyway—there's no defined connection
between the Ajna and the Throat. Not only can you not express it, you don't
have the timing for expressing it.”
“The more you try to express it, the more damage you're going to do to your
pituitary system, because every time you try to express something out of that
undefined Ajna Center, it's the same thing as making a promise out of an
11118888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
undefined Ego. You’re doing damage to the endocrine gland. And doing
damage to the endocrine gland, what you do damage to is your eyesight. And
beyond your eyesight, you begin to have neural damage in the body. You can
have nerve problems, but most common is that you have headaches.”
If you have a Head Center defined to the Ajna Center, you have the same kind
of phenomena. It just operates differently. This person (above) can't write the
script either. Not possible for them. They're not in control of when or what
they say. Now think about the world, folks. No mind has inner authority. The
vast majority of people can never say what they want to say at any given
moment. Can you imagine? And it's hard for them to accept and admit that.
It makes them feel uncomfortable because they think there's something wrong
with them.
So if you have an undefined Ajna, or you have a defined Ajna that's not
connected to the Throat, anxiety is a natural state. Because even when you do
grasp something, it's so difficult to get it out, and that even when you force it
out, you discover that nobody is listening because you're not living out your
Type and then you end up with a headache. And after enough headaches, you
stop thinking that your mind is of any value. You stop respecting your own
mind, while at the same time lost in the dream of thinking that miraculously, at
some moment, maybe your mind can actually do something useful the way it
seems everybody believes the mind works. And it doesn't.
And here is somebody that's going to suffer from the potential of headaches,
mental anxiety, strong mind, strongly defined, and yet at the same time, no
consistent way of getting to the
Throat, and automatically the
anxiety. “Can I make myself
understood? Will they understand
me?”
You can see that with his 17
hanging there, that he’s going to
be obsessed with looking for
facts. You know the history of
him as an actor (Dustin Hoffman).
Here’s somebody who really went
into method. Here’s somebody
who had to go into all the little details, live it out, check it out. Looking for the
Projected Channels and Circuitry 19
facts in order to be understood. And you can also see that his 23 pointed
upward, the pressure to have an insight, the pressure to be able to explain your
knowing. “Nobody knows me. Nobody knows what I mean. Nobody knows
what I want. They don’t know.” Nothing but anxiety.
Type & Authority Gives Back a Healthy Mind
One of the great burdens you can lift from people whose design you read is the
burden of the mind. When you take somebody to their Type, you’re
automatically taking them away from the mind. And when you take somebody
to their inner authority, if they have inner authority, you are automatically
taking them away from their mind. The major questions of their life—what to
do, who to do it with, when to do it, how to do it—all of that is separate from
their mind. That's why the tribe doesn't have anything to do with the mental
plane. If the mental plane was involved in tribal business we'd be still back in
the jungle, running naked through the trees. The tribe just takes care of
business, business of the body of the specie.
So, when you're doing somebody's reading, and you take them to their Type,
and you take them to their authority, and you take them away from their mind;
then give them back a healthy mind. Don't just take it away, because you can't.
You can't. Your minds are all still cooking. All the time. No matter how
aware I am, I've got a box that hums. What to do. This is mind. You have to
give them back a healthy mind.
I remind all of them of their intelligence for others. I've learned to recognize
the importance of everyone's outer authority. Everyone's outer authority. It's
not about agreeing with it or not. It's not about liking it or not. It's about
respecting that every single human being is unique within the totality and is a
specific filter of the whole. Their outer authority—aspects of it, or all of it—
may be of deep value to the other. It's why the moment you accept that you
have no choice, you will see that in the geometry of life, you get those people in
your face who you get.
So pay attention to their outer authority, what they have to share. That's the
beauty of mind. And to give somebody back a healthy mind is to say, "Look,
your mind is going to work for you perfectly if you allow it to. The mind is
there to do research. It is there for the ‘this and that.’"
22220000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
And that means that everybody, in dealing with their life processes, comes to a
point where they have to face a decision, and that's what mind loves. “We got
‘em now. We've got to make a decision. We got ‘em now.” The mind comes
in. “Don't do that! Let's do this. No. No. No. No. Don't do that, let's do
that. No, no, no, wait! Let’s do the other thing!”
The mind says, "Wow, decision making time. Yeah!!!" All this body stuff is
over, we get down to business here. The mind loves that. Now, all our minds
do that and you can't stop them. You can't just control emotions. Can't stop
it. So what you have to do is recognize and let your mind do that. Cheer for
both sides. You know.
Let your mind do that. Enjoy both sides; let it go through the whole thing.
Don't make a decision. Don't give your mind authority. Now look, your
mind wants to make a decision. It doesn't mean that you can't lean. You're
going to lean naturally, but it's about not saying, “Because I'm leaning in this
direction, that's my ultimate answer,” because it isn't. It's just the research,
because life circumstances and the combined aura can change the way the game
is played. All you've done is your research.
Okay, so you got a problem with somebody. You don't like something they
did. You've got the ‘this and that’ of it that you've looked at and you're leaning
towards really giving them a hard time. Okay.
The Manifestor Communicating a Problem
If you're a Manifestor, you have to go up to them and say to them, "I've been
thinking about you and I and what happened the other day. Can I tell you what
I think?” “Okay." And then they can release it. And in the moment of that
person saying, "Yes, you can tell me what you think," their flow will simply be
there. Now look, it doesn't mean they're going to say what they want to say,
and it doesn’t mean they're going to say it the way the wanted to say it. It
doesn't even mean they're going to go with the side they were leaning towards.
What it means is that it's going to be correct, whatever comes out of that.
The Generator Communicating a Problem
Now imagine you’re a Generator. And you're really pissed. And you're really
leaning heavily to that side. Now you can't get on the phone and say, "Hey,
Projected Channels and Circuitry 21
you son of a..." You can't do that. They're not going to listen anyway. Not
only that, but what you verbal out in that moment isn't going to be clear. So
you have to wait. You have to wait for them to step into your aura.
Remember, your aura will do the talking. Your aura will automatically say to
them, “I'm pissed,” automatically. And of course, in that moment, because
you're quiet, and silent, and your aura is talking for you, they will make some
kind of opening comment. "Are you okay? Is something the matter?" Is blah,
blah, blah, whatever the case may be. And then you can blast them. “Uh-
huh.” And then out it all pours.
Now, the interesting thing about that is, Generators often really are out of
touch mentally. In other words, out of touch with themselves, because living
in the manifesting program as everybody does, they can really be far away. So,
they're leaning heavily to one side that they are really pissed, and the person
that they're really pissed at comes up to them and says, "Ready to go out for
lunch?" And they go, "Mm-hmm." You know.
And inside their minds are going like this twirling. And the side that was
heavily leaned against, then you can cheer for that side, "Yeah, good, good,
good you were there. You saw the good points too, didn't you?" See that's
what the mind is good for. Nothing is black and white, and no decision that
you ever make from the mental plane is ever black and white. It isn't.
And, of course, given different circumstances, what works for you, and what
you will connect to, maybe one side or the other. It depends. Your mind
doesn’t really know what's good for you. It's not there to protect you in this
life. It's not there to keep you healthy. It's not there to do any of those things.
It can't. It's helpless. It's really helpless.
So, the moment you tell the mind, "Now look, we know what you're about.
You go ahead and keep us busy up there. You flash and you go through all
that stuff and you compare everything and you weigh everything, but I'm not
doing what you tell me to do. Because you work for me. I'm not going to get
deluded into thinking that this mind is me.”
“This is the vehicle after all. I'm a passenger in here. It's not my mind. I'm
not in charge of what I say or what I think. I'm not in charge of what I do.
I'm just riding along inside.” Sometimes it's hilarious. You know. The
acceptance of what is mechanical is the real spirituality of being given a perfect
22222222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
vehicle and a perfect ride. And the only thing that really gets in the way are
these minds.
They get in the way because they keep on trying to dictate the way everything is
supposed to be, and yet at the same time, the moment that they are acting as a
support system for your real authority and Type, then they're fantastic. See,
they can't tell you what to do but they can tell you everything about the doing,
and they can share it with everybody else. And out of that comes growth and
enrichment of our collective process.
The 23-43 Individual Mind’s Anxiety is
Melancholy
The third aspect of mind is the individual mind. And, of course, the individual
mind, given what we know about the nature of individual chemistry and
melancholy, is that here we
have a different quality of
anxiety. In other words, the
individual mind suffers from
mental melancholy. Now, it's
fascinating to see and I know
many people who have such
designs. They will have an individual mind, the 43-23, because as we've seen
and because it is an opposition in the wheel, it's very, very common.
So you have the 43-23 and then it's cut off, and the rest of the definition or the
rest of the split is either collective or tribal. And you can have people who, in
their physical communal life and their career, all of those things, even in their
home life, seem to be just fine. They feel good to you. And yet at the same
time, they're having enormous, deep, mental anxiety that's driven by chemical
melancholy. These can be very, very, very sad people, mentally.
Now remember, the mind isn't the life. So, the life can look very, very
different. Unless you catch these people at the right moment when you see
them go into the state of their melancholy, only then can you catch a glimpse
of that, because there's no motor. It's different from somebody who is
physically melancholic.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 23
As an individual and as a single definition, manifesting individual, when I go
down into my melancholy, you feel it. It's physical. It carries the Ego power.
But of course, when somebody goes mentally into melancholy, because it is
powerless or can be powerless without a motor, it can be something that is
hidden away, and these are people who can be very, very, very ill. They can be
very ill because they don't really, fully fall into the physical melancholy and get
to process it properly. It stays at the mental level, and at the mental level it
simply becomes a question of whether life is something that one can be happy
in or whether life is only sadness. And it is really the deepest theme of the split
off 43-23: the happiness of life or the sadness of life.
In order to avoid the anxiety that that brings, one can never get one or the
other, whatever the case may be. The anxiety that that brings is very, very
profound. It brings a deep need to know, what does it all mean; to know. Not
so much to remove one or the other, or to have one or the other, just to know
why they're there.
Knowing is a Spontaneous Mutation
Remember that knowing is not logical. It's not abstract. It's a spontaneous
mutation. It may never come. There are endless numbers of individuals who
go to their graves saying, "I really don't know what this was all about. I really
don't know. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know why they put me here.
I don't know why I did what I did. I don’t know why I had those horrible
children, that terrible wife. I don't know why I had the life I did. I don't know
why I had the career that I had, and I really don't know why I'm dying. And I
don't know if there's a God that's going to help me out." It can go to the end.
The 24th Gate is the Most Disturbing Mental Gate
So, it's one of those things to see, rooted in the 24th gate. Oh, the 24th gate.
Oh, oh. I'm waiting for Saturn to get there. I'm a 61 with the 43-23, so it will
be very interesting to see what Saturn
brings to the 24 for me in my
process. I know cycles, so it's
interesting to watch all of these
things.
The nature of the 24th gate. It's
22224444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
called the return. And it is the most disturbing of all mental gates. It's
annoying as hell. Think about what that return really is. You see, the collective
mind is in a staged process: doubt leads to a formula, the formula leads to an
opinion, the opinion leads to facts. In other words, there are stages in that, but
basically the 24 keeps the individual process stuck. It keeps it stuck because
there's nowhere to go, because there is no pattern, there is no way. It's waiting
for mutation.
Now, the 24th gate can be deeply painful. I know 24 people who have told me
about their experience as children of having to bang their heads against the wall
to stop the noise in their head, to stop an idea or a theme repeating itself
endlessly. These are people that have the same dream over, and over, and over,
and over, and over again until it drives them absolutely mad.
Every time they have their dream, that dream they're convinced that the great
truth is there, and each time they have that dream they go through the same
process over, and over, and over, and over, and over, the return, returning, and
returning, and returning, and returning, and returning. It's like a stuck record,
and, of course, that's what it sounds like in the head. The same thing over, and
over, and over again until the magic, if there's magic. The moment of
mutation.
The Jump from the 24 to the 43rd Gate
So when you see the movement from the 24 to the 43, do not see it as the same
as the movement that takes place from the 4 to the 17, or from the 47 to the
11, because they’re in a natural movement. The program
is built into it. The collective. Nothing
new under the sun. There is a place for
ideas to go to. They have their direction.
But the jump between the 24 and the 43
is really something. That's a real
mutative jump.
It's like the movement from the 3rd gate to the 14th gate. It's a
very, very powerful jump. The ordering of a new mutative
energy that suddenly becomes the power for wealth, for
greatness, for direction; so it's a powerful jump. But it doesn't
always come there. It doesn't make it.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 25
If you have somebody who is just a 43, what they do in their lifetime is that
they’re conditioned to certain kinds of knowing, and they get stuck with that
certain kind of knowing. And it never becomes unique or their own knowing,
unless they have that experience of ‘ah-hah,’ the jump. Otherwise, they just
personalize a conditioned knowing that they hold onto and keep repeating. “I
know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know,” they just
keep on saying.
Jumping Always Happens in the Melancholic Stage
So, be clear that in this individual mind there is this jumping place, and this
jumping place always happens in the melancholic stage. Always happens in the
melancholic stage. As an individual, at a personal level in my life, because I
have suffered from melancholy, and because I've learned to see its beauty over
these last 12 or 13 years, and have had the richest, creative time of my life in
the acceptance of all of that. It's one of my personal nurturing things with
people that I work with who are individual, and particularly those people that I
meet, like myself, who have the 43-23 mind. It's very common.
You'll find within yourselves the nature of your own definition. The 40-37 that
really needs to work with the nature of community and others. All of these
different aspects that you live through in your own process, that you can
recognize now because you're awake to how that operates, how you can
nurture others in that process. You're going to meet, as analysts, so many 43-
23s, just like you're going to meet so many 20-34s and so many 40-37s. And
these are primary groups for therapeutic activity.
22226666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Those three groups need to be worked with, and they need to be worked with
people who are aware of those things. I'm not a 20-34, I am not a 40-37, but I
am a 43-23. And it's essential that the individual mind recognizes that
melancholy does not mean that you act on it, because then that's when you
have the sickest of minds.
Mind isn’t the Authority
Mind isn’t there to be the authority. Mind isn't there to take care of business,
and yet at the same time, what you have is the individual melancholic mind in
its sadness, in its inability to be able to get out of the same thing over, and over,
and over, and over again. That is ready to take a risk, like a 28.6 day, and is
ready to jump into things, and they get burnt at that. They are freaks, after all.
Why Keynotes?
I want you to think about, why in my work with you over all of these years, that
the greatest accent has been on keynotes? You have to learn to recognize that
keynotes are bits and pieces of a formula that can be
strung together. If you look at the 61-24, the Channel of
Awareness, and the 43-23, the Channel of Structuring,
the awareness of how to structure—the awareness of
structure is what the individual mind is all about.
Learning how to bring keynotes together, learning how to
string them together not only gives you a deep insight,—I
will show you over the next few days some wonderful
stringings of keynotes, and you will see that what you're really doing is just
adding bits and pieces together in a formula, and they're always going to be
accurate. The structuring of awareness and the awareness of structuring; it is
the ongoing process that is part of the individual mind.
Awareness and Mutation and Structure
What that means is that awareness can be changed through mutation, and
through the mutation of awareness, the structure can be changed. That's
its purpose. The moment the individual mind recognizes that mental
melancholy is healthy, and it is not a reason for anxiety but it is the only way to
get rid of the anxiety, is to accept the sadness as a creative mental environment.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 27
These can be profound thinkers, the 61-24. They can be profound thinkers,
but most of the time they're constipated, stuck on the thinker's toilet with
nowhere to go but stay in the same place. So, they have to learn that the
melancholy for them is their only way out, and of course, if it becomes
depression then we have manic depressives. We have psychotic depressives.
We have the most deeply depressed mental beings. So take care of them, eh?
Keynoting is Enlightening
One of the things to be clear about keynoting, and the stringing of keynoting, is
that it's enlightening. And it's enlightening for your clients because it gives
them that sense of awe. That sense of awe that says, “Oh my God, they really
know me.” The other thing about it is that it really expresses the comedy of
what it is to be human.
If I look at my design, I can see that I'm the penetrating,
competitive freak. That's one of my formulas. And the
fact that that's one of my formulas is important,
because I have to keep in mind that all of the ways in
which the keynotes can be strung. I can structure the
initiating of perfected form – that's the other side of my
formula.
So, when you're dealing with keynotes, the thing to
remember about that is it's not just coming up with a
keynote that you like, because it's easy to string
together the keynotes that you like, and say, “Gee
that's me.” It's also to string the keynote the way you don't like it. Play around
with it, because what you're looking at is how your formula works. And of
course, we are formulas.
The more you realize that your keynotes strung together into a Type, vibrating
in space, whipping along, is the sooner that you're going to let go of thinking
you're in charge of anything, which is terrific. You'll start feeling better. The
world will be a nicer place for you to live in, and all of this stuff you've been
worrying about forever will disappear. It's really nice. So the recognition of
the formula is something important.
It is an amazing thing to see the formula working. These are just mechanical
things that are taking place. It’s just interesting to see the way mechanical
22228888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
things work. The more you see the formula in things, and the more you just
watch the mechanics of things, you get to live them. And the moment you're
really living your own formula, you've made it.
All those different parts of you, that part of your design here and there, and
you get to see that, and you get to recognize that in yourself. It's a tremendous
victory over your mind, through your mind. I mean, understand the magic of
that. We're using the mental plane in order to take power away from the mind,
which is quite a trip.
The moment you recognize those formulas in yourself, that's the moment
you're really getting into what it is to be you. You're seeing your own nature,
you're seeing yourself at work and you’re seeing the way the formula goes.
We've got lots of formulas in us, and obviously the more complex your
definition, and particularly when you're dealing with splits, you've got all kinds
of things that are going on in your formulas. But, the more you play with
them, the more you understand what you're here for. We're here to live out
our design, so getting close to your formula, seeing what it is, and accepting the
fact that you get all sides of your formula, and you get it in combinations that
you haven't even thought of yet, because all of those possibilities are there.
Look for the Beauty in the Formula
This is one of the things about lifting the spirit of people. You see, when I do
a reading, no matter how shocking I am, I'm there to lift their spirit. We always
can see the beauty in the formula. Look for the beauty in the formula of those
you work with. They rarely see the beauty in their lives. Rarely do they see
their own beauty. They've never lived it out. They’re always outside living
something that they're not, and the very beauty that you find in yourself, that
makes you feel good, to see the formula in that way, understand how powerful
it is for a client.
Oh yeah, it's a bit of the trickster, but then again I am a bit of a trickster. It's
the truth, it's just not the whole truth, but it helps sometimes when you can see
that positive formula in somebody you're working with. Because you're
shattering them by taking them through their design. You're turning their
world upside down. And in turning their world upside down, yes, you can give
them tools to become themselves, but remind them of their beauty. We are all
Projected Channels and Circuitry 29
truly special. I direct you into looking at your formula to see your divinity.
Well, I don't mean to get too mushy, but it is there.
What we do see within ourselves is the potential of our formula. It's an
important thing to hold in front of us, as the mirror that's the mirror of light,
eh? The mirror of light that says, “Hey, look, what's in this formula? What's in
this formula is really great.” And of course it's you. You're finally talking
about yourself. To recognize your formula is to begin to really love yourself.
It's a great place to start. You look at the high end of your formula and you
say, “Yes, yes, yes. Me, I too can be the messiah, yes.” The nice thing about
knowing your formula is knowing how to truly laugh at yourself because, you
really can get the joke, eh?
When you listen to people give out their formulas, you've got succinct
formulas, you've got these extended formulas. There are all kinds of
complexity in them and, of course, it is a mirror of what we are. We are, after
all, our definitions. That's what we are. That's quite a road to go down.
Work with your formulas, really. Turn them all around. Turn the keynotes all
around. Turn them inside out, because you really get to see yourself. You get
to see how other people see you after all.
Remember the value of the positive aspect of the formula, and giving the
positive aspect of the formula to your clients. And when I say giving them that
positive formula, it doesn’t mean you have to read it off. It’s about you seeing
that it’s there. And you know so much about a design in front of you, the
moment you can see that formula in them and flip it around in your head,
move the keynotes around, so you get a real glimpse of that.
You see, it’s one of those things about what you are that is very hard to grasp.
What we’re good at grasping is what we’re not. So it’s hard for us to really
grasp it, being able to see your own formula, to put your formula together is a
way that helps you see yourself, the part of you that you really don’t see, which
is your definition. It’s what everybody else experiences in you. And it’s a way
for you to see.
At the positive end of all of that, the advantage for both you and others is in
the formula that is you. We all have an extraordinary capacity built into us.
Now, we all do it in different ways; we all have our unique aspects of that. But
your formula is very important and use it well when you’re dealing with clients.

Channels 64-47 and 11-56 Abstract Mind
Okay, we’re going to go back to
our theme of the mind. In going
back to the theme of the mind, we
go back to the collective and start
with the channel 64-47, along with
the 11-56. The 64-47 is the
Channel of Abstraction. And the
11-56 is the Channel of Curiosity.
Now if you string that together, the abstract mind is about the abstraction of
the curious, or curious abstractions.
They’re built into each other, this
process. You can link it together in
many ways and if you play with all
the keynotes that are inherent in it,
then you’ll see that you really can
discover what that whole mental
flow is all about. But it’s about
bringing the abstract outwards and creating a sense of curiosity about it as a
form of stimulation. In other words, to take the oppression off and stimulate
others with it, in that sense.
Now, these are projected channels. We already know that the mental system
suffers from anxiety and paranoia when it cannot fulfill what it assumes is its
destiny. If it’s abstract, that it ultimately can make sense out of things, it can
make sense out of life. All of the qualities of mind that make mind different in
the sense of A) the way in which it operates in its dominance in us, and B) the
fact that it’s not a motor and yet at the same time, it is the pressure that creates
the conceptual field.
The Head Center’s Job is to Create Stress
The Head Center is a fascinating center. The Head Center is outside, part of it,
of your very body. Your personality crystal never sits inside of what you call
your physical body, but sits in the crown of the Head Center, which is outside
the body. The Head Center is unusual; it is unusual because it carries stress. In
other words, it creates stress, that’s its job. And the stress that it creates is the
stress that we call anxiety. It’s created by the Head Center.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 31
Inspiration Puts Us under Stress
What the Head Center does is,—we give it a nice name, we call that inspiration.
It puts us under stress. That’s what inspiration does. It’s not a motorized
stress, so we don’t feel it like we do the adrenaline system. It’s a different kind
of stress.
You see, the mind is designed to finish its process in metamorphosis; in other
words, completion and transformation. These gates that move from the
Throat upwards, they’re magical gates. They’re magical because they are
transforming agents. After all, the 62nd gate is going to take the logical mind
and it’s going to concretize that logical mind in language. That’s quite a
translation. Ask any 43 how easy it is to get what you know inside to actually
be expressed as words on the outside, because the movement from the inner
conceptual Ajna field to actually concretizing as language, that’s quite a jump.
The 62nd Gate Creates Words
And there’s real magic, particularly in the 62nd gate and in the 56th gate. The
62nd gate is important to us because out of the logical
expression of the mind we build the basis of what we call
language, which means that if you look into the logical
wiring of the mind, that’s where our ingrained grammar is
established.
We know scientifically that grammar exists in the mind
before there are words to be used grammatically. It’s a
way in which the mind operates. This is logical. And out of this capacity to be
able to organize the pattern, we’re able to create words. And of course the 62nd
gate is this metamorphic gate of giving things their names.
An essential aspect of mind is the creation of the Maia, and the Maia becomes
the densest when we have the most names available. We now live in a time of
more names than have ever existed before. We have the densest Maia we’ve
ever had, and they’re all created by 62s like me who give you “personality
crystal” and “rave” and “design crystal” and all these funny words. This is the
Maia business.
33332222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
The 56th Gate Creates Images with a Great Story
The other side of this is the 56th
gate. Out of the 56th gate we have
the capacity to string words
together to be able to create an
image. You see the 11 to the 56,
like my idiom, ‘you see,’ the 11-56 is
all about that, getting people to see.
And it’s the great gift of the 56th
gate to be able to tell a story so that you can see it.
The 62 will use languages and formula. They will give you a map. They will
say, “This is where it is. Follow the map.” The 56 will tell you a great story.
“As you’re going along, there’s going to be this billboard, oh, that billboard’s so
funny, you’re really going to love that billboard, stop and read it okay? And
then right after the billboard you make a right…” and they tell you a whole
story. Very different, and yet the magic of that 56th gate is that that’s what it
can do.
It is the eye speaking, if the eye could speak in that sense, the eye that witnesses
experience. And it’s the voice of that eye that witnesses experience, the
storytelling voice. So the mental anxiety is so deep in the collective because
they share it.
Individuals don’t share their melancholic anxiety unless you happen to be in
their aura and they blast you. But the collective calls you up on the telephone
when they’re anxious. Mental anxiety is keeping the lines humming in the
global wiring system, because it’s always being shared, always. Given the fact
that we know that the mind is not our inner authority, that by the time those
things even get the opportunity to manifest in the Throat, it doesn’t mean that
anything can happen with them.
Nothing more frustrating than a 56 that tries to stimulate
itself with one of its own ideas and then spends the rest of
its life crashing and floundering like a grounded bass. I’m in
a 56 mood. It’s not me. Oh, what to do. Human beings are
really funny, aren’t they? Speaking as a freak.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 33
The Channel of Logic 17-62
When you go over to the logic side, you have the channel of logic and the
Channel of Acceptance, so you’ve
got logical acceptance or the
acceptance of logic. That’s the
theme of the logical mind. It’s
just there basically in just the
obvious keynote of it, and of
course, that’s true for just about
anywhere that you look in design and you string the keynotes together.
The formula, this is one of the things about understanding the absolute
uselessness of mind as an authority. You have your doubt (gate 63), and then
you come up with your formula (gate 4). And you turn it into an opinion (gate
17), and you find the facts for it (gate 62)—doesn’t mean anything. It can be
interesting.
One of the famous responses to having your first introduction to Human
Design, “Oh that’s interesting.” And every time they would say to me, “Oh
that’s interesting,” I’d want to take out my Chinese bullwhip and let them have
it. It’s not about being interesting. It’s about being. But that’s what it is at an
intellectual level; the logic stops at the Throat and says, “Jeez, that’s
interesting,” or not. But it doesn’t mean that anything is going to happen.
That’s the whole thing about the mind, it’s wonderful.
You have somebody who’s an 11-56 and they’re doing their very best to
stimulate things and nothing happens. Nothing happens, it’s just blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. And you have the 17-62 that’s trying to organize everything
and nothing gets organized. You can get into so much pain from all of that,
because the moment you assume that you can because you can think it, you’re
really in trouble. It’s about whether or not it happens.
33334444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
The Channel of Stimulation 11-56
Ideas and Emotional Clarity
You see, the 11-56 comes to a moment of clarity. Remember that an idea is
actually an aspect of what we call emotional clarity. An idea is something that
comes out of a sequence. It’s an
idea, it’s a capacity, it’s a sudden
opening up of something. And by
the time it gets to the 11th gate, it
gets crystallized as what we call an
idea, a concept. And that concept,
the anxiety of that mind that is
carrying that concept, that anxiety is,
“Can I stimulate others so that they will believe me?” And so they get to that
56th gate.
Now look, we don’t know what their design is, and we don’t know their Type.
And of course it’s going to be different. If they’re a Manifestor, they’re going
to have to ask permission to stimulate somebody else. “Interested in an
interesting idea?” “I’ve got this great idea, you interested?” In other words,
they have to go in there and make sure, and then they can stimulate.
If they’re a Generator, they have to wait for that moment to come when they
can respond. And if they’re a Projector, they have to be invited. In other
words, according to your Type, according to your authority, that aspect of
mind then has its potency.
Being a Verbal Gunslinger is Difficult to Deal With
You see there’s nothing more painful to an 11-56 than to have a great idea, the
ability to be able to tell that story, and not get anybody to pay attention to
them. Because they blurt it out. The most difficult aspect to deal with in
Human Design is to be a verbal gunslinger. It is the most difficult aspect. That
is somebody who has the Ajna Center, or the Self, or the Spleen, connected to
the Throat, and only in that sense. In other words, the Throat is activated, the
Throat can be spoken out of, but there is no motor connected to it. And the
other one, by the way, is the 20-10.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 35
The thing to recognize about the verbal gunslinger is that the verbal gunslinger
has a very powerful Throat Center. There’s no question about that. And yet
the Throat Center has a dual function. And the fact that the Throat Center is
constantly activated means that the Throat Center, at its own level, has an
assumption of being able to act because it can initiate speech. It’s much easier
for an undefined Throat to learn that lesson than it is for a verbal gunslinger,
because the natural tendency of the verbal gunslinger, because they can
manifest verbally, is to do just that. And of course because they manifest
verbally, they meet resistance and get punished, just like any Manifestor would,
and nobody is there to really pay attention to them.
What happens is that not only do they struggle, and out of that struggle have
the anxiety that goes along with that, but the real sad part about that is that
their beauty that is their intelligence and their inherent gift is lost—it’s lost on
deaf ears. You see the verbal gunslinger always has to wait for the opportunity
to be initiated into conversation. It is their gift, that once initiated into
conversation they have greater power than the ones who do the initiating.
They are, after all, very powerful Throat beings.
The Generator Verbal Gunslinger
One of the most common aspects is the verbal gunslinger as a Generator. And
here you can really see the difficulty that arises. Instantaneously, it’s so simple
for them to verbally set themselves up, to verbally try to manifest. “I can do
that, I will do that, I’ll go there, blah, blah, blah.” And of course the frustration
that they suffer from all of that. And how long it takes them to be able to wait
to use their verbal power and their articulating skills to back up their response,
to be the weapon, if you will, of their response, to be the carrier and armor for
them from their response. So it is a difficult aspect and whenever you see that
in dealing with your clients, be clear with them that that’s an experiment that’s
going to be the most difficult for them to live out, and yet the experiment that’s
the most important for them.
The Channel of Structuring 23-43 Gunslinger
When you’re dealing with a 43-23 that is a verbal gunslinger, nobody is ever
going to know what the hell they’re talking about if they’re starting the
conversations—nobody, nobody. It’s the most bizarre babble-speak you can
imagine. Nobody. They’re freaks, after all. The fact of the matter is that the
33336666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
moment you ask a 43-23, the
moment you open up for them
the opportunity to express their
knowing as a response, as being
recognized as a projected
element, when they’re invited to
make their contribution,
everybody pays attention, and everybody gets mutated.
I know so many people who can be so clear at the mental level and nobody’s
listening to them, nobody. This is really the saddest part, and the most bitter
part of the verbal gunslinger’s life. The perversity of what it is to be a human is
that the moment the verbal gunslinger doesn’t have anybody listening to them
because they’re not entering into things correctly, they shout louder. It’s like
being an American in Paris. “Where’s the bathroom?” You know?
Yeah, you figure that if you do it loud they’ll get it, because you don’t know
how to talk to them. See, you just get louder; the verbal gunslingers just get
louder. They become screamers, and yellers. They’re the kind of people that
everybody says, “They shoot from the hip.” They don’t shoot from the hip.
They just bubble and vomit. And everybody says, “I don’t know what that is.
I don’t know what they’re talking about. I don’t understand a word they’re
saying, doesn’t make any sense to me.”
Toten Hosen
And you see, you can be brilliant, I mean brilliant. I know a lot of people—
particularly many people that I’ve met in my work in Europe—whose whole
lives crashed, who went down into deep, dark holes in life, to drugs and to all
kinds of things, and really disappeared. Most of these people were verbal
gunslingers. They gave up on themselves. They gave up on themselves and
they gave up on others. “They’re too stupid to listen. They don’t understand.
They’re all ignorant. They’re dead. They’re not going anywhere.”
A German friend of mine, one day he was telling somebody a story and trying
to turn them on to something, and they walked away, obviously not deeply
impressed. There’s a great expression in German, it’s called ‘toten hosen’. It’s
‘dead pants.’ Can’t get a hard-on out of that if your life depended on it; they’re
just dead. It’s a great expression in German.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 37
That’s what happens. Everybody’s got toten hosen. Everybody’s dead.
Nobody pays attention. Nobody’s being stimulated. Nobody understands.
Nobody knows, and “I’m not going to tell them. I’m just going to slowly die
here inside with my paranoia.” So it is a difficult aspect in design.
Like all of these things that we look at, if we poke our fingers in any place in
somebody’s design, we’re always going to find dilemmas and things that have
to be dealt with. And if we concentrate on this thing at the expense of that
thing, or this or that, and that’s what happens to people who come to design.
They realize, “Oh, I’ve got this kind of channel or this kind of gate,” and they
get into that and they forget about that there’s all these other things that are
operating.
If you’re living out your Type, it homogenizes that whole process for you. It
allows you to live each aspect that is within you correctly, and then you can
move from one to the other, examining it in your process. But at the same
time, you’re not going to leave your Type and the protection that it provides
you in terms of your aura.
One of the great tasks for the verbal gunslinger is to take the experiment of
recognizing that when their intelligence is called upon, their intelligence is
always greater than what is expected of it, and that’s deeply impressive. The
freak that somebody actually asks, what comes out of that freak is so profound
and deep in that moment that it can come out. Now, if they were trying to
figure out what they were going to do themselves, it would all be a mess. And
the same thing is true whether you’re going to try to organize people or
stimulate them. You’re only going to be able to do that by being able to live
out your Type.
Now, obviously that’s going to be different if the Throat is connected to a
motor. If we’re going to have Manifestors and we’re going to have Generators,
how all of that is going to actualize. But the fact of the matter is that the nature
of the mind works at its best when you allow it to follow its Type as a guide.
Then those things come out. And for the verbal gunslinger, it’s such an
important gift to be able to manifest in language. I mean it’s a very important
gift, this consistent manifestation in language. We need those gifts to be paid
attention to.
It’s essential for us to be able to grasp each of these streams that are operating
at the mental level, so that the moment somebody who carries any of these
33338888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
definitions lives out their Type. The moment that the verbal gunslinger waits
for their invitation, that’s the moment that their real intelligence is going to be
appreciated, and that’s the moment the anxiety goes away. After all, it’s about
being healthy. It’s about getting rid of the anxiety. Imagine what it’s like to
understand or know or to have made sense out of something, and nobody
listens. It’s horrible. It’s horrible. And you put it out and you waste your
breath—it’s horrible. And human beings are living with that all the time.
Live Your Type to Relieve Mental Pain
There’s no more pain than the pain that’s racing around at the mental level, the
anxiety level that humanity is operating at. And so much of that can be
alleviated so easily by them simply recognizing how to honor their Type and
get the respect for their intelligence that they deserve. It’s one of those
essential ingredients.
I was just thinking about schools and the way children are educated and trained
and how all children are expected to be Manifestors in the classroom, as well.
And how different we all are, and how different our digestive processes are,
and how much mental anxiety is created in that situation.
It’s an essential ingredient for us to see that mind is a beautiful thing and not
meant to be a torment for us. It’s meant to be a vehicle of our larger union.
It’s not meant to be occupied with all this mundane stuff. After all, it’s not
tribal, it’s not about that. It’s not about how you make a living and who you
make love to and all of those things that make up the life of the body—it isn’t
about that. It’s mostly just collective with the possibility of mutation coming in
so that everything keeps evolving, but it’s about larger principles and larger
issues.
Bonding Releases Our Real Intelligence
We personalize our minds so much. We get very, very, very, very, very, very,
serious about what we think; it’s such a joke. We have no idea of the value of
our intelligence unless we bond with others. It’s out of our bonding that our
real intelligence is released. Out of understanding the mechanics of how we
meet and how we bond together, you can see that there are rules in the game.
If we play the mechanical rules, the verbal gunslingers will have their proper
role. They will be the ones that are called upon to express those things.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 39
They’re the rightful expresser of those things. They’re intended for us to rely
on them.
Where would we be without the 11.4, the great teachers? We rely on them for
everything from the mundane to the obscure. We cannot trust them when they
are full of anxiety, and we don’t listen to them when they’re trying to tell us.
Only when we begin to appreciate them, and you can only appreciate people
through their design. It’s like seeing how nice your formulas can be. In the
moment you recognize their capacity, that’s the moment you can invite them to
show you how significant their contribution can be to understand how things
should be organized, to recognize what truly is stimulating, to recognize truly
what we need to learn, and to be able to have what’s new explained to us. This
is a marvelous capacity of mind, and so much of it is lost.
How many times verbal gunslingers come up to me and they start talking.
They just come up to me and start talking. I truly do not listen to them.
Sometimes I try to make an effort. It doesn’t work. It’s not that I’m not
interested in what they have to say; it’s not that I don’t care about them. It’s
clear to me the moment they start with me that I’m not really listening to them.
I haven’t asked for anything from them.
Now, of course, I get caught in my role as a teacher, so I end up in situations
where by the very formula of being a teacher, I have people who come up to
me, my students, Generators who come up to me and Projectors who come up
to me. And of course, yeah, this is the whole thing about all of us recognizing
the game.
There’s a part of me, and it’s unfortunate that I’m not a humanitarian; one of
you tribal huggie-wuggies will have to do this in the future. But if it were my
nature I would have everybody’s chart in front of me somewhere on a sheet of
paper, and I would recognize the need that certain students would have to be
dealt with just during the course of a program like this, because everybody goes
through different things.
For me to take the time and go up to the Generators and say, “Is everything
okay?” and “How you doing?” and blah, blah, blah. And go up to the
Projectors and invite them to make their comments, and see if the Reflectors
aren’t too disappointed in things, and of course that would be the best way of
dealing with that mechanically.
44440000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
The more we understand the rules, then the more we can set out the rules
between each other. We are the ones that carry the torch of this knowledge.
For us to be able to deal with each other here in these gatherings that we’ve
had, this is one of those real opportunities to play out the mechanics and to
have the experiment with those that support it around you, and see how all that
works.
But it’s essential to recognize that if you’re a verbal gunslinger, you’re not going
to get the respect that you deserve. It’s not about whether you’re right or
wrong, okay? It’s not about that. You see the gift isn’t about coming up with
right or wrong things to say, the gift is being able to say them at all. Please
understand that.
It’s essential for us to hear all of the opinions, and it’s essential for us to get as
many of the ideas as possible. In other words, we’re open to all of that, and we
need them. We need them for our very business of being a duality, of playing
around with comparison, of being able to compare one to the other. This is
how we codify our history, and this is how we substantiate our facts. But of
course, it’s not about doing.
Whether something is a valid experience is something that you’re only going to
know when you live it out, no matter how many people have had it before you
and have written about it. And no matter what the theory says, and no matter
what the opinion is, and no matter what the facts are, if you don’t experiment
with it yourself, you can never truly accept it absolutely. It takes the body, it
takes the motors, it takes the real authority, it takes the nature of your Type to
have things happen.
Disconnect from giving your mind authority. Watch the anxiety go away.
Watch the medicine cabinet lose its Excedrins and Tylenols, because that’s
really what it’s all about: getting rid of that anxiety. And the other thing is that
the benefit that it brings to your eyes, to your ability to see more clearly. You
know, the cliché we have about the nature of emotions blinding.
Mental Anxiety Creates So Much Distortion
One of those things to recognize about the nature of mental anxiety is that it
creates so much distortion. In creating so much distortion, what it does is it
focuses attention on things, the mountains that we make out of molehills.
That’s what anxiety does. Anxiety creates exaggerations of fears that are hardly
Projected Channels and Circuitry 41
probable or possible. The fear that the comet that’s going to pass by in 2027 is
actually going to make a left turn and smash the crap out of us. There are
going to be all kinds of people on this planet who are going to be cheering for
that. Ah, really, cheering for that. The New Age fringe, eh.
Not only that but beware of people who tell you that there’s a UFO behind it
and they’ve got some Kool-Aid for you. Be careful that you don’t go shopping
for Nikes. Then they all die with Nikes on. They’d all gone shopping for
Nikes the day before. I thought about that, and shit, it must be a big spaceship.
The human mind is so unreasonable. It’s so incredible. The whole thing about
the nature of anxiety is that it can get so out of whack. Really, totally out of
whack. There are people who really think when they wake up in the morning,
they honestly believe that the world is going to come to an end that day.
Now, the immune system is gagged with laughter. Fortunately, it only works in
the moment so that the gagging doesn’t kill you. It gasps with laughter at such
a concept. Nonetheless, the mind is really able to live out that fear.
Mental Anxiety Distorted is Potential Madness
You have to see how distorting the anxiety field can become. See, this is where
madness is. All madness is in the relationship between the Head
Center and the Ajna Center. In a sense, we could call them the
format energies of the mind. In calling them that, and in seeing
them as that, you can also see that—just as the format energies
between the Root and the Sacral all carry with them depression
as a theme—at the mental level, that madness, the potential of
madness, the potential of anxiety distorted is there in each of
those streams, and is a potential of the mind. So we can really get mad.
The 64-47 can get totally crazy by not being able to make sense out of life.
What happens to them is that then they make sense out of everything. You
know these people, somebody farts and they think that it’s a sign from God to
go left instead of right.
Well, it’s true. That kind of anxiety is really crazy. These are people that see
signs in everything. Now, it isn’t to say that there isn’t truth in that. There’s
truth in everything, but there’s madness in stuff, too, because if you can’t make
sense out of things and you get so distorted, you start making sense out of
everything, and it’s still all distorted. And these turn into bizarre ideas.
44442222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
I remember this guy in Holland, my humor today, really… He was convinced
that you could use a Black and Decker power drill to drill through the skull
here and take the pressure off the third eye, and people
went along with it. He would (drilling sound). Yeah, nuts,
bananas. And to take the pressure off the 24. “Oh I don’t
want to hear it anymore, don’t want to hear it anymore.”
Madness.
The madness in the 61-24 is the madness that comes with
the anxiety that there are things that one cannot possibly
know. I was saved from real madness by being allowed to
know what is knowable. And I have nothing else to look for. I’m not
interested in the least in what is unknowable, doesn’t mean anything to me.
Crazy people, crazy people want to know what’s unknowable, which means
that most of you are a lot crazier than me, eh? Oh, no joke in that. That’s true.
There are so many things that you want to know that you can never know; let
go. In that lies madness. Oh, it doesn’t mean that you’re really crazy or
popped now. But, of course, given the nature of your conditioning and given
the nature of your life, that anxiety can become so distorting that it makes you
mad. You become obsessed with the knowing you cannot have. And in the
same way as the binary works, you make up knowings, and then people really
think you’re nuts, because all of that is taking place between the Head and the
Ajna. That’s not about trying to translate that from the Ajna to the Throat.
You give that madness into the vehicle of the 43-23 and what comes out of
their Throat is madness. They’re not going to be able to bring that into a form
that is rational and explainable because it is unknowable. And the moment that
you hear knowers who are going through that process, you know they’re full of
it. You can hear it, they don’t know, they can’t explain it. They just, “I know
it, I know it, I know it.”
At the logical level, the madness of formulas, oh this is the meat of black magic
and world dominance and, yeah, all that dark, crazy stuff…come up with the
magical formula. You see, doubt rules our lives. When you recognize that the
15-5 is the only universal channel, and the universal value of the logic process,
then you can see that doubt is a deep, deep instrument of anxiety, and
something that we are designed to confront one way or another. Now, the
moment you do not understand that life is absolutely logical, and that you’re a
vehicle operating mechanically, then your life is going to be filled with endless
Projected Channels and Circuitry 43
doubts, endless doubts, and those endless doubts creating a pressure and a
stress to come up with formulas.
It is not an accident that the line of liars is in the 4th gate, 4th line. There could
be enormous fabrication; the real madness of logic is to come up with, really,
false answers. The madness of false answers. “I really know why that
happened,” and becoming obsessed with that. All kinds of people who are
truly deluded, trying to explain logically their delusion. Using logical tools, and
of course, logical tools to express their madness.
Now that isn’t to say that everybody that has these channels is mad, please.
However, it is to say that if they don’t have an outlet to the Throat, that you
are dealing with a building up of pressure of the anxiety. In building up the
pressure of the anxiety, if these beings do not understand their nature, if they
do not recognize how they operate, what their Type is, that they can’t write the
script, that they can’t control what they’re going to say, if they don’t understand
how these things work, the madness isn’t that far away.
Madness is something that is there in the public domain. In the context of how
I would describe it, it’s quite common. There are all kinds of delusions at work
in those three channels that don’t necessarily impact in a negative way on the
rest of society. It may impact on your partner or your children, that you keep
on telling them that you know how to whatever, how to get a perpetual motor
working, and your kids have to nod through that at dinner time every night.
That you know how to do that. If people would listen to you, that you could
tell them how to have cheap energy forever, and your kids are nodding their
heads. And as long as you don’t tell that to their friends while their friends are
at the house, nothing happens, it’s okay. They just figure you’re kind of loony.
So many of these mundane, little mad tics that we have are from this kind of
pressure. And that pressure is that the anxiety, the only way to deal with the
anxiety is to try to fool it. To try to fool it by coming up with an answer,
coming up with a rationale, or coming up with a sense of it. The mind is so
messed up that it thinks that it can help itself get out of its own mess by
creating more mess. This is the mind doing its own number, so then out of
that to get away from the anxiety it creates a delusion, and then it tries to keep
on expressing the delusion in the hopes that ultimately the delusion becomes
reality. And of course all along, they’re full of anxiety that the delusion is going
to be recognized for what it is, that they are going to be found out, which
means they even get deeper into it. Human beings.

One of the major aspects of an analyst’s job is to deal with the nature of mind.
You’re not going to surprise anybody who sits with you by telling them that
their mind doesn’t run their life, you really aren’t. As a generalization, all
human beings know the joke of all that, and they’ve all suffered the
consequences of following their mind. They wouldn’t be coming to you if their
mind could solve their problems because they wouldn’t need you to solve them
for them. That’s why they’re there.
It’s essential for them to see that in recognizing that the mind is not their
authority, that does not mean that the mind is not important or of value, and
that their particular minds are not to be discounted. There is an inherent
beauty to the way in which they operate, and respect will come to them when
they allow it to come to them.
This is the gift that you bring to people when you do a reading. You bring
them a mirror of what their real essence is, a mirror of their beauty, a mirror of
their mechanical beauty. The mechanical beauty in that picture frozen and
unspoiled by conditioning, just this mechanical beauty. And for them to see it’s
not about saying, “This is good,” and “This is bad,” and “This part of me is
good and this is bad.”
It’s about recognizing that when you live out your nature all of it is you and
correct, and you will get the benefits of that. You will get to see the ease of
which you can move through your process, and the greatest stumbling block is
the mind. You all know that the only way you can come into this knowledge is
mentally. You can’t come any other way. You have to come in with your
mind, because what we’re doing in this process is reconditioning the mind. As
we use the mind as our tool to understand the Human Design, we’re also
conditioning our minds to accept their role and its importance. It’s a hustle job
we’re doing here.
I’ve been seducing my mind for years. “It’s okay, it’s okay, I love you, you’re
nice, you’re nice, you’re nice, you’re great for everybody else, okay, not for me.
Sssssh.” No, that’s what we’re doing. Do that for them. Don’t take it away
from them. Don’t make the mind the enemy; it is not the enemy. It just needs
to be used properly like anything else, and there is a mechanic to that.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 45
Open up for them always that opportunity and their experiment that they can
live out the basic experiments for their life. What it means to experiment with
Type, what it means to experiment with not allowing the mind to make a final
decision. It isn’t about interfering with the mind’s processes; you can’t do that.
But what you can do, because the mind isn’t connected to a motor, is that you
don’t have to act on what the mind says. That’s the thing of mechanics. You
don’t, you really don’t. It doesn’t matter whether your mind’s connected to a
motor, you really don’t. I know, I’m awake with that, I know, it’s true.
So the fact is that you don’t have to take that act of decision until the moment
comes for you that the timing is right. The timing is always right according to
your design, according to your definition, according to your Type; wait for it to
happen. And then you’ll really see how beautiful the mind is.
So many of you have got such wonderful stuff that you’ve taken in
intellectually. Not just this, I mean your life process, the information that you
have. And whether your mind is defined or it’s undefined, it’s the same thing.
You’re never going to get that respect for your mind unless you live out your
nature. It doesn’t matter how brilliant you are.
I know how difficult it is for a Generator to know, or a Projector to know, but
Human Design, and to be with somebody who doesn’t know Human Design,
and to keep their damn mouth shut until they’re asked. What do you do? It’s
easy, wait for them to ask, and then they come in completely, and it’s you
putting your aura in them.
Now I know that’s difficult, but then you see, if you wait for that, if you wait
for the formula, the results, wow, because they’re there to hear you. They’re
there to listen to your mind. They’re there to take that in. And then your mind
gets the respect that it deserves. Does not mean that you’re right.
The behavior’s correct, they take your mind in, you’ve had your opportunity to
be clear, and then they tell you you’re full of it. What to do? But it’s been
correct, and you’ve had your opportunity. And their not accepting at that point
is not because they weren’t listening. It’s because they disagree. This is when
mind has its potency. This is when it has its power. And so many people
suffer from self-degradation of their minds. That has to be liberated.

The Differences in Verbal Gunslinger Expression
I was asked about the difference in the way in which the verbal
gunslingers express themselves, these projected elements. The
first thing is that the connections between the Self and the
Throat, that these connections are always about the need of
the identity to express itself and to express direction and love,
and it can be an ongoing process; in other words, at any
moment, that can come out.
The mental definition to the Throat, all of those
are a frequency of a whole lifetime; in other words, you can wait
your whole life to try to make sense of things or understand
them or whatever. The mental verbal gunslinger is forever able
to open up their mouth and start talking.
The only one that is specifically different is the Splenic Center connected to the
Throat, both through the 16-48 and the 20-57. Then what
you have is people, that as verbal gunslingers, they don’t
always gun sling, because it’s going to be based on their
splenic system, and it’s going to be based on a spontaneous
action in the now.
There are certain situations that will bring out gunslinging
in them, but they’re not as ready to be a verbal gunslinger as
either the mind or the Self. So I hope in some sense that clarifies that for you.
(Long pause.) Yeah, sometimes you just have to sit and wait. I got off on a
totally different,—I have no control over my unconscious mind so, where it
starts going sometimes is always very surprising to me.
Some basic things about the nature of the connection now
between the Ajna and the Throat. We’ve been looking at these
channels between the Head Center and the Ajna in the context
of how anxiety can be turned into madness, that the pressure of
anxiety is something that can lead to distortion, and the
distortion, ultimately, can result in having all kinds of mental
difficulties. So often these people have a hard time living in the
world.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 47
There are a number of generations, particularly around 1960-
1961, in which you have a whole generation, tens of millions
of people, that have both the 64-47 and the 63-4 in their
design. This is the 1960-1961 generation. So of course they
carry with them all of that potential as a madness feel.
There’s a lot of madness, a lot of craziness in the world, a lot
of delusion in the world, and of course this generation is
carrying all of that energy and programming all of that energy.
But the relationship between the Head Center and the Ajna is very, very
different than the relationship between the Ajna and the Throat. It’s very
different. You see, there is a tension that gets added the moment you step
towards finding expression.
The tension between the Head Center and the Ajna, if there’s anything really to
focus on; in other words, the anxiety is there simply to be able to make sense,
understand, to know.
But the moment you get from the Ajna to the Throat, you have
not only the anxiety of whether you’ve made sense, understand
or know, but you have the tension there of whether or not you
can actually get that to an expression.
Talk to somebody who has a defined Ajna and an undefined
Throat, and they will tell you how difficult it is to be able to
turn their inner language into an actual verbal expression. It’s
very different, and it’s very difficult. That’s why these gates in the Throat have
such special powers as metamorphic powers. They really do something unique,
and they take what is fundamentally a visual in dealing with the collective, and
they have to turn that into language. They have to express it in language. They
have to articulate it with sound.
Verbal Gunslingers Can Explode Their Thyroids
One thing that I didn’t mention about the verbal gunslinger. You should really
recognize, obviously, is that because the verbal gunslinger has no direct access
to a motor, that Throat can only talk so long before it gives out. One of the
real punishments for verbal gunslingers in this life is that they can explode their
thyroids. They keep on gun slinging and keep on gun slinging and keep on gun
slinging.
44448888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
So this metamorphosis that takes place is a very powerful event. At the same
time, it means that whatever energy you have verbally, that you have to
husband that energy carefully. You see, the verbal gunslinger that waits for the
opportunity to express themselves is getting access to the aura of the other.
Nine times out of ten, they’re getting access to a motor. And then they can
speak with ease; all the pressure is off the Throat. Basically what you have with
a verbal gunslinger is a toy that has batteries in it. Now you can turn the toy on
and it’s going to do a hell of a job for a while. And then slowly
everything….and then they can’t talk anymore. And, of course, they make up
reasons for why they can’t talk anymore, which is any kind of possible
conditioned interpretation: anger, frustration, bitterness, whatever the case may
be.
The Abstract Process
The 11-56: Ideas, Stimulation, Experiences, Seekers
So first of all, in terms of the experiential process and the experiential mind, the
11-56 is something that is really an essential ingredient in the human way, and it
is an essential ingredient to the
human mind. That said, it’s not
fact, and it’s never intended to be
fact. An idea.
An idea is something that can be
stimulating, and an idea is
something that can lead to
experience. But there’s nothing in that idea that can stand up to real scrutiny.
It cannot stand up to experimentation. It cannot stand up to the formula.
I have met so many 11-56s, and they are truly their formula. They are seekers.
They are searchers. They seek ideas. They search out others. This is an
extraordinarily social aspect of abstract circuitry. The 11-56s are very, very
social minds. Very social. They can drive you absolutely bananas. They really
can. However, these are very, very stimulating minds.
The difficulty that comes with the 11-56 is that because it is their genetic role to
be able to collect and share experiences, they would desperately like to have
them themselves. Therein lies their pain. It’s not necessarily possible. The 11-
Projected Channels and Circuitry 49
56 that’s cut off from a motor, that 11-56 really lives out a very deep pain, the
pain that they cannot follow their own stimulation. Now, you see 11-56s are
never intended to do such.
They are our storytellers. They are our first tradition of education. Our first
tradition of education is the village storyteller, the shaman,
whoever it was that had that responsibility. In the
matriarchy, the eldest, the keeper of the stories. There was
always an 11-56 around.
Remember that the mutation of the larynx is in the 12th
gate in the 4th line—the prophet. And the very opposite of
the 12th gate fourth line is the 11.4, the teacher, with its
three different variations. That is, the difference between being a teacher and a
sage and a guru. All of that is there in the 11.4.
It’s essential to recognize that the gift of the 11-56 is to teach us about
experience, not to yearn for experience itself. This is when the 11-56 truly has
its profound impact. Because you see, that design of being a seeker, and a
design of curiosity is not for them, it’s for the other so that they know all the
possibilities of what can be sought out, that they can get to recognize what
stimulates them, and in that, they may enter into that kind of experience.
But it’s the gift of the 11-56 to bring curiosity and stimulation to the other.
And of course 11-56’s are internally, eternally messed up within themselves.
They can’t teach themselves anything; that’s not what they’re here for. And
because their gift is to be teachers, their gift is to be stimulators, they tend to
give more credence and value to the mind than anybody else, and tend to take
seriously their ideas—deeply, seriously, their ideas. Kenneth Starr, the
American lawyer is an 11-56.
There is nothing more powerful than the outrageous seriousness of a believer.
Oh, the 11-56 can be absolutely, unbelievably obnoxious. They are so serious
about their believing. And of course we know why. They have to be, because
they’re so anxious that no one will believe them, and they desperately need to
be believed. And so they become more and more and more caught up in their
belief system. And the more they believe, the greater it is. It’s not just enough
that a teacher comes into the world, they have to glow, they have to walk on
water, they’ve got to fart gold, they’ve got to kill snakes in the crib, they have to
commune with angels.
55550000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Once you start believing, boy you’ve got to keep piling it up. Keep yourself
convinced that your believing is true. And you get so damn serious. “I believe
more than you do.” People actually say things like that. “I believe in Jesus
more than you do. And on Judgment Day I shall be redeemed, and you shall
go to hell, because I believe more than you do.” As a kid I used to watch
evangelical television for humor. I love them, eh? “Put your hand on the
television.” Okay. I’m with you. Oh, yeah. Jesus on the main line. I’m going
to have to say something nice now about 11-56s.
When I see the joke of humanity—Karl Marx with his 11th gate. He was really
serious. The mythology that came out of that was hilarious. If you get into
belief systems, you can get really weird. Kâmpŭchéa/Cambodia—they were
living out the belief system. So they butchered a million people.
Belief systems can be devastating. Those people who are threatened in their
beliefs and do not have the substantiation behind their anxiety, they will kill
you if you get too close to touching their core. Because if you touch their core,
they fall apart. They won’t let that happen. They get very, very, very serious,
these people.
On the other hand, they can be rather delightful, kind of mindless, hippie types,
rolling through the world, looking for this and that and the other thing, and
really finding nothing. The beauty of the 11-56 is that it is our teachers, and
that we need to have good teachers. We need to have teachers who are not
identified—that is not the nature of the abstract—that are not identified with
the ideas, that they are simply the teachers of experience, nothing more,
nothing less, without an agenda. Not the creators of mythology, and of course
this is the dilemma.
The 56th gate in its storytelling capacity can be a historian, or can be a
propagandist, can tell us the truth or distort it for its advantages. All of that is
inherent in the way it operates, and every time that an 11-56 plays verbal
gunslinger, you’re in danger. The moment they are releasing their intelligence
naturally, they’re a lot cleaner by nature. Ideas are transitory, they’re transitory.
Life, and how we experience it, is transitory. All these hundreds of millions of
horses that we had to move us around, and the kind of life that we had, all
these things, things move and change. It’s all transitory, ideas are transitory.
They have their time, that’s all.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 51
The moment that 11-56 has recognized that their responsibility is to be honest
brokers, good teachers, then we all benefit in the end. How hard it is now to
get the truth from the witnessing of experience and we have the most
incredible technology you can imagine to watch things. How many books have
been written about Kennedy’s assassination? How many ways are there to tell
that story? How many myths have grown out of that that have become
delusions that are accepted?
It’s so essential for us to have clean teachers. We can get them, ultimately,
people live out their nature, they live out their Type. When the 11-56
recognizes that its ideas and its stimulation is not for it to identify with, but its
capacity to be able to stimulate others, to share with them the processes of
being human, and whatever is going on experientially in that time.
The Logical Process
When we come to the other side and we look at the logical process, the
pressure that is there on the logical process is that it is open to and knows that
it’s going to be the target for criticism the moment it speaks. This is one of the
main anxieties in the
Logic logical process. Abstract
Remember, logic is
starved of energy, so
the presentation of
logic is much more
important.
If you look at the
abstract and the logic
processes, they’re actually quite reversed. The lower abstract process, non-
mental, is driving the abstract mind. Out of the lower abstract process, the
abstract mind gets its fuel, if you will, gets the information it needs to teach out
of that experience.
But in order for logic to get the energy for experimentation, logic needs to have
a viable formula that can be experimented with. It’s not like you can
experiment with nothing. You need the experiment, to be guided into the
experiment, and here the logical mind takes on a very powerful function.
Recognize the importance of mind for us as a totality.
55552222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
The logical mind, being a part of the logical universalizing process, is an
essential tool for us. That’s why we don’t mind so much, when somebody’s
telling a story, if we sense that there’s less than the truth in it. But we mind an
awful lot when somebody’s trying to get us to understand a fact, and we can
sense a lie in it. We get very upset, very upset.
We expect the storyteller to be a storyteller. That joke of a little boy that’s
sitting with his mother and father and his father is telling a story and all of a
sudden the little boy interrupts and says, “Is that true?” And his mother
smacks him and says, “Now, you be quiet, he’s just telling a story.” We give
that to the 56; they can tell a story and be entertaining, because we’re not
looking for the truth in that sense. We’re looking for the moral, we’re looking
for the idea behind the story. It’s different.
The 17-62: Just the Facts
But when it comes to the 17-62, we want the facts ma’am, just the facts ma’am,
Dragnet. “Just the facts,
ma’am. I don’t want to know
the color of your eyes, I just
want to know how tall you are;
give me the facts ma’am. And
don’t lie. How old did you say
you were? Give me the facts
ma’am.” We don’t want anybody messing with the facts. We take that very
seriously.
The collective is very serious. They’re very serious, which makes the tribe and
individuals very nervous, because the collective can get very, very serious. They
can also be terribly frivolous. There’s always the other side. But that
seriousness is particularly a pressure on the logical side. I know, I have the 4
and the 62, I know that pressure of seriousness. When it comes to answers in
my life, or it comes to detail, I can feel that pressure, that it’s serious, that you
don’t mess around with the answer and you don’t mess around with the detail.
So it’s an essential ingredient in the 17-62 that they are under a great deal of
pressure which means that if the opinion is not based on a sound formula, they
have to play with the facts. And that’s when they run into trouble. Because
you see, we’re counting on them to give us the experiments we need to work
on.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 53
We had one of these grand blunders just recently here in the States. NASA and
Boeing, I think together, were designing a jet airplane that could travel at
supersonic speeds that could hold 300 or 400 people. And after spending 150
million dollars, they realized that it wasn’t going to work. They realized it
wasn’t going to work because the original engineering and architectural plans
simply did not pan out successfully.
Now, that’s when you know you’ve got a 17-62 and you know that they do not
have the full or correct answer to work with. And so what they do is say
“Okay, well these are the facts that fit.” And often it’s enough information for
people to go along with it until they finally get to the point where they realize
there’s something wrong in the formula, that it really doesn’t work that way.
The 17 can create things like computer programs, but lets everybody find the
mistakes. They’re asking for the 62 detail from others, “Well, tell me where the
mistakes are, I’ll fix them.” But they don’t know where they are. When the 17
is programming they don’t realize where the mistakes are. Now that’s a
process.
So please understand that this business of the importance of the 17-62, that
whole flow going down, is that the power of the opinions is going to be
conditioned by the quality of the formula. It means if you’re a 17-62 and you
don’t have your own 4, then you wait for it. Your wisdom can be then to pick
exactly the right formula to form your opinion from. That’s when those things
really work.
All of that’s mechanical about understanding how you’re designed, so you can
take advantage of those things. And once you’ve recognized the correct
formula, then you can go to work at trying to bring the opinion which is a
pattern, and give it a name, and be able to describe it reasonably. The 62nd gate
is a magical gate. It is not there for flowery language. It often sounds like the
gestapo. “One and one equals two.” Well, it’s true. In other words, logic is
something that’s hammered into us because the real potential of logic is that, in
terms of the Maia, it can be an absolute. One and one is two is an absolute.
We know that. So logic can be very firm in that.
Logic has problems is when it’s unreasonable. One of the things to
recognize—and all of this is covered in the Throat Center tapes—is that there
are qualities to voices. The quality to the logical voice is to be reasonable or to
be unreasonable. And logic is only unreasonable, the expression is only
55554444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
unreasonable when the opinion and facts do not stand up; in other words, that
the formula is not correct. We need to have solid formulas properly organized.
Just as the 11.4 is a magical gate, so is the 17.4. It is a gate where the
responsibility to manage and organize the collective is established, and to
externalize that organization of the collective. And the collective can only be
organized through facts; there is nothing else. The Holy Grail of collective
security is shared, collective, proved facts—nothing more important to the
collective.
Now one of the things about the nature of being a Projector and a verbal
gunslinger is that in your urge to express your opinion or your facts, you’re less
likely to do it well. In other words, your organizational skills are deeply limited.
You’re like the toy with the batteries; you can only keep it up for so long and
then the batteries wear down. And you haven’t really been able to get it across
because nobody is listening; they’re just waiting for your battery to go down.
“Yeah, they’ll shut up in a few minutes, just wait, just wait, just wait, they’re
almost done. I can feel it now they’re in the last gasp.” And then the battery’s
gone and you’re saved, and you walk away saying, “They don’t really know
what they’re doing.”
The importance of the 17-62 is that if they allow their aura to do their talking,
they are the center of mental organization. They are the key to mental
organization and will be approached with respect. And then they can explain
reasonably what that organization is, how it can be organized, because nothing
is more democratic and collective than the logical circuit. Because even by the
time you get to the point of the 62 where you can actually establish a legitimate
fact, be able to articulate that as understanding, and be able to share that
understanding to those who seek it out, it’s still a long way to a motor.
The Three Verbal Gunslingers of Logic
The 16-48 doesn’t lead to a motor; the 31-7 doesn’t lead to
a motor. This is the difficult task of logic; that’s why it’s
so important for us to live out our Type so that logic can
actually get more easily turned into energy and activity.
There’s so much organizing going on that’s just on paper.
And nobody’s paying attention to it, because so many of
those organizers are simply trying to tell everybody how to
Projected Channels and Circuitry 55
be organized, instead of being recognized for their organizational skills.
That means that the 31-7 will have to be involved, that the alpha will have to be
involved. Do you notice? Logic has three verbal gunslingers out of the three
gates of the Throat. No motor. That’s why we’ve got so much blah, blah, blah
on the logic level. And not only that, that blah, blah, blah is talented. It’s
talented. It’s got all kinds of skills and depth; it’s all these qualities there.
The 31-7: Alphas are Selected by Others
I’ve known people who have the 31-7 who really kind of think that’s it’s very
Leonian. It’s all Leo; they get this kind of, “Well, I’m a leader.” This is a
projected element. And you can see 31-7s when they play out their leadership
role when they’re young, and you see them at the playground. And there’s the
31-7 verbal gunslinger saying, “We’re going to go over to the swings now.”
And everybody goes in another direction. Everybody! Everybody! It’s an
amazing thing. Nobody pays attention.
You see, alphas are made, and they’re made by others. The alpha is selected by
the others. I have watched that. You can see that take place in animals. I’ve
had many litters of dogs in my life, and you can see how quickly the alpha
establishes themselves. Quick. And the others have to agree to it; otherwise,
it’s always a two-way street.
So the 31-7, yes, they do have
wonderful skills of leadership. That’s
what they’re here for. But the nature
of that leadership is that they can
never say, “I am the leader. Follow
me.” They always have to wait for
somebody to say, “You’re the one
that can lead us. Will you?” And then they say, “I am the leader. Follow me,”
and everybody follows. It’s so simple. And then everybody thinks they’re great
leaders. Unless they have the 7.4 (the abdicator) and eventually get tired of them
and people fire them. That’s okay, too.
One of those things to be clear about is that the power of logic suffers so much
in humanity because it’s all projected, and it’s all projected gunslingers, and so
you’ve got all this talk. Go into a new age bookstore and look at how many of
them are going to tell you they’re logical. And go into any kind of bookstore
55556666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
and look at all of the concepts, the so-called logical concepts that would change
everybody’s life.
New architecture, new plumbing, new this, new that, new societies. It’s an
endless piece of business. It’s all projection. And the only way that it’s ever
going to work, and the only way that it’s ever going to get any respect is if these
people live out the nature of their Type. That’s all they have to do.
At the moment that any Ajna to the Throat is ready to wait to have its aura
recognized, it will get its mind recognized as a reward. And that feels very
good, that the other will listen. In terms of logic, it is essential. And it’s
essential that we have reliable facts, because it’s the only way that we’re going
to be healthy, if we really know how things work. We can’t do anything about
them until we are identified with them as a collective, and then we can act.
When I was a kid, the neighborhood I lived in was very nice and quiet. When I
was growing up, there were maybe eight or nine houses in the area. There were
no traffic lights; they weren’t necessary. Over a period of ten years, that
neighborhood began to expand. There was a lot more traffic and city busses
and all kinds of things. Several of the parents on different occasions had
gotten together and said maybe we should get a traffic light. There was what
had become a busy corner. It was discussed, but nothing was done. There
were plans. They had talked about it, all of the collective, logical stuff that goes
on. It took the death of a little girl who got hit by a car at that corner. And the
next day, I mean the next day, the city brought a light and set it up.
Now, this is the whole thing about collective and collective action. The thing
for us is not to have to wait until a little child dies before we do something, as a
metaphor for us. This is what happens when you have a very confused
collective field. You have all kinds of competition, and I use ‘competition’ in
the terms of ‘best.’ You’ve got the best theory when somebody spends money
on it. That’s ‘best’ in the logical process. And you’ve got this enormous
competition to find energy amongst those in our society that are organizing us.
In order for us to be secure in the patterns, we have to be able to finance that.
We have to be able to pay for it.
Throughout the United States, throughout the Western world, throughout
most of the world now, there is a desperate need of governments to be able to
supply optic fiber so that we can all live in the technological new age. Now
that’s an enormous investment. There were many societies who saw that much
Projected Channels and Circuitry 57
earlier than other societies. Until you get around to the time where the pattern,
the logical pattern is self-evident, only then slowly can you gather the resources
to be able to do something to be able to ensure the security for the future. It’s
essential for us.
When you look at the way that government is run, because government is
collective business, you can see what government bureaucracy really is. How
many investigations are going on, and I mean normal things, exploratory
papers, committees, and committees of committees and committees of
committees of committees to look at this and that and the other thing. You’re
paying as taxpayers for all of that logical stuff to take place before any action
can come of it. Most of the dollars that are spent on looking at theory and
what theory can be turned into practice, never gets to practice. Never. It’s
astonishing.
So one of the most important things in the awakening of living your design is
the possibility of slowly being able to bring into proper perspective the logical
process and how it should really work. Part of that way is that the logical
verbal gunslinger, whether that is from the 17-62—what we’ve been looking at,
or its other variations—the moment they’re living out their Type, we’re going
to get cleaner material. That’s what we need. We really need things that truly
can be organized, and we really need as much of the facts as is humanly
possible for us to get. The moment that those facts are there, automatically
the opportunity for experimenting with it should be there.
The Collective-Logical Mind Needs to be Networked
So one of the things to see is that the collective logical mind, more than any
other mind, needs to be networked. The abstract mind can write books or tell
stories or make movies as a metaphor. But if you’re looking at the logical
mind, it’s got to keep you up-to-date. It’s got to keep on adding on the facts as
they accumulate.
I don’t know how many of you have seen it, the new and improved, 44-26, the
new and improved basic training. It’s very beautiful. It is based on 7 hours of
basic training. The whole thing about having a formula is that that formula
needs to then be opened up, the facts and the organization have to be laid out.
We are living in an archetype of that. I know how much work was put into the
organizing of all of that material over a long period of time.
55558888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
This is the magic that’s possible in being able to organize detail. Because the
moment you can organize detail, that basic training is a manual for anyone
wanting to step into the experiment of Human Design; anyone. It’s not a
question of whether they should step into the experiment or not; it’s a question
that they have all the tools that are necessary. Now this is the mental value in
order to be able to provide all of the facts, so experimentation is something
that you either do or not. But it’s not a question of whether you can
experiment or not. It’s then either one or the other, because all the data’s
there. And then if the energy is available, bang, away you go. But you see it
takes time.
All formulas need to be fleshed out. How many things, ultimately, and how
many ways, ultimately, Human Design will be described, will fill a library easily
by itself, and go on and on. Because in the end, once you really have a formula,
you can go infinitely with that formula. It’s part of the process. The gift of
both the 17-62 and the 11-56 is that they have the ability to communicate these
essential things to us. Your client has to know, when you’re doing their
reading, the beauty of what is inherent in their design, so they see it themselves,
and they recognize that the real beauty will come out if they let it—if they let it.
And of course, they’re afraid.
Verbal gunslingers are afraid. They’re driven by anxiety. “If I don’t say it now,
then I’m never going to be able to tell them, and they won’t hear it, and they
won’t know.” Well it’s not true; it’s not true. It happens. Whatever your
formula is, you’re meant to have it, it is yours, and it operates in conjunction
with all the other formulas. It is life.
If you’re a 17-62, you’re going to end up organizing. It’s just the way it is.
Whether that organizing is reasonable, unreasonable, whether it is true to its
formula or not, whatever it may be, you’re still going to do it. So it’s not like
saying to that 17-62 or 11-56, “This is not going to happen to you.” It will.
They’ll get to stimulate, they’ll get to organize. But for them to feel good about
themselves, to love themselves, to respect their own minds, they have to wait.
They have to wait to act out their Type. They have to wait for people to come
to that, and they will. They will come to that naturally, because it is the power
of their aura.

The Individual Process
The 43-23: The Acoustic Third Ear
Finally, with the 43-23, it’s a very different process. The individuality is
acoustic and the individual mind is acoustic. Basically the individual mind
operates from noise to cacophony to insight and to babble. It is exceedingly
difficult for knowing to find a voice—it is exceedingly difficult. The 43rd gate is
a spontaneous gate. Remember how I described to you the emotional wave of
the individual in which they can go along on an even level and spike? And
basically that’s what the 43 is.
It’s in a pulse…it’s in a pulse.
Whatever it knows, it holds
on to. “I know, I know. I
know, I know. I know, I
know.” It just stays there.
Stuck. It’s waiting for
breakthrough. It’s waiting for “Aha!” This happens throughout the 43 life.
Now, that “Aha, I know!” doesn’t really mean they’re ever going to be able to
explain it. Ever. In this life of mine I’ve been a teacher in many ways. I’ve
taught young people in schools. It’s a phenomenon as a teacher that you say
something, you ask a question, and there’s that 43 going, “I know! I know! I
know!”
And then you say, “Okay, you tell me.” They don’t know. They knew in here,
“I know, I know, I know,” but they couldn’t explain it. You see, the individual
mind is very different. Not only that, but the 17 and the 11 are working
visually. The 11 wants you to see the story, see the movie, to be stimulated by
it and carried away by it; and the 17 wants you to see the facts, to see the
pattern, to see the point. But the 43 isn’t about seeing, it says, “I want you to
hear what I know.” Think about that. Inside it’s hearing it, it’s not seeing it,
it’s hearing its knowing. That’s why 43s hear voices like Ra Uru Hu. They hear
sounds and noises. They can hear their own voice talking inside of their head,
but they’re not actually hearing that.
I call the 43rd gate, as a joke, the third ear. I think it’s a nice joke. But that’s
what the 43rd gate is, it’s the third ear. And that third ear inside is making up
what it’s hearing. I don’t know how to really describe that; in other words, it’s
not hearing a sound, in that sense. It’s hearing the possibility of what a sound
66660000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
could be, imagined as a sound, but it’s not a real sound. They’re not hearing it,
not in the way our ears hear, through their diaphragm.
Now this is where the difficulty is. The difference between the 43 and the 23 is
the difference between the 43 being English and horny, and the 23 being
Japanese and blind. I don’t know where that comes from, I really don’t. I
don’t know who my muse is today. But it’s true; you’ve got a translation
problem. Do you know what I mean?
The 43 Has a Translation Problem
You have a real translation problem. The 43 has a hard time being translated
by the 23. So 43-23s are forever going, “Oh, I know,”
inside, and then they hear themselves explain that knowing,
and they really feel funny, because it’s not a good translation.
If you don’t really know the other language, it can be
disastrous in the way it comes out. So many knowers, in
trying to explain their knowing, open up big cans of worms.
They end up saying things that cause all kinds of dilemmas,
because they can’t translate properly.
It’s like this wonderful thing in the Dead Sea Scrolls. They wanted to get into
all this phallic stuff, instead of talking about what the real Sumerian translation
was, which was “mushroom.” But they didn’t want to get into the translation
as of drugs. If you’re looking at the famous Rosetta stone, which was an
earliest possibility, Aramaic to Greek to Egyptian hieroglyph, the one who did
the translation from the Aramaic to the Greek blew it.
And so you’ve got all kinds of hieroglyphs, that up until the last ten years, were
deeply misunderstood. Instead of saying that she was a queen of plenty, it was
saying a lot of other things. This is what happens when translations are bad,
and translations can be outrageously bad; nothing worse than a 43-23 with a
bad translator.
This is the whole thing about the 23rd gate. This is the gate of translation. This
gate of being able to split it apart, being able to break it up into its components.
Remember, this is the Channel of Structuring. The 61-24-43-23 as just a
keynote link is the ‘awareness to structure,’ or the ‘structuring of awareness.’
Projected Channels and Circuitry 61
So you can see what the whole process is; however, you cannot structure or
restructure awareness unless you can explain the knowing. And you can’t
explain the knowing unless you can translate the inner language of insight to
the outer language of communication. The only way in which that works is if
the 23 is nourished to be an explainer, because only practice in explanation is
going to make it theoretically possible to be able to explain the knowing.
I know very clearly, because of my unconscious
Ra’s design
process, that my knowing that is there in the
43, when that knowing comes out through the
23, I don’t have anything to do with the
translation. It’s being translated by my logical
formula. I have seven gates in logic. And
because I have the 62nd gate as well, that 23 is
always being translated by the logical formula,
so it makes it possible for me to get my
knowing out in a logical way.
It’s very, very difficult for individuals to be able
to explain themselves. This is why they’re so
easily ostracized. “I don’t know what you want.
I don’t know what you’re saying. I don’t know
who you are,”—all this “I don’t know” that they get delivered at them. It is a
difficult process. And they are freaks until they can structure. They feel it
themselves. The moment that they can get their knowing out and explain it,
that’s the moment that they can feel good about who they are. “Well, I want to
tell you, it’s really simple.”
No knower knows what they know until they’re asked. Nothing’s more
important than the 43-23 to recognize that if they don’t have a knowing
agenda, that they will get enormous respect for their insights. Because you see,
the moment they focus on their knowing, the 43-23 is a verbal gunslinger, “I
know this and I’m going to get it out,” not only are they on batteries, but
they’re using a translation program. The batteries run out, the whole thing falls
apart. It just doesn’t work.
But that 43-23 that waits for its recognition,—and it may not be that they’re
asked to explain what they really know, they may be asked to explain something
else. That’s when they awaken to their own uniqueness. It’s when they awaken
to their own uniqueness, that the mutative mind can mutate anything. Any
66662222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
concept. To be a mutative mind doesn’t mean that you have to have the same
grounding as logic and the abstract. You can have spontaneous grasping of
concepts.
For the 43-23 to wait to be asked as a gunslinger, their magic comes out. Then
they can bring in their knowing. Then they will have those that are going to
pay attention. So all of these mental channels, recognize how important that is.
That if you live out the nature of that, then mind gets respected, and that mind
gets respected at the individual level. There are so many people who have
wasted—and when I say wasted, no blame in all this—but just wasted minds.
I’m not talking about the minds that haven’t even been developed. I’m talking
about superb minds that don’t respect themselves. And that’s so common.
I can’t avoid that in looking at design. You see, there’s no real thing as an
unintelligent mind. Oh, there are damaged minds. There is retardation. There
are all kinds of things that are there in the infrastructure of the design that go
back to the first 88 degrees of life. But in terms of the mind that you’re going
to meet in Design, whether defined or not, you’re always dealing with
intelligence and special capacities if they’re operating out of their Type.
You’re not designed to filter awareness in a specific way without that being of
value to the totality; it is. We need to have that clear kind of direction. We
need the clear storytellers. We need the clear organizers. And we need the
clear mutative explainers. They are clear when they’re living out their nature.
So that’s all for the toy box.
Q & A
A 1/3 Teacher with the 11.4
Student: I have a friend with a 1/3 profile. And then she’s got the 11.4 and a
62 about three times, and nothing else. No other channels. So she’s big on
teaching. She’s got this lower trigram in her profile, how does that…
Ra: Well look, the one thing to recognize about a 1/3, because the 1/3 is the
first of 12 structural crosses, so it’s a foundation. And the one thing about the
1/3 is that because it is all personal, that the thing to be clear about them is that
everything they do, they do for their own personal destiny, they’re absorbed in
their own destiny.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 63
So it does not mean that they cannot make good teachers. As a matter of fact,
they can make wonderful teachers. But they’re not teaching because they love
the students and the joy that the students get out of the knowledge. It’s that
they love to be the teacher. Now it doesn’t mean that they don’t care about the
students, but if a student drops dead and they’re not in their class anymore,
they’re not going to fall apart. In other words, as long as there are students,
they’ll be happy.
I have two children that are 1/3s. It’s very clear, my son is deeply, deeply social
and he’s a beautiful being, but I know that he’s social because it suits him to be
social. When somebody is there and it is fun, that’s great, but when they’re
gone they’re gone. He goes back to finding somebody else. So yes, they can
make very fine teachers. It just means that the delusion in all of that is that
they’re great humanitarians and givers, and they’re not. They’re not, but they
can be very good. Someone with an 11.4 like that, they can be an excellent
teacher, and it’s good for them to be in a communal environment to fill up all
those empty spaces. They can be very sensitive to their students.
Invent Your Rules of Play
Student: Is it okay for verbal gunslingers with defined Ajnas to ask questions?
Ra: Oh, yeah. Again, one of the things that happens is I get a lot of people
say, “Well, we’re two Projectors. We don’t manifest. Can we talk to each
other?” “We’re two Generators. Can we ask each other? Who goes first?” All
of these kinds of things. The whole thing is I want you, all of you to invent
your rules of play and to see that those rules are obvious rules.
So, for example, I had this discussion the other day with someone. If you have
a Generator and you have a Projector. Now the Generator can invite the
Projector to lunch. They’re going to have to pay for it, but the Projector also
has to say to the Generator, “Are you really sure you want to do this?” so the
Generator can go, “Um, hmm” or whatever. In other words, by understanding
each other’s design, then you can play out what’s necessary in that and you can
be very clear with each other. You can make sure that everybody is
comfortable in what you’re doing. So, what was your question again, because I
got off on a track.
66664444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Can the Verbal Gunslinger Ask Questions
Student: If the verbal gunslinger can ask questions?
Ra: Yes, of course. The verbal gunslinger can ask questions, but the verbal
gunslinger cannot use that power to lead and initiate, in the sense of you say to
others, “Let’s go do this or let’s go do that.” In other words, any time
somebody has the defined Throat, they have the capacity and the right to
communicate. But the whole thing about being a verbal gunslinger is that what
happens is that naturally that’s all about
directing manifestation. That’s what it
tends to be. Verbal gunslingers are
always trying to direct manifestation.
They come up to you and ask you what
you want to do or they start things. They
try to start things verbally, and of course
that’s not healthy.
It doesn’t mean they can’t ask a question.
Doesn’t mean they can’t be a good student, but at the same time, I make that
easy for all teachers, in that sense, too. In the sense that if they have a question
period, you already have permission. You already have the ability to respond to
that and say, “Well this is question period, I can respond to that and I can offer
a question.”
It’s just that I have a lot of, for example, split definitions who are verbal
gunslingers who have asked me repeatedly if they can ask themselves. Or the
verbal gunslinger who is a Projector if they can invite themselves. My answer
to them is, “No. I don’t want to talk to you about that now. Talk to me in
seven years,” because there is truth in that.
It’s the kind of thing that once they are really in their design, once they are truly
living out their Type, then that is possible. But of course, even to suggest that
at this stage is very, very dangerous because what they really would like is to be
in control of it. If you haven’t gone through the whole process, you can never
know how much of what you’re doing is just a mind trip and you’re just
messing yourself around.
So, yeah, it’s always better for a verbal gunslinger to have the opportunity given
to them to ask, rather than asking the question out right. Because many times,
Projected Channels and Circuitry 65
other than a situation where it’s set up, you can ask somebody a question as a
verbal Manifestor and not have them listen, so they don’t really care about
answering you, and so you don’t really get an answer that’s valuable for you, in
that sense. It’s all about just organizing the mechanics of things. Going, going,
gone. Have a nice day.
The 19 Projected Channels
When you’re looking at the BodyGraph, one of those things to keep in mind as
a general view is to always remember that there is a symmetry to the body and
there is a left side-right side to the body. Projection is a fascinating theme in
that the projective capacity, or the projective potential is so strong. The ability
to be able to understand, or make sense of, or to know how to deal with the
energy of energy types and to be able to coordinate that energy so that it's
efficient and effective for everyone. And considering that we have 19 of these
projecting channels, we got a lot of projecting channels that are there.
So, it’s a dominant theme, and it means that more than half of the nature of
what we are is rooted in a theme of bitterness, and a deep, deep need for
recognition.
We Need Each Other
Every time that I look at the generalizations of a BodyGraph, I’m constantly
put in a position of having to see that humanity is designed to come together.
That people are designed to come together. That groups are designed to come
together. There is no way without that, and when you see that there are all
these channels that are projected channels, how much we need the other to be
able to recognize it in order for us to be fulfilled in our processes.
We’re not designed to be alone. It’s not in our nature. We are here in an
illusion only of separateness. In spending time looking at the program, you
can see that not only are you never alone, you’re never your design. You’re
only a theme that is your design, constantly in the ocean of programming, and
then we are a specie biologically linked and biologically bound to each other.
We have deeper imperatives than we can possibly imagine at the surface of our
neo-cortex. All kinds of drives in us—speciel drives, animal drives—that we
have very little connection to. We need each other.
66666666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
We are of the same thing, and the progression of our civilization has brought
us to a point where we’re as integrated as we have ever possibly even imagined
we could be. The nature of our technologies, our capacity to be able to
communicate and share information, but more than that, our growing depth of
understanding the nature of what it is to be human at the biological level, at the
chemical level, and the nature of the universe around us.
We are a whole. This business of looking at a design and seeing all these
projected elements, is that when you’re dealing with a client and you’re bringing
them to their Type, you’re also bringing them to their social entrance.
It’s the bizarre irony of my life that a creature like me is so loved. It’s a real
irony for someone like me, and that could not have come any other way than
living out my Type, because it would have been impossible for that to have
been in my life. I never would have attracted it, and it never would have
happened.
Something to be clear about the nature of what it is to really be comfortable in
the world is that in living out your Type, you get the right social connections in
your life. I know how much all of you struggle with that. I truly empathize
with what it costs you at the personal level to be yourself. It’s clear that that is
one of the main stumbling blocks of actually becoming your design.
You see, the public will be able to take advantage of design. That’s not the
same as becoming your design. Don’t think for a moment that any
popularization of Human Design is going to bring about everyone who is
interested in that to this kind of level of recognition and understanding. They’ll
take advantage of the techniques that are revealed through Type and design,
but that’s something quite different than living it, seven years out of your life.
And the only way in which we grow is that we have to be in communion with
those who also are aware of their design.
This Knowledge Means Nothing if You Stand Alone
Now, it’s not that this is about setting up some kind of prejudicial boundary,
because it isn’t about that, and that’s not what I’m about. Some of my closest
friends don’t even want to know what design is. It’s not about that. It’s really
about seeing that, in order for you to live out your design, you need as much
support as possible, and that support can only come from those who also
understand.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 67
In your intimacy and in your business dealings, in your career, it’s essential for
you to have people around you who understand what you understand about the
nature of being. Otherwise, those relationships are not going to be productive
and they’re not going to be healthy for you.
You have to make an effort, because in truth, it means nothing if you stand
alone. I know; I once stood alone with all this knowledge. It means nothing,
and I was more alone in the physical-social sense than I had ever been in my
entire life, because there was really no one to talk to. There was only a world to
teach, and no one to talk to. And you see, the point now, after all these years,
is that there are a lot of people now who know design. Know about design,
have met it at some level, and you’re the core representatives of that in
America.
You have to see that in order for you to really have your fulfillment, you have
to get through your seven years, and you need to have around you the support
that’s essential. You have to be recognized for what you’re doing. Teach those
around you. Inform them. Do their readings. It doesn’t matter whether they
believe it, want it, or care about it.
Their reaction at any given level is not the point. Anybody who meets Design,
at any level, isn’t going to get rid of it, and it’s important for you to set that
basis of your relationships with others, so that they recognize where you’re
coming from, and that you can see them, so that you have clear, clean
associations.
That’s why I enjoy these groups. The chatter of Human Design people—it’s a
wonderful chatter. It’s unlike anything that I’d ever known in my life, and you
can only get that in certain environments at certain times. One day, it’ll be as
common as asking somebody what their astrological sign is, but the whole
thing is that you are the ones that are going to be called upon, ultimately, to be
able to take people who have become fascinated to a deeper level. You have to
be there. You have to be there.
If you’re living out your Type, and you’ve got support around you, you will get
there. If you’re constantly being dragged back into all kinds of conditioned
arrangements, you’re really going to get messed up. You’re the ones that have
to go through that process.
66668888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
The Splenic-Projected Circuit
Okay, projection. There’s a wonderful circuit here. It’s a very strange
projected circuit. The 20-10, to the 25-51, from the 26 to the 44, and then back
up either the 48 or the 57 way, to the 16 and
the 20, and down again. All of that is
projection. And all of that is projection on
the splenic side. All of it. See, we have this
thing when we’re looking at the BodyGraph,
that because of the power of the Solar Plex
Center, we don’t clearly see the Spleen for
what it really is. No motor, no motor. (Note:
Channels 16-48, 25-51 and 44-26 are discussed at
length in the Creative Channel section.)
Now, the advantage the no-motor Spleen has
over the no-motor Throat, is that the no-
motor Throat is running on batteries, the toy, and eventually will run down, but
it can run the batteries out immediately just by blabbing for several hours.
The whole thing about the Splenic Center is that it gets the same toy with the
same batteries, but it only uses it once in a while. So, the Splenic system can
actually operate longer than the Throat without doing damage to itself, without
a motor. Now, that doesn’t mean that it’s going to do any cleaning, but it may
do some verbal cleaning.
In other words, it has the capacity to be able to articulate, but to articulate
without the access of energy, but again, at some point that would break down.
Now fortunately, unless that Splenic Projector is living in a cave, and all the
planets that would affect it have been taken out of the sky, it won’t get to that
point. It’s always going to meet the energy necessary to revitalize that Spleen.
The Splenic system, because it is weakest, is treated that way. We’re fascinated
by the mind, we’re blinded and seduced by the emotional system, and we tend
to take the poor old Spleen for granted. I have Splenic awareness. I do not
take the Spleen for granted. I discovered, like you discover in your own
process, how much more profound and clear it is than my mind when it comes
to me. After all, minds don’t have inner authority.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 69
The Splenic Center is the only awareness center we have that does us any
physical good. It’s the only one we have that keeps us alive. It’s the only one
we have that keeps us physically healthy in terms of survival well-being. The
Solar Plex Center and the mind can both make us sick, but it’s a different kind
of illness. Yet the Splenic Center, for all of its gifts, and for the fact that it is
the only universal awareness that’s out there on this planet, it’s limited because
of its frequency to only being available existentially, and not being able to go
back, reference; bang, there.
In the Brahman revelation of the human BodyGraph in the seven-centered
chakra system, there was no Spleen as a major center or as a major chakra.
There was a minor splenic chakra, but there was no major splenic chakra. It’s
part of our evolution as a Rave, that is, this 18th century discovery of Uranus,
and the simultaneous transition of humans from a 7 to a 9-centered being.
And by the way, there was an overlap at that time, like Cro-Magnon man and
Neanderthal. Historians might find that fascinating one day to look at that,
because there was a real change that took place in us.
The Splenic System is the Only Reliable Awareness
The Splenic system has been given much more authority, and it’s very
important for us to see that it is the only awareness that is really reliable. The
mind has no inner authority, and the emotions are in a wave and they’re not
truly aware yet.
So, if you have a Splenic Generator, they’re the most aware Generator. It
doesn’t mean they’re the most intelligent. Doesn’t mean they’re the cleverest.
It just means that their generation is directly connected to a fundamental
awareness; defined, fixed. And remember that the nature of the Sacral Center
is that it is only a diaphragm that expresses what’s connected to it. So a Splenic
Generator is generating existential awareness. That’s what it generates,
existential awareness that’s rooted in whether things are healthy or not.
Defined Spleen Split from a Defined Solar Plexus
So wherever you see the Splenic Center, the awareness of the Splenic Center
when it is defined is essential to be integrated into the whole. So many people
say to me, “Well, what do I do. I have this split. I’m emotional on one side,
77770000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
and I have a defined Spleen on the other and they are split off from each other.
What do I do?” The Splenic Center can only give you an existential truth; and
the emotional authority says there’s no truth in the now.
So it takes a specific attention, and the attention is that no matter what your
immune system is telling you in the now, you collect it. In other words, you
have to recognize you’re experiencing it and you collect it. And you collect it
until you’re emotionally clear. And you keep on collecting awareness in the
now.
Gate 48 Collects Criticisms that Add Up to a Solution
By the way, that’s what the Spleen naturally does in the 48th gate. The 48th gate
is a collection of criticisms, until finally all those criticisms add up to a solution.
It’s just collecting different in-the-moment criticisms that come like drops of
water from the tap of the 18 and they fill up the well. So being somebody who
has a defined Splenic Center means that there is a reliable, fixed awareness
that’s there to guide the vehicle.
It’s very difficult, mostly for men who have strong splenic systems, to honor
their Spleen, to honor the instinct or intuition or taste that is coming out of the
Spleen. The male tends to be conditioned to be a Manifestor. Women are
conditioned to be Generators. That tends to be the kind of conditioning that
we work. Everybody’s got to be busy and do things, but one’s got to be active
and one’s got to be passive as a kind of generalized theme. Being conditioned
to being a Manifestor, pushing things out and only meeting resistance–quite a
problem.
In this movement here, those splenic forces, if they honor their Type and they
pay attention to the awareness in the now, they’re of enormous value, because
these are people that can be clear in the moment. I can never be clear about
the past or the future, but I can be very clear in the moment. That’s the nature
of being a splenic being.
Undefined Splenic Center Buzz
I do this next spiel for a student who is always complaining to me that I always
spend so much time talking about undefined Solar Plex Centers and leave out
the poor undefined Spleens. So let me deal with undefined Spleens. The
Projected Channels and Circuitry 71
undefined Splenic Center gets the same kind of buzz that the undefined Solar
Plex Center gets. The only difference is that with the Solar Plex buzz you get
the wave, and with the splenic buzz you get the spark in the now. So the
undefined Splenic being, when they enter into somebody’s defined Spleen, it
doesn’t only make them feel good, it makes them feel better than good, and it’s
only momentary which is why it’s so seductive.
The undefined Splenic system steps into the defined Spleen and has exactly
that instant to get the movie, because in that instant they get the buzz. And in
the moment they get that buzz they have to read it, because if not, that feel-
good is just as dangerous as going into somebody’s emotional wave when
they’re up. They do the same thing. They create a sense of false authority.
The false authority in an undefined Spleen can be devastating. Somebody
makes you feel good because they define your Splenic Center, and they take
you on a feel-good ride. Remember, what makes you feel good is not
necessarily good for you.
The thing about being emotionally conditioned is that you do get it eventually.
If you’re undefined emotionally and somebody is taking you from the up to the
down, you figure it out because you’re going down with them. But the
undefined Splenic Center doesn’t get that chance. They get that hit, and only in
the moment that they get the hit, because it’s a spontaneous awareness, only
then can they suss it out. Because after that it’s masked, and then they’re
caught in the feel-good of being conditioned by somebody’s defined Splenic
Center. That’s the moment—like somebody undefined emotionally who gets
defined—depending on the nature of the feel-good or the wave, you give it
authority and it makes decisions for you.
Now look, the Splenic Center is deeply seductive when it comes to false
authority, because it is the only awareness we can really trust to keep us alive.
That’s why I tell people with an undefined Spleen that the most dangerous
thing for them in life is to be spontaneous. It’s right there and it will be
expressed in the whole genetic continuity. Don’t be spontaneous—it’s so
dangerous.
Do you know how many people walk around with the 20-34 and no 57? With
an undefined splenic system? What kind of a cruel karma that is? And don’t
tell people who have that that it’s a cruel karma. Don’t do that to them.
Remember, make them feel good. But think about what that’s really like.
77772222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
There’s that 20-34, and it doesn’t have that feel good, and it wants desperately
to act in the now because the 20th gate is the only existential gate, and it’s
backed up by power and busy, busy, busy, busy. And these are people whose
spontaneous acts are enormously disruptive; I mean enormously disruptive. I
have had 20-34s in classes in the early years, where I came as close as I’ve ever
come to throwing people out. Just utter chaos out of all of that. Utter chaos.
Jumping at doing things, and of course there is no awareness, consistent
awareness that can be trusted that can guide that.
So the undefined Splenic being can suffer just as deeply as an undefined Solar
Plex being. Keep in mind that symmetry. The difference is that the suffering
of the undefined Spleen is in the moment. You can cut them very deep in the
moment, whereas with the emotional system, it takes time. It has to go
through the wave. It’s not spontaneous.
Authority Awareness Conditioning
In saying that about the nature of the undefined Spleen and Solar Plex, it’s also
true of the undefined mind. In other words, this deep, deep power is there in
all of the three awareness centers to be places in which authority is assumed by
the conditioned person who has that center undefined, and in assuming that
authority, really has distortion in their lives.
In my process, it is clear to me that the first priority has always been to heal the
world’s Solar Plex. It’s something that needs to be healed. But it’s not to say
that people with undefined Solar Plexes are the only ones that are victims, if
you will, of authority conditioning. And we can give that that specific name:
authority conditioning.
You’ll see that authority conditioning, or authority awareness conditioning is
right there in those three awareness centers, and that’s where people can really
suffer. That’s where all the guilt and the blame and the shame and whatever
else is, because you see the moment that that awareness is being conditioned,
because the unaware, who does not know their design, is giving authority to
their awareness, major decisions in their life are conditioned.
My response as an undefined Solar Plex person to the emotional field and what
that did to me in the first half of my life, how clearly it was that so much of my
decision making was emotional. It was just emotional, had nothing to do with
me. And yet at the same time to recognize that that’s going on for the same
Projected Channels and Circuitry 73
person who is undefined mentally, gets conditioned at the mental level and
makes a decision for their life based on that mental conditioning, and then
they’re full of blame for the other. And the anxiety and the paranoia and all the
other stuff that goes with the mind.
And the same thing is true for the undefined
Splenic Center. Taking in the defined Spleen and
then being conditioned to have that as their
authority. Here’s a great day to see that at work.
You’ve got the 32.6 and the 28.6 and both of
them are in the Spleen, so imagine you’ve got
somebody today who has an undefined Splenic
Center.
In the program, they get the 32.6 and the 28.6,
and then somebody comes along and whacks
their Spleen and cranks it on. They can give authority to that depression. They
can give authority to the need of taking risk in that moment. And because it’s
Splenic, and because it can be such a powerful authority, they jump only to
crash, and then what it takes them to recover with their undefined Spleen
afterwards.
Just as what it takes somebody who’s undefined emotionally to take emotional
poison out of your body. Or what it’s like to have an undefined mind and get
somebody’s mental trip out of your head. Do you know what that’s like to
have an undefined mind and somebody comes up to you and they tell you
terrible things about yourself? “You’re screwed.” You’ve got a lifetime of
rattling that around your head.
The Magic of the Undefined Awareness Centers
So these awareness centers, they’re very, very vulnerable at the undefined level,
and then again, see the magic of any of these awareness centers undefined. The
magic of the undefined Splenic system: the potential of great healing, the true
wisdom to recognize what can make you feel good and what doesn’t feel good.
The wisdom to recognize the nature of fear and how to heal fear is all in the
undefined Splenic Center.

The Undefined Mind’s Genius
But the undefined mind is our pathway to mental genius. It’s our way of seeing
clearly how the mind works, what minds are good and what minds aren’t.
What awareness is of value and what awareness isn’t from the mental plane.
Without the undefined mind we would not have had Freud and Jung finding
the collective unconscious out there. They found it through their undefined
minds which are always in the collective unconscious, endlessly in the collective
and individual. Always. What happens to us when we give authority to what
we’re not.
Guiding Clients with Simple Warning Signs
See, when it comes back to you really being a good analyst, when it comes back
to you providing a service, the real service you provide people is to be able to
guide them to their Type, to be able to explain to them the nature of their
definition and authority, if they have it. And then to put up huge, simple
warning signs for them. Little warning signs that you just hold up in the air.
You say, “Undefined Spleen, what feels good isn’t necessarily good for you.
Don’t jump.” Little signs, little signs. Not complex things. Little mantras.
Got an undefined Ego, “Never make a promise.” You got an undefined
Throat, “Never speak first. You just wait for it.” You got an undefined Ajna,
“Never give it inner authority, ever.” It’s the only thing that saves the
undefined mind. You go to them and you just go boop, boop, boop, boop.
You know.
Undefined Sacral, “Don’t worry if you’re sexual or not.” Undefined Root,
“Don’t get caught up in the stress.” Undefined emotional system, “Don’t give
authority to emotions.” Did I leave anything else out? Oh yeah, undefined
Self, well that’s an old mantra. “If you’re in the wrong place, you’re with the
wrong people.” Undefined Head Center, “Don’t go crazy.”
Little things. Because once you know your Type, then the most important
thing to help you fight conditioning is to know where not to give authority.
When you see that someone has an undefined awareness center, then you know
you have to accent that. “Not only should you be careful to not give authority
to this, but understand how tempting it is to give authority to the undefined
Spleen.” All these undefined Splenic people who say, “Oh, I love to be
Projected Channels and Circuitry 75
spontaneous.” They want to give authority to spontaneity; they desperately
want to do that.
Just as the undefined mind wants to desperately give authority to its mind,
desperately. And the undefined emotional person wants to desperately give
authority to their emotions so they don’t feel sick, because if they can give it
authority, at least they can claim it as their own. In all three cases you have
problems, mostly medical problems.
The Fundamental Health Channels
Between the Throat Center and the Splenic Center, these two channels, the 16-
48 which we’ve looked at, the Channel of Talent that we saw in the creative
channels, and the 20-57 which we looked at, in a way, through integration. In
the earliest teachings, in the very beginning of basic trainings, I taught that
these were the fundamental health channels. They were called the health
channels. They still are. And when you recognize them as the health channels,
and you add the projected health channel out of the Spleen of the 44-26,
because that’s also enormously important to our well-being, it’s just not about
manifesting our well-being. (Note: Channels 16-48 and 44-26 are discussed at length
in the Creative Channel section.)
You’re Healthiest When Recognized
You’ll see that in these three projected fields, that in order for us to be healthy,
we can only be healthy when we are recognized. When you’re recognized for
who you are, that’s when you’re the healthiest. And it’s right there, in it being a
projected element. It’s right there. It just calls that out and says it to you. It
says, “Well-being as a human being is something that is part of you being
recognized and part of you being able to be with others.” One is tribal and one
is individual and one is collective. It covers the spectrum.
The Spleen’s Feel-Good Talents
It’s about bringing health into our world body, and we can’t do that unless we
can do that teamed up bond-by-bond-by-bond. Two of these three are
channels of talent. It’s a real talent to be healthy. And it’s a real talent to make
people feel good, and it’s an essential one. It’s like getting the new basic
training on mimeograph sheets with hand-drawn pictures. It feels really good.
77776666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Talent can make us feel good. Aesthetics can make us feel good. Art makes
us feel good. That’s the projected power coming out of the Spleen. Beauty
can make us feel good. Perfection can make us feel good. Solutions make us
feel good. Skills make us feel good. Sound can make us feel good. Being in
the now makes us feel good. Being alert makes us feel good. It’s all there.
These are the things that humanity needs to feel good.
Words are Very, Very Powerful
If you look at your own life and you make out a checklist, you check out these
six gates. Tell me if you really feel good, because that’s what it’s all about. It’s
about bringing that feel good to others because it is projected. It has to be
invited, and get the joke. We all want to feel good. It’s an easy invitation:
“Would you like to feel good?” “Oh yeah!” Easy invitation. The 20-57 and
the 16-48 both express feel good without motors as language. There is nothing
more devastating and more powerful to humans than words.
You have somebody in your life you don’t like, and you see them all the time.
Every time you see them, look at them and then say, “Gee, you don’t look well
today.” After a week of that, they’re really sick. Words are very, very powerful.
One of the primary ways for us to feel good is through words. It is a great skill,
and it is an essential existential capacity to bring feel good into our language,
bring feel good into our conversation, bring it into the basis of our
communication with others.
The other side, the 12 and the 35, because they’re related to the emotional
system, they’re either full of hope or pain, or happy or sad. That side of the
Throat is never consistently, in language, telling you about the feel good, and is
not necessarily making you feel good by what it says. You may be a poet in the
12th gate, but then again you can be a brutal poet, too—cruel poet with words.
No crueler words available than the words that come out of the 12 and 35, as
cruel as words can be. They can also be delightful, obviously.
Peter Rabbit’s Mother
But you don’t get that on the splenic side. What’s there in the splenic side is
really the potential to make us feel good. We get to feel good by feeling secure,
by being informed, by feeling prepared. One of the responsibilities of the 20
and the 16 is to do what my mother did, and bought me Peter Rabbit. That’s a
Projected Channels and Circuitry 77
funny eclectic joke. Peter Rabbit’s mother, you know the story of Peter
Rabbit? Peter Rabbit lived beside a carrot patch.
I think I had Bing Crosby telling that story. Lived beside a carrot patch and
would always get into trouble. And he had a very strict mother, and his mother
had a favorite thing that she said to Peter, “If you don’t have anything nice to
say, don’t say anything at all.” Now this is the great teaching of the 20 and 16.
They have to learn that. I can rip people to shreds. You have to learn that.
You have to learn that if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything
at all.
Now, of course, you can never live such a law if you’re on the other side. No
12 and no 35 is ever going to be able to hold up that law, never. And it’s the
job of the splenic side to do that, to keep things cool, to keep things healthy, to
be able to keep the dialogue going, to open up the opportunities for
understanding. It’s a very important gift.
If you look at the way in which the Throat is structured, if you draw a line from
the 43 to the 23, you’ll see that the whole splenic side, the alpha leader that has
to give you the feel good. American political conventions with the brass bands
doing swing, and 40,000 people grooving in the crowd, “Let’s have a feel
good.”
My favorite picture of that is Richard Nixon in one of
those conventions in the late 60s early 70s with his
famous fingers and that smile on his face–good God.
Our collective leaders try to make us feel good. It’s the
feel good side, and it’s the feel good language, and it’s
meant to be that way. Doesn’t mean it is. It’s meant to
be that way.
And on the other side, you have the emotional Solar Plex language. The
language that operates through its various mechanisms, whether it’s through
the wave, or whether it’s through the emotional melancholy, however that
process is. Very different voices, this old expression about talking out of
different sides of your mouth? You know this expression? Well, this
expression is this binary that’s inherent in the Throat.
So, there is a very specific importance in seeing that the symmetry is different,
in that the 16-48 and the 20-57 go to a non-motor Splenic Center. Not here to
77778888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
act on the feel-good. Now isn’t that a drag? See, when you meet somebody,
you speak splenic. “Hi, how are you? Nice day today, eh?” That’s all Splenic
formula. Doesn’t mean there’s anything behind it. No power to act in all of
that. It’s just a verbal formula of “Have a nice day,” smiling, chatting, whatever
the case may be.
How the Throat is Hooked Up – Left or Right Side
If you bump into a 35-36 on a bad day, and you say from the Splenic side, “Hi,
how are you?” They dump in you and say, “It’s an awful goddamn day and
why’d you ask?” Very different. When you look at somebody’s chart, and you
look at the way the Throat’s defined, the way the rest of the stuff underneath is
hooked up to it, or above hooked up to it, check and see if it’s left side or right
side.
Check and see if it’s Splenic or Solar Plex—it gives you a real insight.
Remember that somebody who’s splenic isn’t necessarily ever going to reveal
their true selves. Emotional people will. That’s part of their beauty. They
expose themselves. They are naturally vulnerable. And the Splenic side doesn’t
do that. The Splenic side is keeping everything all very nice and feel good on
the surface.
So, it means when you’re dealing with a client that’s coming from the Splenic
side, you know that it’s going to be more difficult for you to really get them to
open up. This is not the kind of client who has a reading where you should
expect at the end of the reading that they say anything to you other than thank
you and leave.
If they’re coming from the Solar Plex side, they may break down and cry; they
may get upset with what you’re saying. There’s a different kind of energy that’s
at work. They’re also more ready to be exposed. Again, when you see the
magic of the Throat, and you understand that it’s a key in our whole
manifesting process, that you can see these two sides, they’re very different. It
gives you an important insight, not simply into yourself, but it gives you an
important insight into those people that you’re dealing with. It also tells you
something.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 79
When you meet somebody, and you’re like me, for example, you have some
open motors so you can be very sensitive to their energy, and you feel there’s
something the matter with them. If you’re talking to a Splenic side Throat,
they’re not going to tell you. You say to them, “How are you?” and they say,
“Oh, I’m fine, thanks.” They may be dying inside. Because it’s this drive for
the feel good, this drive for ‘the patterns okay, everything’s alright in the now,
all of this is fine.’ Very different from meeting the other side. It’s just
different. See those differences, see how they work.
Q & A
Why is it Called the Brainwave?
Ra: Why is it called the brainwave (Channel 20-57)? I wish I could answer that
question. All of the keynotes were given to me. I think it has to do with the
old brain, not the new brain. In other words, it has to do with the mammalian
brain. And it’s that frequency out of the mammalian brain, I don’t really know,
but that’s my assumption, that it has to do with the description of the
lymphatic system. It could be the lymphatic wave. It’s not about the mental,
the mind.
Integration is Just a Projection without the Sacral
Here is a Human Design joke. Look at integration and you recognize what it
is; that is, it’s the backbone of our design. It is the most
individual of all things, and it is the root of our ability to
be able to succeed in the world as a specie.
If you take away the 34, it’s all projection. It’s my
design. The 20-10, the 10-57, the 20-57—those three
aspects of integration are all projection. You see,
without the Sacral Center, life is just a projection.
That’s the joke folks, by the way. (Note: Channel 10-57 is
discussed at length in the Creative Channel book.)
88880000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
It’s one of these cosmic Bodhisattva jokes, you know? Think about that: life is
just a projection. It really is. If you look at that carefully, you’ll see that’s what
it says. It says life is a projection. Waking up is a projection; perfected form is
a projection; this penetrating awareness of the Splenic system, it’s all projection
without the Sacral. All of it. All of it.
Without the ability to be alive, to make more, to be sexual, to carry all of this
Sacral energy, without that, there is no life; it’s just a projection. Nothing more,
nothing else. It’s red like the apple in the garden, that Sacral. And it makes
such an enormous difference in the way in which everything operates on the
planet.
I was discussing this morning about the way in which the conditioning of
authority in undefined centers can be so devastating. I also mentioned to you,
so that you’re clear, that the way in which our undefined centers respond is
relative to the center that they are. In other words, you’re going to have very
powerful response to conditioned authority through the three awareness
centers.
You’re going to have a very powerful conditioned authority to those people
who define your undefined G Center. If you have an undefined G and
somebody steps into your life with a defined G Center, they can make their
love, their direction, your authority. And because it’s so strong in you, the
moment you make that your authority, that’s the moment that you’re in
trouble—not only in trouble, your liver is in trouble.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 81
The BodyGraph’s Closet is the Sacral
Every single one of the centers has this kind of impact at various levels of
strength. But one of the most curious ones is the Sacral Center. If you have an
undefined Root and somebody defines it, you’re going to feel that energy, and
you’re going to feel that energy strongly. It’s an adrenaline rush.
But the thing about the Sacral Center is that it can be extremely subtle. And its
greatest success as a prime motor is how subtle it is, which is why it can be so
frustrating to live with.
It takes a long time for the Sacral to accomplish things. That’s the whole
business about Sacral energy. One of the things to recognize—and I know, I
have a totally undefined Sacral Center—that when you take somebody’s Sacral
Center in, depending on how it operates, you’re not necessarily going to feel its
influence in a deep way. It can be very subtle. Very subtle.
For example, if you have an undefined Sacral Center, and there are defined
Sacrals around, they may not in any way be sexual or sexy. There may be no
connection whatsoever, and yet at the same time, there’s going to be
stimulation to the undefined Sacral Center. In other words, the mirror you get
is rarely what you see.
You see, the Sacral is the BodyGraph’s closet. Think about it that way. It’s the
BodyGraph’s closet. There are a lot of things that we keep behind the closet
door, the sounds the Sacral makes that can still make so many people
uncomfortable to have to live with their own mmmhmmm. But the whole
business of the Sacral is that the Sacral itself hides a lot. And it’s able to do
that, so its impact sometimes can be very subtle.
So in looking at this integration system, and looking at the projection out of
integration—I’ve been enjoying this. Because of course, not only did you not
know what I was going to do here this week, but the hosts basically didn’t
know what I was going to do this week, other than that I was going to do the
channels. I’ve been doing many things with you around these channels. It’s
been fun to chart this.

How to Read Manifestation in a Chart
Left–side, Right–side Throat Examples
I want to look for a moment at examples that are left side–right side. So the
moment we’re looking at this Throat, just for the purposes of the left side–right
side, we draw a line between the 43 and the 23.
Everything on the Splenic side is driven at the genetic level to express things as
a feel good, and to express things as a feel good in order to get access to
energy. So the moment you’re looking
over here, the first thing to see is the
strength of the 20-34.
This is somebody who in the now is
going to express feel good. He (Diego
Rivera) is busy working and he will let
you know that it’s great and it’s
wonderful, whatever the case may be.
He’s not going to tell you clearly how
he feels. That’s not there, even though
it’s latent inside and you can see that
the emotional Ego is just hanging there in the split.
On the other hand, Frida Kahlo comes specifically from the other side. You
can tell that this is somebody who’s going to speak out of the emotional side of
the Throat. And speaking out of the emotional side of the Throat, she is going
to be more vulnerable. And because of the wave, there’s going to be
movement in the way in which she express things according to where she is in
the wave, whether things are going to be expressed as hopeful, or things are
going to be expressed as painful.
When you look at these two people (charts on the next page), just from that
perspective, if you generalize that vastly, what that’s saying to you is you’re
going to know very little about Diego living with him, and you’re going to
know an awful lot about Frida living with her.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 83
Frida Diego
Now, they both have powerful connections to the Throat. They’re both able
to articulate, but because he is oriented towards the Splenic, and it’s an
undefined Spleen, he doesn’t want to get into all that deep stuff. He wants to
feel good. And because there’s an undefined Spleen, he desperately wants to
feel good, so even when he’s horrible and life is a drag and everything, there’s
still in the way he speaks, you get the sense that everything’s okay, because he’s
not letting you inside. He doesn’t want you to find those things he doesn’t feel
good about. Then he’s got to deal with them—doesn’t want to necessarily.
The moment that you go over to the other side, to Frida’s side, it’s very
different. You know right away that this is somebody who’s going to let the cat
out of the bag. You know that out of the emotional nature and out of the
emotional melancholy, in this case, that the moment she is unhappy, she is
going to articulate the unhappiness. She is going to talk about her problems.
She may rhapsodize about them. You can get very romantic about being
fucked up, and you can get very romantic about being awake. It doesn’t really
matter, it’s just a mechanism.
But the one thing is that when you’re dealing with somebody who has strong
expression out of the emotional side of the Throat, you know that they’re going
to be much more revealing. It helps you to look at somebody’s design to keep
simple little things like that in mind. It tells you the way they’re oriented to
express themselves. But more than that, it gives you an insight into what
mechanics are all about. The fact that somebody is mechanically Splenic means
that you’re going to have to be the one that opens them up to their need to be
revealed. It’s not hard to do that with emotional people. They’ll tell you they
want to be revealed. It’s very different. You’re dealing with a basic binary
that’s there within the design.
88884444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Ra: You tell me (showing students a different
chart). Come on, you’re either half wrong
or half right.
Student: I think he’s a bit of both.
Ra: No, he’s not a bit of both.
Student: Alternating back and forth
depending on who’s in their aura.
Ra: Yeah, that happens anyway. Look, whenever you look at the Throat
Center, the Throat Center is center of manifestation. It doesn’t matter whether
it’s defined or not. You look at that Throat Center, there is only one gate out
of that Throat Center that’s pointed downwards. The others are pointed up.
The one that’s pointed downwards is a main theme pointed towards the
emotional system. You know that this person is always, always going to be
swayed and pulled to speak out of their emotional side. It’s always going to be
there. The moment that somebody comes along and hooks up the emotional
system and connects it to the Throat, these are going to be emotional
outbursts. Here is somebody who’s going to express their emotional state as
inconsistent outbursts. But it’s not somebody whose natural tendency is to talk
about how good they feel.
This is somebody who spent a long time in therapy. This is the emotional side
of the Throat; it’s very, very different from the Splenic side.
Everything about being able to read a BodyGraph is always about following the
energy. When you look at a center and it’s undefined, you have to see that the
moment there is any activation in that center, when that center gets defined
through transit or somebody else’s aura, automatically those dormant
activations become living themes. They’re the only consistent living themes
that will be there throughout the person’s life. Because every time his Throat
gets defined, every single time, it’s through those themes that he has in the
Throat that he lives out that experience. All of that is on the emotional side.
So what you have is somebody who’s going to bring those out on occasion, and
it’s going to depend on the kind of emotional conditioning he receives.
Whether he brings out the hopeful side or the painful side, it’s going to depend
on the wave that he’s into. But you know that this kind of a person is going to
Projected Channels and Circuitry 85
be much more open to inner exploration than somebody with an undefined
Throat that goes the other way.
Here’s another example that’ll help you know
to how to read these things. You can’t read
manifestation from any other place but the
Throat. By the way, this is a famous German
poet (unknown). You can’t read manifestation
from any other place other than the Throat,
and the only exception, and there is an
exception, is when you have somebody,
which is extremely rare, who has a totally
undefined Throat. Then you have to use
other criteria.
But in terms of the nature of looking to see whether somebody is going to be
Splenic-sided or Solar Plex-sided in the way in which they’re going to express
themselves, you can see from this design that you’ve got somebody who is a
Reflector. You can see that there’s a natural movement from the Spleen; you
have a 48 that’s sitting there. But it’s the Throat that matters. If you look at
the Throat, and one of the things to recognize is that in this particular design
with the 31 on one side and the 45 on the other side, those two aspects, if it
wasn’t for the 12 being present, you would really say that his natural tendency
would be to the logic or to the Splenic side; in other words, the 48 working in
conjunction with the 31 in that sense.
But the moment you see a potential pointed towards the emotional system–
over. Remember that we live in an emotional environment. The Solar Plex
Center is basically defined all the time, like all the centers. And so for
somebody like this, the natural tendency is going to be to express themselves
from the emotional side. By the way, he was an incredibly emotional poet who
eventually committed suicide. That’s about as emotional as you get.
And this chart (below), emotional side. You can see, even though, again, there is
this nice 16 pointed at the splenic system. You can see that the weight of it is
all going over to the other side, and it’s a very important attribute to look for in
Design. It’s something for you to be able to see.

Solar Plex-sided Throats Easier to Work With
You’re going to find that your clients that are Solar Plex-sided in the Throat are
going to be much easier to work with. You’re going to feel much more
comfortable with them because they’re going to be much more open to the
experience of being taken inward. You’ll have a much cooler reaction, and less
of an involved reaction from splenic-sided Throats, because again, they’re
genetically trying to make sure that everything is okay and they feel good. And
they don’t want for a moment to admit, because then they have to get into
looking and seeing whether they really feel good or not and all the stuff that
you get into when you go through all of that.
When we’re looking at this kind of an
open chart, remember I talked to you
about the nature of being able to tell
somebody not only their Type, their
essential definition, the authority if
it’s present, but to be able to tell them
what is there that they cannot give
authority to. And we know right
away that if you look at a chart like
this, they cannot give authority to the
Spleen, so they can’t be spontaneous.
Now she (Anna Freud) is an
emotional Projector, so right away you have genetic continuity. Right away.
That undefined Spleen is the genetic continuity, right away, to being an
emotional Projector. The emotions are the authority, no truth in the now. It’s
about being projected; you have to be invited, so obviously you can’t afford to
be spontaneous. So the first thing here for this open Splenic being is not to be
spontaneous.
The undefined Sacral Center—when you have somebody that has a very
powerful emotional system, they’re sexy without being sexual if they don’t have
the defined Sacral. There’s an awful lot of sexy 40-37s who don’t have a lot of
sex. It’s one of the ironies of that because they’re very different things. The
Sacral is the genetic strategy; the Solar Plex is simply the pleasure or the
sexiness that can be associated with all of that.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 87
So the thing to recognize for somebody like this—and of course sex was a
theme, given her father (Sigmund Freud)—the undefined Sacral Center is not
here to get stuck. They’re not here to get stuck, that’s not their authority.
Their authority is not to have to stay with things until the gears change and all
that kind of stuff. And of course they have absolutely no sexual orientation.
And very important for them when they’re young to understand that they can
be anything sexually, or nothing at all.
Undefined Self: wrong place wrong people. Undefined Throat: don’t speak
first. Undefined Ajna: great mind for everybody else, not for you. Undefined
Head: you can filter the inspiration, but don’t give yourself a headache in
thinking you’ve got to figure it all out. Then she can live out of her Type. Wait
to be invited into community. The moment that she waits to be invited into
community, everything is correct for her.
In getting to the point where you can synthesize a chart, all of the things that
I’ve been taking you through in this course are about you being able to see that
there are all kinds of ways to experience the genetic continuity in a chart that’s
in front of you. If you start with the Type, you’ll see that everything else falls
into place. If you string together the formula of the channels, you’ll get the
formula of the person, and then you can see the formula according to their
Type. And when you see the formula according to their Type, you will see
whether they have authority or not. These are all ways of looking, from a larger
view, to see the basic generalization that somebody is, because we’re all
basically just generalizations. Everybody, because generalizations work
perfectly with the not-self, lives them out.
Profile: The Larger Purpose of the Vehicle
The final step is to be able to look at the position of the Sun-Earth and the
lines and give the chart its final perspective. To be able to look at the profile.
You’re taught from the very beginning in Design the importance of the Sun-
Earth and that they represent 70% of our programming. It means that the
Sun-Earth positions in somebody’s BodyGraph carry with it enormous impact.
In the wheel they form a cross, the two Suns, the two Earths. This is an
incarnation cross. The personality Sun-Earth and the design Sun-Earth have a
mathematical formula of twelve different possibilities of combinations between
personality and design. Anna Freud happens to be a 6/2 profile.
88888888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
If you pay attention to the structure of the hexagram that we’ve been working
with for years now, and if you take into mind what I’ve been telling you about
how we look at the daily program (see the Understanding the Transit Program
book), how we look at lines this way, and we’ve talked a lot of line talk,
particularly through the line course, structural understanding of the lines, then
you can grasp profiling.
There are two different levels in Human Design, and they all meet in Type.
There is the level of the analyst and the educated Human Design person. And
this is rooted in definition and in authority and Type. And then there is the
surface that can be used as techniques by the general public without any depth.
And this is profile in association with Type. This is the surface.
Type: Vehicle Acts Out its Geometry
What Type gives us is the way in which the vehicle is meant to act out its
geometry, and the correct way for the vehicle to act out its geometry. The
moment that you’re dealing with profile, you’re dealing with the larger purpose
of that vehicle.
6th Line Personality
So when looking at somebody whose profile is a 6/2,—you have to recognize
that if I take the same design; for
example, two students here are a perfect
example. They’re born on the same day,
they have the same design, they have a
different profile. One’s a 2/4, and one’s
a 3/5. Same day. Different profile.
Same design. Same vehicle. Different
profile. Makes you very different.
So when you’re looking at the Sun-Earth
position and you’re looking at the lines,
the first thing you have to look at is what is the personality, because this is the
overview of the personality.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 89
The overview of the personality here is that this is a sixth line personality.
Now we know what a sixth line is. We know that the sixth line is about
aloofness, we know it’s about the
completion in the sense of being able
to look and judge the nature of the
hexagram. A sixth line person, a
sixth line personality is always going
to be judging the personality of
others, always.
We know the nature of the sixth line
is that it jumps into its sixth line
nature early, burns itself out by its
Saturn return, goes into aloofness
and separation until its Kiron return, during which time, by the way, from
Saturn to Kiron that it’s a valued member of the community because it can be
used as a point of judgment. And finally in the last phase of its life, the
opportunity, perhaps, to be able to find something that not only can it judge
correctly, but that it can enter into itself.
So we know, for example, with Anna Freud, that up until the time she was 28
or 29 years old, she lived out the 6th line in gate 9, and the 6th line in gate 16 to
the hilt. You know what the 6th line in the 16 is folks? Propaganda. These are
people that get suckered into propaganda when they’re very young. “Thank
you, daddy.” Sucked into the propaganda. Sucked into putting her energy to
that detail. And then by the time she gets to her Saturn return, then she pulls
out and becomes aloof. It doesn’t
mean she doesn’t participate. Just
means she takes her distance.
So when you’re dealing with the 6th
line personality, you know right
away that it’s going to be very
difficult for you to get a
commitment out of them in the
middle of their life. Between 30
and 50, you can bang on them until
you go nuts. They’re not
necessarily going to commit to
anything.
99990000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Now, you can only have two kinds of 6th line personalities. You can have a 6th
line personality that has a 2nd line design; or a changing cross, which would be
the 6/3. And again, a 6/2 and a 6/3 who can have the same design, be born
on the same day, and be born a few minutes apart—you’d swear that they were
twins but they’re not.
I told you earlier in this course that one of the most important things you can
do to finish your education is to write out clearly for yourself, do it yourself,
look at the eight profiling gates, and look at the 6th lines of each of those
gates and string them together. Put all the first lines together of those eight
gates. And you look at that. And then when you look at somebody’s profile,
you’re really going to have a sense of what that being is. And it’s the easy way
to do it. (Note: See the Profiling table at the end of this book.)
What do we have with a 6/2? If we go to the 10th gate, we have the role model
hermit—a role model personality with a hermit unconscious. Now what that
really means is that because the 2 is underneath there, we know the 2s have to
be called. You see, the 6/2 ultimately has to be called down from its fence to
come into the world itself, that phase after Kiron. And the whole thing about
the nature of the 6/2 is that as long as there is no call that brings it off the
fence, it goes about its 6/2 business. Remember 2nd lines love to be left alone.
So here you have somebody who’s aloof, who loves to be left alone, but is
watching you. Don’t forget that. They appear to be aloof, and they appear to
want to be left alone, but they
are watching you. Now think
about what that means in both
ways.
You can have somebody with
the same design and different
profiles, so you know right
away that the way they’re going
to drive that vehicle is going to
be different, even though it’s
the same vehicle. This is the
beauty of seeing a profile.
At the same time, you can have somebody who has a 6/2 and has a totally
different design, obviously. In other words, there are all kinds of ways that the
Projected Channels and Circuitry 91
6/2 structure is lived out in the world through every kind of design, through
every kind of definition, through every kind of Type. Of course, that’s true of
all the profiles; that’s why they’re so important. You do not need an education
in that, though one day I’ll do that. It’s not about that. You already
understand the lines. All you need to understand is the structure of those lines,
and when you look at somebody’s profile, then you’re going to be able to see
how the vehicle can best operate.
The 3/6 Profile
Here’s a 3/6. Profiles, by the way, you always use the position of the
personality Sun first, so it’s a 3/6. A 3 personality, 6 unconscious. Now we
know that 3s are trial and error, bonds made and broken, mistakes. The
martyr, the anarchist, the pessimist. You name it, you got it. So you’re looking
at that kind of personality, that’s what you’re looking at. You’re looking at a
martyr-anarchist personality. And it constantly is having things bang into it.
When you see somebody who has a personality that’s lower trigram, you know
that they don’t know much about the other side. They don’t have
transpersonal skills; that’s why they have to be bumped into. And remember
that the 3rd line has a harmony to the 6th line, which means that the 3rd line way
can lead to wisdom, that trial and error can lead to discovery, and that much of
what we call discovery is serendipity. It came out of a mistake. It came out of
looking for one thing and finding something else.
Jacques Cartier called the island I was born on Le Chine. He thought it was
China. It was just the island of Montreal in the St. Lawrence River. He was
looking for China. He was so surprised that there were no Chinamen there.
When he saw his first Indians he was deeply disappointed, he said “They’re not
Chinese.” Anyway.
Don’t give the 3rd line a bad reputation. I got a 3rd line mind. I understand the
principle of the 3rd line mind. And of course it’s perfect for me, given that I
got smashed by the voice; it really banged into me. It really did. I mean,
banged in the vulgar sense. I got banged. And that’s what happens with 3rd
lines. So you got a 3rd line personality that’s going to bump into things, and
underneath, what’s underneath? You have the martyr that wants to be a role
model. At the moment you see harmony in a profile, you know that this is a
changing cross. The moment you see harmony in a profile, you know that this
99992222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
is not as common. The most common is the 4/6. That’s the most common,
not the 3/6.
Underneath, if you have a role model, you have an aloof unconscious that
disengages from life when you’re about thirty and is watching and speculating
on things, while your personality keeps banging into them. Hopefully, you
bang into the right thing, or hopefully the right thing bangs into you, because
otherwise you’re just the martyr-role model. You’re the anarchistic-
administrator, or the administrating-anarchist depending on how you like to
look at things. There are going to be all kinds of vehicles associated with that.
Think of genetic continuity, and how all these things work.
Here’s a three personality. Things have to bump into him. He’s a Generator.
That works just fine. It’s easy for the vehicle. Just wait to have things bump
into you. How wonderful that is to be able to tell to a 3rd line personality that
they don’t have to look for anything, that it’s going to happen to them. That
it’s really going to bump into them. That’s magic.
Now, it doesn’t mean that everything that bumps into you is going to be good
for you. It doesn’t mean that things are going to bump into you painlessly. But
it does mean that you can play Lao Tzu, my favorite old boy is Lao Tzu. You
can all just sit there and say, “Well, shit happens.” That was his deepest
philosophy. It’s true. None of the old boys would have loved neutrinos better
than Lao Tzu. He would just have found that delicious. Yeah, it just comes
banging into you, and there’s nothing you can do about it, and that’s the magic
of it all.
In that sense, the harmony of the 3rd line to the 6th line potential wisdom, this
wisdom comes out of the recognition that one is already surrendered, which is
what a 3rd line can know, because when they try to actualize things, of course
they don’t work. But the moment they wait for things to bang into them,
everything is terrific. All their opportunities come that way. So when you’re
dealing with the 3/6, what you know is that only until the trial and error
produces something of substance is it possible for that unconscious to get
engaged. Otherwise, it’s just not going to be involved.
Differences between the 3/6 and 4/6
Now there’s the other example, the common example, a 4/6. Now look at the
difference between a 4/6 and a 3/6, and remember, that can be minutes apart.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 93
You can have people, same design, different profile. Now the 3/6 is the
martyr-role model, but the 4/6 is the opportunistic-role model. That’s very
different. And the 3 personality is lower trigram with a transpersonal
unconscious, and here you have a transpersonal personality with a
transpersonal unconscious. 4/6s are very powerful beings at being able to
externalize truths.
Remember that the 6th line always has this capacity of being a good witness.
Once they recognize what is role model material, they can be wonderful
administrators. That is ultimately their gift to any community or any of those
that see them and recognize them, and of course they can externalize that.
The other thing is, the 3/6 has things bang into it, but the 4/6 has a strategy of
making friends. Now think about what that’s like as a Generator. If you’re a
3/6 Generator, you’ve got to wait for your opportunity for it to bang into you.
In other words, there’s no development, it’s always a surprise.
If you’re a 4/6, you’re already into being friendly with people as a way of
having an opportunity to externalize. You’re social. You’ve got social skills.
The 3/6 doesn’t. If a 3/6 and 4/6 have the very, very same design and both
have very strong social channels, the 3/6 is only going to be social when they
get bumped into, and the 4/6 is going to be social by nature, and it’s going to
be a dominant theme in their life. And it’s just about reading the lines.
The Fourth View Doesn’t Belong to Human Design
You see, the fourth view in Human Design does not belong to Human Design.
It belongs to the Global Incarnation Index. That’s where profiling comes from
because out of profiling you get to see how purpose can be achieved. See,
what the three views of Human Design teach us—definition, authority, and
Type—is how to live within the vehicle and how the vehicle functions. But
how the vehicle can run best is one thing. How it can achieve its purpose is
another. So the running, the proper operation of the vehicle, this is Human
Design. Learn to accept your Type, learn to respect your inner authority, live
out that and then you’re driving in a vehicle that operates properly.
The next step is to see that that vehicle has a unique purpose; that is, it has a
structural purpose, and that purpose can be found in the profile. In other
words, that same design operates differently depending on profile. If you’re
99994444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
living out your Type correctly, and you recognize that the profile will operate
through your Type, it’s simply about you being aware of additional strategies
that you can take advantage of.
There is a difference in strategy between the 3/6 and the 4/6. They may have
the same design, but it’s important to see that that vehicle will operate best if
it’s waiting for somebody to smash into it. Now the 4/6 couldn’t stand that.
That would be horrifying. But for the 3/6 it’s great. “Bang into my vehicle.
Let’s see what happens.” The 4/6 says, “Let’s be friends and ride side-by-side.
There ain’t no damage, don’t scratch my car.”
It’s very different, yet it’s the same thing. So as a rounding off of your process,
you have to see that all these little ways of synthesizing are what opens up a
chart for you. Then all of those lines are matter of fact. I mean, literally,
matter of fact. Once you really understand structure, and some of you now
have had the opportunity of listening to these recorded tapes I’ve done of
readings, and most of my time is spent just doing an overview, and my
overview is to stress definition, type, and authority. Once in a while I use
profile; it’s rare, but I will mention it. It depends on the person.
Sometimes I see from my own experience that they need something stronger,
in a sense, to be able to guide them, but the fact of the matter is that I spend
most of my time providing those three views because that’s basically what a
human being can handle. But I know the profile going in, and it’s helped me to
synthesize the language that I use in describing it. For so many years, it’s one
of the things that certain students have had to go through in this process of
trying to distill out of my unconscious flow what the techniques are, if there are
any, or to create techniques, in that sense. That is a difficult thing. Many times
I’m asked, “How did you know that?” When it fact it doesn’t seem obvious
that it’s there in the chart.
Often a lot of that is just simply that I use all my synthesizing tools when I look
at a chart. I take in the profile; I take in the Type. I recognize through the
undefined centers that this is where the person has lived their life and given
authority. Out of that comes a great deal of information about that person
before I even get down to the minutiae. For me, a reading is only interesting
when the chart is suddenly just there in front of me. In the instant the chart is
in front of me, the whole thing is there through that synthesis.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 95
So when you have, at this point in your careers, mastered definition and Type
and authority, the next step is to be able to integrate, not for your client but for
you, to give you another tool for synthesizing that chart to pay attention to
profile. It is very important. And it gives you a simple way if you just go
through the structure of the lines; you don’t have to be a genius. It’s much
easier to teach profile. That’s why it’s part of what I call bubble gum Human
Design. Profile is really easy. Profile can be reduced to twelve sound bites, and
that’s all somebody needs.
I know it goes much, much deeper, but that’s not the point. The point is it’s
designed to be very powerful surface information, like Type, very powerful
surface information. So working with profile is only a matter of you paying
attention to what these lines mean. Now, you will not understand the lines as
they apply to somebody’s personality or design until you have learned these
profiling gates, until you take them in deeply as they should be taken in.
That may be something that can be prepared as some kind of a chart, just the
profiling gates with all the first line keynotes, all the second lines, all the third
lines,—because if you string those keynotes together, you’ve got your profile.
And it gives you tremendous information. All of those things where you say,
“Where the hell did he see that, how did he know that?” You’ll soon discover
why I know all that. Because it’s easy. It really is that added bit of that extra
view that you can look at, and it gives you so much information, because it
quantifies how everything is working inside of that.
Keynoting Lennon and McCartney
I’ll give you a couple more examples. Lennon and McCartney, and John
Lennon is a 2/4. Now I call the 2/4 profile the missionary; to be called to
externalize. Don’t have to be a genius. String keynotes. To be called to
externalize. That’s the 2/4. And if they’re not called, they never externalize.
They can only get called if they’re waiting for the opportunity.
Remember the theme of the opportunist? If you have a lover and you don’t
like your lover, don’t leave your lover until you have another lover, that whole
theme of the opportunist. Well, here’s the 2/4. If you’re waiting for your
opportunity you may be called. And 2/4s are very good at minding their own
business. They have a hermit personality, that’s the 10.2. The 13.2, they’re a
bigot. And I don’t mean that in a negative sense. I just mean that in a sense
99996666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
like if they’re not going to choose the people in their life, why should they put
up with all these people knocking on their door.
John Lennon Paul McCartney
But they’re also democratic; they’re the 7.2. If you go through the profile, if
they’re the 59.2, you know they’re shy. That’s their strategy. If you go through
the profiles you’ll see what a second line personality is. It’s a shy hermit.
That’s its strategy. It’s very democratic. It’s up to somebody else to call them.
They don’t have to do it themselves. If nobody calls, they can mind their own
business. And not everybody is welcome, that’s the 13.2. All of those themes
are there.
When you go to the fourth line unconscious, you’ve got an opportunistic
unconscious. It has to wait for its opportunities, otherwise it’s not going to
succeed. And of course if it’s the unconscious, you’re going to find that people
with the second line are very hesitant to jump. The second line personality
naturally is a hermit, and the fourth line unconscious is naturally saying, “Wait,
wait, wait…wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait for the opportunity, wait for the
opportunity, wait for the opportunity, wait for the opportunity.”
Profile Resonance or Harmony is Important in a
Relationship
McCartney is a 4/6. Now why do you think they got along at the profile level?
You got a 4/6 and you got a 2/4. Those fours together, profiles, when you
meet somebody who has similar profile to you in terms of line—same line
resonance or harmony—it’s a very important connection.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 97
If you take two people who have the same design who come together as lovers,
and then you have other samples of people with the same designs who are
coming together as lovers, if the profile is different, if they don’t have
resonance or harmony in their profile, there’s going to be difficulties in their
being able to achieve their purpose together. It doesn’t mean that it’s going to
be a bad relationship at all. But it may take both of them away from being able
to achieve their purpose in life.
One of the most common things in life is how many members of a
relationship, partners in a relationship, sacrifice their destiny, their purpose,
they assume, for the benefit of the other or whatever the case may be. It’s one
of those things to see in a chart when you’re looking at composites or you’re
looking at partnerships, that it’s important to have resonance and harmony in
profile because it shows that the relationship can be mutually beneficial in
terms of achieving purpose.
Keep in mind that because profile is not designed, is not the way in which the
vehicle operates—it’s a larger mechanism at work—the profiles do not have to
be harmonic or resonate in order for the vehicle to live out its natural process,
and to live out the process in a healthy way. It’s a separate issue on a much
larger plane that’s taking place when you’re fortunate enough, because your
genes won’t attract you that way. They’re into the vehicle attraction
mechanism. If you’re lucky enough to be attracted to a profile in which there’s
harmony and resonance for you, then whether that’s a good relationship or
bad, you’re achieving your purpose through it. It’s something interesting to be
able to keep in mind.
John Lennon Paul McCartney
99998888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
What you have here is the connection between Lennon’s opportunistic
unconscious and McCartney’s opportunistic personality. They resonate to each
other at that level. It’s just one of those things. When you meet people that
have the same profile as you, you’re meeting people who have the same kind of
structural purpose. And even though the gates of the profile will be different
and the design and definition will be different, there’s a sense of connection
you have that’s very special, because at the purpose level, there is a bond.
Profile Relationships and Allies
This is one of the aspects of the writings of Castaneda that I always liked—this
concept of the ally. And to recognize that the allies are everywhere, and that
our allies in life are not design allies but they’re profile allies. This is where you
meet your purpose allies in life. It’s a matter of profile. You both have
structurally come in with the same purpose, to fulfill the same kind of structural
purpose, even though you have different vehicles. These beings, when you
meet them, can be of great value to you.
I’m a 5/1, so if you have either the five or the two in your profile, or the one
and the four in your profile, then I’m a powerful ally in your life. Now if you
don’t have that, it doesn’t mean I’m not of value to you, but it’s a different kind
of purpose relationship. There’ll be a time, particularly after I finish writing all
these books on the Global Incarnation Index, when we’ll be able to use profile
in the way that it’s intended. In other words, that not only can we recognize
purpose, but we can find those with whom we can fulfill purpose more easily
by both living out our nature and at the same time being connected to those
forces.
And by the way, harmonies are the most productive. The moment you’re
meeting harmonies through your cross, there are many, many relationships.
For example, there are a lot of people in my life who are 2/4's, many, many,
many of them. And, of course, that’s the natural harmony to being a 5/1. It’s
just the natural harmony. You’ll find, for example, that you will meet both the
resonance, but particularly the harmony of your lines in your profile, and you’ll
see that those relationships are very different. They’re different.
Profile relationships are very different, because they’re about purpose, and of
course, at the surface that can be very subtle. In other words, you can’t
necessarily see what kind of impact you have on them, or they have on you, in
that sense, because you’re both involved in a process that’s taking place below
Projected Channels and Circuitry 99
the level of the line where you cannot be aware of it. It’s one of those things to
remember. We have no access, at the conscious level, to what our true purpose
is. That’s something that takes place below the line.
The 1/3
Okay, last look here. This is a 1/3. This is the beginning. This is the first
cross. It’s the only cross that is personal in the sense that both lines are lower
trigram. Now, if you have a 1 personality, you have a chameleon personality.
The 10.1, the first line of modesty. This is the chameleon. You have a
chameleon personality. You have a personality that wants to be the authority,
and yet at the same time is empathic. This is the cave man, cave woman, the
59.1. All of that is there, and of course, they are the very, very foundation of
personal involvement. In other words, they disappear. They can be totally
disappeared and gone.
Their personality is staying out of the way, and at the same time they can jump
right into your face and take advantage of you for their own purposes. All
1/3's are totally self-absorbed. If you have a 1/3 that’s tribal, it’s very different
from a 1/3 that is individual. The third line underneath that is unconscious,
that’s a trial and error unconscious. It’s one of the most magical things about
profiling, because profiling is a way to enter into the genetic code of the whole.
And to recognize that the foundation cross of any hexagram field is always
going to be a 1/3, which means that though the personality has to have a
foundation, if the foundation doesn’t work, the unconscious will become
anarchistic. The unconscious will look for what’s wrong with the foundation,
and in that evolution is possible. It’s not just fixed.
The 1/4
If we started with a 1/4, there would be no place to go. You’d have two
foundations locked together, and you would just have a fixed nature of a
hexagram. That’s why the ancients, in their revelation, knew there were
changing lines, and that’s why it’s so obvious, in the mathematics, that they
exist. This is the beauty of 88 degrees of the Sun. This 88 degrees creates life.
If it was 90 degrees, there would be no change. None. None whatsoever.
There would be no movement. There would be no change of the crosses. A
1/3 would not become a 1/4. Wouldn’t happen.
111100000000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
So, it’s very important to see that the 1/3, that even at the very, very basis of
what it is to come into the world, you never come in locked. No choices, not
no chance. Very different. You come in locked. You come in locked into a
program and the moment that you know how to live that out, you transcend it.
You get its glory. You get the beauty that is beyond anything that form can
recognize. My trip about the light and the darkness. I know how incredible the
light is; otherwise, I would never have been given this gift. But it’s not about
that. It’s really about seeing that the only way we honor the light is by
surrendering to the form, so that we can see the damn light, that we can be the
light. That’s what it’s all about.
Achieve Your Purpose by Honoring Your Profile
So, at the level that you’re at now, it’s time for you to think not just about,—
and I’m talking about you, not those you work with. It’s not just about what it
is to live in your vehicle according to its Type and authority, but for you also to
begin to look at your purpose, and begin to see that the way you achieve your
purpose is by honoring your profile. It is the Sun-Earth. It is the core of our
being. And in honoring your profile, you’re going to be able to see that there is
a subtlety to how you live out your Type, and that subtlety is related to your
profile.
I’m a 5/1. I have a universalizing personality, but that universalizing
personality isn’t going to be able to universalize anything until it’s got the
foundation right. And the only way that I’m going to be able to get that
foundation out is if I can universalize it practically, which means I can’t do that
all the time. The moment I look at that, and I see that I’m a 5/1, and I’m a
single definition Ego Manifestor, I know that there’s a real subtlety placed on
me. See, if I was a 4/6, I would just be barreling out there. If I was a 2/4 with
my design, and the voice came to me, I’d be a god damned, zealot missionary.
I’d be plowing through everything. But I’m a 5/1. I’m different. I seduce and
run. That’s my way. It’s 5/1, and every time I seduce you and I run away, my
reputation grows, which means the next time that I have to do any seducing it’s
going to be more powerful. It’s the way that it works.
It is a subtlety upon the strategy, and in order for me to fulfill my purpose, with
my design, that single definition Manifestor fulfills its purpose only through
universalizing a practical foundation. Basta. And if I had a different kind of
profile, that vehicle would have to be oriented in that direction. So many
Projected Channels and Circuitry 101
people are going to be out there and alive that have my design, but don’t have
my profile.
So, pay attention to how you fulfill your purpose, and recognize that when
you’re looking at profile, in terms of your clients, all you’re doing is giving
yourself an extra insight into how you can add some subtlety to the hints you
give them, the clues you give them, as to how they live out their Type. If
you’re dealing with somebody that has a third line personality,—remember pay
more attention to the personality than the design because they have conscious
access to it as a theme. If you’re dealing with a third line personality, it’s
important for you to tell them if they’re a Manifestor and they have to ask
permission, wait until it bangs into them, then ask permission. Wait out the
personality trick. Play the personality game. Live out the line.
So, pay attention to those themes, eh. They give you a deeper insight. All of
these synthesizing tools, that’s what they’re there for, to make it simple for you
to be profound for them. That’s what it’s all about. That’s a nice catch phrase.
We put it on bumper stickers…
Q & A
How Aura Works in a Group
Student: You say a lot of times to be hooked up, go to a public area to be
private. In a group, I can’t touch certain people.
Ra: Ultimately, the way in which the auras are operating for you is that the
most intense aura field that you’re in are those people in your aura. What
happens to an aura in an area like this is that it just keeps on hooking one into
the other, and then you can move through the auric field. You’ll notice that at
a party, and you go into a lot of people gathered around in various spaces. And
all of a sudden you notice somebody, or somebody notices you, and you make
eye contact, and it’s eye contact that goes across the room, and all of that.
You’ve hit each other’s auras through moving through everybody else. It’s not
a direct aura contact, but you’ve picked up their aura through the other auras.
So, in that sense though, there is a more intense conditioning of your aura by
what is closest to you, you’re still getting the whole interconnective auric field.
It’s working through everyone here together. So, if we do a chart for this
111100002222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
room, there’s no way of dividing that. There’s no way of separating any of us,
in that sense.
Weigh the Conditioning Potential of the Undefined Throat
Student: When you talked about this difference between the splenic voice and
the emotional voice, and looking at a chart like that, you said that someone
who has no Throat definition at all, that there would be a different criteria.
What would that be?
Ra: Yeah, if you had a situation of a defined Throat, but everything looked so
balanced. In other words, it was a defined Throat where all three channels
from the Throat to the Self were defined, and both the Splenic and the Solar
Plex are undefined.
One of the things that you have to do with the undefined Throat, is that you
have to look and see where the most pressure is, or the most potential is.
In this particular case, we saw a number of things
that would have made it easy for us to make a
decision. There was a lot more activation around the
Solar Plex than around the Spleen. And in the case
of the definition of the Throat to the Self, the
abstract side, the 33-13 was conscious, and the
Splenic side, the logic side, the 7-31 was
unconscious.
So, when you’re dealing with an undefined Throat, then you have to weigh it.
In other words, you’re going to weigh and see where the more common
conditioning is going to take place. Is there more conditioning potential on the
Solar Plex side? Or is there more conditioning potential on the Splenic side?
Now, what that’s going to say for you is simply that that’s the greatest
likelihood for their voice. It means that, most of the time, they’re going to be
more open because they’re coming from the Solar Plex time. Most of the time,
their voice is going to be more volatile in terms of its movement, yet at the
same time, that does not discount the fact that they can still come out with the
Splenic side voice, because it’s totally open.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 103
The thing about the totally undefined Throat Center is its capacity to be wise
about the nature of the Throat. So one of the things about the totally
undefined Throat is that they know how to speak out of both sides of their
mouth. So, they will take advantage of speaking out of both sides of their
mouth, knowing when to be cool and when to be hot, in that sense. Another
way you could look at the way in which the voice is expressed on those two
sides.
Collective Self-Love
Student: It’s the chicken and egg question about being a Projector, because
one of things you’ve been saying is nobody loves themselves, so suddenly in
this process there’s a moment when a light goes on and I see something in my
design. Like yesterday, when you said experimenting with depth, I was like
“ah.” And then the moment of recognizing that, it’s a little scary because then
I have to love myself. Which comes first? Do I invite the recognition by
loving myself or does it matter?
Ra: No, it doesn’t matter. Both ways are possible. The thing to recognize
about being a Projector, being anybody, is that your aura will talk for you. So
you can find love through being recognized, you can find love for yourself
through being recognized, and at the same time you can find love for yourself
through your gift of recognizing. It can come either way. And your gift of
recognizing can bring love into your life and recognition. In other words, you
have all these multiples that are at work.
The theme, though, is that none of that comes out without the invitation. In
other words, how you’re going to live that out, which way you find the love for
yourself, and remember it’s much more difficult for you. You have a single
definition that is collective (16-48). So, what that means is that, in order for
you to love yourself, you have to see a way in which everybody can love
themselves. It’s not just enough that you love yourself.
No collective person can be ever satisfied with their own love. Never, never.
Part of being collective is the recognition that whatever personal experience is
of value, and is truly mutative, this is something that the whole collective
should be able to get access to. The collective does that. They want everybody
to participate in what they think is correct. So, of course, through the 16-48
what usually happens, is that you’ve got Lennon and McCartney writing love
songs.
111100004444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Do you know what I mean? In other words, all that thing about love, and all of
that stuff, it just gets put out as a kind of feel-good in the world. That was
Lennon running around saying, “Give peace a chance,” his bedroom movie;
literally, trying to get everybody to see, “Look, I can’t love myself until all of
you are at peace. Don’t you understand?” That’s what he was saying. He said,
“Look, I can’t be at peace with myself unless all of you are at peace.” It’s so
collective. That’s such a collective concept.
So, it becomes very difficult for you because at that point it’s recognizing, “Ah,
I can love myself. Can everybody else? Can we share that?” And if you can’t
share it, it’s just as bad. “I love myself and nobody else does,” says the
collective person, and that makes them feel so bad about life. That’s the trials
and tribulations of being collective.
So, the whole thing for you to see is that the logic in the geometry for you, is
that you’ve actually come to a place where you can see that loving yourself is a
pattern that’s accessible for all. That can take a lot of the burden off your
shoulder. Collective people carry a very serious burden. They carry the burden
of trying to enrich everybody else's life, with the standards that they think are
appropriate, and so you can end up spending so much energy being concerned
that everybody else loves themselves.
So, yeah, your first step, live out your Type. Be invited to your own love, and
then watch how that grows, but there’s always going to be a part of you that’s
never going to be satisfied with that. And of course, that’s valuable, but it also
means you have to accept that as a criteria that genetically is there in you. That
says, “Even though I may get to a point where I do love myself it’s not enough,
it’s not good enough, and I’m never going to be satisfied until everybody loves
themselves.” Well, yeah, go for it. It’s not my job.
Human Design in the Corporate Business
Student: I may have to wander a bit before this question. In my education in
psychology business consulting, at the beginning, I just touch the corporate and
business world, and then I immediately got out of it, because what I saw there
was that where there is emotional blockage—and that depends on how many
people are in the group, and how many people are blocked emotionally—that
there really was nowhere to go in certain businesses and organizations where
that block was cleared. Now, this is kind of an offshoot, but, so then I began
to work with the individuals who would come to me out of the corporation in
Projected Channels and Circuitry 105
private, in secret, almost. And also, with smaller businesses where we could
deal with that. Is there a way that I could have stayed within that…
Ra: Yeah sure.
Student: …and probably made a hell of a lot of money in that, but I chose to
go out and do it the other way because I couldn’t…
Ra: No choice.
Student: I didn’t see that it was possible, at that time, within the group
structure, to work with that, unless the total group would agree to working at
that level, which is very difficult to get in a corporate structure, because it’s too
threatening to management to be able to do that. So, what to do? And also,
there could be a difference in healing, undefined with a person who’s undefined
emotionally in that structure.
Ra: I do Human Design corporate readings. Every corporation has the
potential of being much more efficient and much more successful if the
management is trained in Human Design. And one of the keys to the
corporate work that I have done in the past, and what I’ve done recently is to
work with the key figures in management. Now, one of the advantages of
Human Design, if you get the opportunity, the only way you can get in the
door is by the secret way first. In other words, somebody who is in authority
within the organization has to be taken through their Design, because
automatically, they will see the possibilities out of that.
But what’s essential to recognize is that, based on Type, organizations can be
run very efficiently. In other words, we talked about the nature and the power
of the Sacral Center, and how important it is in terms of the Sacral being the
great workers that we have. Now, of course, the Sacral is not going to be a
great worker unless it’s treated with respect, unless it’s dealt with according to
its Type. So, if you have an organization in which you can see clearly where
your Generators are, if you ask them to do things, you’re going to have very
successful employees who are going to be very efficient, and are going to make
more money for the company, and more money for you.
If you have Manifesting employees, they have to be clearly told what the
boundaries are for them as Manifestors. In other words, that they have to
inform before they act, and then they’ll be free to act. If you’re going to have a
111100006666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
force where you need people to go out there all the time, you can’t afford to
send people outside who have problems with motors or who have problems in
actualizing. You can go through all of the structure, and of course what you
end up with is a way for the organization to be run efficiently. Not only that,
but who should be in charge of what?
The last company I did which was about five weeks ago, I did 17 employees.
The first thing that was clear in that analysis is that I printed out 17 charts on
two pages and just looked at them. And just by looking at that, I found out so
many things about the nature of that business. For example, there was no 48th
gate. 17 employees, no 48th gate. Now, my reaction to that was one of two
things: either the company doesn’t have any depth, or that’s its whole purpose
is to collect depth, and if that’s its whole purpose, it’s perfect. I did not know.
Hey, I take things blind. I do not want to know from the company what they
do. I don’t want to know any of those things. In other words, I want only to
work for the mechanical level.
So, of course, this company later I found out, turned out to be that their whole
business is research. No 48. That’s what they were in the business of. That
was perfect. If you brought one 48 into that organization, you’d skewer
everything, because you’d have one fixed solution there, one way of accessing
the depth.
The other thing was that there was a total lack of defined Egos and my
recommendation to the company was that they were undervalued. They were
working too hard for too little money, and it was time for them to charge more.
Not that I knew that, but that was one of the major dilemmas that they were
going through, that they weren’t getting enough return on their labor, and yet
they were very successful. The company kept growing, but they didn’t get the
return. They didn’t get the return because their valuation wasn’t correct;
undefined Ego. Undefined Ego doesn’t know the value of things and can end
up being,—that was a company in which there were 15 Generators or
Generating Manifestors.
So, the moment you can take this knowledge and you can bring it to the
business community, then you get an immediate positive response; that is,
business is more efficient. If you treat your employees according to their Type,
they’re going to be very loyal to you, and they’re really going to appreciate you.
There’s not going to be resistance in your relationship, and that elimination of
the resistance in the relationship is essential, because what we’ve learned, by
Projected Channels and Circuitry 107
looking at the tribal circuit, is to recognize that the business aspect of our life,
the career aspect of our life is essentially tribal and operates out of the laws of
honor. It has to do with loyalty. It has to do with support. It has to do with
being able to nurture each other, and at the moment that any organization runs
according to its type, it’s automatically going to be more efficient.
The employees are going to have a better sense of family in the organization.
You’re not going to have turnover. You’re not going to have this vast
movement of people in and out, people quitting, all of that stuff. In other
words, if you look at any organization, the most unstable aspect are the
Generator employees, because they’re the ones that are operating at potential
frustration levels, and are ready to quit. You get so much turnover, and you
don’t have consistency in the way the organization runs, but the moment you
treat those Generators properly, just by respecting their nature, then they
become your best employees. They become the most trustworthy, the most
efficient, and the most consistent.
So, the nature of taking Human Design to the business level, this is something
that over the next several years, with what appears to be a jump in the way in
which Human Design is recognized, that the opening up of corporate analysis
and corporate possibilities are really going to be there. It’s deeply effective and
none of the owners of the organizations that I’ve worked with have had
anything other than real gratefulness and praise for the kind of knowledge that
Human Design delivers for them. A way of really understanding how to work
with people, and to bring out the best in the community of business, and not
just leave that for attempts to bring out the best in the community of our social
realm.
Student: Question that I would have about that is, within the corporate world
this whole thing about privacy, and getting actually that kind of information…
Ra: Yeah, the advantage that we have in our time is that there are a lot of
people of my generation who are freaks. Who are ex-hippies. Who are open
to this or that, whatever the case may be. I know a lot of sannyasins who are in
business. There are a lot of people who are open to, not only going through
this kind of analyses of their business, but at the same time have employees
who naturally will resonate to that. Now, of course, it’s something that’s
essential.
111100008888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
I do not do a corporate analysis that involves employees unless the employees
have given permission and have given accurate time, because that’s the way I
know. So, obviously, you’re not going to be able to do that with every
organization, and you do have questions of privacy that are involved. There’s
no way you can do a general program of analysis of a corporation without the
employees participating in that and providing the energy in recognizing that it is
being looked into.
What I always provide at the end of the presentation material that I do
corporate-wise is an opportunity for any of the employees whose data has been
analyzed to get a reading at a discounted price. That’s something that I’ve
always done. I usually get, out of this group of 17, I think there were three or
four. I haven’t done the readings yet, but I think there are three or four that
booked readings, because they became curious about that. The information
was shared with them at some levels. Yeah, obviously those things are
important. From the very beginning people have been concerned that Human
Design was going to end up in the hands of the bad guys, the CIA and all this
stuff. Someone was telling me this morning about email from military
establishments looking for information on Human Design. It’s very amusing,
all that stuff.
What is Purpose?
Student: You were talking about the profiles showing where purpose is, and I
just have a general question. What is purpose?
Ra: Yeah, okay, and I think if you hear that on the tape, I didn’t say exactly
where purpose is. It’s how to live out what can bring you to your purpose. In
other words, it's the proper strategy to get you to that purpose. The question is
an excellent one, because at the maia level, purpose doesn’t exist. It doesn’t
exist. That’s why this is Incarnation Index information and it’s a view that
comes with a different perspective.
You see, the real purpose of any of us is a purpose that we fulfill as an aspect
of the whole, and that aspect of the whole that gets fulfilled, we do not know
anything about. This is the tones and bases that lie beneath the colors that lie
beneath the lines. This is a part of our work in form that we have no conscious
access to. And it’s not like we can do anything about it, nor is it that we can
truly see, in that sense, in the maia sense, what the purpose is.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 109
In my writing of the Incarnation Index, I will be able to give people a larger
sense of where their particular incarnation is in terms of general areas of work
within the totality. General areas of work. So, in that sense, purpose only
means that there is an intrinsic value to everyone’s life. And that intrinsic value
in everyone’s life is that contribution that is made to the whole. And the best
way to make that contribution is a) to be able to know how to live within your
vehicle to live out your Type and b) to take advantage of your profile strategy
to get you closer to fulfilling that purpose even though you will not recognize
that purpose being fulfilled.
Profile is the Structure That Leads to Fulfillment of
Purpose
It’s not like in the maia you get the satisfaction of saying, “Aha,” because it
doesn’t work that way. That purpose is deeply, deeply veiled beneath the level
that we can reach, or above the level, if you like, that we can reach. So it isn’t
about the claptrap of destiny, in that sense. It’s not about saying, “You’re
purpose is to change the world.” It’s not about that. All the profile says is that
if you pay attention to the profile, this is the structure that leads to fulfillment
of purpose. It’s the structure. That’s what a profile is. It’s a structure that
leads to the fulfillment of purpose.
You can see that by seeing that structure in relationship to the four gates you
have of the two Suns and two Earths, you can see what structure. In other
words, you look at those elements of the cross and you can see that those are
the dominant themes. Those four arms for you, those are dominant themes in
your process. But your suspicion in the question is correct; that is, it’s not
about being able to say, “This is what your purpose is.” The profile is there to
guide you to fulfill a purpose that you can never consciously participate in.
Never. Nor unconsciously participate in, never.
Give Up Our Vanity
That’s the moment that we give up our vanity. That’s what that’s for, eh, to
give up our vanity. Just to do our perfect part in a perfect program. You can
only, like genes standing in line one to the next, you do your bit, but the one
gene that breaks down on the job, everything else gets all kind of messed up.
We’re all in here together. So, the moment that we take profile for what it
111111110000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
really is, it gives us an edge on being able to give the vehicle the subtle
direction of purpose.
You don’t need that purpose to be fulfilled in this life. All you need is the
Human Design to be fulfilled. In other words, live out your Type. Live out
your Type. You will be fulfilled within yourself, but in terms of purpose, the
purpose is trans-personal. It’s trans-individual. It’s something that’s simply
integrated into a larger purpose. By the way, the answer to that is, life, because
that’s the purpose. The purpose is life. That is awareness, consciousness, and
form. That’s the greater purpose.
Student: Wouldn’t that simply be to know that the ladder you’re climbing is
leaning up against the right wall?
Ra: Yes, that’s right. God bless your clichés. What you’re going to have to do
is write a book one day of Human Design cliché’s. And you find a cliché for
every single gate and line. That’s not hard. There’s only 384 of them. Come
up with 384. Go into the computer, get all the clichés you can, and put them
to a line, because it’s true, eh? There’s a cliché for every line; they’re there.
Where is the Genetic Inheritance in the Personality?
Student: When we talk about genetic inheritance and the codons, it’s clear to
me that they do have a chemical basis. What about the personality?
Ra: Yes. You mean the personality in terms of inheritance?
Student: In chemistry.
Ra: Okay. Let me tell you the truth. Shh, don’t tell anybody, okay. No one.
First of all, the only real genetic inheritance is in the first 88 degrees of the Sun.
That is the genetic inheritance in the vehicle itself, and it’s all genetic
inheritance. The difference is that the design crystal is in tune to the body, and
it’s in tune to the genetic material. That’s why through the design, we can read
the genetic material, but it’s not the genetic material itself. In other words, it’s
the way in which the design crystal gives us access to our bloodline, and our
past, and it is in tune to it.
The personality is in tune in its own way. In other words, the personality tunes
in to certain aspects of the genetic material, but it doesn’t tune in with the same
Projected Channels and Circuitry 111
depth that the design does, because it is in the design’s interest to keep the
body running in a,—it has to have a direct relationship to all of that genetic
inheritance. The way we structure that in design is that people grasp that. That
there are these two aspects of us; that is, the blood inheritance that we carry
within us, this deep genetic information pool that we have, and at the same
time, our capacity to be able to reflect on that as passengers within the vehicle.
But, we can only reflect on that through the genetic inheritance that we’ve been
given.
The way your brain is structured and all of these other things, all of this
biological reality of us is always a direct result of inheritance. No life can be
anything but a direct result of the inheritance from the chromosomes of the
father and the mother. But the real inheritance—that’s why it’s the medical
application of Human Design—is in the first 88 degrees that is in the
conception chart. What we see in design is that we can talk about those aspects
of our consciousness that relate to various things. That aspect of design
consciousness relates to, connects to, the genetic material, but it isn’t it itself.
Don’t tell anybody.
What is “No Mind?”
Student: Sorry about this question. It’s euphemistical. I found myself having
an argument this week with someone who’s a pretty serious meditator. I got
confused, but all that stuff about the “no mind,” where does that all come
from? What is “no mind?”
Ra: No mind (showing a chart with an open mind). Look. The first Atman guru—
no mind. No mind—mind illusion, everything’s illusion. If you have an open
mind, everything’s illusion. Everything’s a trip. Everything’s just passing
through. Nothing is there. So if you have an open mind, you go to an Atman
guru and the Atman guru says, “No mind” then it’s perfect for you. You can
become a meditator. You can become a masturbator. It doesn’t make any
difference. Away you go—no mind, no mind, no mind and you’re right, it’s
terrific, no mind, no conditioning in the mind. Don’t take in authority. The
mind’s never inner authority and it can be so deeply conditioned to be an outer
authority; it can be deeply conditioned to be an inner authority.
111111112222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
These people with an open mind, no mind for them is beautiful, and it works.
All of a sudden, they go into meditation, and they’re around people who are
meditating, and it’s all kind of quiet, and it’s like, “Wow.” No mind.
Now, if you take somebody like Ra Uru Hu who has a defined mind, and you
take him to an Atman guru, and the Atman guru says, “No mind,” I say, “No-
no-no-no-no-no-no, not true, not true. All mind, all mind, all mind, all mind.”
This is the whole thing about the beauty of Human Design. The beauty of
Human Design is to be able to recognize that no generalization can stand up
until it’s looked at through the magnifying glass of Design. For somebody like
me, it is torture to say “no mind.” It’s not possible for me.
If somebody has an open Head Center, open Ajna Center, no mind can be
quite natural, because, of course, they don’t want to be bothered by that
scourge of stuff that’s pouring through all of the time. What we tend to do out
of mystical peer pressure,—and there’s nothing more disgusting than a spiritual
groupie on a trip. They try to hook you into their generalization and they say
“no mind, no mind. Let me drag your defined Ajna to my guru.” What an
enormous pain that is for the person with the defined mind. It’s horrible.
The same thing is true for people with undefined Self’s who have gurus who
tell them who they are. All of these traditional lies. And also traditional
wisdoms. That’s why my whole thing about people who say to me astrology is
this, and this and this…none of them are accurate. They’re not accurate.
Nobody who understands Human Design can tell you, tell me, for any given
moment that astrology is going to be accurate. It’s hit and miss. It can’t be
anything else. And the same thing is true for all of these hip ways of saying
“this is the way” and “this is the way” and “this is the way.”
If you’re living out your mechanics and living out your design and you’re living
out your Type, there can be any way. It’s like all the people having the same
design, and they’ve 12 different people with the same design, and they’ve all got
a different profile. There are all kinds of ways. You take these 12 people, they
all have the same design, different profile. One of them has a satori experience,
and tries to tell all the others that this is the way. Now, it’s okay if everybody’s
got the same design, sort of, but they all have different ways of approaching it.
What we have is that we have all kinds of teachers that speak only out of their
design and people fall for it. Punjaji, open mind. No mind.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 113
Osho, the 18-58. Never be satisfied. I mean, give me a break with all this
stuff. They’re speaking out of their design. Now, there’s nothing wrong with
that, we all do, but when you turn that into a generalization and say that that is
a way to be enlightened or awake or whatever, then you’re doing damage. The
Ego therapist with the undefined Ego, the damage that gets done, just because
there’s a generalization. “You have the willpower.” Bullshit. That’s not true.
Sometimes it’s true, and how human beings love to lie.
The astrologer gets one aspect out of ten absolutely right and think that they’re
terrific. “Wow, that aspect really works.” The rest is all just laid aside. We do
that all the time, and then we tell people who can’t be no mind, that there’s
something wrong with them; and we tell people who can’t be willful, that
there’s something wrong with them; and we tell people who don’t know
themselves that there’s always something wrong with them. We make them
sick.
When I gave you that little piece about every day you see somebody and you
say to them, “Boy, you don’t look good.” This is what we’re doing to each
other all of the time. We’re saying to undefined Selfs, “You have to know who
you are and where you’re going. You have to,” and we make them sick. So,
your mystical argument with your mystical friend, they’re not mystical, they’re
ignorant.
Student: Sometimes you have the Channel of Curiosity.
Ra: What to do. What to do.
What about a 4/6 Profile Having All 3 Gates of Aloneness
Student: I have a question. I have a 4/6 profile and have all three gates of
aloneness. I find this just a bit confusing. I would like you to comment on
this.
Ra: Yeah. Again, the strategies of profile are different than dealing with your
Type. So, first of all, you have to deal with the nature of the Type. Now, the
fact that you’re a Generator, and the fact that aloneness for a Generator is
actually not an unnatural state, the genetic continuity of that. And, of course,
the genetic continuity of having all three gates of aloneness is saying that not
any initiation is going to happen to you, because not everyone who could
111111114444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
initiate you will ever get access to you. So, that aloneness is related to the
nature of your Type.
But as to how that comes out as a purpose strategy, how you can fulfill your
dynamic in this life, that 4/6 is saying you have to build friendships, that’s the
4. So what the 4 is saying that you’re going to live out your aloneness, and the
only way that anybody is really going to get access, is going to be able to come
and get your response is if they come as a friend. In other words, you have to
build that out of a friendship pool. That’s what the 4 says, and then the 4 is
also saying, “It will all be a matter of opportunity for you,” so genetic
continuity. In other words, yes, you need to be alone a lot. Yes, you need to
be aloof, because that’s your sixth line so that you can watch all those things,
but it’s also saying your opportunity will come.
So, what really qualifies that is that the moment you see three gates of
aloneness and whatever you are, like me I have all three and I’m a Manifestor.
It just means that my manifesting can’t happen all the time. It’s my continuity
to being a 5/1. I can’t bring that out all the time. It would be exhausting for
everybody else including myself. So for your 4/6, that 6, the unconscious 6, is
holding back your four. It’s saying, “Well if they’re friends, we’ll look.” But
remember the strategy of friendship is one day you can consummate. You
don’t have to consummate right away. So, the key for you is simply to see how
the aloneness affects the way in which your generator works. You need to be
secure with those people that you allow to initiate you, and that security comes
out of friendship.
The Discovery of Uranus
Student: Could you cover a little bit more around the discovery of the planet
Uranus and what it did for us?
Ra: I can try. No single event is the cause of anything. There is continuity,
genetic continuity in all things. Events that mark specific points, they're
metaphors for us. They allow us to accentuate it, but I don’t want you to place
the entire transition of going from a 7-centered to a 9-centered being
exclusively on the discovery of Uranus. It’s not like suddenly Uranus was
discovered and (snap) that was it. That transition from 7 to 9 had already been
at work, working underneath, in that sense, as part of our evolutionary process.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 115
However, the moment of the discovery of Uranus, this is the initiating point
into human consciousness. In other words, that the 9-centered being suddenly
was there to emerge. Now, we would have had an overlapping in that. That’s
important to see. In other words, you’re going to have a period going from
around 1781 until as late as the 1880s, in which you would have 7-centered
beings and 9-centered beings both on earth at the same time. Very interesting
period, to be able to see that there was the old and the new that’s at work.
Now, one of the things that I can’t help you with, is that because I had no real
esoteric background before I began all this process, I don’t really know very
much about the traditional chakra system. I know many, many people who do
and who are, well, as close to experts I suppose as I’ve met in terms of the
chakra system. They have a very hard time trying to find a way to go from the
7 to the 9.
Now, yeah, I know, yes I know your opinion. I’ve heard all kinds of people
give me all kinds of examples of how they think that evolutionary step took
place, where the Spleen came from, all of these different kind of things.
“Where did it pop out of?” I’ve heard Jürgen tell me that story forever. Where
did G Center come from?” So, I have difficulty in being able to describe the
difference.
The one thing that I want to tell you though, is that if you do research, you can
never reliably look at somebody’s design before the discovery of Uranus.
Doesn’t make a difference how sophisticated the computer program is, that
you can go back 35,000 years or whatever, if you look at Adam’s design, Adam
had 5 centers. He didn’t even have 7. So the reality is that from 1781 onward,
then Human Design is accurate. Remember, that’s the beautiful thing about
patterns and what happens when mutation takes place. With Human Design
you cannot read a pre-1781 chart. I know, I’ve been through it. I’ve looked at
all kinds of them. You can’t. It is simply not going to work because you’re not
dealing with a Rave, at all. A Rave came into existence in 1781.
I was only given the numbers. Theoretically the next version would actually be
11, but we never get there. That’s what the voice said anyway. We don’t get to
that version because the game changes. There are these on-going progressions
at various levels, certain cycles, deep cycles in cosmic time actually went
through much longer progressions than we have in terms of this kind of
numerical business.
111111116666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
What is in the Totally Open Throat & Sacral’s Closet?
Student: If the Sacral Center is the BodyGraph’s closet, and the Throat is
where you read all manifestations. And you have both of those completely
open, what lives or is hidden and hangs in the closet, and what does that mean?
Ra: That’s the kind of closet that can open up to the cosmos. That’s the kind
of closet, that you open up the door and all of a sudden you’ve stepped into the
middle of the galaxy. The totally undefined Sacral Center is mystical. I’ve
already seen it in something like 14 or 15 mystics and gurus over the years, so
it’s obviously an indication of a deep fascination with the life force. And of
course the undefined Throat, the ultimate wisdom is Throat wisdom, in the
sense that it’s so important to life on Earth. So somebody with an undefined
Throat and an undefined Sacral, totally undefined, the potential for wisdom in
them is extraordinary to understand the nature of life and how life manifests;
however, in practicality, at the mundane level, these are very disturbed people.
A totally undefined Throat is a very difficult thing to deal with. And there’s so
many influences and so much pressure on the Throat system, and in
combination with an undefined Sacral, where you have people who have all
kinds of sexual problems on top of that, that you can end up rather than having
this extraordinary wisdom, you can end up with somebody that is very
uncomfortable with themselves.
Student: Can you add a 4/6 profile to that, because then you’re externalizing
all of that and it seems to me that in some way…
Ra: Well, you don’t externalize what you’re not, you externalize what you are.
So, the nature of whatever that definition is, what’s the definition in that
situation?
Student: Struggle and judgment.
Ra: Okay, so if you’re looking at the way that definition is, it means that in
order for that to come out, in order for the struggle to correct, the struggle to
challenge to come out, that it can only come out through friendship. And only
through friendship will there be an opportunity to externalize that struggle and
to externalize that correction. And of course it has to be invited.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 117
This is the beauty in why Type is the surface of this knowledge, because if you
do live out the Type, whatever the difficulties inherent in the design are
overcome, because by living out your Type you’re not caught in the authority
that’s not you. You’re not caught in false sexual authority. You’re not caught
in false manifesting authority. And then in living out your Type that way, that
opens up the possibility that you don’t identify with those forces and do
become wise as to their nature. All of our undefined centers are, after all, outer
authority for the other. And through those processes we can be a benefit to
the other. Okay, one last question.
Astrology Can Only be Accurate Sometimes
Student: Some people say that Progressions…(laughter) Or isn’t there a good
one?
Ra: I have friends who are really good astrologers and I drive them crazy. I
make them very depressed. I’ve seen progressions. I’ve had progressions done
for me. I’ve watched them go through all of that process. The underlying
nature of astrology is that it cannot possibly be accurate. It is not possible.
Anybody who knows their design knows that. You all have planets in dormant
gates.
If an astrologer says to you—just dealing with personality activations—that
your personality Mercury in Sagittarius means this that and the other, if that
personality Mercury is in a gate, and it’s dormant, and it’s in an undefined
center, that aspect that’s given to you by the astrologer is not true. It’s
sometimes true, but it’s not true. It’s not consistently true. Now, of course,
there are all kinds of astrologers that are going to read your personality chart,
and they’re going to read your personality and what they’re reading are many,
many aspects that are dormant, that have nothing to do with who you are, that
has nothing to do with who you are consistently.
So at the base of astrology is inaccuracy. The fact that astrologers have
invented house systems and progressions and all this stuff, it doesn’t impress
me. Now, I go back to the simple, and the simple says, “It’s obvious and
evident that astrology can only be accurate sometimes, and can never be
accurate all the time.” So I’m not going to put any credence into anything that
astrology presents as a more sophisticated way of looking at this or that. I find
that the more astrological knowledge you have, the more confusing it is. And
111111118888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
the more things you know about astrology and can say, the more difficult it is
to understand what the hell anybody’s talking about.
I have a famous Vedic sannyasin astrologer staying in my house right now.
When he gets into astrological babble-speak, I just kind of look at him and I
watch him, and then he’s talking about himself, and then I’ll say to him,
“Where is that in your chart?” And then he’ll look at it and see that it’s in an
undefined center, and I say, “You’re full of shit; you’re a lousy astrologer. You
don’t know nothing man.”
I’ve made him so depressed he wants to study Human Design now. This is a
joke. So, yeah, what I do in situations like that where I take it seriously in the
sense that it’s a legitimate, honest question of the moment, is that I just point
out to them that basic inaccuracy. If your personality Sun is in a center in a
gate, the center’s undefined, the gate is dormant, an astrologer telling you that
you’re a Taurus or a this or a that is a joke. You only become that thing when
somebody hooks up that center. And you may have a relationship in your life
where your partner never hooks it up. Can you imagine?
And the astrologer’s telling you you’re a Taurus and this is the way you do
things, and that doesn’t come out. That Sun is locked behind a closed door
somewhere. And then your partner, who knows nothing about astrology, reads
the description of Taurus and says, “Ah, astrology’s full of shit, he’s not like
that.” Because she didn’t bring it out, or he didn’t bring it out of the other. So
this is a basic thing about comparing things to Human Design.
The most astonishing thing about Human Design is how accurate it is. You do
get to see. I respect the astrologer’s knowledge, the recognition, the revelation
of the impact of planets on our lives, what planets mean. I have respect for
aspects, but only if they actually function.
One of the people that deeply impressed me in Europe is a man by the name
of Döbereiner. He’s one of the greatest astrologers, living astrologers, in the
world. He specializes in medical astrology, and on many occasions over the
years where we’ve been able to sit together, and of course to be able to see the
depth of aspects the way he can, what he knows about a relationship between
planets is incredible. But the accuracy of using that, he doesn’t have.
The moment you take that depth in the knowledge and you apply it to the
matrix, you apply it to what Human Design is, which is a non-dogmatic field.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 119
And you put it through, and then you get to see whether that aspect is alive or
not. If somebody looks at your astrological chart and you’ve got a Mars-Saturn
in conjunction, they’re going to give you a whole story about it. But if it’s in an
undefined center, it’s not consistent in your life. It’s not a major theme. It is
for other people; every time they hook up that center they get it.
So, that’s not my business in this life to be argumentative in the sense of,—I
could trash everything because of course I see it from its limited perspective. I
see that the modern, revealed synthesis is going to be always much more
accurate than any of the components that it’s synthesized out of. It’s just
obvious. Astrology is one of those things where you can clearly point it out.
After all, the revelation of Human Design has done more to substantiate the
basis of astrology than anything ever. I like to think of the fact that I’ve
honored astrology just before I kill it.
You know what I mean? “Yes, you were right, the planets do influence us,
now drop dead, there’s something new. Because it’s not accurate and this is,
eh? Have a nice day.” So welcome to a new day.
Projected Channels of The Root Center
Probably the center that is given the least respect and attention is the Root. It
is one of those things that I have noticed in conversations with students,
analysts, all kinds of people. People have a reading. They talk about all kinds
of centers: the Ajna, the Throat, the Ego, the emotions, the Self, the Spleen,
the Sacral. Nobody talks about the Root.
Back Problems
One of the things that's interesting about the nature of the Root is that the
Root has no direct access to the Throat. Everything else does, other than the
Head Center. So, given the basic structure of the BodyGraph, you can see that
we don't have particularly good connections to our Root. That's why most of
humanity suffers from back problems. We don't have an easy connection to
our base, to the base of the spine, to the Root Center, to the adrenaline system.
111122220000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
We know the by-product of adrenalized stress. We know what happens when
that energy fuels something else. You've
already seen how profound the Root is in
fueling the format process, and providing the
pressure for the format energies, and how
significant the format energies are in being
able to understand design, and understand the
way in which we work together in concert.
So, the Root is very significant, but because
we don't have a natural way of getting to it
immediately, we don't see the Root manifest
on its own. We never get to see that. We
never get to experience that. And so, we don't give respect where respect is
due.
The Root Center is essential for us. It is a very, very complex center. It has
more gates than the Spleen or the Solar Plex. It's incredibly complex. It has
more gates than the Self. It has the same number as the Sacral. Only the
Throat is more complex, so this Root Center is really something.
No Direct Access to the Nature of the Root
Now, let's think about the nature of Root energy. We talked about how certain
centers that are undefined, that when they are defined through connecting to
somebody else or the program, that certain centers respond in different ways.
We've already seen that awareness centers—the Spleen, the Ajna, the Solar
Plex—respond by being conditioned to giving authority to those awarenesses.
And that can be quite profound in terms of what happens to you when you
give false authority to an awareness, whether that's the feel-good of the Spleen,
the concept of the mind, or whether that is the wave of the emotional system.
In other words, that those centers when they are undefined, are always open to,
not so much that the conditioning is more powerful, but that the conditioning
is taking place in areas where we naturally seek out our authority, so that we
can really be conditioned away from our true authority.
When you're dealing with the Root Center, the undefined Root Center does not
recognize—and I know, I have lived this in my own life—does not recognize
the defining of the Root Center as such, only its by-product. In other words,
the stress out of the Root Center can only be experienced through
whatever channel it goes out of, but it can't be experienced as the Root. I
Projected Channels and Circuitry 121
know what it is to experience the Ego, but I only know what it's like to have
my Spleen under pressure, or my Sacral under
pressure, or the emotions under pressure. In
other words, we don't have this direct access
to the nature of the Root.
Back Problems. It’s one of the most
interesting processes that I've had in my
mystical life. In the early 1980s, I think. Well,
anyway I don't remember. I damaged my
spine. Sarah was there when that happened to
me. I don't know, how old you were, six years
old? Something like that, five years old? I
was in bed for two or three months. I lived on morphine. I lived in a dark
room all day. I was in absolute agony. I went to all kinds of specialists and
they told me that I had damaged, had crushed the disc at the base of my spine,
and that they wanted to cut into my spine and to replace it. Put a Frisbee in
there or something.
The whole thing about that is that the disc separates the two components of
the spine, the bones, and the nerve endings can touch each other. And that
creates a great deal of pain and sciatica and all this stuff. You build up calcium
deposits in that, and you can avoid the pain for a certain amount of time, but
it's very easy to break the calcium and get into the pain again. Now, I've been
dealing with back pain all my life, since that time. It's one of those things that
was there. I didn't do any surgery. Yeah, I toughed it out for about six
months. I found a guy who gave me some hints that were very valuable,
putting a pillow under my knees and stuff like that.
Then within a couple of years of that, I disappeared. I end up as a wild man
living in a tree. I'm running up and down mountains. Now, the doctors had
told me that I would never run again. They told me that I would never lift
anything over five pounds again without bringing damage to my spine, and that
if I was lucky enough to avoid all that, I'd be a crippled old man. Sons of
bitches. So anyway, remember if you tell somebody every day that they're not
well, they're not well.
So, there I am running up and down mountains, and lifting things, and carrying
things, and going through all of that process. Now, the physical damage that I
took there, I have an undefined Sacral and Root so the kundalini there, I'm not
111122222222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
able to handle that if I'm not living out my life properly. The moment you get
ill, the moment you get sick is when you're not living out your Type, and that
illness is going to come out of those centers where you're being identified.
So the stress of the life that I was living in at that time, there was an enormous
amount of stress and pressure on me to work too much. My Sacral was being
defined. The Root was being defined, and obviously, I was into something that
truly was not for me. The net result of that was that I had to lie down for three
months. So the damage doesn't go away. The difference is that in living out
my nature, and in living out my Type in all of these years since then, it's rare
that it disturbs me to the point that I am really uncomfortable. It doesn’t. It
doesn’t stop me from walking, running, lifting or any of those other things,
because now at least my system operates properly and I'm not putting that kind
of pressure on that undefined Root Center.
Now remember, if you don't have access to the Root, it's very difficult to work
with it and heal it. It's difficult. And it's one of the things to see that we are all
in a pressure sandwich, and that pressure sandwich is the pressure between the
Head Center above and the Root below. And we're squashed in the middle of
that, and we're pressured into, like now, being good ants. Go to work.
The Splenic Side of the Root Center
So, we're going to look at the six projected channels that operate out of the
Root. And we see that the Root is
divided up into a perfect symmetry. We
have three generative channels, the
formats. We have three splenic-
projected channels, and we have three
emotionally adrenalized channels.
We're going to begin on the splenic side.
See, one of the things to recognize about
Projectors is how complex they are as a
Type, and there are many subtleties and
differences in the qualities of projection.
The 11-56 is very different, very
different, than the 41-30. Or the 18-58. They’re very different. First of all, if
Projected Channels and Circuitry 123
you look at the 18-58 or the 41-30, you can see that in the case of the 18-58,
you have energy available that’s going into the Spleen. Remember, we talk
about a Projector as being a non-energy Type. Now, what we're really saying is
that the Projector and the Reflector do not have consistent access to either the
Sacral or the Throat. In other words, can neither generate nor manifest, but
that does not mean that they're void of energy. They can be incredibly
energized. The 40-37, the 39-55, the 19-49, or the 41-30.
Defined Motor in a Projected Channel — Health Problems
So, you have somebody that has three motors defined to each other and they're
still a Projector, because they haven't had access to the Sacral. In other words,
Projectors are very, very complex Types. It does not mean that they are energy
starved, but you see, the moment you bring a defined motor into a projected
channel is the moment you can see that they can have a tremendous amount of
health problems.
When you're looking at the 16-48 or the 20-57, or you’re dealing with the
projected aspect that is not energized in any way, then it's not likely to suffer
the same kind of physical damage that is possible in anyone that has a projected
aspect that is rooted in energy. (Note: Channel 16-48 is discussed in the Creative
Channels book.)
The 40-37 Holds Water — Bladder Problems
The classic example is the 40-37. No one holds water better than them. They
hold water. And, of course, the reality
of their being able to hold water
means that they can end up being
overweight. They can end up being
very bloated, and not just the 40-37,
but the 40-37 as an archetype of that.
What you're looking at is energy that
may not have a consistent way to get
out, and one of the main problems
that come to 40-37 is bladder
problems. In other words, they can't get it out. Or they have to get it out all
the time.
111122224444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
One of my jokes about being undefined emotionally is that the moment I step
into an emotionalized aura, I have to pee. It's terrible. They make you pee,
these people; it is what they do. They should all have shares in toilet
manufacturing companies.
Get their rightful profits.
If you don't have a way to
get the energy out, then the
moment you step into
somebody's aura and they
hook that up, you can pee
and so can they. You need to get the energy out, and of course, what that
means for the Projector as a Type is that they can be under a deep energy
burden, and of course their bitterness gets empowered by the energy.
It's not like they're saying, “I have no energy, and I need you, and I understand
energy, and therefore I can be of assistance to you,” which is the classic
Projector pitch. But that's not true for the Projector that has energy elements.
What they're looking for is, “Give me access.” Let me put my energy to work,
putting your energy to work. And, of course, the moment you have a Projector
who has an energy element and you recognize them, they're very powerful.
They can become physically active.
Some Projectors, without access to energy within their own system, are at their
best just sitting behind the control panel and guiding the energy from behind
the control panel. But the moment you have an energy element in the
Projector, it means that in order for them to be healthy they have to use their
own energy, not simply guide the energy of others.
In other words, those things are combined. They become active workers on
behalf of the energy of others in order to benefit themselves, because they need
to get that energy, and they need to get that energy out. It's essential for them.
It is much less a pressure of that kind of dynamic on the splenic side,
adrenalinely, than it is on the other side.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 125
The Solar Plex Side — Emotions Under Pressure
Obviously, on the other side you've got two motors. You have the Root and
the emotional system together. You have the emotions under pressure. If you
look at the simplest level of keynotes, you're always going to get a fundamental
truth. All you have to do, when you look at the 19-49 or the 39-55 or the 41-
30, all you have to think is ‘emotions under pressure.’ And if that's a projected
element and it's not generative and it's not manifesting, then you know that that
pressure builds, and that
pressure can pop unless it has a
natural release. The need to be
able to get the energy out and
get the energy out in a healthy
way.
The other thing at the surface
to look at and something
important to see,—we've been talking about, in the nature of conditioning and
the nature of the conditioning of undefined awareness centers, how sensitive
undefined awareness centers are to that kind of conditioning. I want you to
look at the symmetry between the Splenic Center and the Solar Plex through
these six channels from the Root. And I want you to recognize that they both
have to do with our health in a very profound way, not just the obvious way of
the Splenic Center.
The Healthy Emotional System and the Root Center
You see, the healthy emotional system does not come into existence through
the operation of the 40-37 or the 12-22 or the 35-36. A healthy emotional
system is conditioned by how it lives out its relationship to the Root. It's very
important to understand that. If you have a healthy emotional system, you're
also going to be a healthier human being. Every time I tell a Solar Plex person
to sleep on it, I'm better medicine for them than anything that they ever met,
because it's automatically making them healthier. And it's important to see that
we have very profound Solar Plex illnesses, and that the Solar Plex Center,
because of its nature, can blind us to being in situations where we can be
infected, abused, hurt.
So, the basis of whether we're going to be healthy splenically, how well our
immune system is going to work, and how healthy we are going to be
111122226666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
emotionally, how well our whole Solar Plex-neural system is going to operate,
all of that is being conditioned in the relationship with the Root. And then you
can begin to see that if you look at these three sets that are coming out of the
Root Center, though we don't have any direct access to the Root, if you're
going to build a temple in the body, build the temple to the Root first, because
out of that Root comes everything.
Out of the Root comes the formats that guide the functioning of all energies,
and the basis of how we are going to operate through all three fields of
awareness, how we’re going to operate
through all three streams and fields of
the emotional wave. All of that is
structured out of the Root relationship
and whether that is going to be healthy
or not.
I’ve already shown you that the core of
Human Design and homeopathy together begins with the format energies.
Everything about the correct operation of the Root has to do with our health.
That’s why you have kundalini yoga. It goes back to that recognition that if
you can get the base energy to operate in a healthy way, you can be a healthy
being. What we can see out of Human Design is that the health of the Root a)
begins with you living out your Type whether the Root’s defined or not, that’s
the first thing, and b) the second thing is that the only way we can see that our
Root is operating properly is through the definitions that come out of it. That’s
the way. And that’s the only way.
Then we’re going to have this healthy movement of this kundalini energy, the
energy that is driven through us is energy that is clean. The cleaner the energy,
the cleaner the fuel, the brighter the crystal, the clearer the trip.
Spleen to Root People Must Use Their Body
So, we’ll start on the splenic side, and we start with the individual process, the
nature of mutation. The first thing to be clear about the Spleen to the Root is
that these people must use their body. Must use their body. Must. Now, of
course, that could be a dilemma if it's a projected element. You have to be
invited to use your body. Now, I've had people who will say, "Jesus, Ra. Okay,
the first time, did you mean I got to sit here in the house and wait for
Projected Channels and Circuitry 127
somebody to invite me again?" And, all this kind of stuff that comes with
people resisting their mechanics.
Somebody can invite you to participate in activity with them on a regular basis.
You don't need an invitation every other day after that. All you have to do is
recognize the invitation, and that it's a valued invitation in the first place. And
if you’re a Generator who has the Spleen connected to the Root, then it's
essential for you to wait for the opportunity to respond to activity. In other
words, just following out the program of the various Types and the way they
operate.
But when I say that it's essential for activity, think about it this way. You have
an undefined splenic system, and let's take the simplest
metaphor which is the laundromat. The laundry, the
washing machine. So, the Spleen is a washing machine.
The undefined Spleen is a washing machine that's just
standing there with its door open. That's all. That's
what it's doing, and it's
waiting. Now the moment
that it's connected to the Root,
it gets plugged in. It does not get turned on. It just
gets plugged in.
Now, while that door is open, splenic people are
taking in dirty laundry. They take in the dirty laundry
of the people around them. They take in the dirty laundry of the world around
them. They take in the dirty laundry of their pets, their plants. You name it,
they collect it, and it's all going in that open door. And then suddenly they're
connected to the Root and all the lights come on, on the washing machine, but
nothing is happening. That's why, if you have the Root connected to the
Spleen, you must work with your body. What that's really saying is hook up
your aura to something so that you can get that aspect of yours connected to a
Sacral or a Throat, so that not only is the machine plugged in, but it's working.
And then you can clean out that load, so that you're ready for the next load.
Now, think about what happens to that machine that's on, that keeps on
getting loaded up, that never gets turned on. At a certain point, that machine
gets overloaded, and the moment that it gets overloaded, even if you finally get
the chance to be active, the machine breaks down. In other words, you love to
go hiking, and you don't do it for a long time. And normally when you go
111122228888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
hiking you feel absolutely terrific. And then you don't do it for a long time.
And the motor has been on, and stuff has been flowing into the washing
machine, and then finally you get your chance to generate or manifest, and you
hurt yourself. You can't even complete the activity.
So, you have to see that when you're looking at somebody's design and this is
an element that is projected in them, they need to work with their bodies
because it is something that is going to make them healthy. But it’s telling you
something else: It’s a natural projected element. The moment we see that one
of the most common Types, and the most complex Types in the world are
Projectors, you have to recognize that we are deeply and intrinsically dependent
on each other. And the presence of these definitions between the Spleen and
the Root are always an indication of that.
There’s a teacher of Human Design in Germany, who as far as I know, now
lives somewhere in Mexico. She has all three channels defined between the
Spleen and the Root and nothing else in her design. I’ve seen that a lot.
Incredible thing. This is somebody who is a workout freak with all kinds of
people; this is a 4/1 profile. That is the juxtaposition cross. These are very
strange people. They're friendly with everybody, and everybody's friendly with
them. And, this is a person that's always getting an invitation to do something
physical, and they're always doing something physical; healthy.
But that's the magic of keeping the Spleen healthy when it is adrenalized;
otherwise, it becomes something that makes you sick. So many people that I
know who have defined Spleens to the Root are not healthy people. It's an
irony, after all. The irony is you would think that the Spleen defined is
something that's going to be fundamentally healthy. Well, it is, as long as it's
properly exercised, and depending on the Type, brought to the exercise in a
correct way.
The Individual Process
The 28-38
In the individual process, the 28-38. You can see that the Root Center is the
breeding ground of depression. Stress that is not properly channeled becomes
depressive energy. That's why we have lines like the 28.6 or the 32.6. Or we
have, like in the 18.2 terminal disease. We have all kinds of aspects that are
Projected Channels and Circuitry 129
connected to the Root that can be made depressive by the very energy of the
Root Center. You see, we are meant to be depressed if we are not productive.
The Gods are cruel, you know?
It's like it is ant season now (see the Transits book for more information about the ant
season.) You play grasshopper and the gods are going to give it to you. The 28-
38, the Channel of Struggle, a design of
stubbornness. If it weren’t for the 28-
38, we would never have evolved into a
social specie—never. It's one of the
things you learn in Human Design and
sexuality and the nature of caring. That
integration only will care for the other
in the presence of either the 28th or the 38th gate. In other words, if you take a
pure integration being, who is absolutely self-absorbed and selfish, they will
only become concerned about the other in the presence of the 28 or the 38.
So, the first thing to recognize about the presence of the 28-38 is that it brings
a fundamental health to human nature, to the most individual, the most
survival-oriented, primal aspect of our nature. What is brought to it is the
opportunity for that to be healthy, to be healthy in the sense that the capacity
for survival is something that can be empowered unto others. For that reason,
no other channel is more caught up in the nature of life, purpose and death.
And, of course, the nature of struggle is one of those jokes for me. I'm deeply
attracted to 28-38s; I have the three aspects of
integration. The moment I become concerned for
them, because their 28-38 is there and it brings out that
aspect of my integration; at the same time, they make
everything so much more difficult. They're really a
pain in the ass. You can really see that the moment you
have to care for the other, struggle is natural. And that
we must accept that, and not be depressed by that. We cannot just be
individual and alone. That's what the 28-38 says, “How can I find out what my
purpose is alone?” That's something deeply that the 28-38 figures out. How
can I find that alone?
Of course, the 28-38 does not want to be influenced. The 38th gate is a gate of
being deaf. “I don’t want to hear what you have to say.” So at the same time
that it recognizes that its purpose cannot be found alone, it can get really
111133330000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
depressed because it doesn’t want to be influenced. It just wants to be
empowered, nothing else.
The 28-38 is the capacity to struggle, but it's a boxing match before the ring of
the bell. Just like it's a washing machine that's plugged in, but not turned on.
When the 28-38 is just standing there alone, it's just standing there like this with
its fists up in the air. It's like one of these toys, you know? And, of course,
what happens to it is that it can finally just explode.
By the way, one of the most common things for a 28-38 at that point of
explosion is that it brings other people to explode on them. I know so many
young men with the 28-38 who have been beaten up, minding their own
business, just standing there with this 28-38 energy in them for struggle and
fighting, and somebody else just gets off on it. And, of course, if they're not
exercising that,—if you take somebody who’s a 28-38 and they have regular
exercise, they don't struggle. It isn't to say that they won't forget their keys. It's
not about that.
Exercise to Music
The essence of their day-to-day process is not going to be colored as struggle,
because if they put their body to work, then they give themselves something to
struggle with. Just as breathing is so important to the individual process on the
emotional side, exercise is extraordinarily important to people on the splenic
side, but exercise to music.
It's one of those things that if you're going to go jogging, and you’re a 28-38,
take your Walkman with you. Jog to the music. You'll find that you can run
longer, that you breathe better, and that you feel better. That's one of the
reasons why the 28-38 can be the greatest of all dancing gates; can be. These
can also be people, by the way, who absolutely refuse to dance—the moodiness
of the individual process. But this is a great dancing gate. This whole channel.
You can see the dervish here sometimes.
We tend to get caught up in word prejudice. Channel of Struggle. And we
tend to think of that as being, well, not nice. But, of course, it's an absolutely
essential ingredient. My knowing. I know a lot. I don't have to reveal any of
it. I'm a pure integration individual, backed up with an individual Ego. I don't
have to tell anybody anything. I went through most of my life not informing
Projected Channels and Circuitry 131
people at all. The moment I had my disappearance, I disappeared into 28-38
land.
And 28-38's are infuriating if you're a 20-10-57 like me, because, you see, they
don't let go and they say to you, "How do you know?" And you tell them that
you don't want to tell them now. They will fight with you. They will struggle
with you. They will force you to tell them what you know, until they get to a
point where they either reject it or not. Whatever the case may be, but they
force you.
All the tribal people loved my energy. Loved the feeling of the voice energy
that they could get through contact with me, but the 28-38’s, they turned me
into a teacher of Human Design. They forced me to explain my knowing to
them. They forced me to care that it was important for me to explain my
knowing to them. Now, of course, half of them were deaf to it. You know,
what to do. Nonetheless, they forced me to do that.
The Ear of Acoustics
So, it's one of the things to recognize that these channels that are coming out
of the Root, oh, are they ever important. What they do is create the life energy
that pressurizes a whole process. This Channel of Struggle is a mutative
process and more than any place else, it is the beginnings of the power of the
ear of acoustics. This is the basis of intuition. Intuition is ruled by our acoustic
sensitivity. The gift of the 28 is to know what risk to take when, based on what
it hears. That's why they can get into so much trouble, because what they think
they hear in the moment and what they can act on spontaneously can be quite a
blast. The exercise and the movement to sound.
The 28-38 Child
The other thing is if you have a 28-38 child, it's great to have music playing in
the house. And it's great to grab their hand, and pull them up, and dance
around with them. These are the kind of children that you send to dance
school, or you put them into the marching band, or whatever the case may be.
But you'll see how healthy that is for those children. They will not be the
strugglers we know. They won't. They will march to a different drummer.
Now, of course, all of that has to be invited.
111133332222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Invitations for Anything Individual are Tricky
The theme of invitation for anything individual is always tricky ground. One of
the things to be clear about is that if you accept that the individual is never
going to acknowledge your guidance in the moment—and when I say never,
sometimes they will—because they need to see it as their own guidance, and if
you don't expect them to respond to the guidance in the moment, your
guidance can have deep impact on them.
This is particularly important with individual children. You can make
suggestions to them. “You're a 28-38. “I'd like you to take up dancing,” or
“You're a 28-38 and I'd like you to take up some martial art.” Kids, boy or girl,
whatever the case may be. They have to be guided to that. They have to be
invited to that. But because they’re individual, you cannot expect that in the
moment you do that, that your good work is going to be accepted. And if you
can do that, then you'll see that most of the time—most of the time, not all of
the time—that they will recognize the value of that guidance, claim it as their
own, and go about doing that.
I've had spectacular moments in my movie where somebody will come up and
start ranting and raving at me. You know what? I'm great at not hearing it.
I'm a 43-23. It's like they’re howling in my face, and I'm watching their glands,
and the bubbles above their eyes, and the bulging of the neck. The color. But
if anything in that rant is of any value, truly of any value, three or four days
later, I hear it in my own inner voice, in my 43-23 mind. And if it actually is
clear, I'll claim it as my own. And you hear this in individuals all the time. I
know this.
I'll be sitting with an individual and we'll be having a conversation, and I'll be
saying something about what I know, and they'll play devil's advocate, and
argue with me or do whatever they do. And then two or three days later, I’ll
hear them in a conversation with somebody else, and they're saying what I said.
Now, of course, in the moment there is no way that they were going to accept
that knowing. They don't want to be influenced. They don't want to be
mutated. They don't want to be changed. And yet, out of the aura, after some
digestion, if there is truth in that, the individual will then take it in.
Now, this is the whole key with the 28-38. You can say to them, "Look, you
need to exercise. It's important for you. And why don't I invite you to try out
this kind of …” whatever the case may be. Give them time afterwards. Don't
Projected Channels and Circuitry 133
put it out as if they have to, in that moment, say, "Oh gee, great. I'm going to
do it right now." Because they're not. They're just not.
Individuals empower and need to be empowered, but there's no control over
the timing of that empowerment, how a mutation takes place. Some people get
AIDS and they're gone quickly. Some get it and they're not gone quickly. How
a mutation takes place varies. The real key is to remember that individuals
need to be nurtured according to their difference. Allow their difference to
exist.
Don't allow their difference to contravene what social rules are absolutely
necessary, because we have to live together. But at the same time to nurture
what their individuality is, and to recognize how important it is for the 28-38,
because otherwise, if you don't raise your 28-38 properly, you live with their
struggle as a dynamic of your life. So your family struggles and your siblings
struggle. This is what goes on. So, if the parent raises the 28-38 correctly, they
take the struggle out of their family life and everybody is healthier.
The Defined Spleen — The Only Trustworthy Reliable
Awareness
We come back to our adrenalized splenic system. We looked at the mutative
quality of the splenic Projector in recognizing the importance of the Spleen as
an awareness. Now, I want to differentiate between being able to exercise the
energy aspect, and recognizing that the intuitive aspect, or the taste aspect, or
the instinctive aspect is active if there's definition. In other words, the ability to
be able to trust and rely on the Spleen as an awareness.
There is nothing more trustworthy in design than a defined Splenic Center. It's
trustworthy because it is the only reliable awareness that we have. So, the
moment you have definition to the splenic system—and in this particular
situation, in the moment you have Root definition to the Splenic system—you
need the activity to deal with the energy, but that does not mean that you need
to hook up to the Sacral or the Throat in order to be responsive at the
lymphatic level. In other words, to have your hunch, to have your instinct,
your intuition. That is operating.
111133334444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
So don't mix those two up and think that yes, you have a defined Spleen, but
you can't trust that awareness because it's turned on, but it's not operating. It's
not true. It is operating when it's defined.
The Tribal Process
The 32-54 – The Channel of Transformation
The next thing we're going to look at is the tribe, and we're going to look at the
32-54. This Channel of Transformation. It's so interesting to see that
transformation through surrender is the
instinctive stream. Transformation
through surrender. And that
transformation has to be transmitted.
As I mentioned to you, the healthiness
of any stream operating out of the Solar
Plex or the Spleen is going to be
dependent upon how the adrenaline aspect of that stream operates. In other
words, the nature of the 44-26, its ability to be able to transmit what is healthy
is conditioned by the transformation. Now, that transformation is something
that has to be exercised, otherwise it doesn't work.
Think about the power that lies in the 54. And
think about the symmetry to the other side, the
19. Both the 54 and the 19 are needy, because
the instinctive stream is needy, leading to the
point that it can say, "I have or I don't have"
through the 21-45. But need is what drives the
tribe. Now, what does the 19 need? The 19
needs community. The 19 needs proper principles. The 19 needs enough to
eat. The 19 needs somebody who they are able to touch. These are basic
needs.
Now, think about what happens on the other side with the 54. What does the
54 actually need? The 54 needs to be recognized for its potential value. It
needs to see clearly that it can be evaluated properly, honestly, fairly. It needs
to be accepted into the organization of the material way. And it needs to see
that the principles of that material way are fair. In other words, if you're good,
Projected Channels and Circuitry 135
you get recognized and through that recognition you rise up, so that ultimately
you can become the king or the queen at the 45.
Now, these needs of the 54 are rooted in, like the 19, getting recognition first.
You can see that it is ideal that these two gates, that are the neediest of
recognition, are in projected channels. We know that Projectors and projected
channels automatically get more recognition. Now, that recognition could be
positive and negative, but they automatically will get the recognition. Their
aura automatically will invite the invitation. So, it's an opportunity that is self-
fulfilling in the mechanic.
The 19 and 54 Flirt
Now, the 19 and the 54 have exactly the same way in which they get attention.
They flirt. They both do the same thing. The flirting of the 19 says, "You can
have sex with me, maybe, if the bargain’s right. If
it's fair. If it's a good deal. If the principles…”
blah, blah, blah, on, and on, and on. The 54 says,
"Wouldn’t it be nice if you could have sex with me?
But you can't." And if it’s same sex, the 19 says, "I
may be your best ally." And the 54 says, "I may be
your best ally." The best ally of the 49 is the 19
that backs their principles. The best ally of a 54 is a 32 that recognizes their
value, and acknowledges them.
Now, think about what that's like if you've got somebody, and it's a reading,
and they have the 54th gate. And they don’t have anything else there. You say
to them, "This is the gate of ambition. This is the marrying maiden." You give
them all these formulas. The thing to recognize is that according to their Type,
if they live that out, they will get those opportunities. Now, if you have
somebody who has this channel, the 32-54, they are a transforming agent. And
by being a transforming agent, what that means is that the moment they're
invited, they never stay at the ground level for long; never. Because they are
transforming agents in the material way. And the reality of the 32-54 is that
they know what they're worth.
This is very important when you're dealing with a circuit that is Ego dominated.
If you have two Ego people standing together and one of them says, "How
much do you make?" And they say, "Oh, I make $100,000." And the other
one says, "Yeah, I make $100,000, too." What's important to the Ego person is
111133336666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
not how much money they've made, because then the other Ego person says,
"How much time did you have off?" "Well, I had three weeks." "Aahh, I only
worked two months. I'm a hell of a lot richer and more successful than you."
This is about being Ego. Ego recognizes that willpower is under-valuated.
You see, what we tried to do with willpower,—imagine if willpower was a real
commodity. What you have is counterfeit willpower in the world, and that
reduces the value of willpower. You've got all of these people that are
propagandized into being willful, and so it seems like willpower is a dime a
dozen. It's for free after all. Free will everywhere. Ego people know that's a
lie. They know that willpower is costly. That it takes energy, and that they're
sensitive to that energy. It's their heart. It's their stomach. They have to rest.
They have to eat.
So when you're dealing with a tribal circuitry, recognize that this is Ego
circuitry, unlike any other major circuit that goes to the Throat. Here in the
tribal circuitry, everything is focused on the Ego and that means it's focused on
valuation, which is why valuation is so important to the 32-54 as an agent. You
see, the moment you know what you're worth, you're going to get it. And 32-
54 beings who are pure Projectors, if they wait for the invitation, they're always
going to get the recognition that leads to transformation, where ambition is
properly respected and valued.
The 32 Carries a Devastating Energy
But there's something else at work here, aside from just the pure material level
of that. You see, the 32nd gate carries with it a devastating energy. That is, the
frequency of the fear that we call failure. The 32nd gate in anyone's chart will
always bring this inner question: am I going to succeed or not? Will I fail?
And the question of failure to the 32 is the failure of continuity. Now, think
about what that means. The continuity for a 32 is that there are always new
54's showing promise, who can be evaluated and elevated in order to keep the
genetic pool of the business healthy. That's continuity.
It's like having a high-tech business in which you need super, super
programmers, and there are just none of them around. That's when a 32 gets
really depressed, because they can see that transformation isn’t going to be
possible as a continuum. And the one thing that the 32 does is that it is the
sentinel, it is the guardian of tribal continuity. “We have made rugs in this
village since before your god was born. We will make rugs in this village until
Projected Channels and Circuitry 137
the end.” This is the tribe. There is a sense of beauty and health in that
continuity.
Those of us who have traveled, and those of us who collect crafts from various
places in the world, we're deeply grateful that these artisans still exist that
follow these old businesses and maintain them even today. This is tribal
tradition. And the tribal tradition of staying with what works is not innovative,
obviously. It can stagnate, and the only thing that keeps it innovative is the
new blood that can be brought in.
These are always the 54s, the ambitious ones. The ones that have new ideas,
and new ways of wanting to do things, who can then properly be recognized
and evaluated and allowed to bring their new energy into the enterprise to keep
failure away.
Now, think about what that means on the mundane level. The mundane level
of the 32 is saying to you that if there's anything that you have to do that's
different from what you did yesterday in order to survive, you're really scared.
Because the moment that the 32 is present in your design—like the 42, its
opposite, that need to complete things, and getting hooked in it, and locked in
it, well, that's the 32.
You want to be able to stay with the continuity, because you're afraid of failure.
And of course, these are businesses that stay with continuity to the point of
extinction. They talk about that we're now living through one of the great mass
extinctions in history. And, of course, that is paralleled if you look at the
business world.
Continuity without Transformation Becomes Stagnation
There are more mass extinctions in the business world than have ever existed
before. It goes on all the time. It's the same kind of process. The continuity
has to be there in order for the tribal worker to be secure, but the continuity
without transformation becomes stagnation, and that leads to the failure of the
enterprise. When the enterprise fails, the ripple effect is incredible.
The income of all of those people that are working in that organization, the
income that's taken away from the places that they frequent within the
community. The pressure that's placed on the banking institutions that can no
longer have the mortgages paid for, that built the houses that the people are
111133338888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
living in with their families, and it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
And it's an ongoing dilemma of late twentieth century capitalism. It's just the
way things are.
One of the things about Design is that it isn't about just being personally
healthy, it's about having healthy societies. It's about having healthy material
environments. We spend most of our time trying to make money. We're still
the animals that we’re gathering and hunting, thousands and thousands and
thousands of years ago. Not much of that has really changed. And because
we're unaware of our nature, and because we deal in a world that is
fundamentally ignorant of its nature, this whole business of hunting and
gathering, what the 45-21 is all about, drives us nuts because it doesn't work
well.
We live in the propaganda of the free will, emotional Manifestor. That's the
propaganda of the world. It means that our dealings with each other and the
way in which we approach things, and the way in which we approach each
other hierarchically, doesn’t work properly.
So, the 32-54, its presence in somebody's chart, when you're looking at that in
somebody's design, for them to understand the absolute importance of waiting
to be invited, and while they're waiting to be invited to be a transforming agent,
they have to go out and exercise their body. It is essential for them.
Business Deals on the Golf Course
They're the kind of people that get recognized and make business deals on the
golf course. They're perfect for that. They're moving along, they're using their
body, and at the same time they can be a transforming agent. Now, think
about what the transforming agent does. What that transforming agent says is
that, “This is the way in which we can improve our product.” In other words,
it's the beginning of the new and improvement process.
Now, often, you cannot have an improved product unless you have improved
workers, this whole level of continuing sophistication and education necessary
at the manufacturing level. And at that moment of transformation, how you
can bring in fresh blood and then what to do with that fresh blood—that's the
44-26. How to take that fresh blood and give an old story a new twist and how
to turn on the tribe and then be able to produce it.

Symmetry of the 19-49 and 54-32
In keeping to the symmetry, recognize that the 54-32 is also a channel of
sensitivity, just as the 19-49 is a channel of transformation. It's a mystical
channel. We give transformation another name on the other side. We give it a
pure mystical name, but it, too, is a great transforming agent. The
transformation of our relationship between ourselves and other forms of life,
particularly mammalian forms of life. It’s the place where the common micro-
cosmic principle is translated into a macro-cosmic principle. In other words,
the 19-49 becomes spiritual, mystical, religious.
The 54.4 is the Most Mystical Line
Never forget that truly the most mystical of all lines is the 54.4. And because
there's no explanation of the 54.4 in the Rave I Ching, most people just don't
know what to do with that. Well, think about the nature of what we've seen in
the 54—they flirt. They're here to get attention for their value to the material
way. Now the 54.4 is the possibility of being recognized by something totally
not mundane, for the form itself to be recognized.
Institutions Transform the Tribe
This is a calling to build temples. Somebody's got to finance the building of
temples. You see, the 19-49 tells you that there's a god; it tells you in the sense
that it makes you sensitive to the fact that we are tiny and there are things that
are great.
But the 54.4 says, "Excuse me, but we're going to have to finance this temple,
and we're going to have to figure out how much it's going to cost, and how
many workers we're going to need." Did you know that was one of the great
job creators of the Middle Ages, the building of churches in Europe? It hired
all these poor people, all these craftsmen, these carpenters, and gave them all
jobs, and it would take 20 or 25 years to build one of these things, and
everybody got work.
So when you're looking at the mystical side of the tribe (19-49), remember that
the mystical side of the tribe doesn’t have money. They have principles and
hugs. The money's got to come from the other side (54-32). So, built into
transformation is also the ability to transform material, and transform the
energy to bring material wealth, not simply for individual benefit or for tribal
111144440000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
benefit at the material level, but to be able to provide for institutions for the
tribe. And when I say that these are the temple builders, do not be confined by
that description. It's just nicely poetic. They build your schools as well. In
other words, the money's got to come from somewhere.
So the 54.4, these beings can externalize that. They can go out there and
campaign for the funds, and that's how many people get recognized, doing
charity work, offering material work for free, and many get recognized for that.
So, it's an important aspect to keep in mind about the material side, the money-
making side of the tribe, that it also brings with it as a result of its productivity,
institutions. And it is the institutions that transform the tribe, and this is the
whole point of this discussion. It's the institutions themselves.
Remember, if you look at the responsibility inherent in being a 45 is the
education of your tribe. Now, of course, that wasn't always true, in the sense
of how we understand education. There was a time when educating your tribe
meant that warriors had to be trained, that hunters had to be trained, and that
the better trained your warriors and hunters, the more successful your tribe was
going to be.
Now, given the nature of our evolution and the way our civilization works, that
kind of education today is what we call going to school, being trained, being
educated. It's an essential ingredient for the development of the tribe that they
have institutions, and the most important institutions to the tribe—there are
basically four of them—is they need to have authority control, what we call
police. They need to have a hospital. They need to have healthcare. They
need to have schools. They need to have education, and they need to have
their temple.
Accepting Fair Taxation
The moment they have the police station and the hospital and the school and
the temple, they can begin to be competitive with other tribes. And so, one of
the most important aspects of the 32-54 is whether or not they're going to be
able to accept fair taxation. I hate to get mundane in the middle of April, but
of course, it's very true. This nation was formed out of a rebellion against
taxation. As a matter of fact, the founding fathers of North America were all
people escaping debt that was unreasonable.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 141
So, it is a major issue of the tribe. After all, for most of our history in the last
thousand years, the average human being was indentured; that is, they
automatically owed money to somebody for something, and had to work most
of their lives and never really had a chance to pay it off. Taxation that is
acceptable is something that is really rare, and even though we have all kinds of
countries who say they're taxing people, there are a vast majority of nations on
this planet in which taxation is either something that literally does not exist, or
something that is fundamentally and totally ignored.
It's a major question in the tribe, and that question is: Should I give up any of
my tribal wealth, the wealth of my brother, my mother, my father, my sister,
whatever the case may be. Do I give up our wealth for institutions? Now, if
it's only the tribe itself and it's not collective, it's easier. In other words, you
can see in America the expansion of private schools and parochial schools,
Catholic schools and Jewish schools, whatever the case may be. And you can
see how quickly the tribe is ready to fund that as tithe, opening up their
taxation and saying, “Here, take that” because it's purely tribal. “I'm only
teaching my own, the institution is only for my own, this is a Catholic hospital,
you’re Protestant, drop dead.” This is what the tribe is all about.
And so this 54.4 has a very, very special responsibility. It's a way of recognizing
within the tribe that the building of institution serves not only the tribe, but
everyone—everyone. And, of course, that's a mutative process. That's not an
easy thing to do.
So, when you look at political taxation in the world today, you look at a country
like Italy. Now, Italy has the largest black market of any western country, and
about half of its market is black and therefore not taxed. Now, these are deeply
tribal people. You try to get somebody from Milano together with somebody
from Palermo. It is not going to work. They do not like each other at all.
These are different tribes. The north would like to separate from the south. A
part of the north would like to separate from the rest of the north, and that
part that's left, each cousin would like to separate from the other.
Why We Don't Have Peace on Earth
So, this whole business of being able to provide the essentials necessary for
peace on earth—oooh, does that sound fuzzy. To provide essentials for peace
on earth, that means that everybody has to have shelter, everybody has to have
education, everybody has to have healthcare, everybody has to be able to speak
111144442222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
their own language, and all of those institutions have to be financed. Now,
that's why we don't have peace on earth. We don't have peace on earth
because there are so many beings on this planet that do not want to give up
those resources, and it's not about blame. There is no choice in the way that
we are.
Circuit Mutation
The reality is that in the nature of the tribe, you really have to see how
important an element this is, because the 54.4 is the only place where the
tribe can actually be influenced and influence the collective. Remember
that the tribe has nothing to do with the collective. It has something to do with
the individual. The individual plays ‘monkey in the middle’ between the tribe
and the collective and acts as the mutative force, but the individual has to
mutate them separately, has to mutate the tribe first and then has to go and
mutate the collective.
Here in the 54.4 is the one place in which the tribe, because of its institution
building, can be of value. So, look at what politicians do. They go into
Chicago, and they go into the Polish district, and they do non-Polish jokes, and
they do “We love Poland,” and they get the Polish money. And then the same
collective politician the next night puts a skull cap on and goes into some
synagogue and does the same song and dance, dog and pony show, to get that
tribal money. And then the next night it goes into
the Irish district, and it goes on and on and on.
And you can see that what the collective politician
is doing is tapping into this part of the tribe that
recognizes that institutions must be built.
Now, any other aspect of the 54 says, “Yes, we
have to build institutions, but it’s my palace that
we’re going to build. It’s my factory we’re going
to build. It’s my store we’re going to build. It’s the apartment building I’m
going to build so that I can rent it, sell it, lease it,” whatever the case may be.
In other words, built into the 54 to the 26 is the building up of the structure,
and of course, all of this is being guided by the 50th gate, that is, the building of
all of this.
I get this all the time. It drives me really bananas. I get these people who are
always trying to tell me that the pyramids or this or that were built by some
Projected Channels and Circuitry 143
kind of advanced, high-tech whatever. It’s natural for us to build things, and
the first thing that we build are monuments to our godhead, and it’s the most
natural thing for us to do at the most primary level. You notice that there are
not a lot of temples being built anymore. There are a lot of storefronts being
rented. This grand building of temples, with rare exception, is something that’s
fading. We have other monuments that we build.
If you’re going to be a great city in North America, you have to have an up-to-
date, modern, 20th century athletic facility. That’s what marks a modern city, as
it has done since Rome, since the building of Coliseum. We have a deep drive
in us to build, and a deep drive in us to build physical environments—to build
them. It’s a by-product of this whole stream.
So the key in that is to recognize that the building that takes place that’s
beneficial to humanity is one-sixth of the potential energy in building. In other
words, if we were to do a budget for the future and we were to look into that
budget as to what is exactly equitable for financing our institutions, we would
find that it should be no more than one-sixth and no less. It’s the way it’s
designed to be, and it means that that is probably, in terms of the BodyGraph,
the only taxation that’s fair.
Now, you can get into all kinds of stories about this one makes much more and
one-sixth for them is blah, blah, blah, and this and that and everything else; but
in terms of the mechanics, that’s the tithe. Built into the tribe is that one-sixth
can be put away for the benefit of the whole, and that means that ability to
build the institutions necessary to enrich the life of the tribe in order to avoid
failure.
In the short course that I gave on global cycles, I talked about how we’re all
living through this potential of entering into cycles of fear and failure. That the
32 is something we’re going to meet and the 32 is part of the whole trend that
we’ve been living through hundreds of years. And because of that, we’ve had
the greatest building ever, ever, in the history of the planet. You get a nation
like Indonesia and they build the Petronas towers, these incredible structures.
They’re the largest buildings in the world, these two towers, and they stand up
there saying, “We are a success. Look how high we can build this building.”
This is what’s built into this stream.
That’s why you end up with such ostentation. You end up with people who
build enormous palaces and castles for themselves. That ostentation is built in
111144444444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
there. Usually comes from 26s like me. The Egoist who need to build palaces.
That’s why it was good for me to sit in a chair in a tree for a year. That’s low,
downscale living.
I want you to focus on that in the sense that,—how many of you here have
activation in any of these 4 gates? A lot of people in the room, about half, little
more. Think about that. You see, the responsibility on that side of the tribe is
not about the responsibility of bonding together, but it’s about the
responsibility to make sure that there are the right institutions and
environments that will nurture that. It’s a different responsibility. It’s splenic-
side after all. It’s cool. It’s not huggy. It’s not sensitive. It’s not emotional.
One of the funny things about it, this is instinct, after all; it’s about smell. One
of the most important things for us in our civilized development is to be able
to control smell. Have you noticed that? We build all these giant, smelly things
as a result, which is also an irony of this whole place.
Building Memory Machines
The other thing is this is where computers come from. Computers don’t come
from the mind. They come from this stream. This is what they’re, well
literally, what they’re born out of. The cellular level of this stream of instinct at
the cellular level is where memory is stored. This is a memory stream. If you
couple the fact that this entire system is about being alert and that it’s about
memory and that it’s here to build things, it’s going to build memory machines.
It’s going to build memory buildings, we call them libraries. It’s going to build
these things.
Transformed Aspects of Our Body
It is out of that need to be able to transform, if you look at all of the things that
we have around us, you’ll see that they’re extensions out of our body. They’re
just transformed aspects of what we are physically and that’s all they are ever
going to be. We can’t be anything other than what we are because we’re all in
one body. It’s all just seeing different levels of the perception of how things
work. But this stream is very important for us because it really does build
things physically.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 145
If you want to transform a community, if you want to enter into the wilderness,
you’re going to find these people are your frontiersmen. They’re the ones that
are coming out, and they’re the ones that are going to be able to conquer the
wilderness by cutting down the trees and building buildings, by civilizing it.
The Other Side is Agriculture
You see, out of the other side we got agriculture. The 19 and its desperation
for readily available food is the root of the miracle of agriculture. The moment
you understand the design of plants, you’ll see it’s not a miracle at all. You’ll
see that plants have been standing around forever saying, “Please do this to me.
Please control me. Please manipulate me.” Because that’s the design of plants:
Please do that to me. So human beings, the moment that the 19 got really
hungry and sat around and watched food grow, they figured it out. And you
see this is the beginning of civilization.
The beginning of civilization is the 19 in its need for food resulting in the wave
of agriculture. You ever notice that? How pretty that is? The 19 to the 49 you
get the wave of agriculture. The food is not always there. You’ve got to plant
it, you’ve got to wait, you’ve got to go through the seasons, the hope that the
harvest is going to be great, the pain that the harvest is not great.
And at the same time on the other side, you got the 54-32 people saying,
“Look, you don’t have to worry about the harvest every year if we build a silo,
if we build storage bins, if we control their environment, if we air condition
them, do this do that, whatever the case may be. In other words, on the other
side, out of the agriculture came the city.
Now, you’ve got all kinds of anthropologists or all kinds of theories about how
these things work. It’s right there in these two channels, and it’s right there
specifically in the pressure out of these two gates. The 19 says, “Okay, we can
plant seeds and wait for the food. We don’t have to go anywhere. We don’t
have to travel. We don’t have to build up our tents. I can finally unpack my
Samsonite. We don’t have to go anywhere.” And on the other side, the 54
says, “Yes, but if we’re going to stay here, let’s be comfortable. Let’s build a
yurt. Let’s build a condo. We can vacation there in the winter,” whatever the
case may be.
It’s out of those two. And you can see that the moment you have the
agriculture that keeps you in the same place, and you have the building of the
111144446666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
environment, the city around it, that the net result is that all human activity was
forever changed—instantly. Without the institutions, it would not have been
possible.
You see, the very, very first institution was the temple. It was the first
institution. The value of the first institution is that in the city of Ur in
Mesopotamia, one of our most ancient cities, that with the fertile Tigris-
Euphrates and the ability to understand how things grow, you didn’t need to
put everybody to work in the fields. It wasn’t necessary, and it meant that for
the first time that full-time human activity could be placed in something other
than survival.
Our Civilization Owes Everything to the Tribe
The priest took in the grain. They stored the grain in the temples, and then in
order to keep records of that, they invented writing. They took clay and they
made marks in the clay that we would come to call cuneiform. All of those
things are deeply interconnected to each other and cannot be separated from
each other. I tell you this so that no matter what you may think of the
grandeur of collective thought, in the end, our civilization owes everything to
the tribe, everything, what we call the modern life.
Being monogamous in communities, having the institutions that we have,
having the ability to write and communicate with each other—all of that is
rooted in the 19 and the 54. It’s one of those deep, magical places that you can
go in Human Design.
I got a whole buzz going through me. I could talk about that forever because
there are so many fascinating things in that as a nurturing point. And to
recognize that given the mutation of the emotional system that’s going to come
in the future, that the 19 in its relationship to the 49 will have been mutated as
well. Our concepts of divinity and humanity are going to be mutated.
Remind the 54.4
The 54.4, when you recognize its importance, you can always point that out to
somebody. Remind them that their support of institutions is valuable. It’s
valuable to them because it makes them feel good genetically, but of course,
they’re intended for that. They’re intended to be concerned about the
Projected Channels and Circuitry 147
institutions. They’re intended to be concerned about whether we have enough
schools, whether they are of enough quality.
How Tribal-Collective Politics Works
The two main themes of politics in America have always been crime and
education, other than those times where there is threat. These are basic things
and this is about how the institutions operate, the financing of those
institutions. The dilemma in all of that is that though the tribe is the source of
it and pays for it, they rarely run them. This is one of the dilemmas.
The collective, because of its natural ability at the impersonal level, is our
destiny in the sense that it is our experiential way. And it is our only way into
the future. So, there is a lot of resentment in the tribe and that’s why you have
pork barrel politics. People get so upset about corruption without realizing
that, of course, corruption under any other guise…
In Human Design guise, you can see quite naturally what that is. You have a
tribal vote that gets you elected in some district. The fact of the matter is if
they don’t see anything coming back to their district from the money they’d put
out and the vote that you got, you’re never going to get their vote again. So
you make sure that their local school gets some kind of government project or
they get a new bridge or they get road repair or whatever the case may be so
that the tribe feels like their institutions are being improved even though it’s a
collective son of a bitch that took their money.
And if the pork barrel isn’t there, no way they get elected. If you look at the
politics of the 20th century in the United States, you can see that the pork barrel
politics was the way things were run for a very long time because it was the
only way that you could hold it together. The moment we stepped into the
television age in North America, all of that became difficult to keep up; in
other words, the homogenizing of the collective field. All of a sudden, pork
barrel got a dirty smell to it which is very tribal; the smell of corruption. You
notice how tribal that is.
And of course, now we have a real conflict. What we have now is secret pork
barreling, and of course, secret pork barreling leads to all kinds of
investigations in which the collective investigates the tribe for being bad, for
being tribal, for wanting to back their favorite son or daughter. For wanting to
111144448888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
get a better deal because that person happens to be the cousin of their aunt’s
cousin. That’s the tribe, after all.
By not understanding how the mechanism works, the collective doesn’t take
the opportunity to work out some way of being able to do that, like
proportional taxation or any of these kinds of concepts. Proportional graft,
proportional corruption, in order to keep the tribe happy so they’ll keep on
paying their taxes. Otherwise, you get people who walk around with guns
saying, “I shoot the IRA,” who think it’s a vast conspiracy against the tribe.
I’ve met many people who have shown me books and brochures that the
American Constitution does not give the American government the right to tax
the people. And of course, you give that to somebody who’s tribal and they
swallow that fast. It’s like, “Yes! Those collective whatever’s, they never give
us what we need. Our schools look like hell,” and on and on and on.
It’s a real dilemma because if you take that to a world level, you can see how
important it is for us to have global institutions that are properly financed. It is
a disgrace that the United States of America, who is by far the wealthiest and
most successful nation in the world, owes billions of dollars to the United
Nations. It is a disgrace, but that’s the United States pretending it’s tribal.
If you hear people like Pat Buchanan, he sounds like somebody who’s the head
of a white tribe. I don’t know about the black, the brown, the yellow, and
everybody else, but he sounds like a white tribal leader. “Why should we spend
our money there?” But, after all, if we don’t have successful global
institutions—and that is a question of our time—then we’re not going to be
able to educate properly the whole. And right now, this is a major question.
You can see that played out in many ways.
I doubt very much that very few Americans understand how much this thing
over in Yugoslavia is costing you. Do you have any idea what that’s costing the
American taxpayer? Do you have any idea? It’s a fortune. They’ve fired 45
cruise missiles already. That’s about $60,000,000 down the toilet. Not only
that, they’ve fired so many that half of the American arsenal is used up. Every
time they send planes and troops and they go over there, all of that stuff, and
to keep them there, and to feed them, and the humanitarian aid, and
everything—you know how much this costs? It’s a fortune, and this is the
tribal business.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 149
And here you have the collective NATO, and the collective NATO is dumping
on the Serbian tribe. Hey, this is a collective-tribal war. And you can see
running through the whole collective background of this war all the little tribes
beginning to squabble. From the American perspective, it’s the American’s
war. I mean, that’s America. That’s the ego of America. It’s their war, and of
course, in the terms of their wealth and their fire power, they have the vast
majority of the airplanes that are over there.
But each and every one of these NATO countries that are involved, they’re all
little tribes. They’re all tribes. And they’ve come together in a collective
purpose to fight a tribal enemy. No matter what the real material is in all of
this, it doesn’t matter the history in all of this, just look at this as an archetype
of the struggle that’s going on in the world, because this is the archetype of the
struggle. Until the tribe is ready to give its support to the building of global
and collective institutions, until the tribe accepts the framework of a collective
world, we’re going to continue to have wars and conflict.
I don’t know any other era in which you have such collective warfare. We’re
releasing something unusual taking place. It’s a 20th century phenomena, and
slowly the tribe is being hammered. This is our time of fundamentalism.
So, the whole process of transformation, I want you to see clearly that though
the 32-54 is always to be seen in its instinctive capacity in dealing with fear, in
being conservative, in all of those things that we know about it in terms of
basic analysis, but also to recognize that there is an inherent generosity that is a
by-product of the work of that whole stream.
The transformation that leads to somebody building an apartment building, the
fact that they may gain an enormous profit from that structure does not negate
the fact that they’ve provided housing for all kinds of people who needed it.
There is always a very generous by-product to the building aspect of this
stream.
Now, of course, what we end up with are slum landlords that we hate. You get
all the variations in all of that, but it’s a very, very powerful building tool. Now,
it has to be invited, and there you must get the political joke in all of that. You
have to be invited to make your contribution. You have to be invited to bring
your transformation. You have to be invited to bring in your new blood that
can result in a new, improved whatever, because it’s pure projection. It’s pure
projection.
111155550000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
I have a glorious Human Design story. I have a friend in Ibiza. I guess Rolpf
is now in his 70s, and his only definition is the 32-54. He’s an architect. He’s
actually a very well-known architect, an historian of early Mediterranean
architecture. He had an idea. His idea was to rebuild all the great architectural
wonders of the ancient world that were lost and to rebuild them as a giant
holographic park in the middle of the Sahara Desert financed by the Aga Khan,
who actually agreed to finance it. Technical problems ultimately made it
impossible.
But think of the irony of this. He is a pure 32-54. I assume he’s still alive, pure
32-54. He’s a pure Projector, and his greatest concept was to project ancient
buildings on the desert. His thing was you could walk through them and you
could go through the Tower of Babel. But what a lovely image. You can see
that that is the grandeur of architecture as art. That projection of what society
should look like.
One of my dreams is that the Global Incarnation Index will be released as a
virtual library. Literally a library that you go walking in. Because this is the
magnificence of what structure brings. The architecture is part of our body.
It’s our larger body. I’ve always been enamored by Design whether that is
Design at the mundane level, or whether that’s Design as architecture, or now
in my mystical life just simply Design. But it’s fascinating to see what kind of
impact that has on society, and these are the forces that are responsible for that
and they have to be invited to that.
And remember, they need to exercise, which is why we build great, giant
athletic stadiums. This is a perfect 32-54 environment. Perfect. You have the
grandeur of a vast stadium, and everything about that stadium is about
supporting activity, physical activity.
The Collective Process
The 18-58 — Taste and Non-moralistic Judgment
When you come to the collective and you come to this stream of taste,
remember that the stream of taste is about non-moralistic judgment. I want to
be clear about that. It’s non-moralistic judgment. The fact that it comes out
Projected Channels and Circuitry 151
like morality is another story. The morality is inherent in the tribe. I smell
good, you smell bad, go away. You smell bad means you’re bad. You smell
different means you’re bad, and of course that’s the whole dilemma with the
tribe. The tribe is fundamentally separate and wants to stay that way.
So when you get to the
collective, it’s important to
understand that the judgmental
capacity that you see in the 18-
58 is always misunderstood
because people always think that
this is about moral judgment
because the vast majority of people who live out this energy, live it out as if it
were personal, and it’s not. It’s impersonal. It is collective.
I talked about how these Root channels provide the right health dynamic or
health frequency for the eventual manifestation of their stream. The 18-58
feeds the Channel of Talent (48-16), and it’s essential to see that the way in
which the 18-58 operates is through the 18. That is, it operates through the
fear of authority, and as such, the 18th gate is the great gate of challenging
collective authority, not personal authority, but collective authority.
When a collective person gets personal, they’re going to have a war on their
hands with the tribe and the individual. They’re particularly going to have
trouble on their hands with the individual because the individual is personal.
Very personal. So if you say to an individual who by their very nature is
different, and you say out of your 18-58 or your 18th gate that there’s something
in them that needs to be corrected, you got a problem. They’re not going to
like that. And if you’re a collective being and you’re personal with the tribe,
they’re not going to like that. “What do you want?” the tribe says.
The moment that the 18-58 lives out its collective purpose, then even though
the tribe and the individual can get upset with them, they will also pay attention
to the possibility that’s being offered them. Because if you have an 18-58 in
your aura, you’ll recognize that they not only have the power, they have the
right to challenge authority. That’s what they’re here for. The business of the
18th gate is correction, the fueling of correction. This is splenic. Every
moment there’s something else to correct. Every moment it’s possible to
correct, every moment. As the quantum of the channel, that quantum is saying
that there is a judgment being made and the judgment that’s being made is
111155552222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
whether to challenge or not, whether to like something or not. And 18-58s are
always, always in that ‘I like it’ or ‘I don’t like it.’
It’s weak, it’s dirty, it’s clean, it’s strong. They see everything in the sense that
they are always going to recognize what the 4th gate always can recognize with
the 63. It can recognize that there’s something wrong in the pattern, and the
18-58 recognizes there’s something wrong in the pattern as a spontaneous,
existential, lymphatic response. It tastes it. “I can just taste it,” people say.
“Taste it.”
That sets the proper framework; in other words, the energy to challenge. We
have seen how difficult it is for logic to get access to energy, and 18-58s are
enormously valuable to us. They are primed challengers. The difficulty in not
being able to manifest or generate that recognition of what needs to be
corrected, of course, leads to pressure and the pressure is felt as lack of
satisfaction. The more stress, the more dissatisfaction. This is a projected
element so it is going to be bitter in its dissatisfaction.
It can get very, very nasty. It’s a washing machine that’s got all the dirty clothes
inside and doesn’t get it turned on. It sees all the dirt. It can be very nasty. It
needs to be recognized, it needs to be recognized as a fueling component, but it
also has to see within itself that the nature of being able to recognize what is
right or wrong, what you like or not without that being moral, is that it opens
up the opportunity to actually challenge it and perfect it. And nothing is more
obsessed with perfection than the 18-58. It’s obsessed with perfection in the
same way that the 41-30 can be obsessed with a feeling.
Don’t Compliment the Stream of Taste
Remember, that to be truly creative in the logical sense you have to be able to
identify. And the more identified the 18-58 is with the correction that needs to
take place, the more obsessive they become. They can drive you mad. There is
is no way to reach the perfection. There is only perfecting as a logical way.
The moment that the identification is with the perfecting process and not with
perfection, then the 18-58 doesn’t end up whipping themselves all the time.
It’s very, very, very hard for them, considering that this is the root of criticism,
to be good to themselves; hard for them. That includes the 16-48, as in the
whole stream. Hard for them, they always realize that something could be
better, always.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 153
The grass is always greener, and it’s a driving force. It can always be
challenged. It can always be corrected. You can still do it again. It’s not right
yet. They’re the most difficult people in the world to compliment. I have a
strong Neptunian 48. I hate compliments, they make me uncomfortable. This
is typical of that stream, because the reality is that every time you get the
compliment, there’s a part of you that says, “Yes, but you know. Yes, but it
could be better, I could have done this, I could have done that, I wish I’d done
this, I wish I’d done that.” Jesus, never say to anybody in this stream after
they’ve cooked a dinner that it’s good.
Don’t you dare tell them that it’s good. Just grunt and go about your business.
Because if you tell them it’s good, they’re going to tell you why it’s not good.
Some of them even tell you before you eat it. It’s frightening. “Well, this was a
little long in the oven,” and I’m going, “Ohhhh, why are you telling me this
now? Do you have to share that with me?”
Correction Can be Personal Only When Invited
In living out your Type, this is pure projection. The only way that the
collective gift,—it’s a gift, it’s a real gift to be able to recognize what you like,
what you don’t like, to recognize what challenge must be made because the
ability to recognize when authority is weak. It’s a beautiful gift, but at the same
time it has to be invited and only when it’s invited can it become personal.
Then it can become personal.
If I ever said to one of my partners, “Is there anything I can do about the way I
squeeze the toothpaste?” then they can give me their collective solution. They
can say to me, “Well, there are machines that you can crank it from the bottom
and there’re little squeezers now that you can attach to it. There’s all kinds of
things.” If I asked for that and invite that, they can give me their correction,
their criticism, their advice, their opinion.
But if they tell me, “That’s not right, the way you squeeze the toothpaste,” I’d
tell them where to go, fast, and I’ll squeeze the toothpaste any way I like. So
it’s one of those things about the difficulty of the logical-collective integrating
its gift into its social environment. So often—and it’s unfortunate for them
because it’s not about blame and they don’t know any different—they end up
being the butt of everybody else’s disflavor. They are the bitches, they’re the
whiners, they’re always complaining. They get this terrible reputation, and of
course, it’s not their fault. They just don’t recognize how that works.
111155554444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Anybody who carries the 18-58 in any kind of design and Type, if you honor
your Type, you will then be able to get your valued criticism out, your ability to
recognize what you like and therefore what can be substantiated or what you
don’t like and what needs to be challenged. You’re not going to then have any
resistance or bitterness in that. See, unless we honor that gift,—this is what
drives the tribe absolutely nuts, that the collective is always telling the tribe
what to do. Always. Instead of inviting the tribe to join in and offer its
whatever. Now you get some of that. You have that now with problems with
communities that are multi-racial and the problems with having police
departments that are fundamentally white in black neighborhoods or whatever
the case may be.
How the Collective Can Get Agreement from the Tribe
You have to deal with all of these things. Just because you’re serving a
collective principle doesn’t mean that by its nature as a philosophy or as a
principle that the tribe’s going to be comfortable. They’re not necessarily, and
even though the collective can know that something is right, they cannot
impose it until somehow they can get agreement from the tribe and the
individual to go along with it. That’s why the collective is so important to us.
The only way the collective can convince either the tribe or the individual is by
having something that they can absolutely prove. Prove. And the moment you
can absolutely prove it, then the dogma of the tribe will give up and the
individual will accept it. So the whole thing about being a collective person,
particularly being a logical-collective person, is that you really have to be
prepared. You have to be prepared. You have to know your facts. You have
to be organized. You have to be disciplined. You have to recognize what the
challenge actually is and go after that challenge and keep repeating it. And you
have to wait for that to emerge out of your life through somebody recognizing
that in you and bringing it out through dealing with your Type.
Now if you’re a Manifestor and all of this is running through, then the thing for
you to recognize is that you need to follow the informing path. Before you
challenge anything, you have to inform others that you are about to challenge it
in order to get their collective backing, in order to have those who share with
you and that you share with.
It’s very hard for anybody who’s truly collective to do things alone, anyway.
They need to share the experience. It’s essential for them. If they don’t share
Projected Channels and Circuitry 155
it, it’s not as interesting. And logical people, particularly, need to share it
because if it’s only them, who’s going to believe them? And they’re not here to
be believed; they have to prove things. They like to be able to do it with
others.
Difference between the Sides of the Root
I want to move over to the other side. Before getting into the specific
channels—and we’re only going to cover one today—I want to talk about the
difference between the adrenalized splenic system and the adrenalized
emotional system, and obviously there is a difference.
Everything about the operation of the Spleen adrenalized is that the awareness
is functioning in the now and that is its frequency. It’s spontaneous. Though it
has the limitation of any projected element in that it needs to be invited, the
fact of the matter is that it is a fundamentally healthy process and the awareness
is reliable the moment it’s defined.
That is not true of the emotional system being defined
from the Root. What you have automatically, though,
in these three channels is something well worth paying
attention to. We know that the emotional system is
automatically an authority when it’s defined, so it tells
you a lot about these three channels in that they are
very basic authorities in life. They establish the
emotional system as an authority for three very different processes.
At the moment you have the emotional system defined, then you have the rule
of the wave, and in the rule of the wave you have no truth in the now. Very
different than the splenic system being defined. Very different than a reliable
awareness.
Everything about respecting the emotional system is about seeing the
emotional system operate with clarity. Only when you can see an emotional
system operate with clarity, which means that it has waited out its wave, do you
really see the value in what the emotional system is. It’s very powerful to be a
center that creates the world environment. That’s the Solar Plex.
So when you’re looking at these adrenalized emotional channels, it’s something
to understand that these are,—I was about to say you could look at them as—
111155556666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
no, I won’t say that because then I’ll confuse the hell out of you. They
adrenalize authority, let’s put it that way.
The 19-49 — Tribal Adrenalized Emotional
Authority
They’re the adrenaline source of authority. So let’s take a look at the primary
authority and we take a look at the primary establishment of emotional
authority as it takes place in the tribe. And that brings
us to the 19-49. Right from the beginning when I told
people that there were mystical channels, people get very
excited about things like that. I remember hearing
somebody tell somebody else that they had a mystical
channel, and it sounded like they had a new Cadillac in
the garage or something.
It’s always nice when you refer to them as a mystical channel, to refer to them
as a ‘so-called mystical channel.’ Most of the time they operate at a mundane
level like everything else, and the 19-49 can give one the appearance of being
truly mundane because it is the basis of the tribe coming together.
It really is about very basic principles, the basic principles of how one
establishes community. You establish community by finding a mate, you have
children and then you have community. Out of that comes the natural flow of
things. The establishment of the
personal mated bond and the
establishment of the communal
bond all operate out of this
stream.
Now remember that this is a
stream of instinct. I have
mentioned to you during this course about the emotional system and the way in
which the waves operate differently depending on the nature of the stream.
Many things operate differently according to their stream theme.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 157
Individual-Emotional Breathing
This morning we were talking about breathing (in the Manifesting-Generating book,
see page 50-51) and I’ve accentuated the fact to you that breathing is very
important for the individual-emotional process. It’s important for the
individual emotional process because it is keyed to breath because of the nature
of the 12-22.
Abstract Stream Breathing
But at the same time, breathing is very important for the abstract stream, but
it’s a different kind of breathing. This is aerobic. This is action. This is
learning how to breathe on the move. This is learning how to breathe through
activity and experience.
Individual Breathing
The individual learns how to breathe by being still.
Tribal Breathing
And the tribe—this is the best part—the tribe learns how to breathe by
holding on to somebody else. Sannyasins in my life taught me how to hug.
So, I've had to hug a lot of people. Ever since I've been in this job, I've been in
the huggy end of this job, and I've had to hug a lot of people.
Some people stop breathing when I hug them. This is something that you can
see is absolutely collective or individual. It has nothing to do with the tribe.
Because the only time that the tribe actually breathes properly is when
somebody is holding them in their arms, or walking hand in hand with them, or
having their hand around their shoulder. In other words, tribal breathing is
something that comes out of bonding.
It's the same kind of tribal breathing that pregnant women are taught along
with their men. In other words, that the pregnant women aren't even going to
breathe properly, in this very, very tribal breath act, unless their man is there
with them, sharing in that experience.
And if you go to a midwife—and I've been through midwife movies—and the
male partner isn't going to participate, the good ones (midwives) will not do it.
111155558888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Because the breath is not right and it's not going to work correctly. I've
actually witnessed that and how valuable it is to be able to breathe with your
partner.
When my eldest son was being born, there was a moment just before the
crowning where everybody stopped breathing. Everybody just stopped
breathing. And I thought I was going to die. I was pressing on my own
system, and all of a sudden there was this incredible (sounds of trying to
breathe). My partner was in front of me, and I just screamed, “Breathe!”
Everybody started to breathe again, and then a few moments later, there was
birth.
One of those things to understand is that those different distinctions between
collective, tribal, and individual, is that they breathe differently, as well. And it
tells you something about the magic of the tribe, and why breath and smell is
so important to the tribe and built into tribal communion. It tells you that you
really have got to get close enough to the other person, touch the other person,
be linked with the other person, in order to see whether you breathe okay with
them. How many people say, when they step out of a place they've been
uncomfortable in, they say, “I can finally breathe now?”
The emotional system is always unhealthy if it doesn't know how to breathe
properly. It's always an indication that there is chaos going on in the emotional
system. So, when you are dealing with the tribe, one of the things to see is that
the root of our mysticism is learning how to breathe in unison. That's why so
much of tribal spirituality is built around chants, and ultimately prayers, where
everybody is in the same breath pattern together. It's actually mystical. It's
why we can be moved by harmonies, for example. All of a sudden, this coming
together of different qualities, different tones, and this beauty that is possible
when all of the breathing is in unison.
Gate 19 — Flirting for the Right Principles
So, the first thing to be clear about the 19-49, is that the 19 needs to have
somebody in their life they can breathe with. Now, the 19 is flirting. And the
19 is flirting for the right kind of principles. One of the things about that
flirting is that it has become a whole ritual for us, to try to get access to the
breath without having to make a commitment. Just sort of flirt with it, and
check it out. It's why human beings are so sensitive to aroma, and why you
Projected Channels and Circuitry 159
have a vast multi, multi, billion dollar industry in providing artificial scent. It's
vast.
Remember that the tribe is concerned with two basic things. Whether they can
touch somebody, this is the emotional side. And whether they can smell
somebody, this is the splenic side. Those two things are fundamental. You can
be a wonderful flirt at a distance, but if you get up real close and you don't like
their breath—and it doesn't mean just the smell. All of us, without recognizing
it, are very, very conscious of how people are breathing who are standing in
front of us. All of us. And how easily we get into other people's breath trips
and start breathing like them.
The Six Mystical Pressures of Gate 19
The pressure in the 19th gate is the pressure for six different, archetypal,
mystical processes. Every pressure gate (in the Root Center), all nine of them, are
very, very important and can all be seen in the way in which they pressure fifty-
four different varieties of things for us to be doing in this life. They just do.
The 19th gate pressures us in many, many ways.
If you're the first line, for example, it pressures you to be in awe of community,
of the other, and of God. And that awe begins the moment the 19 can put a
seed in the ground, watch it grow, and eat the fruit. That's awe. Wonder.
Absolute wonder. Not only is it provided, but one can collect it, store it, keep
it, and not go hungry.
We forget, most of us, in western society that ‘not go hungry’ is an incredibly
important theme in the world. It is still a dominant theme for most of the
world. Most human beings spend their lives doing nothing else but making
sure that they have something to eat, and are in a horrendous dilemma if they
don't. So, this 19 pressure is a pressure to have food resources available.
Now, all of these pressures that come out of the 19, they're just pressure. And
they're not pressure to pressure a spontaneous awareness. They’re pressure to
start a wave. I have the 49, and when somebody hooks up my emotional
system through the 19, they start a wave in me. In the moment that they turn
on my Solar Plex, I'm starting off in a certain place. And as long as they’re in
my aura, or as long as the transit’s in my aura in that way, I'm going to go
through its wave pattern.
111166660000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Gate 49 is the Most Savage
Now, think about the 49th gate. The 49th gate is the most savage of all gates.
This is the gate of revolution. This is where the principles are established that
say, “This is how we can accumulate enough food. This is how much we need,
this is how much you get, and this is how much you don't.” In other words,
the 49th gate is the gate of the sacrifice or the sacrificer. You see, the 19 is very
happy that there’s sheep in the field. The 49 has to kill it. And because the 49
does the killing, because it is its principle—and I know so many 49 butchers—
because the 49 kills it, it’s the principle: the 49 decides who can eat of it. Who
gets the leg, who gets to eat the entrails.
It is the gate of rejection or acceptance. And as such, in the sexual sense, it is a
gate of marriage and divorce. So, you've got to be a good flirt. And the 49
goes through their wave. Now, think about the nature of the revolutionary
when they’re down in their wave and they don't wait to be clear. Think about
the idea of sacrificing when you're down in your wave. I know, I've sacrificed
things very dear to me out of emotional conditioning. It is astonishing how
cold the 49th gate can be in its rejection, and how warm it can be in its
acceptance.
The Quantum of the 19 and 49 — Laying on of Hands
Now, when you bring the quantum of that together, what you have is a
projected field of sensitivity. These are very, very sensitive people. They are
incredibly sensitive to what you say. Whether you say something nice about
them or not, they are going to be sensitive to it. It doesn't matter. They're just
incredibly sensitive. They need touch, and they know things better through
touching them than through seeing them. They're the kind of people that can
do very, very complex work without actually looking, because they can feel it all
in their fingertips.
This is where you get the laying on of hands. This is some of the magic that is
in the mystical of the 19-49, to be able to reject the demons in the body, or
whatever you want to call it. Exorcisms. Through the touch. The hand is a
symbol of the tribe. The hand is very, very important to the tribe, which is
why, in most primitive societies, one of the most powerful punishments was to
cut off the hand. To be able to greet each other tribally and make contract
physically with each other.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 161
Tribal Eating Process
Now, the most important event in a 19-49's life is eating. It's better than
screwing. It's better than making money. The tribe is at its most spiritual when
it's eating. You see, this is the first, real, religious ceremony. The food is given
by forces far beyond the capacity of those who grow it to understand. And the
sharing of the bounty, and the sharing of it together; and more important than
that, if everybody eats at the same table, their shit smells the same.
Well, it's true. And the moment you have that, that’s the moment you accept
somebody into your life. You know what it's like, that you have a lover and
you end up living together. You both end up having to change your smells.
You have to. You have to find a common aroma, and that aroma becomes
you, it becomes your children, and you smell different than the people next
door. Never forget how important smell is for us. And by eating at the same
table, you are truly the same tribe. You're not one of them garlic eaters. We
have so many pejoratives for what people eat—it’s incredible.
It’s very important to recognize the value of food in your mystical process, and
one's relationship to food. The moment you have the 19-49 is the moment you
have the ability to be able to act as a sacrificer, and as such, that’s the opening
up of our whole spiritual process. One thing is the bounty of the food that
comes to us that we gather, and the other is the bounty of our own ability to
control and to kill our food. Human beings are incredibly good at that.
The Trans-Speciel Connection
Isn't it ironic that in the trans-speciel connection between mammals and
humans, that all mammals have the potential of the 19th gate, and therefore can
connect to the human 49. And you see, the animal in need of food, the 19’s
need, can find a principle in the 49 that allows it to have easy access to food.
After all, we feed our sheep, and our cows, and our chickens. They get what
they need. They're not clear, particularly, about the bargain. But they get what
they need. And then we kill them.
And of course, because it’s emotional, we feel guilty, even though we're hungry.
We get to feel particularly guilty because these things live in our backyard. We
get to experience them. We get to see them being born. We get to see our
children play with them. And then we see them for dinner. And of course, the
111166662222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
only way we can do that, being the imaginative types that we are, is by exalting
them.
We still live in a zodiac that’s dominated by animals. Taurus is supposed to be
the most exalted of all the constellations because according to the ancient
mystics, the whole solar system is actually in the Taurus near the eye of the
bull. And of course, we love our cows, don't we? I do. I had steak last night
for dinner. I love the fact that cows are around. And at the same time, I'm
quite willing to pay my respects to the cow's spirit. That's what the ancients
did. They honored them. They recognized, at some level, their personality
consciousness, and we turned them into gods, and we turned them into things
that we honored, and everything was terrific, and we could go on killing. It's
very nice.
I would not want to spend each day having to worry about what I was going to
shoot for dinner. We've been there. We have done that. It's nice to be done
with that process. There are other things going on in the world. So the 19-49
has this quality in which eating and killing are deeply related. This is the
backbone of the tribe. The backbone of the tribe is, if there is not enough to
eat, we will kill. Backbone of the tribe. Not enough to eat, we’re going to kill.
And we will kill what we need to eat.
Now the collective can come in there and say, “Now, that's not very civilized.”
However, as long as the collective isn't going to fill up the refrigerator, the tribe
is going to continue to react in that way. And just about every war that
humanity has every fought is over food. I like Napoleon’s joke: an army runs
on its stomach. Yes, that’s true. But you don’t go to war unless you need to fill
that stomach in the first place, because that's what drives us. To make sure that
there are enough resources, to make sure that everybody's got a chicken in their
pot. And the tribe will kill for that. It would rather sacrifice than kill.
You take a tribe and you give it what it deserves—health, education, protection
of its language, its culture, its native home—it's not going to be aggressive. It
just won't. Oh yes, there are always going to be anomalies that are very, very,
rare, because that is the essence of what the tribe is looking for. We do not
have the equitable distribution of resources; that does not exist. So we still end
up in deep tribal conflicts that are about resources; basics. It's fundamental to
our nature.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 163
Not only that, even when we kill the enemy, at least traditionally, we exalt the
enemy in the same way we exalt the slaughtered animal. In most primitive
societies, the enemy that you kill is honored. It's built into the tribe, and it's
always the other. The tribe has that wonderful formula: me and my cousin
against the stranger. Me and my brother against my cousin. And me against
my brother.
Tribal Loyalty Breaks Down When There is No Food
This is the tribe. It lives out these very, very strict lines of loyalty. And loyalty
breaks down between the cousin and the stranger when there is no food. And
loyalty breaks down between cousins when there is no food. And loyalty
breaks down between the cousin and brother when there is no food, and so
forth and so on. This is when there is really trouble. After all, the tribe has to
eat. Everything about the connection between the Root and the emotional
system is about food. It's about food. It's about food before it's about sex,
which is why sex and food often get mixed up. Or why people like to play with
food while they’re having sex.
They get mixed up, because they are basically in the same thing. But it starts
with the food. The tribe needs to know that food is available. The individual
doesn't know whether they want to eat, or not, because if they don't have a
passion for the food, why bother? And the collective is just looking for a food
experience. They want to go from hungry to full, and they don't care how they
get there. Usually ends up as junk food. But it can end up as chocolate
covered spiders. Blah.
Isn't it funny? Isn't it funny that we don't eat insects? No, really, I'm not really
crazy, it's okay. Isn't it funny? We eat fish insects, like shrimp. But, when it
comes to insects—and, of course, they’re full of protein—we don't eat them.
It's just interesting, eh?
Well, American Indians, I mean all kinds of societies all over the planet have
lived on grubs when they had to, and some of them have even turned it into
art. But, it's just fascinating that human beings are, in the collective sense,
repelled by such an idea. It's just fascinating. Yeah. Anyway. Speaking of
food experiences, that was my 41 trip for the afternoon.
And the moment you understand the way these three different ways of our
relationship to food work, you also have to condition that with that goes
through the wave. The hope that there’s enough food available as a resource,
111166664444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
to the pain that there might not be enough or you don’t get in on it because
that’s in the 19-49.
Individual Eating Process
The melancholy that comes into the individual process when eating is a
substitute for trying to get out of your melancholy. You eat to try to give
yourself pleasure and you become huge, or bulimic, or you go the other way.
You fall out of love with eating. These are people that think that eating is
aesthetically ugly. They don't want to eat.
I know that feeling. I've had very long fasts and you get to a point where you
really do think that eating is an ugly thing. It is, by the way. It's horrible. If
you haven't eaten for three weeks, go into a restaurant and watch people eat.
It's like, ah! God! Get me out of there! I'm a carnivore. That's quite an
experience.
Abstract Eating Process
Think about the wave and the abstract. When you're dealing with the wave in
the abstract process it's about the obsession, or the fantasy of what you could
eat. “I wonder what it tastes like to eat fried snake.” It tastes like chicken. It's
one of those favorite jokes I have whenever people talk about weird food. You
always hear somebody say, “It tastes like chicken.”
Tribal Sexuality – Reliable Resource
When you see all of that in sexual terms, don't laugh too hard. When you see
that the tribe needs sex, it needs it as a resource. In other words, it needs to
know it's there, and it needs to know it’s reliable. It needs it as a resource. And
it’s ready to honor anyone who makes that possible as part of the bargain. And
of course, given that it's the tribe, there is always some kind of sacrifice
involved. One wants to do it nine days a week and the other one once—
whatever the bargain is that the tribe works out in its wave. And its wave is,
“Do I accept or reject this?”
Projected Channels and Circuitry 165
Individual Sexuality - Passion
When you get to the sexuality of the individual, there is no sexuality without
passion. There is none. And we'll see, tomorrow, when we look at the way
the channels work, that that passion is something that has to be stoked as a fire.
And so you can have people that over-stoke.
You can have all kinds of instantaneous,—these are people that can fall in love
every twelve seconds, like bulimics and vomit it out the next morning. Or they
can be sexually anorexic, totally useless, uninterested, dis-passionate.
Collective Sexuality - Experience
At the collective level, sex is only an experience. It's a way to bring relief to
a hunger. And it is only for the relief. And, of course, that operates in a wave
of hope to pain. The hope that it will be a relief, and the pain at the end that it
isn't. That you've just had another experience, and you're going to get hopeful
again, very soon.
The Emotional System Runs Food, Sex and Breath
The emotional system runs these two absolutely essential ingredients in what
we understand as being human. Food and sex. And it's food and sex and
breath, all together. The moment we see food and sex and breath all together,
that all operate according to how the wave operates, then you have to see that
by living out the authority that’s there in your emotional system, by not
jumping, by not being spontaneous, by respecting that there is no truth in the
now for you, by stretching as much as you can your decision making
timeframe, then all of those aspects become healthier, naturally healthier.
You see, the illness of the splenic system is one thing, but emotional illness
always comes out in those two primary areas. They come out through food
and they come out through our sex. And if you are going to have sexual
dysfunctional problems, they are going to be rooted in the Solar Plex. And if
you’re going to have food dysfunctional problems, they are going to be in the
Solar Plex.
Obviously, we're going to have differences between the defined and undefined
Solar Plex and how it responds to this, but I want you to grasp the larger theme
of this. And remember that through genetic continuity, anything you do will
111166666666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
help it work. If you have somebody who has the emotional system hooked up
through one of these three channels, that are having sexual difficulties, you
don't have to send them to a sexual therapist. You can send them to a breath
therapist. Just learning how to breathe properly will bring relaxation, and will
bring a whole different nature into their sexual life. You don't have to go to
where you think the problem is. There are many levels in that.
Many people, for example, with a sexual problem or a breathing problem, can
have that corrected through diet. Because what we call diet is all there
operating as themes in the emotional system. Now, we don't have enough 21
dieticians, because that is what we need. Only 21's have the capacity to be
really successful dieticians, and to be able to help people to be able to deal with
their emotional nature, or lack of emotional nature, through what they eat.
So, when you're looking at the Solar Plex Center, you can see that in each of
these layers we can look at—sexual or food or the breathing or the emotional
wave itself—that any one of them can be useful as a way of guiding people to
be healthy. And any one of them can be become the focus point of
understanding how it can become healthy if they’re living out their Type. Now,
of course, this is all projected.
The 19-49 projects that a bond can be made, but that may or may not be true.
And the 39-55 projects that it is in love with something, or someone. It may or
may not be true.
The 41-30 projects that it's going to gain something positive from a potential
experience; that may or may not be true.
It's projection.
Those aspects need to be invited, and they are truly designed for that. That
energy they represent is always calling invitation. 19-49s are always going to be
invited to the table. The invitation is always going to be there.
What I want to leave you with is this funny business of how the tribe functions
for us. We have to be busy about our material life. It’s the program. And at
the same time, we cannot be busy about our material life until we know how to
deal reliably with the other. The easiest way for us to find communion with the
other is through touch and smell. We need that. We need the access, in that
Projected Channels and Circuitry 167
sense. And what is most mystical to the tribe is the ability to have larger and
larger and larger groups come together in celebration that all belong to the
same tribe. This is the most mystical part of the tribe.
Whether it's a Sunday gathering in a church, or a New Age rave party under a
full Moon, it all carries the same magic. It carries the magic of everyone into
the same food, the same taste, the same pleasure, the same breath. And the
shared abundance is then obvious. If you are very rich, and you live alone, the
abundance is never obvious. You open up that refrigerator, doesn't mean
anything. All of us know the potential beauty of sitting at a big table with a lot
of people you know. It can be a very, very beautiful experience. It is the
essence of tribe.
One of the nicest things about all of you coming out here to Taos on these
occasions is having the opportunity in the breaks in the time off to be together,
to eat together. To come together in that tribal communion. That's tribal
mysticism. This is how all of our gods and godheads are celebrated, through
festivals of food and celebration.
How Tribes Collapse
So, without the abundance, the tribe can't celebrate. And if the tribe can't
celebrate, it becomes spiritually weak. It's just what goes on in our world.
Tribes collapse.
I had this astonishing image of Basque country in northern Spain, and I was up
in some small mountain village, maybe a hundred stone houses, hundreds and
hundreds of years old in a magnificent setting. One of the more beautiful
places I've ever been to. More than half of those houses had been empty for a
generation.
There was nothing to do in that little village. And so, they left the village, the
children left the village. They went to the big cities, they went to Bilbao, they
went to all of the big places. Astonishing sight to see this emptied out beauty.
Not enough resources. Not enough shared abundance. Not enough tribal-
logic or tribal-splenic people to build the right institutions, to build the
factories, to keep the children at home, to keep the tribe alive.
It's one of the things that is slowly destroying the tribe throughout the world.
It's a third world and fourth world phenomena. Whole villages literally
111166668888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
emptying out. Traditional ways of life, lost. There is a great destructive quality
that takes place when there is not shared abundance. And the shared
abundance for the tribe that underpins the stability of the world is in the hands
of the 19-49's. In the end, they are the ones who decide what resources are
available and who can get them. Right now, the tribe is deeply fighting the
collective over who gets them. The collective is winning. The global economy
is winning. It's stripping all of that tribal economic power away.
Backlash and Retros
We live in a time of great backlash. That's why we have all this fundamentalism
in the world. It's a time of great backlash. And the backlash is in the spirit.
The backlash is in the direction that the tribe is being forced to look at. The
direction of giving up their unique behavioral codes. The pressure is now on
the tribe to give up its unique gods. And the result of that is more diversity
than we've ever had before as a backlash. And more retros than we could have
ever imagined: mystical retros, religious retros. They’re all over the place as a
backlash. Very, very important time.
Remember that the theme we’re living in globally—it includes the 40-37—
comes to an end in 2027. I guarantee you, one way or another, by 2027 this
question will be resolved. Either the collective is going to fail in its collective
process,—and it can, by the way. It just means that the collective will break up
into schisms, what we called the Cold War once where you had two great
factions and a large neutral third element. It does not mean the collective is
going to win. But we will know, one way or another, by the end of this cycle,
because this is the opportunity that we do have. That’s why there is so much
backlash. That is why so much of the tribal diversity is being homogenized
into the collective. That’s why we have these strains.
The 19-49s in the world today give us an opportunity in 2027, the mutation of
the emotional system will also bring a mutation to the way in which we see the
sharing of resources, how resources are distributed, and who truly has a right to
get those resources. This is the nature of the 49.4 that's about human rights.
It's called platform, fundamental human rights. It is an essential thing to see
that that is the evolution, and the evolution begins with: don't interfere with the
tribe's food, and don't interfere with the tribe's sexuality. Then it's going to be
easier for the collective to be able to deal with the tribe. Don't mess with those
things. And then it's possible.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 169
The Individual 39-55 — The Next Major Mutation
The 39-55 is the Grounding Place of Mutational Energy
So, we're going to return to our emotional, adrenalized
processes. And we're going to look at the 39-55, the
Channel of Emoting, design of moodiness. The stream
of moodiness, this whole stream of emoting that goes
from the 39 to the 12, this is the most important
mutative place in the circuitry.
The only way that the individual is able to pass on their
mutation is to be able to pass it on to the tribe. It’s
easier for the individual to have impact on the
collective, but it’s never productive in and of itself. The
collective will find the individual interesting but they
will stay with their collective Solomon’s world of
nothing new until they’re forced, either through experiencing it or through
experimentation, to accept its mutative validity.
But the real way in which
mutation takes place is in the
relationship between the
individual and the tribe. And
that relationship is grounded
through the emotional system.
Major evolutionary mutations of
humanity have always, always been completed through this stream. It’s why in
my design that I have the 12th gate so I can articulate the principle of mutation
to the emotional system. It’s all about the mutating that takes place through
the emotional system.
Gate 55 — The Next Sixth Line Mutation
The Solar Plex Center is fertile ground for mutation. The next major mutation,
the mutation that will begin to take place in 2027, is going to be the mutation
that's going to be in the 55th hexagram. And it's in the 55th hexagram in the
sixth line. This is the time for sixth line mutations. The first sixth line
mutation was the discovery of Uranus and the step into the Rave body. The
sixth line mutation means that we are at the end of our process. In other
111177770000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
words, the time that's remaining to us, until we get into the 32nd century, we are
going to remain in sixth line themes. We are now on the fence, or we are
approaching the fence, that our universalizing can only come after the fence.
Remember that the precession of the equinox goes backwards.
Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix
So, the 55 has special significance. When we step fully into the next cycle,
when we step fully into the right angle of the next cycle, we will have the
configuration of the 20-34 and the 59 and the 55. And this cross is called the
Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix. That Sleeping Phoenix is the 55th gate. There
lies the mutative, genetic potential in humanity to awaken to emotional
awareness.
The fact that we refer to the 55th gate as a gate of spirit is to recognize that until
2027, it is no such thing. It is a gate that yearns for that, dreams of that, is in
love with that. Is in love with feeling. Is in love with feeling the spirit,
knowing that the spirit is present. It is a deep passion. It is our passion play.
Without the awakening of the Phoenix spirit in the 55, we have a gate of
fickleness, and this is the nature of the moods. The 55 is fickle. “She loves me,
she loves me not. I love her, I love her not.” It's fickle. In the mood one
moment, the spirit seems to be there. In the mood the next moment, the spirit
seems to be gone.
The 55th gate is the gate of the glass by your bed, and some mornings it's half-
empty, and some mornings it's half-full. There is no true spirit there yet. And
the closest we come in the emotional system to spirit can be found in the 55th
gate when it lives out its emotional authority. When it finds clarity.
Gate 39 — Provokes the Spirit
The pressure that is on the potential to be clear about the presence of spirit,
this is all provoked. The 39th gate of obstruction. This is all about provoking
the spirit. Most provoking of the spirit works from negative. The pressure that
sits in the Root Center pointed towards the emotional system, that pressure is
not just pressuring, it’s trying in a sense, through its pressure to attract exactly
the right harmonic on the other side. And because it has a program, the 19
flirts, the 39 teases, and the 41 fantasizes. Remember that I’m speaking of that
in terms of not words, not language, not awareness, but in terms of the aura in
Projected Channels and Circuitry 171
somebody else. The aura that carries these three gates
does a lot of talking. It’s very powerful.
The 19 steps into your aura, and whether they’re flirting
with you or not, that’s what you think they’re doing.
Feels like that. Not only that, but you find you’re flirting
with them. The 39 teases you. Now that’s the nice side
of provocation. Being a 12, and being able to articulate that stream, I’ve
learned to recognize how easy it is to provoke people with sarcasm. It’s so easy
to provoke them and see whether they can take it.
And of course, there are some people that I cannot tease, because they cannot
take it. It feels negative. Sarcasm feels very painful to a lot of people. They
take it seriously; it’s a provocation. And of course when I tease somebody, or I
provoke them and they take it seriously, well, I know they don’t have the spirit
for me. That’s all. It’s built into that. So that provocation can be a tease, both
positively and negatively, just as the flirting can be. There are many people
who flirt without any intention of ever having that flirtation end. In other
words, it ends in a vow of obedience. They would rather just keep on flirting.
It means that their flirtation is, in a sense, a lie.
All of the pressures out of the Root to the emotions, they’re all provocative.
That’s what they’re there for. They’re there truly to provoke. Remember that
the whole mutative process of the emotional system is dependent on the 55-39.
It is what will change the emotional system. And it will change the emotional
system because, in bringing awareness to the Solar Plex, provocation isn’t
necessary. You see, somebody who has an aware Solar Plex Center is always
going to be able to recognize the right spirits. Always. It’s why when that
generation comes into the world, they’re going to be very inclusive. They’re
going to seek out each other.
There’s a tremendous amount of mutative energy in the 39-55. And it is
operating in the individual wave. That means that if you wake up in the
morning and the cup is half-full, the cup may be half-full for a very long time.
And yet, at the same time, because individuals are comfortable with the same
thing, are comfortable with what works, they will go along in that space and
you really will not notice how profoundly deep, for example, it could be in its
trough. In other words, because they don’t go up and down a lot, you don’t get
this sense of variation in them that says to you, “Yesterday they were in a good
mood, today they’re in a bad.” You don’t notice it as much. Tribal people, you
111177772222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
notice it all the time. Collective people, it’s obvious. But the reality is that
when you’re looking at the individual, it’s hard to tell. They know, inside.
Individuals Do Not Show Weakness
Remember that individuals are very personal. So they hold a lot inside. And
because they’re designed not to be influenced, they don’t want to show
weakness. They don’t want to show their difficulty. They don’t want to show,
like the typical 43-23 mind that gets into something and really does not know
what to do, and still doesn’t ask because it’s a sign of weakness.
So at the emotional level, the emotional individual, only if you’re somebody
who’s attuned to the breath of another person can you tell that an individual is
really messed up emotionally and suffering. Because it’s in their breathing and
nothing’s more important to the development of the individual emotional
system than proper breathing. Their impact is that they bring a vast,
melancholic wave by not being able to access the spirit. They can suffer from a
deep unhappiness.
Teasing, Romance, Love, Passion, Fire
I’ve already mentioned that when we’re dealing with the various levels of the
Solar Plex Center how important it is to see the association of food and sex to
the nature of individuality. And to recognize that the abuse or misuse, or the
great pleasure in food and sexuality is possible through this channel. Yet at the
same time, all of that has to be rooted in the romantic tradition. Individuals
can’t do anything unless they can fall in love with it, unless it is a passion for
them. This is the sexual strategy that’s inherent in the 39. This strategy of
teasing, to tease not to get consummation, to tease in order to create passion, in
order to build a fire. They’re great builders of fires, these 39s.
And you see that the way in which that fire is going to burn is going to be
conditioned by the 55th gate. This image of the Phoenix, the burning, the rising
from the ashes—it is the rising from the ashes we’re waiting for because right
now it’s all burning ground. This is a place of great suffering.
I have always recognized and empathized with the inherent emotional suffering
of 39-55s. I know many, many, many of them. And almost all of them that I
know, it’s a split. It’s a projected element that needs to be recognized. What
Projected Channels and Circuitry 173
needs to be recognized is the spirit inherent in the living 39-55. They’re putting
out their individual, melancholic wave. They have a profound impact as
outsiders, freaks, and strangers when the low end of
their emotional melancholic wave is put out into the
public domain.
See, one of the reasons that 39-55s end up with
problems with food and sex is that so often in their
life, when they’re young, they get ostracized. I know
three women with the 39-55 who were heavily abused
as children. Considered outsiders and their heaviness led to all kinds of
therapeutic attempts to heal these poor things. Didn’t do any of them any
good.
The 39-55 Child
The most important thing for a 39-55 child is the way in which you treat food
in their life. These are children that must never eat other than when they’re
hungry. It’s one of the most essential things. You notice how I’ve described to
you that the Root-Splenic connection’s need to exercise. On the other side, on
the emotional side, you have to see that the emotional adrenaline system is
about providing the right kind of fuel for that exercise.
Health is All about How You Eat
The Solar Plex is all about eating. And because it’s always about eating, it’s also
about digestion. It’s also about the way we process food. And nothing’s more
fickle than the 39-55 who says, “I will not eat carrots,” or this or that or
whatever the thing may be. “And that the only thing I want to eat is Pirate
Puffs six times a day. Cause I like them. And they taste good, and they make
me feel full.”
And of course, the parent with a child like that will not put up with it. They
don’t. They punish them, in a sense. They say to them, “No, you can’t have
this. It’s not good for you. Maybe once in a while as a treat.” And then you
get people who end up being binge eaters if you have a deep enough scar that
you inflict on them. And then because they’re guilty, because they weren’t
supposed to do it, then they vomit it out. Or the other side of that is, as an
111177774444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
individual, “You’re not going to let me eat what I want to eat, so I’m not going
to eat what you give me.”
These are fundamental, basic reactions to a lack of awareness in this channel.
And so instead of this being a deep and profound field for creativity, for music,
for love, for passion, instead of this pure passion for life, we end up with this
distorted, unhappy program. It is two very powerful motors that are connected
to each other. And again, the only way in which projected elements that have
energy, the only way in which they’re going to be healthy is, of course, they
have to be able to use that energy and use that energy efficiently.
We’ve seen that exercise is on the splenic side. But how you eat, and when you
eat, and how much you eat, and how well you eat, and how good the food is
for you is all on the emotional side.
One of the most important mutations that’s going to take place with the
mutation of the 55 is that ultimately it’s going to impact on the 40-37. It’s
going to change the emotional bonds between us. It’s going to change the way
in which the bargain works. And it’s going to change our stomachs. In other
words, one of the by-products of the genetic mutation of emotional awareness
is that those children are going to have a different kind of dietary need.
Obviously, something associated with being able to support that new
awareness.
The Genetic Mutations Impact Different Areas
Nothing is simple. It’s not like Human Design science fiction. The genetic
mutations that take place operate at many levels and are going to impact on
many different areas. In some areas, they will not impact at all. The mutation
that takes place in the emotional system is not going to impact on the 41 to the
35. Till the end of humanity that stream is going to remain unaware. It is the
mechanical program that’s taking us through our human experience and we’ve
not finished our human experience until we finish it. But it does mean that the
individual and tribal aspects of the emotional system are going to become
aware, and they’re going to be become aware in sequence. Until ultimately, the
whole emotional system, with the exception of the experiential stream, is going
to be aware.
The last gate to become aware is the sixth gate. It is the most complex. And
because it carries within in it the seed of the stream of feeling, there’s an aspect
Projected Channels and Circuitry 175
of the 6 that will be discarded. This is really the place in which turmoil is
natural.
The Cross of Tension
The 38-39, along with the 48-21, forms the Cross of Tension. It’s the root of
tension. And the 39th gate brings a field of tension into this emoting stream.
The tension is the waiting for, in that sense, the mutation to take place.
Always. So, there is a deep tension that’s in this channel. And that tension is a
burning ground. Very, very important in working with individuality, and
particularly with emotional individuality, and that includes the 12-22. As
children, this recognition of the difference in the individual, the melancholy
individual, the moodiness, the food habits, all of these things need to be part of
the awareness of anyone who’s going to raise such a child.
Working with THE Adult 39-55
On the other hand, when you’re dealing with adults and you’re dealing with this
stream, it’s always difficult for them. It is difficult for them because there is
always a part of them that is eternally fickle until the mutation takes place.
There’s always a part of them that recognizes that the true spirit is not yet in
the world. That the true spirit is not yet in them.
My pitch to the 39-55s is to recognize that the more clear they are in how we
understand emotional clarity, the respect of the emotional wave, that they lay a
truly perfect foundation for the generation to come. And that the children that
are being born now, these children that are coming into the world, who have
been coming into the world for the last several years, who are going to be the
parents of these mutated children, that the 39-55s amongst them, for them to
live out their emotional clarity, for them to honor their emotional authority, is
going to lay a smooth foundation for the mutation to come.
Just as a side bar, there are many people who would take this kind of
perspective of the future and see that the emergence of this awareness is
something we are going to be excited about and it’s going to be an exciting
event in the world. Well, that’s what Hollywood would do and it’s not the way
it’s going to be.
111177776666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
One of the things that may make a difference—I do not know—is that with
the popularization ultimately of Human Design, there are an awful lot of
people that may come into contact with this kind of information, this kind of
detail about what’s coming. It may help lay a foundation. It may also do
something else. It may create as much tension as it would be designed to
alleviate.
That mutation is going to bring a form of humanity into the world that is
different than us. It’s different than us. And I don’t mean different in the way
that black and white are different. I mean different in the way that Cro-
Magnon man and Neanderthal are different. It’s going to bring a difference
into the world. And only those beings with a defined emotional system who
carry the mutation, they will only be able to communicate through that
awareness with others just like them.
What will actually happen to these children? And what that’s actually going to
look like? There are as many scenarios as there are imaginations. For me, it’s
clear: Given the duality of the world and given our history, that ultimately that
is a conflict. I think it’s the conflict that’s in Revelations. I think it’s the
ultimate great battle. Not that it will necessarily be colored in the goriness of
two thousand years ago. Those images are those images.
But in the formula of that, it is clear to me that that will be a great battle line
because they are truly going to be a different specie. And we have no idea
because we have no history. We have no collective memory of what happened
the last time. We can’t imagine what’s going to happen this time. Will they be
killed? Will they be aborted? Will they be placed in observation? Camps?
Anything is possible given the nature of humanity. It’s going to be very
threatening because they can communicate and will be able to communicate in
a way that we can’t.
We Can Help Build the Road for the Promised Land
So, when I talk about this change coming in 2027 and this movement of new
life into the world carrying a new genetic material for humanity, it’s going to be
uncomfortable for a lot of people, alienating for a lot of people. We have a
complex way in which we evolve. So, we’re at the edge of something. And
what we’re really at the edge of is this kind of human being that’s been around
for about 88 or 90,000 years. This model is coming to a finishing point. The
more that we recognize that we’re part of a greater genetic continuity, we can
Projected Channels and Circuitry 177
all see clearly that none of us here are going to enter into the Promised Land.
But we can help build the road. We can lay the foundation for the next
evolutionary step. And hopefully, by taking away the dogma of moral fear,
then in some way we can educate that next generation, that generation in the
world today that is going to carry these mutations, to recognize the gift, the
pleasure, the beauty of being the vehicles of living human evolution. Of
actually being able to live at a time in which you can see human evolution
come into the world. It can be at that level, a deep, global process.
However, not being an idealist, my assumption is that it will cause a lot of pain
for a lot of years. And it’s one of the themes that I’ve mentioned to you often
about the 59 theme coming. A 59.6 theme ultimately coming, to recognize that
infertility is going to operate at many levels. In other words, they will be able
to see genetically whether as a female you will give birth to one of these
mutative creatures. They may stop that. At the same time, it will be natural.
Many, many elements working together.
So we’re in a very beautiful phase right now. We get to see what it’s like to
complete a process. We get to see what it’s like to complete the understanding
of what it is to be us, only to be shocked by ongoing mutation. At the end,
when we got the pattern all set down—this is what a human being is, this is
what a human being does, this is the way a human being works—and then all
of a sudden we’ll get a whole new generation that changes the rules. This is the
beauty of the evolutionary process.
So the 55-39, this arm of the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix, it’s very, very
important to see that this is the mutative field. If we nurture the mutative field,
then it operates correctly. The real difference in the development is also the
presence of music. The capacity of all of us to be able to nurture our own
mutative process is by being able to recognize and treat correctly the
individuality in ourselves and the individuality in others. And the whole thing
about a 39-55, put music at the crib, that’s nice. It’s very good for them.
The 39-55 is going to operate correctly if it operates according to its Type and
authority. It’s one of the things to recognize about the nature of fickleness,
that fickleness means you must play hard to get. It’s essential. And emotional
authority dictates that. One of the things to recognize about our sexuality is
that inherent in the Solar Plex Center is this force of sexuality. At the same
time, it has a built-in capacity for restraint; you can wait out the wave. So, you
can wait for the clarity and this is essential in the individual process.

Their spirit is something that has to be invited out. “Let me fill up that glass
for you.” Doesn’t have to be half-empty or half-full today. And of course for
them it’s always a question of waiting.
The power between the Root and the Solar Plex is always very seductive, like
the power between the Root and the Spleen is also seductive. It’s seductive in
its feel-good. And the Solar Plex connection is seductive in its just pure basic,
primal power: food, sex.
The last mutation that we had in this stream was in the 12th gate. The mutation
of the larynx. And we’ve had all these mini-mutations in between, all operating
through this stream. If you can think of it this way, you can see that the 39-55
is the format of the mutative field. And when I say that, I don’t mean to
compare it to format energy specifically. I just mean that it is the grounding
place of mutational energy. Out of the Solar Plex system comes contagion. It’s
a line of the 30, the ability to move the energy. And so 39-55s bring a
tremendous fuel to the mutative, energy system. If you don’t have that stream
operating, it’s very difficult to bring mutation into the world.
Someone has the 39-55. And another has the 22, and another the 12. This is
the way these mutative processes work. And they have to be properly
energized through this emotional field. Because it’s only through the emotional
field, the ultimate work of the 12-22, to be able to find the emotional grace to
put the mutation into somebody else, and to put it into them as an emotional
energy, as a spirit.
Knowing Empowers and Feels Good
One of the first recognitions in my life was that ‘knowing’ made me feel good.
The spirit of knowing, and I've tried to bring that kind of joy in my life to my
students as a teacher, no matter what I was teaching. I always recognized that
how you feel about knowing, what knowing gives you as an inner experience, is
much more important than what you know. It's the joy of grasping something,
because it's the essential business of being human.
It is through this stream that the grace is possible, to bring the spirit to new
knowing, to excite people with new mutative knowledge. The 12th gate does it
very poetically, music to your ears, tells you, shares with you, and ultimately
empowers you with its knowing in order for you to feel good. That's its job.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 179
So if we nurture these children, if we help the adults recognize their Type and
the authority of the emotional system, then our mutative processes are going to
work better. And when I say that, that means that good mutations and bad
mutations will operate more efficiently. It’s not about it’s only going to be the
good stuff. Good stuff, bad stuff, who knows. Only time will tell.
All Life Pollutes — Always Has, Always Will
I still get absolutely apoplectic with laughter when I hear people talk about
pollution. I don't know what it's for. They have no idea what it's for. They
don't know if it's good or bad; it's all relative. You can like it or not like it, but
you have no moral idea whatsoever. You don't know. And the nature of our
environment, the atmosphere, that everybody will run around with their little
funny signs and all that stuff, that that atmosphere, for whatever we call it, is
essential as the environment to nurture the next step. We don't know. There's
no separation. All of that is connected.
The more incredible our minds, the more polluted the environment. It's all
connected. And the moment that you're standing around, they're saying “This
is bad, this is terrible, we have to stop this.” I look at these people as
abortionists. “Let's kill the baby. Let's interfere with the evolution. Let us be
God and decide.”
All life pollutes. Always has, always will. That's life. That is neither good nor
bad. That is the way it is. And the pollution of one specie, is the food of
another. We forget. We like to say there is only this good stuff over here that
we should have, instead of recognizing that the bad stuff over there is also
useful. It's just as useful. This is the vanity of human beings. It's not up to us
that we are what we are, building what we build, that puffs into the sky what it
does. This is a joke. See, the world is what it is. You can like it or not. That's
your right, but not for a single moment can you dare say that we're doing a
terrible job. It's not true.
Think about the psyche of the globe. The psyche of the globe is a psyche that
says, "This is a terrible place. Life's a bitch. We're a horrible specie. We've
ravaged the planet. We're destroying the future for generations." We don’t
have that many left. We're designed to burn out our environment at the same
time we burn out. That's the way it's supposed to be. It's not like we're making
that happen. We are it, happening. And when you bring that to your life, and
111188880000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
you can live that, then you can tell me you're a spiritual person and I won't
laugh at you.
We Only Have One Job
That's when you really see that we fit in. It is all correct. We only have one
job: to know ourselves. Nothing else. Nothing else. It's the only job we have.
It's the only purpose for us, relatively speaking, in our vehicles, in this run, is to
know how it works, and to accept how it works, and to be one in the process.
It isn't anything else.
The Collective 41-30 — Focused Energy on a
Single Experience
Multiple Waves in a Design
So, we complete this look at the Root to the Solar Plex Center through the 41-
30. A student asked me about the presence of multiple waves in people's
designs. As I've been describing to you, we have three
generalized waves that operate through the circuits: the
regular tribal wave, the plateau and spiking wave of
individuality, and then the slow rising plateau, and
then drop off the table wave of the collective. By
using those simple kinds of descriptions, if you string
them together, you'll see the result of multiplicity in
waves.
Gate 6 Waves — Line Binary Pairs
Now, by the way, the 59-6 cannot be used this way because the 59-6 carries in
it all three waves. That is the nature of gate 6, its
unique nature as being the source of the wave itself, Binary Pairs
that all of those are possible, and the only way that
Lines 5-6: Collective
you can really distinguish the wave in gate 6 is by
Lines 3-4: Individual
looking at whether it's operating in terms of its
Lines 1-2: Tribal
binary pairs. In other words, we know that the first
and second lines are fundamentally tribal, that the
third and fourth are individual, and the fifth and sixth are collective. Out of
Projected Channels and Circuitry 181
that, you can see what variations may be the most active out of the 6th gate, but
it leads to a lot of complexity.
It's going to take many, many years of research for people to be able to
understand exactly how all of the combinations of emotional waves operate.
Not only that they’re operating through basic differences in circuitry, but
they're operating through differences in terms of whether they resonate,
they're in harmony, or there's dissonance in the way in which the channels
that are defined are structured.
Combinations of Circuitry Waves
But at the very mundane level, if you have somebody, for example, who has the
individual wave, and at the same time, they have the tribal wave, you know that
basically what they are going to have is regular periods of spiking. In other
words, you will have that combination. And the other thing is there are
different ratios, which is why I didn’t necessarily want to get into it, but
nonetheless.
The moment you have the individual with the tribal, the individual tends to
mutate the tribal. In other words, it tends to influence the tribal so you get the
regular spiking in the tribal wave.
When you bring the tribal to the collective, and you have those two kinds of
waves operating, this is the most disruptive. That is, this is the regular wave
that crashes. And for tribal people this is very depressing, because they're not
used to that. They're used to a consistent cycle of going up and down; there is
no real smashing crisis.
When you bring the individual together with the collective, the individual
will mutate the collective wave. In other words, what it will bring is the spike
in any place within the collective wave. So, you can spike on the way going
up, you can spike on the plateau, or you can spike in the crash. Some people
will bounce out of a collective crash immediately, where other collective people
will just die when the experience has been consummated and it's over. Some of
them will just bounce right back, they'll spike up. Some of them will go so
deep after the crash. They'll spike even further down, or, as I said, that spike
can come anywhere in the process.
111188882222 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
Again, that kind of knowledge is not of value to you directly in terms of how
you relate to a client in giving a reading, obviously, because the most important
thing for somebody who is defined emotionally is that their emotional system
has been dictating their life.
They've been making decisions regardless of where they are in their wave, and
what you're there to deal with is to give them some clarity about the nature of
how that emotional system operates, how that wave operates, and how they can
take advantage of that by honoring that authority according to their Type.
Then the nuances of that, which are fascinating to investigate, and I'm sure that
there will be people for centuries who will busy with all that stuff. That's great
for whatever it may eventually mutate into as applicable knowledge, but the
main theme for us is the recognition of the incredible power and influence of
the defined emotional system, and how it can blind us, and how important it is
for the emotional being to recognize it, to honor it, to respect it, and get the
advantage of its clarity.
One of the things never to forget about the emotional wave is that if you can
truly wait out the wave, that is the inherent profundity available to the Solar
Plex, other than being mutated into an awareness. In other words, it’s the very
best you can do, so that's the real knowledge.
The Symmetry of the Splenic-Root Gates
All right, the 41-30. For years people have kept saying to me, "Shouldn't we
change the name of this
channel?" A design of focused
energy. It's a funny channel. It's
a funny channel.
Recognition. Symmetry. The
symmetry on either side is
beautiful to watch. Did you notice something about the,—it's often funny
what people don't see in a BodyGraph that they've been looking at for years.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 183
Did you ever look at the relationship between the Splenic gates and the Root
gates that meet in those three channels? Have you ever noticed that the Splenic
gates are 18-28-32, and those are all in a row in a wheel, in Libra? And did you
ever notice that the other side is the 58-38-54, which are three hexagrams in a
row in Capricorn? And that they are all square each other?
There is beautiful symmetry in the BodyGraph. It's there. It's like looking at
the other side and you see the 49, and the 55, and the 30, and they're all in a
row in Aquarius. And look at the other side. It's very funny. It's not the same.
You have the 19, the 39, and the 41. And it's not the same because of the 39.
Funny thing this 39-55. This mutative pressure. The pressure to mutate. It
breaks the whole symmetry.
Anyway, the 41 and the 30. That recognition is the same as judgment on the
other side, but it is not judgment that is fixed in the spontaneous moment, but
it's recognition that operates in a wave. And the spontaneous judgment is a
taste, whereas the abstract recognition is a feeling. Same stuff, just different.
And the feeling is something that is developed over the wave, and it's only
through that movement over the wave, that it gets recognized.
The 18 is Salt — The 30 is Sweet-Sour, Diabetes
The 18th gate is the gate of salt, and there's no opposite to salt. It's just salt.
It's the existential judgment. And on the other side is sweet and sour, the 30th
gate, because it's emotional. It's not just that thing. It operates in a wave. And
this is the flavor, if you will, of human experience. The flavor of human
111188884444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
experience is sweet and sour. I like sweet and sour meatballs. How about you?
The flavor of life. It's why there is a lot of diabetes here. Chocolate addiction.
These are people that have serious sugar rushes and can go crashing down after
that. Sugar gets its bad reputation from the 30th gate. It says that sugar brings
you up, and then it crashes you down and becomes sour.
The focus of energy in the keynote that describes this is
that the force that is coming out of the 41, the pressure
that's coming out of the 41, is the pressure to recognize
a single feeling. The pressure to fulfill a single
experience is why the energy is focused. It's focused
on this single experience. That's why the 30th gate can
be obsessive, deeply focused on having the experience,
and of course, this is the place of all desire.
I would love to have been able to see the chart of Saint Augustine. Here's
somebody that really hated sex. He really had a deep distaste for sex. He said
you weren't even allowed to enjoy it when you made children. This is
somebody who really didn't like sexuality. Whoa. And of course it's Sunday. I
should be nice to Saint Augustine.
The obsession with desire. It is the only experiential way. It's the human way,
to be desirous. And, of course, for desire you burn in hell for eternity. Jesus,
that's mean. I mean, really, considering we have no choice. We're designed to
be desirous, and then you have all these fools telling us that we're going to be
punished eternally for it. It's the cruelest form of masochism. And where do
you find masochism? In the 35th hexagram. Cruelest form of masochism, to
be condemned to eternal damnation for something we can never avoid. Ever.
Funny.
Fries Our Wiring
So, all desire is born out of the 41, and it is turned into desire by the 30. You
can understand why it's never going to be aware. Desire is an unbelievable
force; it's an unbelievable force. And you see, not every experience is of value,
though all experiences are necessary, and awareness would eliminate the ones
that are not useful but are actually necessary. It's a funny thing about
awareness, it can also be bad for us. Some things we cannot be aware of, and
it's unhealthy for us, fries our wiring.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 185
So, this bed of desire is going to take us to the end. I rather like that. You see,
it’s our way, and it's the only way for us, this yearning and burning for
experience. It's one of those addictions that humanity has, the expectation of
what the future will bring, like my little story this morning about what
emotional mutation may really look like. We have all kinds of expectations as
part of our human experience. And we have the desire for all kinds of things;
absolutely bizarre.
Jeffrey Dahmer
Have you ever seen a chart of birth data of Jeffrey Dahmer? I was surfing the
other night, and I caught a biography of
this human being. And he not only killed
people, but he ate them, he preserved parts
of them. He did all kinds of weird stuff.
And all of it, all of it, out of his own
description, all of that because of its sexual
arousal.
Jeffrey Dahmer
This is a 41 to 35 world. A world gone
mad, but it's a
world of desire that
can take on any kind of nature because it's not guided
by awareness. It's a very powerful field. The only way
in which the 30-41 works properly is when it's seen for
what it is as a projected element. In other words, that
the desire is something that has to be invited, that the
ability to be able to either generate or manifest the
desire is something that has to be initiated by others.
This is the essence of collective circuitry. In collective
circuitry you are there to share. Desires are there to be
shared. And they have the same importance to us as
the value of the 18-58 to be a constant field of potential challenge to false
authority. The 41-30 is the potential challenge to unknown experience. It's still
there in us.
I've watched some crazy people parachute onto the North Pole last night. No
one had ever done it before. They were worried jumping out of the airplane
111188886666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
because the wind chill factor was 250 degrees below zero, and they were told
their faces would crystallize and fall to the ground, which didn't happen. Down
below are all these Russians and Eskimos who have built a bulls eye on top of
the North Pole. Human beings, what are you going to do with them?
Their need to fulfill this desire in them for experience. We have so many
dogmas that punish that, and yet it is us. See, my concern is not with the
unaware nature of this stream. My concern is that if they understand their
Type, and that they give authority to the emotional system that is running their
lives, then the experiences they enter into are going to be valued for them, and
they are not necessarily going to be detrimental or punishing to the other.
It's not about being a victim to these desires. We try
very hard to eliminate the desire field. To control it. To
put a chastity belt on it. To keep the lid on it. Desire
rules us. It's part of the world program. And you can
see that it is deeply offensive to most of the dogmas that
run around. In other words, desire is always trying to be
given its specific little place, but beware of desire.
I’ve shown you that the beginning of our spiritual or religious process begins in
the 19. And when you jump over the 39 to the 41, you can see why. You have
the desire on one side and the desire goes to any kind of experience, for the
experience. And you have the tribe on the inside that can’t abide that because
it’s so disruptive to the tribal nature. You can't just go into your neighbor's
house and take his partner, just for the experience. It's going to destroy the
tribe. It isn't allowed to work.
You cannot give up your responsibility of the day to go off on your own and
muse, or whatever. There's a basic conflict between the spirituality that grows
out of our ability to survive together, and the collective desire that is ready to,
not simply break the rules of the tribe, but actually not even recognize that the
rules are even there, just to simply follow its desire.
So, right from the beginning, in the whole spiritual business, we have these two
sides of the story. We have the truth. Human beings are ruled by unaware
desire, and given that there's no choice, we're not here to control it. We're here
to accept it as a part of life, and our guide to life, and the tribe.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 187
The Tribe and Desire: Colonel Mihailović Story
See, the spirituality of the tribe,—C-SPAN last night. I watched the world to
watch the program. And Peter Arnett is
speaking, and he's a correspondent that's
been in a lot of war zones. And he was
describing his meeting with a man by the
name of Mihailović.
Colonel Mihailović is a first class butcher.
And he was the head of the Serbian Bosnian
armies. And at the time, there were reports
of mass rapes, and killings, and so forth and
Colonel Mihailović
so on. Arnett was walking in the street with
him, and he asked him about this. He described how Mihailovic's tone
changes, his face changed, and grabbed Arnett by his jacket, and he walked
along the street, and pulled him over where there was a whole row of buses,
and the buses were filled with Muslim women, bruised, dirty, a whole bus full;
it smelled like urine. They had been in the buses for a couple of days. And
Mihailović pulled Arnett in and he said, "They’re too stinky for us to rape."
That's the tribe for you. That's the way the tribe works. The reality is that the
tribe has a hard time with desire, the desire to be great when you're born small.
The desire to be rich when you're poor. The desire to be wise when you’re a
fool. All of those desires can get in the way of the operation of the tribe. And
that fundamental conflict within us is that at some point, when the tribal
emotional reality is awakened, it will recognize the unviability of our way, and
they'll stop all that nonsense about how bad desire is.
It's not about it being bad. It is the goad that pushes us along our human track.
It is our essential way to gather all experience. It has been essential for us
forever, to be ignorant of its carrot, and the expectation that comes with it. We
are meant to be an expected specie. We are meant to be able to look at things,
project through things. We're here to be able to follow our dreams. That's the
whole joke of the 41 to 35. It's the desire to fulfill your dream, to have your
dream come true. It's really human. It's schmaltzy as hell, but it's really human.
I have the 41st gate. I have the Moon there. And it's so clear to me that desire
has so many ways to appear, and how desire covers everything, everything.
And yet at the same time, out of the fantasy that grows out of desire, our
111188888888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
awareness ultimately is enriched. See, it can't be aware itself, but the human
experience is the food for our growing awareness. It's the meat of our growing
awareness.
The Secret to Desire
We need to be able to examine ourselves in the human experience. Given the
abstract way, that is its way, to be in the experience in order to be able to reflect
later, and in order to be able to gain wisdom out of that reflection, and pass it
onto coming generations. In order for the Solar Plex Center to be healthy, in
order for desire to be healthy, what you desire you have to enjoy waiting to
see if it's something you can eat. That's really the secret to desire.
I know that from the perspective of not being caught in the whole stream. Out
of the 41 are all the possibilities of desire, but because there are so many
possibilities, there is no expectation. The moment that it becomes a feeling,
those who are emotional through this stream, that waiting out their wave, that
honoring their Type is more important than for anyone else, because this is
conditioning whether our human experiences as a whole are going to be
correct. Because it's not aware, it has to be guided by awareness.
The 39—Deeply Mutative Left Angle Cross of Individualism
In looking at the symmetry between these two wings coming out of the Root,
you come back by looking at that to
the 39th gate. There's a left angle
cross that comes out of the 39, and
it's called the Left Angle Cross of
Individualism. This is a 38, 39, 51,
57. These are deeply mutative beings.
And you can see that it stands out in
the symmetry. It’s like it doesn't
really belong there. It only seems to
belong there when you see that it's
opposite the 38. And this is this
special connection that runs through
individuality, in which this mutation,
going directly across, is also an
opposition in the zodiac. This
Projected Channels and Circuitry 189
movement from the 38 to the 39. So, there's a very special energy there for the
mutative process, and for the coming mutative process.
Protecting Any Emotional Child
Whenever you're dealing with any child that is emotional, allow them the grace
of being emotional. That's number one. That means allowing them the grace
of being able to go up and down in their wave without you making them
responsible for your space. And slowly, because you cannot teach them right
away, and slowly teach them the value of what it means to wait before you
make decisions. I do that as a natural part of my own personal life dealing with
my children, or dealing with people that are in my life.
You can help people be themselves. Sometimes I say to my son if he wants a
toy or something. I'll say, "Do you know what you want?" And he'll say,
"Yeah. I want this, this and that." And I'll say, "Ok, well tell me tomorrow."
He's used to that from me now. And, of course, by the next day it's different.
Sometimes it isn't, but sometimes it's different. And when it's different I
always say to him, "See, it changed today. Are you sure? Do you want to wait
until tomorrow?" In other words, you can always nurture what is in somebody.
By doing that, you allow them to be much healthier human beings, and you
protect them from being deeply conditioned.
The G to the Throat — Our Global Identity
Channels 8-1, 33-13 and 7-31
To finish all of this, we’re going to go back up to the
Throat and we’re going to go from the Throat to the G
Center. We looked at the 8-1 when we began with our
creative process. But the 7 and the 31, and the 33 and the
13, I spoke about them in the beginning when we were
talking about the 8-1 and the way in which the G Center
and the Throat operate together. But there’s something
else, to be able to finish all this, that you need to know.
(Note: Channel 8-1 is discussed at length in the Creative Channel
book.)
111199990000 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
See, the 8-1 is busy being busy being mutative. It isn’t of any real sort of
comforting value when that is present, because it is very much different and it
is operating in its own empowerment realm. When we look at the relationship
of the channels that operate from the Self to the Throat, these are essential
expressions of our direction. It’s
only out of the recognition that these
three channels, as a global
perspective, that this is the place
where we get our world identity.
Our global identity and the global
identity of where we are and where
we’re going is established in this projected field. It’s rooted in the projection of
the 33-13 looking at human experience, and the 31-7 projecting the potential of
human experience into the future. Now it’s where we get our world identity.
And it is always a projection field.
We’re living in this constant illusion of our place in time, looking back, and at
the same time forgetting. Looking forward, and not completely being able to
see. It’s like we have a moving limitation field that’s always going with us.
Now, human beings are tricky. We collect memory, we store it collectively, we
share it collectively. So we have certain advantages in that our memory is fairly
deep. Our relative past, in terms of our own lifetimes, is relatively dense. But
everything about how we feel, about being in the world, and how that is as an
environment, or a propaganda environment, this is coming out of these two
channels (the 33-13 and 31-7.)
The 31-7 — Alpha Mutation by Lines
The Channel of the Alpha, we are coming to a 6th line mutation. We’re going
to have a 6th line mutation that is going to take place in 2027.
It means that all 6th lines are going to be, in one way or
another, resonating in the genetic continuity to that mutation.
All 6th lines. So some of you are going to be alive in 2027,
and the fact that some of you are going to be alive then is
your opportunity to feel the mutation in your own 6th lines
because it will be there. And the thing about a mutation is a
mutation is an on and off. You go along, it’s off, then you
spike and it’s on and it’s on.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 191
So think about the personality, and the personality of the globe and the way
that it sees its future. Its future is going to be seen through the 7.6, the eyes of
the 7.6, mutated.
When you start off in the leadership game, you start off at the 1st line and you
become an authoritarian, because this is the natural way. And out of that
authoritarian mutation comes many other mutations.
The 2nd line democratic mutation, which had to come in order for pair
bonding to succeed. Only in the beginning could there be one dominant force.
One of the first mutations was to open us up and make us democratic so that
we could have pair bonds that were relatively democratic.
The next development, 3rd line, the trial and error. Different kinds of
authorities, different experimentations in authority. Through that different
experimentation, all of that rooted in anarchy. The nature of anarchy is that
when you recognize that something does not work, you can destroy it. It
doesn’t mean you’re going to be able to replace it. But the anarchist says,
“Why let a bad institution stay alive just because there isn’t a new one to
replace it? Let’s destroy the bad one and hopefully new ones will come out of
that.”
The 4th line mutation is simply opportunism. What we would call capitalism.
Power through money.
The 5th line mutation is the general. That is, in a way, a return to the first. A
return to the stability of a dictator, but a practical
dictator. And a practical dictator only in an
emergency in order to protect the whole.
When you get to a 6th line, you’re standing above
the process. You’re sitting on the fence. And
the 6th line is the line of administration. The
only way there can be true leadership is if
everybody is deeply organized. And the ultimate
social change in humanity will be the level of
organization that is going to be demanded in the
future.

Not to sound too bizarre, but why not? I’m very impressed with ants. They
have been ruling the world since before the dinosaurs. They’re incredibly well
organized. On the social scale of life on the planet—and there are such things
that have been developed; it has a rating system—that on the social scale that
ants, wasps, and shrimp are the most socially organized specie on earth.
We’re going to go through a period of sterilization, infertility. We are going to
be at a point where we will have to create life artificially as a matter of course. I
don’t know what that does to motherhood and fatherhood.
There is a social organization that underlies the BodyGraph. The kind of thing
that makes people nervous when they think it will be in the hands of the CIA
or the FBI or god knows who else. Obviously, Human Design is about being
deeply organized, so that we function properly as a whole and that each aspect
not only knows its own nature, but its nature is recognized, and as such,
everyone can work in harmony.
I could pass for Hitler, sort of. I would have gassed all the Solar Plex people.
If I thought about what it would be like to live in such a world as I am
constituted now, I have a basic revulsion to it. The future is not mine. I don’t
belong to it; it’s clear to me.
But the reality is that we are going through a major closing-out cycle. And in
stepping into this 6th line of administration, it’s something to see clearly that
authority will have to be established through administration. And remember
that administration is rooted in the experience of anarchy. In other words, by
being able to recognize what doesn’t work, the potential wisdom of being able
to organize things so that they do work. Now that’s a powerful theme.
Our progression is to move from sheep following the leader, which is the basis
of the Alpha, to individuals who are all alphas in their own process. In other
words, the administration of self-authority. That’s the natural transition. Now,
of course, that’s not going to happen overnight and there are all kinds of things
that operate together that are going to create the environments for these things.
There’s this lovely old Japanese guy in Hawaii who clones things. He’s cloned
the clone of clones. He was interviewed and somebody asked him what value
his work was, this whole business about cloning humans. His comment was
beautiful. He said, “Well, all of these things, in-vitro fertilization, artificial
wombs, cloning. I’m sure they’ll be very useful in the future.” That’s all.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 193
That’s what they’re here for. That’s why it’s so difficult for any of us at any
time to make our judgment about what we think we see in the world and our
moral sound bite on that. There are so many people running around doing
that.
So anyway, when you’re looking at this 31-7, I want you to see that this is the
progression of the Alpha. This is the whole thing I talked about, in that the
real human way is the way to self-knowledge. This is the way. And of course,
the ultimate reward for that is that there is no longer, in that sense, an Alpha.
There is only an administrative order. That’s very different. To be clear about
that, that’s very, very different.
See, we go from being the behavior of humanity. If you follow the line of
evolution of the behavior of humanity and you start in the first line, the first
line’s there to be a chameleon. They don’t really know what it is to be a human
and how a human behaves. They’re going to have to live it out and see.
They’re going to have to be introspective. They’re going to have to see the
foundation of human behavior. At the foundation of human behavior was the
Alpha as pure authority: “You don’t know how to act, I do, follow me.”
When you get to the 10.6, you get to the role model. We’re going to have a
mutation in role model behavior. And because the 6th line is going to be the
theme, being a role model is about being the theme; that is, being an example
in your own life. No need for an Alpha. None. It’s like the magic that you can
see in the 33.6. See, the 33.6 is the line of completely letting go. Just letting go.
It’s my joke to be a ram, that I don’t like sheep. I’m so individual that the idea
that anybody has to be dependent on anything is astonishing to me. And this
whole business of being sheep is astonishing to me.
It’s why I love and have a passion for Human Design, because it empowers
human beings into not being sheep. Into discovering their power and their
beauty and their uniqueness and their own authority. And whether that
authority is specific or that authority is rooted in their Type, the reality is that
every single human being is a pillar of wisdom unto their own life. It’s a
wonderful thing to recognize that. That your life, your potential, your form,
your intelligence is rich.
Everybody has been telling us for so long that we are inadequate. One of the
themes of the world is inadequacy. The abstract part of us that is always
111199994444 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
yearning for experience, it’s never satiated, it knows, it experiences endless,
there are endless numbers of experiences, endless, endless, endless. And
human beings are astonishingly sad about what they are, what life is, what
they have to do in order to survive, in order to love, in order to do all of these
things. See, I enjoy being able to teach you all kinds of obscura.
However, every day that I go out into the real world, every day I turn on the
tube and surf around, I’m astonished at what’s out there. It’s quite incredible.
And the potential to be able to give people what they’re looking for. What
they’re looking for. You see, this 6th line theme that we’re moving towards,
you’re carrying the burden of that. That’s what it’s all about in terms of being
able to prepare the way to see the administration of things, to see the order, to
be able to share the pattern. The ability to be able to share the pattern sets the
foundation for the future. It will happen anyway, whether you want to or you
don’t. Don’t have any choice. The big wheel is still turning. It’s all in the
program. But there’s a real change.
It’s a Very Important Time to Know the Basics
Remember that where we are now is in a 1st line theme. Look at all the 1st lines
in your design, if you have them. You’ll see that that’s the only part of you
that’s really, really resonating to right now. I have ten of them. The 6th is alien
to me. I have a couple of them, that’s all. I won’t get to 2027, and it wouldn’t
be for me anyway. And before 1961, it was a 2nd line theme. And until 1961, I
had no place in the world. I have two 2nd lines, and one of them is in
deliverance, the gate of aloneness, so it’s like, leave me alone.
So we’re headed towards a 6th line theme and all of you, if you look at the 6th
lines that you have, through the eyes of those 6th lines, you can look into the
future. You’re sensitive to what’s coming. It’s like being a 6th line personality
or design in terms of profile. You’re looking ahead towards the mutation that’s
coming. Our job until 2027 is to finish the 1st line business, to really be able to
grasp the foundation of things before the mutation takes place. I’ve mentioned
that in global cycles, that the rapid intellectual development of humanity, that
its peak is 2027. That’s its peak.
If we don’t figure it out by 2027, they’re going to have to wait hundreds of
years before they’ll be able to take the next steps because that’s not going to
happen with a 6th line theme. It rarely does, just pockets. This is a very
Projected Channels and Circuitry 195
important time to know the basics. And in knowing the basics, to be able to
prepare the way for the administration of it. First, you have to be an authority.
This is the time for us, here on the planet, to find our authority, to find what is
authoritative. To be, as I have been, a messenger of what and where authority
really is. And you can only do this in a 1st line time.
What the 33-13 and 31-7 Say in Mutation
So in these two channels, see very clearly that the abstract side in mutation will
say, “We have to let go of the past because it won’t guide us anymore.”
Remember that. You’ve got a whole
abstract process. It comes to the 33-
13 in order to be clarified, in order
to become history, in order to
become memory. Then all of a
sudden you have an emotional
mutation that takes place through
the 6th line and nothing that was
reliable out of human experience
from the past is totally reliable anymore. Gotta let go. There’s a whole new
kind of experience that’s entering into the world.
On the other side is the movement the other way. In other words, that
influence recognizing that its role must change, and that the role is going to
change from the authoritarian to the administrator, going backwards. Giving
up being sheep.
You can see that in many ways in the modern work place where you have
people who very independently work alone, and yet are connected to an
organization via the technology. This kind of independence in which everyone
is their alpha, their own alpha. And that could only
happen through proper administration.
These are two major themes that are at work, and of
course, they’re intensifying. Our direction is going to
change. That’s what the mutation brings, and because our
direction is going to change, how we will want to express
ourselves will be guided by the 1.6 objectivity. You see,
the potential of the change in the program is the potential
victory of collective organization. That’s its potential.
111199996666 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
That potential is only going to work when the collective gives up its direct
authority. This is the whole thing about the collective. In modern
democracies, we all recognize that the party in opposition is more sensitive
to the needs of the people than the party in power. It’s always like that.
Except when they get into power, then the roles get reversed.
So one of the essential ingredients for us is that the way in which the collective
can win victory is not by being the boss, but by being the bureaucracy. That’s
all. By being able to administer all those individual alphas, and that
administration has to be objective in the sense that it’s going to have to follow
mechanics.
Now we all know that, of course, these things don’t happen overnight. They
are never more than 50% successful, 50% of the time. It’s the way mutation
works. So there’s going to be all kinds of processes at work over the next
thousand years or so. It’s nice for us to get to sit on the edge and watch the
foundation of that take place.
Course Overview
In looking at what we’ve covered over this course, for you to grasp that by
looking at the type of a channel tells you what you need to know about it. See,
everybody expected that a channel course was going to be like a lion course.
You know, I was going to go plowing through these channels and describe
them in minute detail the way they operate. That’s not what I did, because the
moment you understand the Type of a channel, you really have the basis of that
channel. It’s the opportunity to bring together, through all of that, quantum.
You know the essence of what it is to look at somebody’s chart and to be able
to see them. Because if you take all these bits and pieces and you string them
together, you have many, many ways now in which you can look at a chart, and
each way is the genetic continuity and a genetic truth. It doesn’t matter how
you look at it. You can look at it through definition. You can look at it as
Type, as authority. You can look at the profile. You will find that all of those
things fall together the more that you’re aware of each of them.
You know the most important meditation for you—if I can use such bizarre
language—when somebody puts a chart in front of your face, just look at it.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 197
Don’t talk. Breathe it in. Look at it. Look at it, just simply. Look at the
definition, grasp the Type instantly. Just see it. Look at the profile. Don’t
think about what it means, just notice it. Your mind knows what it means.
Notice all of these little things. Just notice them and look. And you see that
being is going to come alive in you. It’s just going to come alive in you.
Because the moment that you just noticed those different aspects, they are
linked together in the genetic continuity. They start speaking to you.
And then look to see not the beauty of what they are, but the confusion of
what they’re not. Look at the undefined centers. As you notice each undefined
center, imagine what it means to give false authority to that center. And then
you know them deeply. You know what they have been falling into all of their
lives. You know every pit and danger place for them. You just know.
And if you look to see whether their Throat is Splenic or Emotional, you’ll see
what kind of access you can get to them. Whether they’re going to be more
open to you, or whether they’re going to be more cool. Whether they’re ready
to see themselves, whether they’re not. It’s all things you can notice in a
moment. It’s not about putting pressure on yourself and looking at that and
saying, “What’s this?” It’s not about you looking at a chart and the moment
you look at it you get hooked on a single definition, you get hooked on channel
this to that, or channel this or that. Don’t jump in like that.
When I was giving basic trainings, I would talk to people about starting at the
Throat. Out of the Throat you can have your peripheral vision. But just look
at it and notice these aspects; notice them. You see that somebody is a
Generator. You know what that means. You’ve got all kinds of things inside
of you now that know that. You don’t have to talk about it with yourself.
“Aha, there’s a Generator, they got to wait to respond.” Don’t do that; just see
it for what it is. Okay. You recognize it.
You see there’s a defined Solar Plex Center. Instantaneously, you recognize
that you already know they’re in the wave; you know it’s their authority; there’s
no truth in the now; the whole program is in there. And then you recognize
that out of the nature of their Type that they’re an emotional Generator. The
moment you see that, then you know. There’s a formula. I’ve taught you the
formula. So the formula is there. And the moment you see that you got an
emotional Generator, you know they’re going to play hard to get. They have to
wait, they have to push away, they have to wait again. And of course, the
111199998888 CCCChhhhaaaannnnnnnneeeellllssss BBBByyyy TTTTyyyyppppeeee
moment that you see that, you know that people don’t do that. You just know.
The emotion is blinding.
You can look at the profile. It can tell you that their personality may be lower
trigram and self-absorbed. It may tell you that they need to externalize. It may
tell you a lot of things. It may give you a clue. But all you have to do is notice
it, just notice it. You’ll see a 3rd line there and you’ll go, “Aha, they’re an
emotional Generator and people have to bang into them.” All these little
things are suddenly there. And upon that, when you then go into that chart,
you know what you’re talking about. You know what you’re talking about.
You see, the moment that you look at all of those aspects, you see them. You
just have to see them, then you can enter into the chart. Because you know the
person. Because the person is all those generalities. That’s what they are. All
those undefined centers are what they’re not, and what they’ve been all of their
life without exception. You can be incredibly useful to them then. You have
the formulas they need to hear. You have the formula of their authority; you
have the formula of their type; you have the formula of what is not authority.
Give them real tools that way.
Don’t Teach in a Reading
See, the hardest thing to do for you is to stop being a student teacher when
you’re being an analyst. You can’t look at that chart and get lost in all of your
notes on being a Generator, because we’ve been talking about this for years,
folks. It’s not about that, and it’s not about you teaching them. They don’t
care. They’re coming to you because they’ve got a problem. They want you to
help them with their problem. They don’t want to learn Human Design.
People don’t go to astrological readings to learn astrology. I’ve never met an
astrologer that explains why they interpret an aspect the way they do. It’s
pointless. You don’t want your doctor teaching you how to do the surgery you
need. It would be horrifying.
So the one thing that you don’t want to get into is being a teacher and
explaining to people why you know what you know. Just tell them what you
see. That’s all. You see Generator, Projector, Reflector, Manifestor. You tell
them, they’re going to be very impressed. “How did you know that?” they’ll
say.
Projected Channels and Circuitry 199
And most important of all, tell them where their authority is not. If I look at a
chart and I see it’s a Manifestor or Generator with an undefined Ego, I tell
them almost immediately, “Never make a promise.” If I see somebody with a
20-34 and they have an undefined Spleen I tell them right away, “Never be
spontaneous. Danger.”
And every time you hit that button, right on the surface, very simple, very
straightforward, you get them as deep as your knowledge of what that is. In
other words, they take it all in because these are basic truths in their life. Basic
truths. All of these different ways of looking at the BodyGraph, these views of
looking at the BodyGraph, is so that you can have these views. So it makes it
easy for you to synthesize the knowledge.
The thing to recognize is that none of those views are separate from each
other. They all carry the same genetic continuity. They’re all going to come
back and basically tell you the same thing. So use them. Stay on the surface
with people. Don’t teach them. There are analysts and there are teachers.
It’s a different business. Don’t teach them if you’re doing somebody’s reading.
Just give them what they need; give them their mechanics.
