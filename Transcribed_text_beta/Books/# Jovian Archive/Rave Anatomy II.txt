Lesson One
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
Hello and welcome to all of you. This is one of those areas of investigation that I like
very much. One of the things that I've enjoyed over the last number of semesters is
being able to go back to material that I first began to explore, that I first began to
teach and explain many, many years ago. And for me Rave Anatomy is also an
opportunity to refocus on the BodyGraph itself. The last number of years,
particularly in the work of PHS and Rave Psychology and related programs to that,
the perspective has gone very, very deep inward and has quite literally moved away
from the general attention to the holistic. That is, the general attention to the
BodyGraph as a whole.
One of the things about the development of my Mechanics Advanced Imaging is that
it is database oriented. In other words, the transformation in the presentation is
about the development of the database and the ability to be able to see a great deal
of additional information through the database. It also tends to move one away
again from seeing the graph. And for me, the BodyGraph is really the most fantastic
thing that I was given by the Voice, in a sense. It is the only aspect of the
mechanical construct of the Human Design system that is truly original; that is, the
wheel and the hexagrams and the constellations, the zodiacal configurations, the
planets, all of that, obviously, comes from very different disciplines.
Yet, the BodyGraph is really what makes Human Design unique, and it is of course
the basis of everything in terms of all the gifts that Human Design brings, that is, the
ability to be able to look at a design and to be able to determine what is its strategy,
its authority, to be able to see in the very simple surface mechanics just about
anything that you need to see in order to be able to align somebody to not only what
is correct for them, but to be able to explain to them where, in fact, their life has
been difficult for them and why it's been difficult for them and the way in which they
can deal with that. All of that, all of the magic that we have is here integrated into
this BodyGraph.
The Circuit Board
So, for me Rave Anatomy is not about looking at the database per se. Though
obviously, it's there. It’s about understanding this circuit board and it's really what it
is, it's a circuit board. And the more you think about it as a circuit board in some
ways the easier it is for you to begin to understand how things in fact work. In

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
thinking about how I would begin Rave Anatomy II, I wanted to give you something
that it's clear to me that you just don't think about when you see the BodyGraph.
That isn't to say that you haven’t had moments or epiphanies; but nonetheless,
when people look at the BodyGraph they're already looking in the way in which
they’ve been trained analytically to see it, they’re looking for certain things.
For me, and obviously it has to do with the fact that I drew the first one. And in
drawing that first one, what was incredible for me was just the board itself. And
everything about my earliest understandings of what this BodyGraph was all about
was simply based on disconnecting myself from the values of centers and gates and
channels because the moment you get into the values you get into another level of
seeing, that to strip away all of that, and
of course in the beginning it was very
simple for me to strip all of that away.
There was not the ongoing teaching and
developing of a language to describe all
of this.
Basically what I was given was a
framework and a sort of deep imprinting
of information. I certainly couldn't talk
about a graph then in the way I do now,
but the surface was always the same, it’s
still the same. It was always the
obvious, because it was approached as a
circuit board. And when you approach it
as a circuit board you have to see it
differently. As a circuit board, what
we’re looking at is the movement of
whatever we want to call it—energy,
information, data, impulses, whatever we want to call it—what we're watching here
in these various different configurations is that we're seeing the way in which
information moves within this circuit board.
The Sacral Center
And so when you’re looking at the way in which information moves and obviously it
is illustrated for you here, if you take the Sacral Center—the Sacral Center is really
an amazing thing. It's the very basis of life on this planet. Everything about what
we understand as life on this plane is generated by the Sacral Centers of the planet.
This is what it does. It generates life. It is an incredible force.
It not only generates life in the sense that it fuels and energizes the process of life,
but it fuels and energizes many, many things. And of course, it is the core of what is
the reproductive dynamic that is inherent in all life forms. So, the Sacral Center is
something that is the bedrock of life on the planet. The fact is that approximately
67% of humanity are Generators. That is, a large majority of humanity are

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
Generators, literally two out of every three people that you're going to meet are
going to be Generators.
I have talked about it in different ways in many different kinds of classes that any
malaise that we have on this plane can be laid at the feet of a Generator, not that I
want Generators to feel guilty because I don't. It is just simply to understand what
they bring. That is, the not-self world that is going to be two-thirds generative, that
that not-self world generates a frustration field and because this is the source of life
and this is what imbues life with its energy then you can tell very clearly that we
have a planet that is just saturated with frustration.
And of course, it is something that you don't have to consider theoretically; you can
just see it in the world around us. That is, we have a vast proportion of the planet
that is disenfranchised. We have a huge number of human beings on this planet that
simply do not have access to even the limited resources. And even in those areas of
the planet where we have so-called successful or advanced cultures we are still in a
situation where vast swaths of those cultures still suffer from deprivation and
prejudice and all kinds of things. In other words, we live on a plane where
frustration is something that is just woven into the fabric.
The Relationship between the Sacral and the Root
And when you think about the nature of the Sacral Center and
how important it is, that is, it is the essence of life, and then
you look at the Sacral Center within the circuit board. The first
natural thing to do within that circuit board is to see what is
the reach, what is the dynamic of the Sacral itself. The first
thing to recognize is the relationship between the Sacral and
the Root. One of the most profound series of lectures that I
think I've ever done was the format energies that I did in Ibiza
a number of years ago, to really understand this relationship
between the two.
Again, there's very little really that is
consistently understood about the
profundity of pressure centers. The
fact that we have these two pressure centers above and
below, and that the relationship between the Ajna and the
Head Center is one that we immediately recognize as special,
because we see it as the mental system. That is, the
cognitive capacity of the neocortex, the deep gray area,
storage inspiration zone of the Head Center, and together
they form this mental configuration.
But the BodyGraph is nothing but symmetries. This circuit
board is loaded with symmetries. And it is something to
grasp that the relationship between the Sacral and the Root
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
is more special than the relationship the Sacral has with anything else. The only
thing that comes close is obviously that G Center because again you can see the
consistency of the three different channels, this power column that moves up
through the format from the Sacral through the so-called Tantric channels to the G
Center, you see the dominance of the influence
of the Sacral.
But this relationship between the Sacral and the
Root is one that is very, very important because
it literally establishes the way anything and
everything is going to work. We also see that
the Sacral has a basic relationship to the
immune system, to the splenic system. That is,
two channels, both 50/27 and the 34/57. And of
course, the one that is really significant is that when you're looking at integration, as
an example, in other words, when you're looking at the backbone of our survival
mechanism what you're looking at is that this is the awareness that is most deeply
connected. It is the only awareness that is deeply connected to the Sacral Center.
In other words, if you think about the generative force,
the generative force is primitive.
Think about awareness. We have these so-called
areas of awareness and basically they're an
evolutionary pattern. And that evolutionary pattern is
that when you're looking at the splenic system you’re
looking at something that's very, very ancient. And
we can see the consistency of the Splenic Center as
the source of the root awareness, or the root
intelligence of any form going all the way back to the
level of plant.
When we begin with plants we begin with the Spleen
and the relationship of the great power of the life
force, the generative power being directly connected to
awareness and directly connected to awareness for
one goal and one goal only and that is to survive. So
if you think about the generative force you cannot connect the generative force to
here (Head and Ajna Centers), and you cannot connect the generative force to here
(Ego Center). We’ll get there, but it is really something to ponder.
When we are looking at the Sacral as the key to all life, as the generative source, we
have to see that it is basically limited to survival. Now, there’s nothing wrong with
that. Don't misunderstand the direction that I'm taking; that is, this is what it’s all
about. But it also means that the moment that you understand that the Sacral
Center is most deeply connected to empowering survival, and that it has no direct
connection to the mental system or the ego, that what you get are problems
between the way in which the Sacral is intended to work and the level of evolution
and the way in which we have transformed or become as a species.

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
Inner Authority and the Sacral
And what I mean by that is think about the dilemma that we face on the planet; the
dilemma that we face on the planet is the dominance of the not-self mind. After all,
everything about Human Design is about saying, look this cannot make your
decisions; that your decisions have to come from your inner authority. And of
course if you look at statistically inner authorities, you will see in terms of numbers
that when you're looking at the relationship of the Sacral-Spleen or the Sacral-
emotional system you are covering the vast majority of inner authorities. Yes, there
are a few of these (ego); we'll talk about that. But they're very rare, and that is rare
as a percentage. The vast majority of humanity operates out of this connectivity to
the generative force.
In other words, one of the things about the whole nature of introducing Human
Design is that what has happened to us over the last 80,000 years as our self-
reflected consciousness began to take on communicative potential, that is, the
mutation that took place in the larynx about 85 to 90,000 years ago, that the
dropping of the larynx that allowed us to begin to articulate in ways that nuances of
the articulation would lead to the development of very sophisticated language, that
is, the capacity to be able to express and share concepts in language, something that
is rather remarkable when you think about it. And it is the sophistication of this, the
whole development of what took place over the last 85 or 90,000 years in which the
mind became the determining factor for the way in which the life was going to be
lived.
And the thing to understand is that there was no restraint on the mind being able to
do that, because it was not connected inherently to what was the pure generative
process. Not only that, the pure generative process that says that the be-all and
end-all of life is survival was cut off from a mind that could say yes, yes, yes survival
but some should die. Why not? I’ll give you a reason. I’ll give you a concept. I’ll
give you a concept about who's in and who's out, and why should I do this just to
survive—the grasshopper and the ant—why should I work like you. There you are
Generator, Generator, Generator, Generator—I’m up here Projector, Projector,
Projector, you know. And I don't mean that quite literally, but close to it.
Centers of Sacral Resistance
The Ajna and the Head Center and the Ego are centers of Sacral resistance. It's a
real dilemma. It's a real dilemma when we think of it in terms of the mind. One of
the most interesting things is that there is this. That is, the direct connection of the
Sacral to the emotional system through the 59 and the 6. And of course, one of the
things that we know is that there is a mutative process taking place in the 55 and
that the 59 is its opposition in the wheel and therefore is going to be impacted by
this. And we do know that the generative force is connected to the emotional
transition and the transition to emotional awareness. That is, the so-called
emotional awareness, the emotional intelligence that is emerging with the mutation

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
in the Solar Plexus Center; something that is going to emerge when we end this
cycle and enter into the next cycle.
So that the generative force is deeply connected to our history, that is, to the roots
of our survivability, it’s also connected to our sensory future, because that's really
what the mutated Solar Plexus is all about. It's giving us a new level of sensory
ability, cognitive ability. And so we’re living in an age in which resistance to the
Sacral is really what is created, what I refer to, what we now refer to as the
homogenized world. The homogenized world cut off from the dominance of the
Sacral as the key to life on this plane.
One of the most interesting things about the knowledge itself is that in entering into
your Strategy and Authority and being able to eliminate the control that this
resistance has given benefit to the mind, in other words, it's made it easy for the
mind to ignore the vehicle, that the moment you enter into this technique you
immediately enter into a continuity with what is the real generative force on the
planet.
And it doesn't mean, by the way, that that's
any different whether you're a Generator or
not, in other words, I'm simply talking about
it in terms of the way in which we experience
it as humanity, as a very, very deep complex
aura in which the returning of the power to
the Generator is not in our case going into
the past. That's the interesting thing about
understanding the symmetry in the
relationship to the emotional system, that
this is the bridge to the future. It is the
bridge to tomorrow.
This (mental system) is for something else.
And it's so interesting to see it in this way.
Again, it’s just a circuit board. It's so
obvious that there is no way that the Sacral
connects directly to the Ajna. It’s obvious it never gets to the Head Center. But it
never connects directly. This is something that is really outside of all this. It’s
supposed to be outside of all that.
The mind is not designed to look after our well being. It isn’t. Not in the sense that
it is managing our lives and making the decisions that are going to be the things that
protect us. It is so obvious that the mind is separate from that, you can see it. Oh
yeah, we know that given certain kinds of designs these various aspects can have a
general relationship to each other. But in that sense, the only way that these
centers of resistance are brought into harmony with the Sacral Center is through
conditioning, because there is no natural way that they align, because they’re
different and they have ultimately an entirely different value or purpose.

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
The Mental System
Let’s think about the mental system. Everything about what it is to be a nine-
centered being is to come to grips with the fact that we are a transitional mutative
form. As a transitional mutative form that brings, as all mutations do, both positive
potentials and negative possibilities, it’s what's there.
One of the things that is fascinating about the nine-centered being is that we have
been given the mechanics to be able to understand how to operate our vehicle
correctly. Operating our vehicle correctly aligns it to the basic generative flow. And
being able to operate our vehicles correctly, align us to what the splenic generative
process is intended to bring, that is, physical well-being and security.
So one of the things that we get from moving away from the mental resistance to
the generative field, the mental resistance that then takes the role of deciding what
is good for us or what isn’t good for us and therein lies the journey to hell in a hand
basket because it's the way that it works. That the moment you strip mind away
from that, what you go back to is something that is very essential for us. That is,
you go back to the basic relationship of your form to the form principle as a whole.
In other words, you begin to reemerge into the natural world. That is, to find your
natural balance within the plane that we live on.
It isn't about returning to the primitive of what began with the plant—been there,
done that. And obviously this
is a very complex
configuration, these 64 gates.
But at the same time, there is
this understanding that here in
the symmetry is the continuity
that is going to move us, the
defense circuit that is going to
move us into the future. We
cannot get to the future from
here (mental system). There is no way. You can’t. After all, the Ajna Center
alienates itself from everything other than the Throat. And the Head Center is
always cut off, there is nothing like it in the BodyGraph.
You can’t get to here. That's why the magic of Human Design, you’ve got to bypass
this. You have to bypass the centers of resistance, you cannot change them. You
cannot eliminate the resistance. You can’t. It’s there because it is a natural result of
the way in which this circuit board is configured; nothing more, nothing less. And
nothing will change it.
It’s what's so interesting about seeing the circuit board, is that you begin to
understand the process. And at the same time to recognize that this being resistant
does not mean that this is a problem in and of itself only; oh, it’s not. It's not.
Perhaps the most magical thing that the circuit board reveals is that the security and
progress in the life, that is, the ability to be able to find one's way on this plane is
not what the head/Ajna are all about. They aren't. They’re about something else.

Here is where you really get to see an image of outer authority. You can never claim
by understanding the circuit board that this (mental system) possibly could be the
inner authority for this life. I mean, it's a joke. It can’t be. It doesn't really know
what the life is about. It isn't connected to it. Not only is it not connected to it, it is
resistant to it. Stay away, wearing clothes of garlic, holding a cross, stay away.
Outer Authority
Outer authority is an extraordinary thing. It is what the separation of the Ajna and
the head ultimately are all about. So that they don't have to be down here in the
business of what it is to run a life, to stay secure, to stay healthy, to be in the right
place, to know your direction, to find your rhythm, to have the behavior, all of the
keynotes that are in here, all the things about what's necessary in order to exist as
an identity on this plane, separate, cut off and resistant. I don't want to be that; I
want to be something else—that’s the mind. I wouldn’t do that. What makes you
think I have to do that? I can do anything that I like. That’s the mind, cut off,
resistant.
The moment that you enter into this process of living out your Strategy and
Authority, what you're beginning to do is you're beginning to bring your mental
system, that is, your passenger, to a place of recognition, a place of recognition that
they are not needed for these basic
functions on the mundane plane. That
they are not needed for these decision
making processes of navigation on the
mundane plane. And if they’re not
needed for that, there must be something
for them.
We do not know what it is to have a
liberated mind. And what I mean by
liberated mind is a mind that is freed
from its mundane concerns, a mind that
is not caught up with “I have to figure
out what I need to do.” This is not what
mind is about. And the moment that you
really see the circuit board you see it.
It's totally disconnected from the life
itself. It’s a floating observer, floating
above all of it and in its folly as not-self pretending that it actually knows what the
hell is going on. And of course, we well know, any basic understanding of Human
Design will tell you that the not-self—you look at those open centers or the missing
bridges or whatever the case may be, and that not-self creates the priorities for that
mind, distorts it, strips it of its cognitive potential, totally turns around what is its
motivation and leaves the being lost.

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
The fact that the homogenized world is all made up of these lost beings, they’re all
lost together. They don't think they're lost at all in most cases. You have to be
quite sensitive to actually get to a point of understanding that something's wrong.
And yet, the most important thing to understand about this resistance is that if you
see it mechanically you also understand something else. This resistance is very,
very important.
It's not meant to be a resistance that gives the mind an opportunity to dominate the
form. It’s a resistance that’s meant to point the mind away from the form and point
it out through the trajectory and the view that it has, pointed out at the world that
it's intended to experience so that the passenger consciousness can experience that
uniquely and offer that as awareness, that perhaps it is inspiring for the other,
perhaps it is interesting for the other. And this is a mind that can only operate at
this level when it does not have an agenda. Again, you see it in the mechanics and
you see right away mind is not meant to be involved in the day-to-day operation of
the vehicle. It is not. It really is a passenger.
The Heart Center
In order to really appreciate the ego take the first semester of year one PHS,
because then you really get to appreciate what the ego is because you see that it
plays such an important part in the building up of this circuit board. It is one of the
main elements in building up the circuit board. That is, in the first 88° after
conception.
And when you see the nature of how different the
Heart Center is to any other center—you look at
the Throat and the Throat has 11 gates and it's
basically associated to only one biological thing.
It’s actually a binary—the thyroids/parathyroids.
You see the Sacral Center or any of these centers
and you look at their biological associations and
you see that they are basically oriented towards
one kind of biological expression; but, not the
Heart Center. There is really nothing like it, after
all. You're dealing with the heart and the stomach
and the gall, you’re dealing with the T cells.
You're dealing with something that is really extraordinary.
And at the same time, you can see very clearly that the ego lives in a world of its
own. It’s not like it’s connected to that either. It isn't. And perhaps the most
mystical of all is the fact that it's not connected to the Sacral. I was told in my
encounter that if there were a channel between the Heart Center and the Sacral
Center there would be no such thing as death, one of those concepts that people find
interesting, but anyway. Those of you that have taken Rave Cosmology in the work
I did on global cycles and looking at this very strange thing, the Eron, seeing that it
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
actually has a direct channel between the Heart Center and the Sacral, very unusual
phenomenon. We’re not supposed to be that way.
So one of the interesting things about the Heart Center, when you think about the
Heart Center just in terms of the circuit board, is that in many ways the Heart Center
represents death—don't get carried away with this, but it's an important analogy—
that the Heart Center represents death in relationship to the Sacral Center's life.
And what I mean by that is that the Sacral Center is constantly generating life, this
is what it's doing. It can't do anything else.
And yet, we can see because there is no direct connection between the Sacral Center
and the Heart Center that in fact that life itself is not something that can keep on
going. It just can't. All living things have terminality to them. Now, in our
particular case that terminality is embodied within the Heart Center.
Let me give it to you at a simple level. In the Heart Center you have a heart. Well,
obviously if the heart muscle stops, you have death. In the 26th gate you have the T
cells, they are savage, they are killers. That's what they do for our immune system,
they go around killing things. Of course you have the 40th gate, which is the
stomach and you know what happens when you don't feed that. It goes on and on
and on.
It’s just simply something to understand about
the ego is that it represents something else,
within the mechanics it represents a
timetable. It’s where the real timetable is.
Not just a timetable, it has to do with
temperature, as well. For example, this
channel (26-44) is so essential to what it is to
be a nine-centered being, because literally this
is the adjustment of our body temperature
and the development of the temperature that
is going to establish the best mutative medium.
One of the comments I've made many times about the transition from seven-
centered to nine-centered being is that the only way that you would really notice
that physically from the surface is body temperature. That is, the seven-centered
being would have been cooler than the nine-centered being. And this channel, the
26/44 certainly is a place where—the 26th gate is a hot gate, the 44 is a cool gate—it
is where this heat is created in that sense.
So one of the things to be so clear about when we're looking at the ego or the Heart
Center is to see the Heart Center as something very, very different. It's very
interesting for me. I am an ego Manifestor, and therefore I have a strongly defined
ego and I have a totally open Sacral Center. And it's fascinating for me the
difference between what it is to have the Heart Center as a motor, which is really
unique and to have this incredible force here as the driving force, because they have
very, very different goals.

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
The Heart Center is Connected to Only Four Centers
When you're looking at the Heart Center, the first thing obviously that you get to see
about the Heart Center is that the Heart Center is deeply connected in the same way
the Sacral is to the two awareness
centers in the symmetry, that is, the
Spleen and the Solar Plexus. They both
share that. It is, in essence, where
they meet, after all. It's the only way in
which they meet, in that sense.
After all, the Heart Center is limited in
where it can go. So we have these
three tribal channels, we have the one
individual channel, the initiation that is there, so basically when we're looking at the
Heart Center we see that the Heart Center only has a relationship to four centers.
That is, to the Spleen and to the Solar
Plexus, to the identity to the Throat. That
is it.
Now, think about something else. Here we
have two-thirds of the population,
approximately, two-thirds of the population
that have this (Sacral) defined and guess
what, approximately one-third of the
population that has the Heart Center
defined. It’s interesting when you think
about it that way. And of course, this
(Heart Center) has nothing to do with
individual survival, but has everything to
do with communal or specieal survival. It’s
what makes the Heart Center the great organizing force in the circuit board,
organizing force in the sense that it is the thing that organizes the survival on the
next level. It's the next level, what we understand as the tribe which ultimately
becomes the bedrock of what ultimately will be a collective society.
A Conflict
And by the way, the collective society only lives here (mental system), because if
you enter into any community anywhere in the world, if you go to a neighborhood
you will find tribalism. And what I mean by that is that we have a natural tendency
to bond in smaller groupings, and those smaller groupings then take a position within
the larger collective. So, what we are looking at is that with the Generator we see
the individual survival. With the Heart Center we see the communal survival. And
with the Ajna and the Head Center we see the collective mental process.

11
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
But we’ve got a conflict, don’t we? It’s what's so interesting about these centers of
Sacral resistance. They're not only centers of Sacral resistance; they resist each
other as well. So, you have the basic generative drive that says that life is about the
individual. And you have the Heart Center that says the individual can’t survive
unless the tribe survives, and therefore we have to play the tribal game. And the
collective comes in and says all of that is nonsense. No, it really should be this way
or that way. Well, I’ve got this idea; no, I have the facts, and it goes on and on and
on and on.
It's so beautiful to see the way in which we are constructed, that is, the way in which
the circuit board already sets us up. And then you get to see what it means when
you integrate that into your life. It's one of the jokes of my design is that I come
with my 43/23 and my 25/51 along with this (20, 10, 57) part of integration and I
have these things all connected to each other. And it's interesting to watch that play
out. In other words, to try to find out what is the nature of my own design to try to
get it to a synthesis of this, because ultimately obviously holistically this is what
we're all about.
Remember, I'm deconstructing here for you. When I was laying out the BodyGraph,
this is what I was looking for. After all, I was an incredible novice with something
totally new that nobody had ever seen before. I had all this strange stuff in me. But
basically all I had in front of me was this circuit board. And the first place you go, if
you go back to your innocence, your naïveté, the first place you go is just what
connects to what. And gee, how come there's more of this over here than that.
Wow, isn't that interesting that these connect together like this. These were the
things that I was looking at, how is the circuit board structured. How many of you
have even noticed? I mean, you know the knowledge.
The Need to See the Basics
That's why it's so beautiful to go back to
basics. It’s why one of the most important
things to understand about any analytical
level of Human Design is that you have to be
able to see. This is all visual. Despite the
fact that the highest levels of tools for this
knowledge go deep, deep, deep into the
database information, none of that is really
worthwhile until you can grasp this image,
because this is where it all takes place. This
is where you can see everything.
And you’re so busy looking at definitions or
the lack of it in order to figure out what the
type and the strategy and all of what that
stuff is, or looking what the open centers are
because they are the not-self strategies and

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
this and that, that you have not looked at, really not looked at the BodyGraph to see
it naked, to see it without any preconceptions. Just to see it, just to look at it to see
the way that it works. To see the system, to watch this movement as it goes up and
down the center like that. To understand the beauty of
how it twists and it turns as it moves its way through.
The beauty of this process, this straightness and the
directness of this line right up the center, the
symmetries, the relationship inherent between the Root
Center and the Spleen and the emotional system, these
channels that are literally the same, this (32-54) is the
same as this (19-49), sort of. They’re only different
because of where they go, but the values inherent in
them, the underlying mechanical values are the same.
It’s to see. You can see right away that the ego is
funny, isn’t it; this whole ego circuit is really funny.
There’s something odd about it. It’s like it’s out of
place. If you can see it dimensionally it would sort of be
backward, deeper; it’s out of place. It's different. And
you can see it by looking at it, and then to see how
things connect, to see the limitations of connectability.
The fact is that the Head Center because it is so isolated
that only 30% of humanity has it defined. This is a vast area of openness and
conditioning. It was one of the first things I tried to show people about the mind
being cut off and being cut off from the body’s four motors; just the obvious. Your
mind’s not here to tell you what to do because it's not designed to even be
connected to it. And it doesn't matter about the happenstance that your particular
design connects these things across these boundaries, it is not natural. It’s seeing,
more than anything else, it’s seeing.
The Source of Our Deepest Malaise
The moment that you understand the depth of what the Sacral Center is, what the
Sacral Center brings, and you see the separation of the heart and you see the
separation of the head and Ajna, you understand that this basic drive for life is being
conditioned by resistant forces. It’s being conditioned by tribal demands and it's
being conditioned by collective demands. And the greatest power that we have, the
Sacral, with its vast connectivity to other centers is the source of our deepest
malaise on this planet, because the not-self thrives on the resistance. It thrives on
it.
The tribe says I am going to kill you for kissing that boy because he comes from
another tribe, and all of us are going to be safer because our genes are going to be
safer because we’re not going to be polluted by the little bastard so we’re going to
kill him now and you. And you know that individual, that their generative force says
we do not want to die. It was just a kiss.

13
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
And then of course, you have that collective mind which is the most powerful force of
the not-self, but again, remember that because it is limited in the way in which the
mechanics and the circuit board permit activation of either the Heart Center or the
Head Center that you really have to see that these are huge conditioning areas.
Three-quarters of humanity wandering around with open Heart Centers, having that
being conditioned. And you see that the Heart Center, the Ajna/Head Center has
been the very source of eliminating uniqueness. They’re tribal/collective. They are
not rooted in integration, mutation, unique direction, they’re not.
Finding Harmony
This is the dilemma and it's built in. And all of this has a way of finding harmony.
But it can only find that harmony when the vehicle is operating correctly, there is no
other way. Everything about this knowledge is that it is profoundly selfish. Selfish in
the sense that it is entirely focused on the authority of the individual, the authority of
the individual that defies, can defy the authority of the tribe, the authority of the
collective because truly other than in very, very rare circumstances relative to the
ego as an authority, it's not what it's about.
How important it is, this is the thing about Rave Anatomy, is to broaden one's
respect for the depth that is there just in the circuit board,
because it's all there. And our job is that we truly have to
understand the framework in order to gain insights, in order
to be able to grasp certain ways in which certain things
work. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that
out, you really don't.
If this wasn't a human body that framed this, if there had
never been a human body to frame this, if the schematic
had been laid out in a different way, and I was doing an
engineering or architecture class and I was talking about
flow of data or information or movement or whatever in this
particular circuit board and I'd be standing there, somebody
would say, well, you’ve got a problem here (mental
system), and somebody would say yes and you’ve got a
problem here (ego), because they would see it, because it's
obvious. This is the bedrock.
Looking at the BodyGraph Just as a Circuit Board
One of the nicest things to do is to look at the BodyGraph with absolutely no
activations in it. Take out all the numbers, strip it absolutely naked and just look at
it as a circuit board. This is what all the knowledge is built on. So, these areas, I
think in time they will lead to the potential for fascinating areas of study. In order to

LESSON ONE
The Centers of Sacral Resistance
study our evolutionary process the fact is that we were not intended to bypass this
(mental system) as a stage. It's one of the most remarkable things that happened
to us. But at the same time that this is where we went in terms of our evolution,
this is also what we leave behind, in a sense. And it
also allows us through the very development of this to
return to this source and to allow the emergence of
what's to come.
This simple illustration is the evidence, if you will, of
why Strategy and Authority, that is, giving over inner
authority to the vehicle is so obvious. You can see it.
One of the things that I understand about the
awakening of the passenger is there is a moment that
you get it, you have to get it. And you have to get it
in the same way that I'm trying to illustrate it to you,
that you can see it.
That you can see that all this stuff that you've been
cranking over and over again in your mind, and all
these things that have led you to do this and that and
the other, all that stuff, that all of that has been
pointless activity for your mind, wasted activity for
your mind, because it's not what mind is about. It's
not what mind is for. Mind is not mundane. You can see that. You can see that it’s
not mundane. It's not about eating and shitting and fucking and living, it isn't about
any of that. It’s way up here cut off from everything floating around.
And that's where its destiny lies, in its capacity to observe, in its aloofness above the
dynamics of the mundane, and what the mundane demands in terms of the “this and
that,” no longer concerned about its survival, no longer concerned with its social
relationships, no longer concerned with any of that, just watching, observing sitting
up there in a very special passenger seat.
Anyway, Rave Anatomy begins with your appreciation of this circuit board. And to
see that this is the element, because it's upon this circuit board that everything is
built. It's really something to grasp. And of course, that means that this becomes
our most important tool, because against the background of understanding the
nature of the circuit board we get to see it being framed by the unique imprints that
we look at in terms of people’s designs.
Well, always nice to do Rave Anatomy. Hope you enjoyed that, it’s something
different for you to think about in terms the nature of the BodyGraph. Next week I
will get to more traditional Rave Anatomy material and we will continue our look at
this delightful circuit board. And by the way, Happy Anniversary to all of us; it's
wonderful that Human Design is still here after 21 years and cooking. As I said, lots
of things going on today, so if you have a chance, participate; and otherwise, do
take care. Until next time, bye for now.

Lesson Two
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
Hello to everyone and hello to all of you that are downloading. Rave Anatomy is
something that I really enjoy because it genuinely gives me an opportunity to talk
about things in the context of the BodyGraph that I haven’t talked about in over a
decade and to be able to come to certain aspects of the mechanics with a different
perspective. It's fascinating to me. And this is one of the areas that is really quite
remarkable. It's one of those things about us that's really so fascinating to look at.
All of this is about the subject of mutation.
Mutation is really the key in my teachings of the nature of tone. That is, tone which
is seen as the infrastructure or the architecture of cognition. When we’re looking at
that architecture of cognition we have a number of sensory aspects. That is, tone is
built on binaries and these binaries ultimately represent senses. And yet, there is
one overall sense that is inherent in the whole cognitive architecture and that’s
sound or that is acoustics.
Something to understand about the presence of it is that this is the element that
changes the game, because this is where mutation is. And it's where mutation is
always going to be. It is the only place within the framework of what it is to be us in
which mutation can take hold. And it's the only way in which mutation can be
expressed. And within this context it is the only way in which mutation can be taken
in, can be heard and ultimately begin to do its work.
One of the things that is most extraordinary about the nature of what it is to be us is
that we are driven by an evolutionary mutative process. That is, the program itself
is something that fosters mutation. It is our ability to be able to rise up as a species
in the last 4 million years, as an example. It’s interesting to note that recent studies
have indicated, and it’s funny that people actually express surprise at it, but recent
investigations have indicated that the evolutionary process is very much still alive
and kicking in us, something that obviously within the context of Human Design
we’re well aware of.
Anyway, this is an opportunity to be able to reflect upon what I originally laid out as
simply the mundane level of the mechanics of hearing. Obviously, when I was first
laying out this material, as many of you know by now, the original Rave Anatomy
was simply a collection of illustrations that I had built up in order to write the first
books in Human Design, actually, The Book of Letters. It was out of this collection
that I had all of the basic themes that I felt would be essential to introduce in order
to get people to be familiar with the way in which not simply the BodyGraph
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

17
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
operates, but to understand the correlations between the BodyGraph and the life
itself.
When I first laid out the whole hearing mechanism or the ear mechanism or however
you want put that, it was basically to give people a sense of this at the very surface.
In other words, in terms of the way in which they hear because most people don't
get it. As a matter of fact, my classic representation of this, which is really fun when
you think about it, is about the difference between the classic right ear, which is the
57th gate and the left ear specifically, which is the 22nd gate. And what is interesting
about them, and I will go into this afterwards in detail, is that the 57th gate is
something that basically operates in the now. In other words, this is hearing in the
now. And the 22nd gate is based on the wave and on the movement and this is
hearing over time.
So, when I first introduced this I wanted to get people used to understanding how
you can take advantage of mechanical information in order to transform the way in
which the mundane plane operates.
So let's take the example of the telephone. There isn't anybody anymore on this
planet, including the most bizarre eighth world places where people aren’t walking
around with a mobile phone in their pocket. Everybody's got a telephone or access
to a telephone in this era. Think about what you do with your telephone. If you’re a
right-handed person, most people are right-handed, that is, the majority of people
are right-handed, if you're a right-handed person the tendency is to use the
telephone in your left hand and put it to your left year.
Left Ear: Hearing Over Time
So, if you’re putting the telephone all the time to your left ear think about what's
actually happening to you because it’s very interesting. This frequency—we know
something fundamental about the nature of the emotional system, it’s very
straightforward. The emotional system has an incredible law. It really does. It is
the perfect law of no truth in the now. So, literally when you're listening out of that
left ear, basically what you're getting is that you're getting things that ultimately are
not going to be all available in the moment, in the now, that you're listening to them.
For example, you have a conversation with somebody and after the conversation is
over you suddenly realize what they said. Or a day later you realize that you didn't
get what they said. In other words, there is a delay factor in all of that. So, think
about the dilemma for the not-self world and its right-handedness. The not-self
world and its right-handedness is never getting precise information in the now, which
is quite an interesting thing to think about. So, you're talking to somebody on the
telephone, there is this sense within the general perspective that this is an
immediacy, yet, if you're listening with your left ear you don't get it all. You wake up
the next morning and realize, oh my God, I was fired. You just don't get it.

LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
Right Ear: Hearing in the Now
The other side of the coin is that there is the possibility of being able to hear things
in the now. That means putting the telephone to your right ear. It means a whole
change in the physical mechanics of the way you operate unless you’re naturally left-
handed. When I first began in this process I was trying to get people to understand
this relationship between this BodyGraph, the actual mechanics and the way in which
we can take advantage of those mechanics. It isn't necessarily a good idea to
receive information and actually have no real access to all of it in the moment that
you receive it. That is, as you'll see as I go through this, this hearing is something
that is very different and serves a different purpose in a way.
Individuality and the Acoustic
So, let's go back to the start and let’s go back to the beginning of the process. What
we have laid out here is basically an aspect of what is the individual circuit in the
BodyGraph. As a matter of fact, the only thing missing is the power column and the
format, and then we would have the
complete individuality circuit. So, the
first thing to recognize about the whole
acoustic phenomena is that the
acoustic phenomenon is something that
belongs to the individual.
Please understand why individuality
has a dilemma in dealing with the
collective. Everything about the
collective is that the collective is visual.
Everything tribal is rooted in the
physical contact. But the whole thing
about the individual is that the
individual is acoustic. And when we
see the way in which we look at the
world around us and we look at the
mental construct, in looking at the
mental construct we only have the two
collective systems and the one
individual system, that most of the way or the majority of the planet, the way in
which they deal with the world is that they deal with the world through the visual.
This is the world of what I call Solomon’s world. That is, nothing new under the sun.
In other words, there is the historical experience which is the work of the abstract.
There is the future that can be there, all of those things. What we're dealing with
here in the individuality is something different. It is something different because it is
rooted in its now-ness. It’s not about the future. It's not about the past. It's not
about trying to maintain continuity between the past and the future which the
collective is very much addicted to because it gives it a sense of security. There is
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY II

nothing that brings greater insecurity than the potential of mutation because
mutation can overturn the apple cart. And the moment that mutation overturns the
apple cart the collective is running around like mad trying to reorder their world.
When we talk about this you also have to understand something about just the basic
binary of what it is to be in the world, that is we are always being conditioned or
conditioning others. Your design conditions others when you step into their aura.
And the acoustic phenomena of the individual process is not something that is just
simply held within the individual, but what we well know about individual circuitry is
that its theme is empowerment and this empowering in the other leads to certain
reactions, as you will see.
The 57th Gate: The Right Ear
So, let's begin with the basic breakdown of what we have here and you can see in
this illustration that all of the aspects are coded in red except for certain key aspects.
That is, the 57 the 22 and the 43. As I mentioned earlier, when I began the 57th
gate represents the right ear. What
that means is that this is the ear of
immediacy and the now, and it's
absolutely essential. Obviously, the
57th gate and the 20th gate in this
context are also aspects that are not
simply part of the individual circuit,
but are aspects of what is a much
older framework, that is, the
integration channels.
The thing to recognize about
integration and individuality is that
together they represent a way in
which we perfect our survival. In
other words, this is all about the
potential of survival. And in the
potential of survival, what we know
clearly is that one of the most
important things we have going for
us, being in the forest at night all alone, is your ear. And you want to be able to
hear anything in that now. And it's something to understand about the power of the
57th gate and how mutative this gate can be in terms of its hearing.
Think about what that’s like when you're in a place that you're not familiar with, as
an example, and you get into bed and you’re tired and you're just about to fall off to
sleep and then you hear a very strange sound. You can feel the power of your
immune system demanding absolute attention so acoustically you can pick up the
threat. Because the fact of the matter is that this acoustic nature in the 57th gate is
there to help us understand something very basic. We cannot trust the world. You

LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
cannot trust the world you see, the old cliché about judging books by their covers.
This is the magic that lies in the acoustic that it is a frequency that penetrates at
another level that you can hear behind the veil of the illusion.
And so the 57th gate becomes a hearing that is essential to us. I didn’t begin with
the telephone thing to create some kind of just amusing little anecdote. Think about
it. If you're not putting that telephone to your right ear, think about what that
means in terms of the way you're getting in information. You're not getting in
information that is going to allow you to be able to “defend yourself” in the moment.
You’re not going to have the essential information that you need in the moment.
And it's going to lead to a certain amount of insecurity.
And it's quite a thing to recognize that. One of the great experiments that you can
do is the telephone experiment. And by the way, it takes some getting used to,
you'll see. But it's very, very different information. When I was doing my
professional readings in person, particularly in the first decade that I worked in
Design, I only allowed people to sit beside me on my right, which meant that I was
always talking into their left ear, and I was doing that on purpose. I was doing that
on purpose because there was so much information that I was putting in them that
there was no way they were going to grasp it in the now, anyway. And better that
that information went into them and seeded inside of them and slowly would emerge
in their contemplative experiential process; a slow mutation, rather than an instant
mutation. I never put people on my left side so that I could talk into their right ear.
I was always talking into their left ear.
The advantage that we have is one of the things I talk about a lot. That is, this
knowledge allows us to take advantage of the program. It allows us to take
advantage because we can understand the mechanism. In being able to understand
the mechanism and knowing that it is very important for you to be able to hear
what's being said in the moment and at the same time it's important for you to
understand that if you're having a discussion with somebody and it's not the kind of
discussion that is intended to lead to an immediate conclusion, it’s very valuable to
talk into their left ear, as an example, just an understanding of how the mechanics
operate.
The 22nd Gate: Left Ear
So, when we're dealing with the 57 we’re dealing with intuition. We are dealing with
a hearing mutative potential that is all rooted in the now. When we go over to the
other side, when we go over to the 22nd gate, what we’re dealing with in the 22nd
gate, this by the way is a great and powerful gate of taking in the other. It’s an
extraordinary taking in of the other. The openness to being mutated is what the 22
is all about. But it’s not immediate, it’s a process. It is deeply connected to the
wave function of the Solar Plexus system, so this is hearing that has its wave. This
is hearing that you hear something from somebody and one moment you think it's
great news and then you sort of hear the rest of that over time and suddenly you

21
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
think that maybe it wasn't such great news and then you sort of—it is a different
kind of taking in of information.
The 43rd Gate: The Inner Ear
And then we have the 43. Now, the 43 is odd. Here we have the right ear in the
now and here we have the left ear over time, but we only have two ears, right? My
joke about the 43 is that I like to call this the third ear. It’s my pun on the third eye,
but like all good humor, it's rooted in deep truths. In this context, technically,
referring to it as the inner ear, because it's not really an ear at all. And yet, the
whole thing about being individual at the mental level is that it is incredibly acoustic.
And it is incredibly acoustic on the inside, whatever that means.
It's my joke about hearing the Voice. On the inside, I guess, this is one of the things
about the acoustic nature of individuality, that there is this appearance of acoustic
that takes place, these inner dialogues, these inner sounds, all of those things that
are there. And the thing that is so exceptional about the 43 is that it is not attached
to the acoustic domain of the mundane plane. In other words, it is not connected
with the surface listening that is part of the 57 and the 22. This is listening to the
inside, which isn't necessarily connected at all to the outside. But it carries with it
the deepest potential for mutation.
And because it carries the deepest potential for mutation, the great dilemma of the
43/23 is that rarely is it able to transfer that mutation. Rarely is it able to be able to
explain it so that the collective doesn't run into panic and try to deny all of that.
Remember that the collective gets very upset when the world order is disturbed, it
really does. And because we operate in a not-self world, nothing is more dangerous
than mutative thought. And so many beings that carry a mutative inner hearing
where they are in touch with something that they take in that is outside of the plane
of Solomon’s domain, they're going to have enormous difficulty putting it into the
world.
I know, after all, I’m a 43/23 and I've spent 21 years of my life trying to explain
mutation to the collective, and I see what it takes. And I see that it is not an easy
task, because the world gets disturbed and the collective doesn't like to be disturbed.
What do you mean I have to sleep in my own bedroom? And it goes on and on and
on. This is not the way things are supposed to be, according to the normal
homogenized world, so I don’t want to hear it.
And it’s the other side of understanding something about individuality and its impact
on the other—they don't want to hear it. They don’t want to hear you. They don’t
want to listen to you, because they’re protecting themselves from mutation. The
husbands of women who discover Human Design, you get that visceral reaction—I
don’t want to hear any of that, I don’t want to listen to any of that—fear, fear of
mutation. In the beginning was the word, so to speak. This is really something to
understand about the power of the acoustic. You know that from the power of my
own voice, what it means to be transformed acoustically. It’s very different than if

LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
you were just reading what it is that I had said. It doesn't carry the same power. It
does not. This is a frequency and a very, very powerful frequency.
Deaf Channels
So not only are we looking at the mechanics of how we hear, but also to understand
the reaction to what the hearing can bring, that the reaction is those that don't want
to listen. And then there's deafness, the great deaf channels. And what I mean by
that is this is the bedrock of what it is to be individual. You have to grasp this to
begin with. You have to see that an individual is brought into the world not to be
influenced. There is nothing sicker, and I mean that, nothing sicker than the
individual in the homogenized life, because they suffer terribly. They do—
melancholy, depression all kinds of things.
The 28/38
And because the individual is designed to ignore the collective, not to be influenced
by what is, but to be driven by their own unique process that they are inherently
deaf. The 28/38, the Channel of Struggle—do you
know these people when they're in a struggle? You
try to say anything to them, try to help them. I
know; I have so many 28/38s in my life and I don't
have that. It is really something.
When you understand mechanics you can have so
much grace for people. It’s such a beautiful thing,
because somebody who has this, this is the process.
They cannot take somebody else's advice. It would
kill them. Really, that's not what they're about.
And it's why they can be so alone and disturbed in
their process, because even at the same time that
they are not designed to be helped, they are
conditioned to believe that that is something—you know, the collective world—and
they can’t listen. And then you get the reaction of others who are infuriated with
them, because they will not listen.
The 39/55
It’s the same thing on the other side, the 39/55. You get one of these people in one
of their moods; you think you're going to be able to tell them anything. They’re not
going to hear a word you’re saying. This is the thing to understand about the
individual process that makes it so difficult for individuals. Is that there's so much of
them that is truly cut off from the influence of the other. And because the other
reacts to that and because the other is generally afraid of the mutation that can

arise, they can be deeply alienated and ostracized in society—genius to freak. And
99.99% of the time, by the way, it's just freak, you know, it just is.
The 43/23
So it is a difficult dilemma. The most complex of the deafness is in the 43/23 itself.
You notice here that the specific gates of the mundane hearing are separate from
where the deafness lies. And again, we’re looking at a general view so that you can
see how these different aspects would
operate in the nuance of somebody's
particular chart. That is, somebody like
me who doesn't have the 28/38 or the
39/55 these areas of deafness are not a
part of me. But I have the 43/23. You
try to tell me something when I'm telling
you I know and you can bang your head
against the wall until the end of your life.
But there is something interesting about
the deafness in the 43/23 is that it's not
that they don't hear what you're saying.
I know these moments in my life. It’s
not that I don't hear what the other
person is saying. I'm just not capable of
being anything other than what I am. It
is just so clear to me. And what I notice
is that at some point if what they have
said is of value, at some point it
becomes my own. I don’t know how to express that. It's sort of like I take it over
as if it came out of my own process. But it's a very, very slow thing for that power,
anyone, to be able to influence an individual. They're not here for influencing.
And again, when I talk about deafness, I want you to understand from this example,
it’s not about that they don't hear what the other person says. They just don't give
a damn. It’s not even that. They’re not designed to go oh gee, all right, I’m going
to do that now. This is not collective sharing. This is not tribal support. It really
isn't. It is not those things. It's very, very different. So when I talk about the
deafness understand it is simply a deafness to having that condition them, because
that's basically what it is.
It's a deafness that says, no, no, no, I have to be me. This is the bedrock of the
potential uniqueness that is there in any human being. It’s an extraordinary
potential. And it is this mutative force that is there, because it's the mutative force
that distinguishes us ultimately in our evolutionary process. So we come out in this
vast diversity where each and every one of us have this unique potential, a unique
potential that we see that can be realized in a certain way, can be realized through
the correct authority, realized through abandoning the power of the mind, because

LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
one of the things that you get to see is that the not-self—I very much enjoyed
yesterday in being able to look at the madness of what the not-self world is built on,
and to really understand how distorting the conditioned world is.
We are Driven by Our Openness
Think about somebody who has the 20th gate and they don’t have the 57. Think
about the conditioning of that. They want to be able to hear in the now, they want
to be able to hear everything, and they want to be able to hear what they need to
hear. And they get driven by it. And they get driven to become what they are not.
They are not the life force that is there. They get driven to focus their attention on
what they are not, to give their attention to those 57s who will not deserve it.
In the mechanics we are all driven by our openness. And that there are enormous
problems that arise out of all of this. There is nothing more difficult in terms of the
complexities of circuitry than individuality. You can see that when you look at the
way in which individuality is there and how much of the BodyGraph it occupies. And
it’s something to understand that all of these individual aspects, this is our
backbone; this is what gives us the potential to be unique, to experience
differentiation, all of those things because we are mutative creatures. You've all
been mutated, after all. You’ve been taken away from the collective homogenized
way of life and your life has been transformed. This is what this mutative process is
all about.
The Forces of Mutation: The 23, 20 and 12
And of course there is this extraordinary dilemma in
trying to get others to listen. When you look at the
Throat configuration, these three gates, these are the
most powerful mutative gates that we have. Think
about that, because that's quite a statement. They are
incredibly powerful as mutative forces. They are not in
and of themselves the actual core of the thematic.
They’re not the 57 or the 22, whatever. The only
variation that is slightly different is the 43/23 because it
is an opposition in the wheel and therefore it is
something that tends to emerge as a life force more
than just as activations.
But in looking at these gates in the Throat, understand
that mutation is intended to be delivered acoustically.
That's why we have teachers, masters, gurus,
philosophers, politicians, on and on and on and on and
on. It is why our world is filled with talking heads. This
is what it's all about. It doesn't matter how many

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
pictures you see, but the voice, the frequency in the voice is what carries the
greatest power.
The 12th Gate
So when you look at these three gates in the Throat you have to see them with a
very different perspective. That is, these are the forces of mutation. And where we
begin is that we begin with the 12th gate because the
12th gate is an extraordinary gate. And it is specifically
one of the most important mutative gates in our history
in terms of the knowledge of Human Design. That is, 85
to 90,000 years ago we had the mutation of the
dropping of the larynx and of course this took place in
the 12th gate. That is, the main mutations in humanity
are in this track. That's where they are, this stream.
And of course, as we well know, we have the present
mutation or the mutation that's going to emerge in 2027
and of course this is also taking place in this dynamic, in
this stream. It’s a highly mutative area.
The other thing is that the 12/22 carries with it the most
significant power as a life force. It is the only purely
mutative life force. And what I mean by that is that the
12/22 is the only social channel that is individual. If
you're dealing with the collective, every channel is
social, it’s rooted in sharing. Every channel of the
collective is social. So, whatever that channel is, you want to share it, whatever its
thematic as a life force is, it is intended to be shared.
If you're in the tribe there are only two social channels. One would think there
would be more, but there isn't. There are only two social channels, the Channel of
Intimacy and the Channel of Community. This is where the tribe establishes its
bonds, and this is where it establishes its way in which it controls the nature of tribal
behavior.
But in individuality, for all of its complexity in the BodyGraph, for all of the channels
that are involved only one is social. Only one is there to specifically empower the
other. The 12th gate carries an enormous burden. It is the burden of being able to
articulate the mutation and to be able to empower the other with it. You can see
that the moment you're getting to the 12th gate, you're not getting to hearing at all,
but you're getting to getting people to hear; in other words, the acoustic approach
and the acoustic approach to mutate.
Obviously, the Throat has 11 gates. There are many voices, but there are only three
that mutate you. There is one that will support you, the 45, and the rest will just
share with you acoustically. But they’re not sharing with you in the sense of
changing anything, they're simply identifying things or not. But the moment that
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

26
LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
you're dealing with these three gates in the Throat you're dealing with those voices
that are there to transform you. It’s what you get from me. I have all three of
them. This is all about being a mutative acoustic force, getting you to hear me out
of the center of attention. So, the individual isn't just rooted in ‘they have to hear.’
It's not about simply the hearing. It is about transforming the hearing into an
acoustic projection outwards for others to empower others.
These are mutations that take place at different frequencies, and particularly when
we’re dealing with the nature of the mundane plane. When the 12 is mutating you,
there is no attempt to mutate you in the moment. The 12 is only interested in being
able to put the mutation inside of you. It can afford to wait. My description of my
talking into people’s left ears, my 12 talking to their left ear, because it’s a mutation
that takes place over time. By the way, it’s much less threatening to the 12. It's
something to think about.
Rejection in the Acoustic Domain
There is a great deal of rejection that comes out of this acoustic domain. There are
those that will not want to listen. It is something that arises. The value in the 12,
what makes it a social power, is that it's tricky, it is romantic, seductive, and it has
an ability of sort of smoothly getting inside of you. And it isn’t necessarily something
that is threatening. And the way you notice that, anybody who has a 12/22 friend in
their life or carries a 12/22, it’s harder if you carry it yourself, you don’t really see it
as well. But the 12/22 has a certain quality in them that relaxes the collective or the
tribal, particularly the tribe, the tribe and individuality have a good connection to
each other, so that they can get their smooth message across, and they do.
The other thing that is interesting about it is, for example, that when you look at the
12 it's deeply connected with music and poetry, as an example. When you think
about the nature of poetry, a poem is never something that you want to grasp in the
moment, if you know what I mean. What is wonderful about poetry is that over time
a great poem is something that grows in power and in depth. This is very much a
12/22 phenomena in that sense. In the same way that romance and love out of the
12/22 is something that begins slowly. There is no quick burn. It begins slowly until
ultimately the possibility of that passion building up.
So this is a different kind of mutation, but it's the most successful avenue of
mutation that individuality has because it's the one that carries the best schmooze, if
I can put it that way. And it's the only one that's emotional. This is something that
is very significant, at least for me. It is clear for me that in the transitional nine-
centered BodyGraph the mutation of the emotional system is where an enormous
emphasis is placed. The very fact that this is the area where there is the greatest
possibility of mutative transmission in the 12/22 is also an indication of how
important it is that the Solar Plexus population, that is, the Solar Plexus beings, half
of the planet, how important it is for them to be reached in terms of mutation and
how this is designed to be a mutation that works slowly in them, really according to
their nature so that ultimately they too can get it, that they can get the mutation,
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

27
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
because if we don't get the mutation to the Solar Plexus system, we don't get rid of
the damn motor.
And no matter how we have rationalized and accepted the motor function of the
Solar Plexus, this is an old trait. It's an old trait. It has historical roots in the seven-
centered being. And it is not what the future is about. That is, the neural
development of the Solar Plexus system and its expression through the right is
something that is there, it's happening, it's been going on since 1781. And so this
impact of the direct mutation to the emotional field is something that is very
powerful.
The other thing is it's very devious in way. That is, because the emotional wave
carries a frequency that is highly penetrating, the 12/22s penetrate you at a very,
very deep level. In other words, it goes beyond the coolness. Somebody like me
who is only a 12, this is a very cool, and this is basically what I am, it is a very cool
mutative force. Whereas, you bring in the emotional system, you bring in the power
to put the frequency much deeper into others and particularly for these beings to be
able to share communion with their emotional brothers and sisters, in that sense.
The 20th Gate
This is totally different. Do you know what this is? You're standing on the street
corner, and you're talking to a friend and you take a step into the street without
thinking and there's a car coming and somebody with a 20 goes “hey.” Because
that's what it is. It’s so interesting in Dream Rave; it’s the 20 that wakes you up
instantly in the middle of the night. This is not about mutating you in the sense that
it's something that's placed in you and there is this process where slowly but surely
it is really transforming you. It is not social.
It's the thing to understand about it. It’s simply the thing that is calling to you in the
now. It's what's there for the now. It is what can protect you from what is mutative
that suddenly arises in the now. But this is not a voice that is there to fill you with
poetry and to move you. No, it isn’t there for that at all. It isn’t. It is simply that
voice in the now that is there, both in that sense out of here, to hear what is
necessary in the now and to express what is necessary in the now; no more, no less.
The Integration System: Two Roles
One of the most fascinating things about integration, the integration system, is that
obviously in the integration system the 20/57 is a part of that, but it's also part of
what is the individual logical side, that is, the splenic side, individual splenic side of
the individual circuit. And so it actually has two roles. And what is interesting about
these two roles is that when it's in integration it is totally and absolutely selfish. So
in fact, you step blindly into the street it doesn't mean that this voice is going to say
anything. Nothing. It makes them rather interesting creatures, doesn’t it?

28
LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
But the moment you bring in the 28 or the 38, by the way, so somebody like me
with a 20/57, I don't have the 28/38, without those 28/38 people I'm not very
human. Those people include my partner, my daughter, many of my close
associates. There are many people in my life who bring this aspect to my life and it
turns me around and when I see them in trouble I shout; no more, no less. It's just
a shout. And particularly in my case being a Manifestor, I honk the horn and then I
keep going.
But it really is something to grasp about what kind of acoustic we have there is that
this is the—mutation is a surprise. The space between the notes, it's a surprise.
Suddenly it’s there. This is the voice that recognizes it. This is the voice that can
tell you that it's there. It can. And this is a voice that may say absolutely nothing.
Remember that about it. This is the voice that could tell you what you need to know
and doesn't. It’s often not appreciated—you could have told me. Yeah, well, maybe
you wouldn't have listened, whatever the case may be. But nonetheless, it’s the
thing to understand about the 20 when it's isolated from the 28/38, it doesn't
necessarily tell you in the now, it doesn’t.
In the individual circuit there is a compensation for that. That compensation comes
out of the 8/1. But this is not in any way as deeply acoustic as the rest. Everything
in individuality has a certain resonance to the acoustic domain, obviously. But it's
something to see that the 8/1 is what gives most individuality, generalized
individuality, this social context, even though this is not social. It is simply about the
individual wanting to demonstrate that it can be of value, and therefore, it will turn
around and tell you, look, there’s a car about to hit you, get out of the way. It will
come out of there rather than out of the 20 by itself.
But as I said, if there is this process that is there, if there is the 28/38 there, then
there's no question that it could let you know what you need to know. But it’s
something to understand about the power of what can be said here, because
whatever is said is relevant to the moment. And of course, that can be of enormous
value. Again, this is about the acoustic expression developed out of the hearing
potential. In other words, this 20 is there to express the immune sensitivity that
hears what's going on in the now, so is ready to express what is there in the now.
The 23rd Gate
The 23rd gate has a very, very difficult task. That is, it is a voice that is there to
transform the mind. The 12th gate is a voice that is there to transform the spirit, and
the 20th gate is there to protect the body. But the voice of the 23 is there to
transform mind. It is there to break the hold of the collective stasis. It's there to
juice things up. It's there to push the process forward. It’s there to add to the
overall consciousness of the plane. And again because it operates in isolation, this
inner ear that isn't acoustic at all, because it operates in isolation because it has to
do its own translation to even express itself, that so often the expression of the 23rd

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
gate is something that is very, very difficult for the collective to relate to and the
collective is very important because they share the mental domain.
The “I Know” Voices
Each of these voices—after all, the 20 says, “I know I am.” These are “I know”
voices. They are the three of the four individual voices that are there in the Throat.
This voice that is just “I know;” “I know, I know, I know.” When I used to say “I
know” when I was six and seven years old nobody was impressed. You can’t help it,
it is your mechanic. You go through your whole life saying “I know, I know, I know,”
it doesn't mean you do, and it doesn't mean that you can explain it and it doesn't
mean that your explanation will become somebody else's knowing. That's quite a
journey.
And in a world in which we do not have real outer authority in which the not-self
mind is determining the way in which human beings are operating, it is exceedingly
difficult for this explaining of the mutative new to be received. It's extremely
difficult. There is an enormous rejection of individual thought on this plane. There
just is. And of course the fact is that given that this is the not-self, one can
understand.
That is, somebody with a 43/23, there is no automatic that they're going to have an
insight whose explanation is mutative, because most of the time the things that they
are thinking about are conditioned by their openness, that their not-self priorities
distort whatever it is that is going on, and they lose the power that is inherent in
what is possible for them. The net result of that is that they simply become
depressed. The net result of that is that to others they seem to be really out of step,
out of place, a little bit off, whatever the case may be. And of course their life then
ends up following that trajectory, which is not a very nice one.
This is a voice that needs to explain to mind the way things work. The Channel of
Structuring is all about efficiency. Mutation out of the 23rd gate is about bringing
efficiency to the way in which we can make sense of, or the way in which we can
understand, speaking in terms of the collective, the world around us.
The Triple Binary
So, we have basically within this hearing context we have three things that are a
binary, we have this triple binary. We have the three different kinds of specific
hearing and then we have the voices of those hearings that go out to put mutation
acoustically into others.
I talk a lot about the potential of the passenger. And in looking at the potential of
the passenger, looking at the potential of what is outer authority, the true potential
of mind. The thing about outer authority is that when you're no longer occupied on
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LESSON TWO
Left, Right and Inner Hearing
the mental plane with the ‘this and that’ and the vagaries of your mundane life, that
your vehicle is operating correctly, that you're making decisions according to
Strategy and Authority, it opens up this possibility for the true outer authority of
your mind to be expressed. The expression of outer authority is something that is so
important for us if we are going to develop as a community, as a species.
The quality of communication that exists on this plane is one that is fraught with
deep, deep inherent dishonesty because of the way the not-self mind operates. That
we don't have what is the greatest boon in this life. That is, to have those in your
life whose observations, whose conversations are stimulating and are pleasurable in
the sense that they offer you something that is entertaining. After all, this is the
thing about the passenger. The physical life is not an entertaining thing, but the
passenger can be entertained by the physical life, it can be entertained by the movie
that it watches.
Outer Authority
And it is so important for us that these voices that are there, like anything else, but
in this case the voices of mutation. What is there to be expressed is pure outer
authority. And that pure outer authority carries the power to have a deep impact on
life. How important it is for us to be attuned to the mutative forces, how important
for us that we are able to communicate or be communicated to by those who have a
grasp of the mutation and the way in which the mutation is operating on this plane
so that we can take advantage of it, so that we are not one step behind and lost in
the muddle, lost in resistance, lost in the fears that come when things change.
Each and every one of you in your process, you are involved in what is a mutative
process. And as such, you break with the collective in this way and that. And slowly
but surely, what happens to you as you begin to find your place within this
frequency, this frequency of operating according to this mechanic, is that slowly your
outer authority begins to have greater and greater impact on the other.
And not in the sense that it is outer authority that has a purpose in the sense that
you're doing all this so you can be that. It's about understanding that the moment
that you're truly correct your level of articulation, the quality of the frequency of
what you deliver changes. It begins to carry its mutated potential. It begins to
provide a basis upon which the other, at some point, whether from the moment to
10 years, whatever, at some point that mutation may take hold. And the moment
that it does there is another victory. There is one more being that is ready to
confront the homogenized life and begin a process of extracting themselves from it,
breaking the covenant with it, so that they can operate correctly as themselves and
see what that is, just to see what it is.
The not-self is curious about everybody else. The not-self wants to know how many
times this couple, that actor, this actress what did they do, when did they do that,
blah, blah, blah. The most incredible story of all is to see the unfolding of your own
movie, because you have no appreciation of it. You can't until you fully enter into

your process and go through it and begin to see what's there. It’s the beauty that is
us.
And out of this comes our mutative process. It doesn't matter if you have
individuality or not. Most people have some individual aspects, because there are so
many of them in the BodyGraph. It's simply about understanding that this is the
way that it works, that the power of the acoustic field is based on your frequency.
It's your frequency. You can feel that in the other. You can feel that frequency
when they talk to you, when they tell you something, when they explain something.
This is the beauty of what it's like when you start doing analysis in Design and you
start before your seven-year cycle, and what it's like to do analysis after your seven-
year cycle in terms of the frequency that you put into the other. There is an
enormous difference. This is the mutative force at work.
Well, that was fun. It’s nice to return to the ears and to the acoustic. I hope all of
you enjoyed that. And until next time, all you take care, bye for now.

Lesson Three
The Nine Fuels
Hello and welcome, and to those that are downloading. I have an open Root Center
in my design. It is something that has been a great teacher for me in my life. And
having an open Root Center and dealing with the conditioning of the Root Center, it
has given me a profound insight into how effective the root is in determining the way
in which the vehicle itself is going to function. So it gives me an opportunity here in
Rave Anatomy to take a look at it and to take a look at it through the terminology of
fuel.
The Root Center
We think about the Root Center in terms of it being a motor, that is, one of the so-
called four motors in the vehicle along with the Sacral, the Solar Plexus and the ego.
But it's also a pressure center. It has a very complex function. And it is not a motor
in the same way that the Sacral, Solar Plexus and the Heart Center are motors. In a
sense, it is much more the fueling of all the potentials that are possible out of the
vehicle taking action, that it is here in the Root Center that the ingredients for
specific kinds of functions exist. It makes the Root Center very special.
I can remember a number of years ago at the Ibiza event doing the formats,
something again that I had not done in many, many years. The thing about this
combination of the Root Center being both a motor and a pressure, it was really an
opportunity to explore in a very deep way how profoundly the fuels influence us, and
in fact, influence us in so many diverse ways that in essence it is the source that one
can always go back to as the beginning of things.
We see that very clearly for example in the Rave New Year and the relationship of
the 41st gate and its relationship to the methionine codon, the initiating codon, a fuel
for starting things, this very, very powerful fuel, this fuel, in fact, of contraction.
Again, I really want you to grasp that what we're looking at in the Root Center is that
we're looking at the basic ingredients necessary. Remember something about fuels.
Each fuel is different in order to be exactly what is necessary for the end result,
whatever that end result happens to be, and in many cases, here for example, we
can look at it in terms of the streams of the circuits in which these are the source
ingredients.

Also understand that we have the same phenomenon in the mechanisms that we
create ourselves as a species, that is, the way we fuel a horse that pulls a cart is
different from the way we fuel a vehicle that we drive or an airplane or different
kinds of mechanisms that we have. Different fuels serve different purposes. And it's
important to think about the root in that way. Obviously, the traditional naming of
the Root Center inherited from the seven-centered chakra system is that this is the
source of so-called Kundalini. And again a much more primitive or earlier way of
looking at what we can just simply put into very simple mechanical language, though
Kundalini has a very nice twist to it as a word. The fact is that from the mechanical
point of view, what we're dealing with is a fueling system. And it speaks volumes
about the complexity of the Root Center.
The Undefined Root Center
What we're dealing with in each of these nine gates is that we're dealing with unique
pressures. They’re not similar, they're not the same. They are obviously different
from each other. And so there is a profound complexity in the root itself. It also
says a great deal about the phenomena of what it's like for somebody like me as an
example. That is, somebody with an undefined Root Center. The undefined root in
the not-self leads to an enormous amount of chaos. That is, it leads to the speeding
up of things and of course the speeding up of things always leads to errors,
problems, accidents, you name it, things missed, on and on and on.

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
When we're looking at the world and we’re looking at the hundreds of millions of
beings who are going to have an open Root Center to understand the enormous
pressure they’re under and how damaging it is for them to succumb to that pressure
because they end up being conditioned by fuel, by ingredients that are not correct
for what ultimately their own purpose is on this plane. And this is one of the most
devastating areas of conditioning, this conditioning in the open root.
Again, the beauty of the knowledge is that simple mechanics are what protect us,
Strategy and Authority is going to protect you from the influence of such a
conditioning element. But it's really important to understand how powerful that
conditioning can be. Not simply because you're simply taken down a specific track
that is not particularly yours, but it's the fact that you are being fueled by that, and
you're being fueled by an energy, a pressure that is not correct for you that you're
not equipped to handle. And of course, in the end what that leads to are dilemmas,
problems, physical, psychological and otherwise.
So, these fuels are enormously important. The Root Center is not sexy. This is the
whole thing about the root. You look at somebody's design and the root is not
something that you normally consider as a big item to look at. You’re looking at
Sacrals and Solar Plexuses and G Centers and Heart Centers and Spleens. It is a
very hidden element, in a sense. And it’s very locked out, as you can also see. That
is, it’s very limited in terms of what its direct influence can be, the direct influence in
the symmetry either to the left or to the right, to the Spleen, to the Solar Plexus or
the format energies that lay the foundation for the power column that drives up to
the top of the chart. It is basically something that is hidden away, in a sense, but it
is like the rocket engine, or the fueling tanks, is a better description of a rocket. This
is the driving force. This is the driving forces of the vehicle and these are the fuels.
The Splenic Side
Let's begin our journey here on the splenic side. Let’s think about something in
terms of the way in which we think about the immune system. The splenic system is
indeed fascinating. There is no question about it. It is fascinating in that it has
historical continuity through all of the various forms or evolutionary continuity. We
know that it is the most ancient of the so-called awareness systems. This is our
basic awareness, it is the awareness system that we inherited from our mammalian
roots, and it is basically an ability to be able to recognize and react to circumstance.
In other words, to be able to survive as a bioform in a world in which one is fragile
and the world is a difficult place.
But the thing that is so misleading in the symmetry of the BodyGraph because it has
its mysteries is that when we’re looking at the splenic system, the dilemma of the
splenic system is not its incredible potential, but its lack of power. It lacks power.
In and of itself, this is not a motor. So the function of the Spleen is deeply
dependent on having access to energy, having access to a fuel.

Now, we know that there are a number of connections in the sense of, for example,
the Sacral Center, the two connections of the Sacral to the immune system. And
clearly those are ways in which the immune system finds its energy resource. But in
terms of the way in which the streams and circuits of the immune system are
established, its most natural resource, the fuels that it seeks are here in the Root
Center.
The 58th Gate: Fuel of Vitality
And what does it bring? We’re talking about the empowerment of our ability to be
able to defend ourselves. It is the first thing to really recognize about it. And when
we start at the very beginning, that is, when we start with a foundation here of the
58th gate, I begin with the 58th gate because in fact this is a fuel that is so special.
That is, it is the fuel of vitality and this is the potential of sheer pleasure in simply
being alive. You see that in the 58.1, this joy of being alive.
This is an incredible energy, after all. And this vitality is absolutely necessary. What
I mean by that is that it is the most energetic, if I can put it that way, of the fuels
that are moving out of the Root Center. And everything about being alive as a form,
given the understanding that the immune system is about defending us and allowing
us to survive, that the most
important thing is our ability
to be able to discern and
ultimately to be able to
establish a viable pattern.
This is all about the future.
We're looking at logic here.
We’re looking at the logic
system. We’re looking at
the root of the logic system
as a fuel. Vitality is a logical
thing. Vitality is the
necessary fuel to be able to
challenge. To be able to
challenge any, any, any
pattern. The 18th gate, as
well as being an immune
system gate, is to understand its ability to break away from the pattern of the past
in order to be able to establish a viable pattern for the future. It is why every child
will ultimately challenge its parents. It’s inherent in this. It’s inherent in the
Oedipus/Electra of the 18th gate. It is inherent in the 18th gate being the symbol of
authority as the mother and father. Here is the vitality to challenge standards. Here
is the vitality to challenge stasis. Here is the vitality to challenge. Without it what
do we have?

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
Wherever I'm going to go today, I’m going to take you back to the great source,
because that's what the root is, and it deserves that respect for what it brings for us.
Because what is the 18 without its vitality? The 18 has a gift of being able to
recognize what needs to be corrected, fixed, whatever the case may be. But what
good is it if there is no vitality? It doesn't do anything. There is no possibility of
taking action. And of course, to be able to fight the stasis, to be able to deal with
the challenge, you need that vitality because it is quite a journey.
In the 58th gate we have the fuel that fuels judgmentation, to be able to judge. And
what I mean by that is to be able to discern, distinguish. It's their great gift. It is
the root of what ultimately when this stream becomes a circuit and gets to the
awareness, the Ajna awareness, it becomes logical thinking. After all, everything
that we understand about intelligence was born out of the Spleen, and ultimately
mutated with the emergence of the Ajna.
The 38th Gate: Fuel to Fight
When we are looking at this central system we are looking at what is individual. And
what we are looking at is, rather than judgmentation, we are looking at what we call
intuition. And everything about what is individual and intuitive is deeply acoustic.
And what we have in the 38th gate is that we have a fuel to fight. Again, you have to
think about the immune system and you have to think about what it is about
historically. It is about allowing us to survive. It's about making sure we have what
it takes to survive. After all, what we’re looking at here is the Channel of Struggle,
and that Channel of Struggle is a struggle to find one's purpose.
Once the pattern is established, and the pattern is secure, then what is life? There is
something more than just waking up, working and going to sleep. This is the energy
to struggle for purpose. It is a very specific fuel. Oh, yes, historically, if you look at
this channel in a mammal, as an example, it can be very aggressive, because after
all, as we well know in nature there are times when one has to be very aggressive to
survive. And yet, to see how it is distinguished in its humanness, this fight has a
specific fueling for a specific kind of fight. This isn't about fighting your neighbor;
you’ll find that in the 26. It can be fighting for your very life, but it really is fighting
for some purpose, some value in this life. What a fuel.
Everything about individuality in terms of the intuitive stream is transformed by this.
It is so fascinating about the 28/38 that it is the 28/38 that humanizes the
individual. And it is about this purpose, that inherent in this struggle for purpose is a
movement beyond the simple mammalian pattern. It’s something else. Because
this is an individual gate, and of course when we are looking at the root we have to
see that each of these sets of threes are keyed, in that sense, by the individuality,
the three individual gates that carry deep, deep, deep mutative pressure.
What one fights for, mutates. So first one fights for one's life, for territory. But
slowly, but surely the mutation is there and takes hold. There are other things to
fight for; to struggle for a dream, to struggle for a cause, and on and on. It led, by

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
the way, to a lot of bloodshed, but not directly. I don’t want to get into all that, but
nonetheless. It's a mutative force.
These mutative fuels are the ones that bring the greatest instability. They do. The
58 says, look, I put all my energy into establishing this pattern and this pattern is
great and the 38 is still fighting for something else. It makes everybody nervous.
There must be more. There must be something beyond this valley. There must be
something beyond this concept.
The 54th Gate: Fuel to Drive
The Marrying Maiden; do not judge the maiden; her moon is not full yet. It is
interesting to think about money. I’m going to do a money lecture next week. I
love doing money lectures. People are so fucked up about money. And to look at
the mechanics when you look at the Root Center because the Root Center is the
source of everything, remember, when you want to find a source, you really do in
that sense, you can find all of it in the Root Center.
And when we look at this fuel of drive, this is a material plane fuel. We call it the
gate of ambition. It is a very specific kind of fuel, very specific kind of energy. But
it's different. It's not the cold judgmentation of the 18/58. It's not there or not
intuition of the 28/38. Here we’re talking about the tribe and we’re talking about
instinct. We’re talking about a theme of support, instinctive support. It is something
that is very, very different. It is
not just simply a fuel that you can
look at somebody and say to
them that they are a selfish
ambitious “this or that.” Inherent
in this fuel is a communal drive
that belies all that. As a matter
of fact, the thing that is so
fascinating about the 54th gate is
that it is a fuel that is there to
make sure that the species
survives.
Think about what these gates do.
On the other side over here in the
splenic system, you have fear
gates, fear of authority, fear of
death, fear of failure. And think about what these energies, pressures do. They deal
with those things. They deal with the fear of authority by having the vitality to
challenge it. They deal with it. They deal with the fear of death and that life could
be purposeless by fighting to find some value in it, some purpose in it. And failure?
Failure is tribal. Authority is collective; failure is tribal. If your tribe fails, they all
die. It's not just you. It’s not just you and your “I have to find a meaning for life.”
It’s not, “this is the way the world should be.” This is your tribe.

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
So here in this fuel is a fuel that is there to get rid of this fear of failure, to deal with
it. It is a very, very powerful and essential force. It is the only material pressure,
the only one. And it says that material success has to be a success that benefits
others. And if it doesn't benefit others, if it is only benefiting you, there is real
dysfunction. This is inherent in this fuel. The Root Center that two-thirds of its job
is dealing with fears, it brings the energy for it. It brings the energy for the drive,
for the fight, it brings the vitality; it brings what is necessary so that the fears can be
dealt with.
The Solar Plexus Motor
Let’s go over to the mirror. There's a huge difference between the relationship of
the Spleen to the Root where the Spleen is a non-motor and becomes deeply, deeply
dependent on having these fuels. But the relationship here between the Root Center
and the emotional system is very different. In fact, it is a relationship that is built
on, I was going to say competition, but that would really anthropomorphize it too
much. These are competing forces.
First of all, the Solar Plexus motor. The Solar Plexus motor, as we well know, is a
motor that is operating in a wave. And because it’s operating in a wave, there is no
consistency to it. It is where the anxieties arise that are here in the Solar Plexus
system. When we’re dealing with the root, the root has a specific pressure that it
places on the Solar Plexus. And it is the only center that has the power to put
pressure on the Solar Plexus, and it puts real pressure on the Solar Plexus. And the
pressure that it brings to it is it's trying to lock the wave. It's trying to lock the
wave.
The 30th Gate and the 41st Gate: Fuel of Contraction
Think about the 30th gate. The 30th gate is in this wave of the emotional system.
And this 30th gate is a gate of desire. And the desire rises and falls, and rises and
falls. And the 41, this contraction, this contraction wants to narrow it down. It is,
after all, the Channel of Recognition, narrow it down to one thing and it tries to force
with its pressure to force the wave to shut down, to lock.
All of the mutation that is taking place in the Solar Plexus Center now, the mutation
that's taking place specifically in the 49 and the 55, both of them being histidine, the
55 obviously being the key, because it is individual and mutative, is that you have to
see that both the 19th gate and the 39th gate are having an enormous influence on
the way in which this mutation takes place because they are in fact, doing precisely
what the mutation ultimately is going to bring, shut down the wave. The wave is a
motor function. It is not what is underneath here, the underlying awareness. If you
shut down the wave, you begin to see the true symmetry between the Spleen and

the Solar Plexus, the emergence of Solar Plexus awareness and the emergence of
the completion of what is our awareness evolution in terms of our infrastructure.
So, everything about the relationship between the Root and the emotional system is
something that's very, very, very different. It’s pressuring it. It's just putting this
pressure on it. So here we have the pressure to recognize a feeling, a feeling so that
that can become what is the experiential direction that this is going to take. And so
in this fuel of contraction, what you're really getting to see is the honing down of all
the possibilities to one track. And this is where you get going. This is the genetic
metaphor. Here is the beginning. And the beginning cannot take place if there is
this vast confusion. There is this pressure to lock in on that one feeling and ride that
ultimately to the 35th gate through the experiential way in order to get to that place
of experience and progress.
There is no progress unless one can hone in on that feeling that will move one along
that experiential way. So, the impact of the pressure here is to lock the emotional
system. And of course, as I said it is competitive. It's not like it can keep it locked.
It can’t. Only a mutation can transform that. But this is the fundamental pressure
that is always there at work when the Root is pointed at the emotional system.
The 55th Gate and the 39th Gate: Fuel to Provoke
Here in this moodiness we have the 55th gate. Now, think about the 55th gate within
its sexual context. Within a sexual
context it is the gate of fickleness. Do
you love me? I don’t know. The “I don't
know” is part of the “I know/I don't
know” of what it is to be individual. And
there is this fickleness. Would you like to
have soup tonight? I don’t know. Yeah;
no, no, not really—this kind of not
knowing.
The whole thing about individuality is
individuality always annoys the
collective. And it annoys the collective
particularly in the not-self way in which it
operates. It annoys the collective in the way in which it deals with decision
situations. Somebody says to you, would you like to do something, and you’re
logical.
Basically, what you're doing is you're trying to see what that looks likes as a pattern
into the future and if it seems familiar to you as a pattern and you sort of see where
it's going then it's okay to make your decision. If you're an abstract person and
you’re offered to do something, you look backwards. You look at past experience to
see whether or not that's something that you’d like to do. But if you're an individual,
you don't know. And you don't know until you know.

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
I can always remember my father saying to me; make up your mind, which today is
hilarious. That's exactly what it would have had to be, make something up, because
in fact, I never knew until I knew. And I didn't know when I was going to know. So
here when you’re dealing with the 55 and you're dealing with this fickleness you
have to see what this pressure of provocation is really about. Lock in, stop being
this and that for a moment and find your point. And of course, this is about finding
the spirit.
It’s interesting to think about it in this context, that the dilemma of the spirit is that
there are so many things, there are so many things that there's nothing—the cup
half empty, the cup half full. Here you have this incredible fuel in the 39th gate, this
provocation. It’s there to provoke that fixing, that locking of the 55.
And of course, mutatively speaking this is what is going on here. This is going to be
the first place that emerges without a wave. It's interesting as well, because when
you think about the way in which the emotional wave itself operates in the individual
that the general tendency in individuals is to have a planing wave. That is,
individuals look more like this, actually tiny little ups and downs, but not the kinds of
things you really recognize and every once in a while they spike. Normally they
spike down. Or they can spike up, but normally they spike down. Their regular
process is just sort of floating along on this plane. And that plane, by the way, and
the peaks simply represent mutation. It is mutation that breaks one out of “I don’t
know,” to suddenly “I do know.” Where does that come from?
Again, what you're seeing here in the Root Center is the essential ingredients for the
way in which we operate; this mutative resource. If you don't understand this, it can
be very annoying. Root gates can really be annoying. They’re pressure. I know, I
have an open root—pressure. And of course, there is amplification of that pressure.
When somebody is provoking you, it can be very, very uncomfortable. And yet at
the same time to understand that that power is there, in essence, to lock the spirit,
to get it ultimately to begin to shine, so it too can continue its journey. That is, the
journey ultimately to the full mutation through the 12, and the ability to be able to
deeply mutate others with that spirit. That this is the only place where there is a
fuel that is there to provoke the spirit in a being.
The 49th Gate and the 19th Gate: Fuel to Support
I guess of all of the gates that intrigue me in this era of my work, certainly the 19th
gate is one of them. There is more transformation that is going to take place that
we are going to be aware of over the next decades through this channel and the way
in which this pressure operates. Because the 49th gate and the 55th gate are deeply
mutative at this time there is a transition in the way in which the competitiveness, in
a sense, between the Solar Plexus through the 49 and its relationship to the pressure
in the 19 that this is beginning to change.

It’s very difficult to read it right now. Difficult to read it because Neptune is in the
49th gate, it has been there for awhile and will continue to be there for a while. It
really masks whatever it is that is going on. But there is a faster and faster
developing deterioration in the function of this channel as we move towards 2027
and the change of the cycle. It means something very profound to understand that
this fuel to support, which is the bedrock of the tribe, that is, it is the bedrock of the
tribe being able to survive, to be able to nurture its young, to be able to protect itself
in communities, to be able to expand, all these things.
The 19th gate is an incredible pressure. It's the pressure to have a shared belief
system. It's the pressure to have reliable resources. It's the pressure to have very,
very detailed and profound bargains in the way in which human beings deal with
each other and owe allegiance to each other in one way or another. It is the
pressure to be loyal. There are so many things that are rooted in the 19th gate. The
19th gate is really quite a thing.
And to understand, first of all, in the traditional sense of what this is. Again, the 49th
gate is in a wave. And in this wave of being, in terms of its principles, and in terms
of whether or not it's going to deal with what's on the other side. Again, in sexuality
it’s much easier to see the relationship. The 19th gate is a gate that flirts. And the
49th gate is a gate that has the principles, and the principles are, if you get my
attention, I'll provide you with resources, you stop flirting. It’s this kind of a process
going on. But the whole thing about the 19th gate is that through that ability it's able
to lock the 49 in to this relationship and lock the 49 into this relationship so that
synthesis can take place. And that the resources and needs of the tribe are going to
be supplied.
Understand that when we’re dealing with this 19th gate, we are dealing with the
pressure to need, and they need the support. And the support is built into the need.
Again, in the same way that we can understand the tribal ambition that if it isn't
good for everyone, the tribe is going to suffer. If the tribe isn't under pressure to
have the same set principles, if the principles are constantly going to change, the
tribe will not hold together; the need for the fixing of this.
These essential processes, this is everything that leads to the way in which our
minds work. It is the way in which we define the nature of our lives, the way we are
driven. It's all rooted in these pressures. And these pressures determine what the
qualities of our lives are actually going to be. They determine the way in which
these various elements are going to operate, particularly when you're looking at
these streams here in which everything is there, the abstract, the logic, the
individual, the tribal, this is the source.
Anyone who really wants to take an intellectual adventure into the depths of Human
Design is that through these nine gates there isn't anything about a human being
that you can't understand, that is, as a general grasp of the nature of what it is to be
human, because after all, these are the fuels and everything that is going to arise
out of that is going to be rooted in the fuel and the kind of fuel that is necessary.

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
The Abstract
The 53rd Gate: Fuel to Begin
Formats are really a very profound thing. And obviously here today I'm just sort of
giving you overviews of these things. But I want to look at them just specifically
from the context of today, that is, just through the fuel itself. To begin with the
abstract, when we talk about the human experiential way, and again, understanding
the source of the human experiential
way it is here, we are talking about an
abstract process.
It says a great deal about us as
humans. It says we are driven by
desire. This is what inherently is there
in the quality of this fuel; it is a desire
for experience. It is a desire for
progress. It is the desire to evolve, all
those things are there.
When we look at the format of the
abstract way, that is, again to see the
way in which its central themes are
empowered that in looking at the 53rd gate what we're looking at is a gate to begin,
not in the sense of the 41, that is, the starting of an experiential process, but this is
about how one deals with experience within the life. In other words, to begin a new
experience and to begin a new experience this gate can be a torment as a fuel.
Think about what that's like, you have the 53rd gate and you're in a relationship.
That 53rd gate, particularly as not-self constantly is going to say to you, wouldn’t it
be nice to have something new. I’d like to have a new experience; I’d like to do
something different. This is the deep drive within the experiential being not to have
one experience, but to have many, many, many experiences. So this fuel to begin is
met, of course, by a Sacral gate. And again we have the third of our center
relationships. Again, we are dealing with this direct connection between what is in
fact the primary motor on the planet, that is, the creative reproductive fertile motor
and its relationship to the pressure system.
To one degree or another because they are different forces like in the relationship
between the Root and the Solar Plexus there are certain tensions that result in the
meeting of these forces. As a channel they become something that is greater than
the sum of its parts. Our work today is just to see the part. So, this pressure to
begin. Everything about life and the quality of life is that the abstract says that
everything needs to be lived out in order to be substantiated. The abstract being is
busier, in that sense, in the diversity of their life than somebody who would be logic,
who would find their pattern, their habits, would structure their process.

43
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
And the abstract wants something else. It wants to go through different
experiences. It can be very difficult to have the fuel to begin and not have the 42,
as an example, which is really about, aside from its name the obvious of growth, it is
really about being able to bring things to a close, beginnings, middles and ends. This
is the abstract way. And whether the beginning, middle and end is a minute, an
hour, a day, a year is not the point. It’s to go through the experiences.
So the pressure that is there in the 53rd gate is the pressure in us to keep on adding
to our experiences. This can be a dilemma for many. And yet at the same time to
understand how profound that is for us. It means that if we look around us at the
diversity of our experiences, when you look at this planet today and the number of
different ways in which human beings have done this or that, you get to see the real
fulfillment of what the experiential process is about, and that our lives are not like
our ancestors lives in which there was very little to distinguish one day from another.
In fact, we are at a point in which there is so much experiential potential available
that it is confusing.
The Logic
The 52nd Gate: Fuel to Focus
On the other side, to jump to the other side, to go to the logic, to go to this
pressure, this fuel to focus. You can see how different these forces are. One says,
oh, I want to do many, many, many, many, many things and the other one says, no
I’m going to do one thing. I’m going to focus; I’m going to lock in. I don’t want to
be jumping around, I want to lock in. Keeping Still Mountain is a great name, what a
power.
For me, it’s the most extraordinary fuel in a way because it is a fuel of refinement, if
you will. It is very, very, very, very specific in the way in which it will be released.
How powerful that is for the logical process. And that leads to the ability to have the
energy for the detail work in the 9th gate that leads to the formation of the habits in
the 5th gate and the proper rhythm in the 15. And ultimately that leads to the ability
to find a role to lead others because the pattern is secure. And it’s all back down
here at the source in this power to focus, this pressure to focus. What is the point of
having all those details in the 9, the energy for all those details if you don't know
which one to focus on, and in which order and at which time.
Format energies are just that; they are the basic fundamental fuels of this whole
power column that goes all the way up to the top of the graph. This is the
underlying pressure that is there in us that we are here to demonstrate as humans,
we’re here to have many experiences, we’re here to be able to focus in them,
because after all, if you see this as a whole you can see that each and every one of
these, if you bring them all together they are describing what it is to be us. It’s us.
We have the vitality and the drive to fight. We have the ability to recognize so that
we can have the support to provoke. It is the focus on the beginning that gives us

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
the restraint and it goes on and on, if you play keynote games. It's us. It’s what
human is because this is the source.
The Individual
The 60th Gate: Fuel of Restraint
And finally when we come to the individual in the center we come to the 60th gate,
the gate of limitation. This is one of the more interesting relationships that exist
between the Sacral and the Root in terms of the formats. In so many ways there is
a kind of reversal that takes place here. The 60th gate is a huge resource. It is a
huge resource of information, it is limitation. The whole thing about that limitation is
that this is an energy to hold back, it literally is. It is an energy to hold back. It is
the great pause in the pulse of the human experience. Again, the 3/60 is a pulse.
This is a very unique way in which it operates. And in this pulse, mutation is going
to take place in that sense between those pulses.
The 60th gate in its restraint is holding back and it is waiting for the 3 in order to be
able to pull out a pressure, to pull it out, in a sense. And it's only the 3 that can
break that restraint. And in breaking it allow for the emergence of a true mutation.
No other channel carries more
mutative potential than the 3/60.
Nothing is as mutatively powerful as
the 3/60, and it has nothing to do with
the tribe or the collective, it is deeply,
deeply, deeply individual.
The interesting thing about the
dynamic of it is it’s like the 60th gate is
the pilot in the cockpit of evolution that
lets out what's necessary when the
time is right mutatively. But
otherwise, it is the restraint that holds
back what would be a deeply confusing
flooding of mutative potential, let's put it that way. The 60 is really a control
mechanism, limitation after all. And as this control mechanism it is the thing that is
guiding us in terms of when the possibility of mutation will exist. It's the theme. It’s
also interesting to note that in the Root the relationship between the 60th gate and
the 41st gate in terms of the wheel, that is, that the 41st gate starts the cycle and the
60th gate is the last gate in the cycle of the solar cycle.
In looking at the Root Center if you begin any deep examination of it or any
deconstruction of its aspects, again you get to see that in here lies all of the
resources of what it is to be us. It says a great deal about how uncomfortable and
how unhealthy it is if you're somebody that has an open Root Center and you're not
operating correctly, or if you're somebody who has a defined Root Center and you're
not operating correctly. And of course, it's about not operating correctly, obviously.

Undefined Root Center
But think about the undefined Root to begin with; think about the power that is there
in these pressures and to recognize that these pressures are going to be amplified.
And that they are not natural to the person who's taking them in as a conditioning
element. One of the most distorting aspects of our lives is to be conditioned via the
Root. It just is. And think about what happens when a Root person steps into the
aura of somebody with an undefined Root, they automatically put them under
pressure, whatever the pressures may be. And of course, because they're put under
pressure and the pressure is amplified, the not-self responds to that very, very
rapidly. We know that in the not-self strategy of the open Root, that is, to be in a
hurry. To be in a hurry, to get rid of things, to move fast, get rid of that pressure,
get rid of that pressure.
Defined Root Center
The other thing is that beings who have a defined Root, though they put others
under pressure, are not under pressure themselves. It is not natural for them to be
under pressure. But then again, when you look at the not-self beings that have
defined Roots that do not operate correctly, they’re under terrific pressure, because
despite the fact that they have a defined fuel from somewhere, the fact is that
because they’re not-self they're trying to be other things that require other fuels,
and ultimately it creates problems. Many of which are physical, because in fact, if
you are defined from the Root to the Spleen or to the emotional system and you are
not functioning correctly, then you are going to suffer the consequences of that.
Illness
I remember many, many years ago when I was doing a lecture for medical health
people. They wanted to know the obvious question, does it mean that all disease, all
these problems are in the openness. I said oh, no, most of the illness today is the
dysfunction in what is defined, much more so than the openness. In my career I've
known maybe 30 or 40 people who have had their thyroid glands removed, who had
the Throat defined and most of them the 20/34. That’s very common. And the thing
to recognize about that is that the fact that what is defined in you is your key in this
life doesn't mean that it works for you if you're not working for it. It just doesn't.
And if you're not operating correctly, the very aspect that is there in you that you're
there to benefit from is something that is going to rapidly turn against you, it just
will.
It's why it's so essential to understand why I put this endless stress at every level
that I teach on Strategy and Authority. What I teach you is to open up the
entertainment of being able to see the mechanics of things. It is a delight in that
sense. But, in understanding any mechanic is no solution in your life. That is, being

LESSON THREE
The Nine Fuels
aware of these things doesn't mean that your mind then is capable of taking
advantage of that and making mental decisions to compensate.
That's the old seven-centered way of understanding things: knowledge is power.
This is information. Power is in your authority. This is where the power is for you to
be correct as a being in this life. It is in your authority. And whatever your
configuration happens to be, whatever your aspects happen to be, they will function
correctly if you're making the right decisions. As long as your decision making
process is correct, then everything about you as a being, everything about your
frequency, it is going to be correct.
So, it's always good to remind you of that. And also, it was great to have this
opportunity once again to look at the Root and to point some of you to not simply its
complexity, but its real beauty. It’s an incredible source in all of us. Anyway, I
enjoyed that. I hope you did, too. To all of you, until next time, bye for now.

Lesson Four
The Fork in the Road
Okay, good morning to all of you. There’s an awful lot of downloading so I hope you
have a good sleep. I guess the whole reasoning behind my doing more Rave
Anatomy is because it gives me an opportunity to just talk about certain facets of the
BodyGraph that really fascinate me. That is, I can still quite clearly remember
drawing it for the first time, that is, drawing out the BodyGraph. It's probably the
only really absolutely vivid memory I have from all those years back of my
encounter.
I can remember the sensation of watching the circuitry come alive. I think that from
that moment onward, because I had no real foundation, it wasn't like I was taught
how to interpret the graphing system. I really wasn't, I was just given the basics.
At least as far as I can tell I was given just sort of very basic things about it all.
I spent I guess the first three or four years after that point an enormous amount of
time physically drawing these charts and contemplating them not in terms of what
modern analysis is all about, which is very different, but trying to understand it from
the point of view of just seeing the way in which the circuit board itself operated.
And there were certain things that
just stood out for me. I guess the
subject today is one of those things
that has always seemed to me to be
so different, in a way.
This isn’t the ideal illustration to show
you, but I think anytime you look at a
BodyGraph when you look at the
heart system and you look at the
construct of it, that is, the tribal
circuitry that is running along like
that, that in a sense it breaks the
whole symmetry of the chart. It
really does. It's very, very different.
I can remember when I was first
getting ready to do the first publications in Design working on the translation of my
drawings into the technical aspects necessary for it to be programmed. One of the
questions that I was asked quite a bit in that era was whether I was interested in
developing a 3-D depth, or that kind of perspective. Basically the question I was
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2007 Jovian Archive Corporation
49
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
asked was what we're looking at as a two-dimensional drawing, the question asked
to me was is it two-dimensional. In other words, is this just a translation of a three-
dimensional phenomenon into a two-dimensional graphic, was basically the question.
And my answer consistently was always yes, because of course, when I first saw the
graph in the sense of—it’s very hard to describe that—but anyway, it was clear to me
that there was a difference and
the difference was that if you're
really looking at the Heart
Center—I mean again,
examination of the BodyGraph,
look at this channel. It’s a very
odd channel. We know it as the
channel 44/26, which is the
channel of the transmitter, and it
is one of the most important
channels in terms of the early
stages of development, that is,
the first 88° after conception, this is perhaps in many ways the most significant
stage in the development of the fetus in that it really establishes the viability of the
immune system.
But if you look at it, the thing that is very
interesting to notice is that this channel goes
behind these three. It could have been drawn
the other way, if you know what I mean. That is,
it could have been drawn going over the top, as it
is here. It is just something to notice. That is, it
is one of the things that I hope ultimately out of
all the Rave Anatomy things that I do—in the
course of time I do plan on a final Rave Anatomy
III which will be
mostly oriented to
genetics—I hope
you get to see the
BodyGraph with new eyes.
One of the things to recognize about the Ego Center,
or the Heart Center, is that if we were thinking about it
three-dimensionally, it is deeper in the body, let's put
it that way, it is behind the main framework. And then
it gets intertwined into it. And it's very interesting just
to see how different this system really is. But that, of
course, is not really my point today. My point is the
fork in the road, and here you can see the fork; that is,
these two possible ways.

LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
The Heart Center
Let’s begin with the Heart Center. When you first begin to study Human Design and
you’ve been given an introduction into the nature of the centers and their affiliations
to what is generally the endocrine system, that when you look at the centers in the
way in which they are configured relative to the biology, it is obvious that the most
complex of all the centers is the Heart Center. I mean, it is just simply obvious.
It's obvious in the sense that if you're dealing with the Throat Center, which appears
to be the most complex, after all, there are 11 gates that function out of the Throat
Center, that with the Throat Center basically you're simply dealing with the thyroid
system, the thyroid and the parathyroids, but you’re basically dealing with one
system. And despite the fact that we well know that the thyroid system is an
essential ingredient as a messenger and that its ability through those 11 gates to tap
into the whole system is something that is obviously complex and sophisticated, it’s
still rooted in one biological generalization, if I can put it that way.
Biological Associations
But when you're looking at the Heart Center you have something that's totally
different. The 21st gate is related to the heart muscle itself, the 40th gate is related
to the stomach, the 51st gate to the gall, the 26th gate to the T cells of the thymus
and the immune system. When you're looking at the Heart Center in that way and
you're looking at those four gates, you have to recognize how each of those gates
has an inordinate impact. In other words, you're dealing with a very, very deep
complexity that is here.
What we know essentially about the Heart Center is that in many ways it is a minor
Throat Center. And what I mean by that, so as not to confuse you, is that
technically speaking when you're looking at the Throat Center all roads lead there.
Technically it is the place where everything goes, and we've seen that as we’ve
looked through our Rave Anatomy process and other classes in Design, that you see
that the larger circuits—I use that language, that is, collective circuitry, the logic, the
abstract, individuality—that all of that finds its expression in the Throat.
More important than that, the potentials that are there within those particular
circuits, and potentials that in essence are established in the awareness centers, that
all of them have this direct relationship, this direct connection to the Throat. So we
can see that through the Spleen or through the Solar Plexus system or through the
Ajna that everything in that sense is pointed towards that potential to manifest and
to manifest primarily as verbal expression.

51
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
Tribal Circuitry: Expression through Willpower
But of course, the moment we’re looking at the tribe, right away we see something
that is very, very different. The fact that the tribe has a voice in the Throat that is
the 45th gate you can see how overwhelmed it is by everything else. That is, logic
has three aspects in the Throat and abstract has three aspects and individuality has
four aspects in the Throat and there's the tribe with its one. And it doesn't come
from the Spleen or the Solar Plexus, it doesn't come from the Ajna, it is coming out
of the ego. And that everything about the developmental potential of the tribe is not
focused on the Throat at all. It is focused on the Heart Center.
The 45/21 isn’t really a part of tribal circuitry, though I know that formally you were
taught that, because obviously it becomes the expression of the tribe. But when I
was given the knowledge, the 45/21 was something that was established as being
truly separate. You don't really get to see that in ordinary Human Design
knowledge, you really don't. Where that is something that is significant and where
the real essence of the 45/21 is really displayed is when you look at the WA, or as
it's understood in business analysis, OC 16, that is, larger group configurations. This
is a channel that is the thematic of large organized groups.
The 45/21 as a material channel, the so-called money line, has always been
something in and of itself. It’s why this whole discussion about the fork in the road,
because in fact, when we are looking at tribal circuitry, everything about tribal
circuitry is about expression through willpower. It's not about verbal expression. It
isn't. And it isn't about having leaders who boss
you around, control you, tell you what to do, and
tax the hell out of you. It really isn't.
It’s one of the things to think about that if anything
is really grafted on in this circuit board, it's the
45/21 that's really grafted onto this design, if I can
put it that way. It is really not what this is all
about, because everything about the Heart Center
in terms of understanding its function holistically,
because the most fascinating thing about the Heart
Center is to understand that when you're looking at
the first 88° of life after conception so that you're looking at the 10 stages, the thing
to see so clearly is that the Heart Center is a downward instrument of the
development of the human potential.
Everything has to take this road.
But when you're looking at it the other way, in
other words, when you're looking at it in terms
of the way it’s evolved and the way in which we
operate, that this here is a self-enclosed system,
and it has two graphs on it that link it into the
BodyGraph as a whole. It’s as if you're looking
at this, that this quadrangle, what is the basic
essence of tribal circuitry, that this is something
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

52
LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
that in a sense is grafted into the whole vehicle by the links that are established in
these two areas. This is the way that it's connected to everything else.
The Tribe is Not Connected to the Collective
The tribe is very different. And one of the things to understand about the tribe is
that it's only through this fork in the road that you see where the tribe has any
opening to anything other than its tribal concerns. It's not connected to the
collective. It really is not interested in the collective, no matter where you look on
this planet. It doesn't matter whether you're dealing with the most sophisticated
tribes or the most primitive tribes; there is nothing that frightens them more than
collective homogenization. It does.
One of the things for example, that you see in Europe, because Europe is a classic
environment to see the development of tribalism at its most sophisticated level,
because it is incredibly sophisticated within the modern context of what Europe is.
And despite the fact that Europe has developed a deep and profound collective
experiment since the Second World War and that there has been both prosperity and
peace generally speaking throughout Europe, wherever you look you will see small
tribes threatened by the momentum of the collective process.
It’s these small tribes, wherever you happen to look, whether it is Basques for
example here in Spain. It could be any number, by the way, of regional clans in so
many different countries, like what is going on in Belgium, as an example, between
the Flemish and Walloons. And you get to see that tribes are deeply, deeply
threatened by the collective, they don't like the collective process. They don't like
losing their identity. and whether that collective is experienced within federated
states or whether that collective is experienced through the gathering of nations, the
fact is that all of these small tribes still want to hold on to their essential nature
because they do not have a connection with the collective.
The Heart Center: Three Tribal Gates/One Individual
Here in this fork in the road, one of the things that is so interesting about the Heart
Center is that three of its gates are deeply, deeply, deeply tribal. But one of them
(51) is very, very, very individual. And of course this is the brilliance of genetics, the
genetic imperative, the way in which a bioform maintains its viability and the
richness of its gene pool. The tribe cannot survive in a closed permanent
environment. It cannot. We know what happens, you end up with inbreeding, you
end up with increasing dysfunction in the tribal line and you end up with the
possibility that the tribe itself cannot survive.
One of the main demands of the tribe in terms of its tribal imperative is to make sure
that the gene pool is regularly refreshed. I used to talk about this in terms of the
famous traveling salesman jokes, about the individual urban salesperson going into

backwoods farm country trying to sell some kind of product, and of course always
being seduced into cliché by the farmer's daughter.
The thing about the tribe is that the tribe will accept any individual as long as the
individual will pay certain homage to the cultures and traditions of the tribe. So
you’re the outsider in terms of your faith, marrying into a tribal group, so you
change your faith in order to accommodate it, so forth and so on. What the tribe
wants is it wants your new genetic material. It also means that because the tribe is
designed to be open in a limited way to the influence of the individual, the individual
bringing mutation to the genetic pool, it also means that the tribe in that way and
that way only is open to mutation itself; in other words, the transformation of the
tribe.
Leadership: Struggle between Church and State
Where this leads to is a different kind of leadership. And leadership is really one of
the themes of the fork in the road. That is, we have two kinds of leaders that are
historically represented by these two channels.
And the leaders basically sit in the place of the
end result of this forking of the path. When we
get to the 45 we have the obvious. That is, we
have the obvious of the Emperor, the Empress,
the king the queen, the ruler of the tribe; this is
the force that is going to guide the tribe. And of
course, it represents what we would call the state.
And when we come over here to the 25/51 we
come to what is inherently a mystical channel.
Obviously, on the mundane level it is all about
competition, it is a design to be first, this channel
of initiation. And yet, historically, the 25th gate is
the gate of the priest and the priestess. That is, it
is the other side of authority.
In other words, the incredible battle that took
place for a millennia between who was going to be
in charge, whether it was going to be the inherited tribal leader that was going to
make all the rules, whether the king was going to be the final word or the queen,
and in this case whether it was God's Word that was going to be the final word, and
of course we had this struggle between church and state.
This is not a struggle that's ever disappeared, after all. It is still something that is
very much a part of the world we live in today, particularly with the vitality of Islam
and the aspect of Islamic thought that feels that theocracy, that is, the rulership of
the religious, that theocracy is ultimately the only way that the tribe should be ruled.

LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
And you can see that the tribe here, this fork in the road is a big story, because for
the tribe there are just simply two ways to go, and both of those ways are control
mechanisms. Here one is being controlled by the tribal leadership (45), the king that
says “I've decided we go to war, give me all your young boys.” Or on this side the
priesthood (51) that says, “We haven't had rain, give me your babies for sacrifice.”
Neither one can be pretty. The fact is that these are control mechanisms that are
there.
Now, when I say that, all of this is about the not-self. You can only really
understand our history by understanding the not-self. This is not the way in which
the potential of these energies or the potential of these different directions can work
in terms of what it is to be correct and what it is to operate correctly. But again,
we're all living within the same circuit board. And so, the homogenized world is
always dealing with these two forces, always.
Third Way of Leadership: Democracy
No matter what has happened to us, the fact is that there
is a third way (31-7) in which we are really led, and that
third way is what we call democracy. That is, the
collective logical approach in which patterns are offered,
and in those patterns being offered a need for those
patterns to be supported through recognition. Obviously,
this is something that lacks a motor. And we can see that
the collective leader does not have, cannot have the same
power that these two forces have, because the power that
is inherent in the tribal leader, the power that is inherent
in the priest is a power that is driven by will. Willpower is
an incredible thing.
The Power of the Tribe
And when you think that 65% of humanity—you’ve got to figure that out, that’s a lot
of people—have this (ego) open, this is the amplification of will. That this is an
amplification and conditioning on the tribe to follow the leadership of these forces
and reject the collective. You’ve got an incredible example of this today in Kenya.
Africa has consistently had its dilemmas in this century, this past century. And
Kenya has been one of those places where one really had a sense that the folly of
colonialism perhaps could be solved here. And I say the folly of colonialism because
it is all about tribalism. In the end that is the dilemma.
And of course, the colonial rulers, whoever they happen to be, whether they were
British or French or Portuguese or whoever was involved in Africa, their tendency
was to take one tribe in an area and make that tribe their favorite and to give that
tribe all kinds of power. And so, in creating these artificial nations, because there

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
are no true nations in the African continent, in that sense, they are constructs that
were created through conquering and colonialism, you end up with these strange
anomalies in which you have many, many tribes in the same collective nation. And
amongst those tribes is a visceral distrust and often hatred for the other.
Kenya was one of those examples in which it seemed to work. In other words, the
collective patina of creating this nation, I guess through Jomo Kenyatta, who is really
the father of modern Kenya, there was really this attempt. Now, there are two really
big tribes in Kenya and they just had an election. It was obviously fixed. People in
power don't like giving it up. And people who are tribal leaders and of course the
two main candidates each come from the two biggest tribes and the tribal leader in
power didn't want to give up his power to the collective vote, so he fixed the
election. And he says that he won and he has himself immediately certified, and so
forth and so on.
And this collective patina breaks down instantly. The tribe doesn't trust the
collective, and the tribe will reject the collective if the collective goes against the
tribe. And you can see that so clearly about the tribe, it has no access to, it has no
relationship, in that sense, to the collective. It doesn't.
The easiest way to understand that is to look at the head/Ajna mind system. And
you look at that and there's no tribe. There isn’t. There are no tribal channels
there; it’s all collective or individual. So, the tribe doesn't trust all that. It doesn't
trust the collective concepts; it doesn't trust the collective processes. It doesn't. It's
only when its tribal leaders go along with it that it's okay. It is the only way that it
works. It’s only when the tribal leader says, look, we’ll look after our own business
here in the tribe but we will also be a part of this larger collective, okay? Okay.
The Changing Cycle
We can see one of the major dilemmas that is soon going to be rising, and it’s here,
because obviously if we’re talking about the fork,
we have to see what this is because this is what
establishes it. And of course, it’s the channel of
community. And since 1610 we're living in a
global cycle which includes this channel, the 40/37
along with the 9 and 16, that is, the Cross of
Planning cycle. Think about it. That is, humanity
doesn't know anything else. I think that those of
us that are going to be able to survive at least into
the middle part of this century for the next 20, 30
years, we're going to begin to see an enormous
change.
And in 2027, when the cycle physically changes,
there is really going to be a certain shattering that
takes place, because this is what we’re used to. We’ve lived in an age in which the

LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
tribal bargain is at the root of our success. It's interesting when you look at the
Cross of Planning that it is the balanced contribution of both the collective, that is,
the 16th gate, the gate of enthusiasm in the channel of talent, the gate of a logical
identification. And that 16th gate opposite the 9th gate, that energy that is there to
do the detailed work to really dig into things, our era of science, the whole glow of
what has come with the development of the infrastructure and the development of
the infrastructure tailored to the tribe. Tailored to the tribe because in the Cross of
Planning the 40/37, despite the fact that it each has two gates represented in the
cross, the 40/37 being an opposition that is a definition, is very, very powerful and
takes dominance.
The Cross of Planning
We have a social contract. It is in this age, that era of the Cross of Planning, that
that language emerged, the foundation of the French Revolution, the American
Revolution, this contract, the Marxist revolution. Wherever you want to look,
regardless of what the results are, suddenly this need to have a contract between
those that govern and those that are governed, that there is a bargain. And the
bargain is inherent for the well-being of the people, because what you're dealing with
here is you're dealing with the stomach and you're dealing with the mouth.
In other words, you're dealing with the breadbasket issues. And it is those
breadbasket issues that is the survivability of the tribe, its ability to be nourished, to
be protected, to be held together morally through principles, to be held together
spiritually through the glue of a specific faith, that all of this has been inherent in this
age, all of it. And so what we have seen is the flourishing of certain tribes. The
tribes of Europe are a classic example, and of course they ultimately spread that by
the very power of the development of their technologies and ultimately their
colonialism. There are rivals in all kinds of different parts of the world and settling in
different parts of the world.
Secularism
What we’re looking at is an age that has been built on this power. And you can see
that in the last 150 years or so, you can see the beginning of the emergence of the
challenge to this power and the challenge to this power by the collective, by logic
alone, by the logical collective saying that we should not be ruled by the bosses and
we should not be ruled by the bully pulpit. We are here to be part of legitimate
forces in the way in which our lives are determined, that we have a right to involve
ourselves, to vote, as an example, the collective democratic process, what ultimately
is secularism. This is secularism.
The ruler of the tribe is always going to be one in faith with the rest of its tribe,
though it doesn't necessarily have to rule by spirituality, and traditionally they did
not. But for example, in England when it broke with the Roman Catholic Church, the
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

king immediately declared himself the head of the Church, and those things, the
battles that took place between these two. But the fact of the matter is that we
have this tripartite process, and that the rise
of the collective democratic challenge to
these forces has been very, very powerful.
And you can see that the tribe has simply
figured out a way to make another deal.
That's what it's done. It's figured out a way
to make another deal.
If you go into any of these areas where you
have individual tribal groups within a larger
configuration, you'll see that the people that
they vote for, they're voting for on tribal
lines. They vote for those people, they're not
going to vote outside of their tribe, they're not going to vote outside of their faith;
they are not going to vote outside of that. But they're going to vote for a tribal
leader who is going to participate in the collective. In that way, they maintain their
power with their people and at the same time the responsibility of the 45 is to make
sure that the tribe does well. And that the tribal leaders understand in this era that
if they don't integrate that their people are going to suffer economically, so they
integrate. Here (25) is where the challenge is.
And you can see again, even in the most modern societies, the impact of secularism
and its effect on the priesthood, its effect on religious guidance, here is where you
see this enormous transition taking place in this 25/51, because this whole initiation
process is beginning to break with this priesthood process. All of this is being
encouraged by secularism. This is what the challenge of the 31/7 has brought to this
powerful construct that is here.
Following One’s Own Principles
So let's go back for a moment. The tribe is held
together in the deepest possible way. That is, it is
held together through mutual support and mutual
support is expected. If there is an election in a
collective environment and you have your tribal
member who is there and you have somebody else
who's running against him that is outside of the tribe,
part of the collective environment, it is expected,
even if your tribal leader is a corrupt ignorant fool
you're going to vote for him, and you’re going to
vote for him because he's one of yours.
And yes, there will be a few who don't do that.
They're going this way. And they're going this way
not in the sense of looking for the guidance of the

LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
priest, because what has happened to the tribe, because both of these are
threatened by the power of the collective secular, is that they have joined hands. So
there is confusion now in these roles.
And what you have is the beginning of this breakthrough in terms of following one's
own principles. Yes, but this other person is actually a better candidate, and they
seem clean, and they seem like they'll do a decent job and I'm tired of seeing my tax
money go into construction projects that make other people rich, including the
people I just elected, so forth and so on, because the corruption in power is
something that one can never, ever escape.
So there is a transition that is taking place in all of this. And what is happening is
that the tribe is under pressure in a way that it’s never been under pressure before.
It doesn't necessarily trust that its leaders that are controlling it through the 21, that
its leaders are really doing the best for it. And what you really get to see in this era
of the power of the secular collective democratic state is that you get to see the tribe
making greater and greater demands on their leaders to stand up for the
continuation of tribal survival. They do not want to go quietly into the night. This is
not what they’re interested in.
And of course, they're creating a lot of pressure, which means that there is a
breakdown in loyalty within the tribe itself. Again, it’s one of the things you see. I
described to you how the tribal leaders have adapted to the collective process by
holding onto their tribal control and at the same time agreeing to participate in the
larger collective process. What happens within the tribe itself is that the tribe begins
to get varied aspects of the tribe, elements within the tribe, usually younger forces
within the tribe that feel that this 45 is selling out.
It's making accommodations to the collective in order to line its own pockets and in
essence is holding its people back and in that aspect you get that aspect of the tribe
that wants independence. They’re the ones that want to break away from this; they
want to create their own little nation, even if there are only 26 people, whatever it is,
they want to create their own little nation that can be run in their own little tribal
way in which the illusion of democracy is there. But in fact, it is simply a neo-
tribalism.
Political Class 101
This is my political class 101; it’s the beauty of the fork. It gives you a very, very
deep insight into the underlying mechanics that are there. And again, to understand
something, this driving force that this is all about, because after all, if the bargain
isn't the theme, if the tribe doesn't believe it has a right in its bargain to be dealt
with, to have what it needs, the protection of its culture, and so forth and so on, that
as long as this (40-37) is the driving force, then there is going to be tremendous
tension in the way in which these aspects (45, 25) traditionally have functioned.
They are going to begin to break down.

The traditional tribal ruler, which was somebody who inherited that position, that is,
from father to son in most cases, that traditional tribal rulership is being challenged
by new tribal voices that don't belong to a tradition of always being at the head of
the table. There is a challenge that is coming for control of the tribe based on the
fact that the tribe has failed to stand on its own and has been swallowed up in the
secularism.
And again, you can see in tribes which have been dominated by theocracy, tribes
that have been dominated by their moralities that in these tribes you have the
strongest reaction. In other words, for them, for somebody who is radically
fundamental Islamist, there is nothing more horrifying than the secularized
democratic mongrelized society. From their perspective I certainly can see it. They
look out and they see everything that is there that can destroy what is their power
and their control in their society.
The Breakdown of the Tribe
And of course, this is the great dilemma of our time and it's a dilemma that is
growing more powerful because of the decay of what the root of all of this is. This
(40/37) is what's breaking down. This is where the dilemma is going to be, because
when we no longer have this contract as the background theme, and it’s the
transition that we move to in 2027, when this contract isn't there anymore, the
whole power of the tribe is going to fall apart. And of course, that means that you're
going to have deep, deep reaction. It is the time that we live in.
As a matter of fact, the breakdown of the tribe began at the beginning of the 1960s.
That is, it began with the precession of the equinox. We retrograded into the 1st line
of the 37, on our way to retrograding into the 6th line of the 55 where the mutation is
going to take place and where the Cross of the Phoenix is going to become the
dominant theme, the dominant background frequency. We're going to move away
from what has been over 400 years of dominance by tribal concerns.
These years that have been part of most of our development since the 60s, we have
actually been a part of the era that is watching the breakdown of this. In other
words, the collective world since the 60s, the advent of the global village, the
Internet, multinational corporations, stock markets that never close, the integrated
economics of the world, the tourist industry, it goes on and on and on and on and
on. We have had this enormous collectivization of the planet.
And you can see that wherever you look in the world, no matter whether you're
looking at the most sophisticated societies or the most primitive societies on the
planet, there is a backlash as a result of this, and the backlash can be seen in what
we call fundamentalism or the rejection of the global economy, those thousands and
thousands of people that riot every time the global economists come together, those
people that feel that the global economy is destructive and unfair and this and that,
when in fact, it’s the best thing that ever happened to the average being.

LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
Again, remember that over 2 billion people on this planet only earn a euro a day or
the equivalent of a euro a day. That is nothing. And the fact of the matter is that
nearly 500 million people have been brought out of poverty in the last 10 years
because of globalization, yet globalization becomes the monster, the bad creature,
the ugly capitalists, that entire story. The reality is that all of that is the backlash of
the tribe that feels like it is losing more and more of its identity in a world of
McDonald's and whatever the case may be. The fact is that the homogenization of
culture is more frightening to the tribe than anything else. And this is what the
collective process brings.
The Decay of the Bargain
So what we’re seeing is the decay of this bargain, because the bargain said, look, no
matter where the world goes we're looked after first. You have to worry about the
tribe first; you’ve got to worry about your clan, your kin, and your neighborhood.
You have to worry about those things first. That’s what's got to be looked after,
that's what's got to be cared for. If you’re going to build these big, big global
institutions they have to be able to serve the tribes, they have to be able to provide
us with what we've always demanded. And of course, most of what is demanded is
very basic, that is, food, security, all of the fundamental things.
And what you're seeing now is this tremendous backlash in that sense, tribes in fear
that they are going to lose their security, and they are. I'll never forget the
experience of—I toured for about 14 years, so I traveled to a lot of places to teach
people. And I can remember going with Alokanand Diaz, we toured a lot in Spain
together and we had some program that we were teaching in a retreat around Bilbao
in the northern part of Spain.
We were actually about a half-hour out of the city in the mountains in an absolutely
gorgeous village, one of the most beautiful mountain villages. It looked like a fairy
tale, all of these gorgeous stone houses and the ancient terraces and as green as
green can be. We were working in a house at the top of this hill and after the first
couple of days when I had a chance just to get out of the frequency I went walking
around. Every single one of those houses in that village was abandoned and empty.
I mean every single one of them. The village was dead. Nobody was living there,
other than this strange guy who built a brand-new place on the top of this hill, a
restaurant on a road that was down at the bottom where the village would once had,
I guess, its life. There was nobody there.
The children didn't want to be sheep farmers. They had had the advantage of a
society that had improved and had become enriched very quickly, and they had the
advantage of good schooling and they had gone off to school and eventually to
university in Bilbao and they never came back. And slowly but surely the parents
and grandparents died off or moved and you have a dead village.

It is one of those ingredients of what happens in the collectivized society. The life of
that village that had survived for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years was
wiped out in one generation. It just disappeared. And by the way, it is not alone.
There are places like that in so many areas in Europe it’s just a reality, the collective
society. It is the same thing about the power of the church. You can see that.
Christianity by far is the most secular of all religions. And the attendance of
Europeans in terms of their particular faiths, it just steadily drops further and further
and further, and this power, this moral power over the tribe is something that is
constantly, constantly being challenged now.
The Rise of Individuality
And what is challenging it is the rise of individuality. This is a mutative channel and
it’s changing. I'm an example of it. I’m a 51/25 and I am the anti-priest, in that
sense. This is a whole new process. And it’s a forerunner of what's coming, because
what's coming is an age that says our concern is not about support. Our concern is
about individual survival and perhaps the empowerment of another. But individual
selfish survival first, and that means that you cannot have a tribal ruler anymore,
because you will not be able to trust the bargain.
And we already see that; the bargain is breaking down. It isn't to say that rulers in
the past were not corrupt, but it wasn't corruption then. I don't know how to
express that. It was their recognized take. But what we have seen in the 400 years
of the Cross of Planning is that we have seen that tribal rulers have become more
and more corrupt either in their lust to maintain their power or in the way in which
they enrich themselves through their role of being the tribal leader. And of course,
what that has led to is to those in the tribe being strong enough to go a different
road, to take a different turn in the road, to go through that individual initiation to
move one towards what one needs for one’s own life, rather than what is supposed
to be given, sacrificed or otherwise to the tribe.
And the individualism that we have seen that has arisen since the 1960s, the so-
called 60s generation, my generation, and the put down of that generation that it
was selfish and self-absorbed and all of those things that came along with that whole
flood of human beings after the Second World War. The fact is that they are
carrying this energy. It is the precursor of an era in which the individual is what it's
all about.
And of course, this is a threat to everything. It's a threat to everything, because in
fact what it's opening up are two new doorways. And that these doorways, along
with the 12 are going to be the real expression of the transformation that's taking
place when we enter into the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix as a cycle. And that is,
that the individual in their correctness is ready to make a contribution. That is what
it is to be a role model, and role models are going to be of enormous importance.
Not as rulers, not as priests, and not as your collective leaders, but living examples,
that you can take advantage of. That is, by seeing them, by connecting with them.

LESSON FOUR
The Fork in the Road
I Am
After all, they are there to make that contribution; and at the same time to be aware
in the now, because without this awareness in the now its survival is going to be at
risk. And it is awareness of the “I am.” It is not the royal “we.” It is not “I speak
for God.” It is not that I am a representative of all of you, that you chose me; no,
it’s “I, I, I, I am. I can, I can contribute,” the articulation of I am as a contribution.
This is the future, and this is the greatest threat to all of this.
The so-called New Age, a byproduct of the boomers, the 60s generation, you can see
that they have challenged every possible avenue of this traditional moralistic
approach. And you can see that because it's homogenized, after all, we're not
talking about real awareness, we’re talking about a homogenized process,
homogenized initiations—the Catholic that becomes a Buddhist. Give me a break,
this is basically the way it works in the way in which it operates in the not-self. You
give up one master for a better one; you give up one morality for a better morality,
whatever the case may be. That is the way in which the challenges work. So, you
have this New Age with their fascination with every kind of moral system that has
ever been put on the planet and this becomes their way of challenging the traditional
power of the priesthood.
However, it doesn't change anything deeply in that. It simply opens up the
recognition that as an individual that one doesn't have to be trapped by the contract.
And it doesn't mean, by the way, that the tribe will react nicely. If you're a nice little
Arab boy and girl and you decide that you're not going to believe in Allah anymore,
you might lose your life. You would be deeply at risk to do that. Again, it's only
been in these societies, the collective societies where this challenge to the traditional
moral guidance, that that challenge has brought out an individual reaction to it that
has opened up a whole spectrum of looking at different philosophies, looking at
different ways to spirituality.
But again, all of this is still a remnant of the
bargain—what’s the contract—because in fact
you cannot escape any of the God business
when you're dealing with all of this. And you
see, “I am” is truly godless. It isn't about that.
It isn’t about serving anything. It isn't about
leaving something. It isn't about accepting the
control of something, it isn't. It is about the
fundamental expression of “I am.” And this is
the future.
And this fork in the road over the next hundred
years, everything that you're going to see on
the political calendar, all the movies you’re
going to watch about the madness of the world
that we live in and its ugliness, all of it is going
to be a reaction of all this, a reaction to this
falling apart, and the fork not meaning

anything anymore, because if this (40/37) falls apart you don't get there. You really
don't. Something else takes over, something else that is about the future. And it's
about us.
The most important thing about Human Design is that the knowledge was given so
that those that come into the world now and in the future will have what they need
in order to be able to survive in an era that is going to be very, very different and
deeply traumatized for at least a hundred years. And the only way they're going to
be able to do that is being able to have within themselves the certainty and the
assuredness of their “I am.”
Follow Your Strategy and Authority
This is what Strategy and Authority brings. It brings the ability to trust in one's own
power, one's own capacity. To be able to make decisions correctly as yourselves so
that regardless of the turmoil around you and the world around you that you can
operate correctly on this plane. You are not going to have the foundation that has
been there for hundreds of years, this support, this contract of the people. It is not
going to be there. It is breaking down. So the only thing that you can rely on, the
only thing your children will be able to rely on, and your children's children's
children's children is their innate capacity to be able to operate correctly; educate
them well.
Anyway, I enjoyed sharing that with you and hope you did too. Until next time, all
of you take care; bye for now.

Good morning to all of you and there are a lot of you that are downloading, good
morning to you, too. I guess it's my sense of humor, but I had this passing thought
of this little cabal of the ten of us here secretly meeting to share the secrets of
immortality. You could have been burnt at the stake for that kind of stuff. It is,
after all, one of those themes that was particularly intriguing to the seven-centered
being.
The seven-centered being lived in a deeply threatening world, a world that is still
not, in that sense, a nature that it’s still not been mastered. The terminality of what
it is to be a bioform was certainly very obvious throughout the whole span of seven-
centered life. And there was an enormous amount of attention paid to the possibility
of being able to extend the life.
You can see how deep that theme is in terms of the mythologies of so many of the
Godheads of early seven-centered belief systems, these immortal forces and this
potential of the gift of immortality. I think of Achilles as a classic example of that
where there is almost the gift of immortality, but oh, oh, what to do. There is this
dilemma and the dilemma is the bioform.
It is a continuing pleasure for me to take advantage in these kinds of courses to go
back to things that I looked at and talked about years ago, a decade or more, and to
have a fresh perspective. That is, to have all of the time in between to give me an
opportunity to look at these things differently.
When I was in the early years when I was trying to separate, because it was very
new knowledge and I was very concerned that Human Design was not seen as being
just another New Age thing and I really wanted to keep the focus on the pure
mechanics and the fact that it worked, that is, Strategy and Authority, keeping the
focus where the focus belonged.
Yet, at the same time I was given a lot of interesting information that for somebody
like me that wasn't necessarily practical in terms of, do I teach this to people, and I
began doing what were called grey courses. Basically in the grey courses I covered
what I've been covering over the last several years in Rave Cosmology, a whole
broad spectrum of fascinating stuff about the nature of being in the progression and
evolution of the program and all these things.

The Eron
One of the things that I was given and I dealt with this last year in Rave Cosmology,
perhaps the most bizarre because for me it is truly bizarre was a configuration that
was given to me as Eron. And supposedly, because again, I have no idea whether or
not all of that will be realized, but theoretically it is a form that is the next form in
our evolutionary process and is very, very different from us. The huge difference in
it is that it's not a bioform; it’s not a bioform at all.
As a matter of fact, given our kind of consciousness and experience we would
assume that an Eron was something that was inanimate simply in that we have no
other way of recognizing consciousness operating through—well, we do in a sense,
the computer, as an example, but we don't think of them as being similar to us, let’s
put it that way. Anyway, the Eron, an interesting creature, entity, whatever one
wants to call it, silica-based and one of the interesting aspects of it is that it is
immortal, that is, relatively speaking. That is, it's not a bioform.
The Bioform is Deeply Vulnerable
The moment that you're a bioform is the moment that you are deeply vulnerable.
We know that. The fragility of this experiment when you think about the extreme
speculations on, for example, the impact of global warming over the next several
centuries, how fragile the life on this planet actually is, all life on this planet. It is
well known that life can disappear in a moment here. We have already experienced
that with the literally overnight destruction of the reptilian dinosaur dominance of the
planet about 65 million years ago. That was just simply a meteor. Life on this
planet is deeply, deeply fragile. The bioform is a fragile thing.
It is one of the handicaps of consciousness. That is, most human beings simply do
not have the time to ponder. I think that those of us that have been raised in
cultures where we have been basically spoiled relative to the scale of the planet itself
that we forget that that's the greatest privilege we've been given, is that we’ve been
given enough time to ponder. Without that, there is no transformation. There isn't.
Most of the world is caught in the grind, and is caught in the grind because the
bioform is very vulnerable and it demands constantly, vigilantly, that it is nourished
and protected and along with being nourished and protected means that it has to be
occupied. It is caught in a vicious circle of survival. And no matter how much we
fancy it up and no matter how much we think of ourselves as being sophisticated, we
are no different than any other life form on the planet. We are caught in the same
cycle.
As an evolutionary process the fact that self-reflected consciousness, after all,
human beings, everything about life on this planet, not just humans, but everything
about life on this planet is based on cognitive potential. In other words, one of the
things that we see out of the nature of the evolving program is what we call self-
reflected consciousness. I don't think you could speculate what that was really all
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LESSON FIVE
The Mechanics of Immortality
about. I think this is simply a phenomenon of the formula. But this phenomenon of
the formula, this cognitive root in us that the bioform that we have, the human form,
basically our neocortex is an enormous leap in terms of the potential to realize the
inner architecture, in other words, to realize the cognitive potential.
But what we understand, because we see it through the terminology of
homogenization, is that the real potential is not something that can be realized. That
is, the cognitive architecture is there, the possibility of whatever the potential of the
awareness may be is there, but of course all of that all is caught up in the struggle
for survival. And in that struggle for survival where the mental plane rules based on
the old seven-centered strategic process that we live in a world in which the biology
gets in the way of the potential for cognition. It just does.
We see that again in the creation of the whole computer phenomena, that is, a
mechanism that is dedicated to calculation without having to be involved in the
world, not having to struggle for its survival. All of a sudden there's this enormous
speed and accuracy in the way in which information can be processed.
So, one of the things to recognize about the bioform is that this is the weakness, if
you will. At the same time, the evolutionary process through the bioform has given
us the floor plan for the foundation for self-reflected consciousness. In other words,
what computer theorists talk about when they speak about the potentials of artificial
intelligence. And I don’t want to get into a discussion about that because those are
funny words and I don’t want to go through the whole deconstruction. I just want to
give you a sense that our evolution is away from what holds us back from the purity
of awareness. And it's our form.
I guess that's what Buddha understood. Just that the solution didn’t work. The
solution is not being out of the body, the solution has to come through the
transformation and evolution of the form principle itself and it’s only by being totally
connected to the correct trajectory of the form principle do we get to a different kind
of medium for the cognitive potential, a different kind of medium for the crystals and
the way in which they filter the neutrino ocean.
Immortality
So what does this all have to do with
immortality? You can see that we have an
interesting construct here that you don’t normally
don't see in a rave chart. This is exactly where
the immortality connection is in the Eron. That
is, the direct connection between the Sacral
Center and the Ego Center. And of course, we
well know that in the nature of the BodyGraph
that there is no direct connection between the
ego and the Sacral.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
For those people that want to know the secret to life, what is the secret to
immortality; it sits within each of us, actually. My drawing of these lines that we
normally do not see, in those positions, if I can put it that way, at the source of them
there is a—let’s call it a proto-receptor or a proto-firing mechanism—there is
something that is there. It doesn’t work, if I can be sort of mundane, it’s not time
yet, but it’s there. It makes this system, in a sense, a key, a key in understanding
well-being and understanding well-being at the surface level through the centers
themselves.
In other words, to be able to understand that if you are talking about being able to
survive as long as you can, as long as you can in a healthy way, then one of the
things to see is that the infrastructure for that is here. This is the infrastructure
because these are the only ways in which there is this connection that is going to
operate between the ego and the Sacral, and that their relationship to each other is
one that is incredibly important.
The Nodes and Environmental Direction to Well-Being
We have many ways in this era of Human Design to look at the subject of well-being,
and one of the things that is essential knowledge in PHS is the understanding that
the design external, that is, the design nodes, that they represent our alignment to
what is the environmental direction that is going to give us the well-being that we
require being in these nine-centered Uranian vehicles that are intended to, on
average, last at least 84 years compared to the Saturnian seven-centered being, the
29 year cycle. And it is something to really grasp. We have very, very different
bodies, in that sense.
I don't want you to confuse what I'm about to tell you with being aligned to the
correct environment through your Strategy and Authority. I'm talking about the
infrastructure that is built in the holistic vehicle, the BodyGraph, where these things
are in the BodyGraph, what is the mechanism for them. The obvious is the splenic
side. This is the obvious. And I say it's the obvious, because for example when we
look at the initiation of life from conception that the way we go is that we go down
from the Throat, the G, to the ego and then there is this very, very important
transition to the Spleen.
The 26th and 44th Gates
The 26th gate, this gate is the temperature monitor, it is the kicker, it’s the thing that
sets everything on fire. We’re fire creatures; we really are, we’re fire creatures. If
you're looking for heat in the BodyGraph you go to the 26th gate, this is hot. It's hot.
And the thing about the 26th gate is that this is where biologically the reference is to
the thymus gland. Now, the endocrine system is one of those wonders biologically
within us. And when we're looking at the thymus gland, we’re looking at something
that until very recently was very much a mystery to the most probing of science.

LESSON FIVE
The Mechanics of Immortality
What we've discovered about the thymus gland is that basically in the first three
years of life that it has a tremendous responsibility in providing information to
establish a healthy immune system. In other words, it is a builder of the immune
system. It's pointed at what we know in terms of the splenic system, where the
immune system is in our design; as a matter of fact, in all higher forms.
So here's this 26th gate, which in a way is a controlling mechanism that in some
ways you can see as the mechanism that programs or launches the immune system.
It heats it up. One of the things that I find so interesting about the 44/26 for me is
that I think about it in terms that this is a very interesting place. If you look at the
design of fish and reptiles and birds, they all have a 44 potential, but they don't have
the 26. The whole thing about the 26 is that it is bringing a new kind of energy. The
44 represents the past. The 44 is our deep past. And not simply our past as a
human, but our past going back into our whole specieal history, going back millions
and millions and millions of years. It’s all stored there.
The Splenic System
And the thing about the immune system, we know that what makes the immune
system unusual, in a sense when you think about symmetry, is that unlike the other
side this is not a motor. It’s a cold environment. It's cool. This is the whole thing
about being a splenic person. You meet splenic people who are not emotional; these
can be the coolest people. By the way, if you’re not-self it would just be cold, which
is a different thing, after all. But there is this coolness here.
And the thing to see is that on this side you have all this heat. It is this meeting
here, this channel of the transmitter, the channel of surrender. It’s quite a name for
a channel. And it is this heating up, but it's more. The heat brings mutation. And it
is one of the things to understand how deeply mutated our immune system is and
when I say mutated, mutated for what is necessary for us as humans in these forms.
On the other side, the 44, there is no deeper fear, because it never goes away, is the
fear of the past. The 44 has a memory unlike anything you can imagine, because it
has a memory that simply aligns it in our code, in the genetic code, as deep and as
far back, as deep and far back can go. The immune system is based on learning
from survival. It’s what it does. It learns from survival. It recognizes something,
and then from then on it knows how to deal with it. It is deeply experiential.
This is one of the dilemmas for the difference between children with open Spleens
and defined Spleens. For the defined Spleen child you need to give them every kind
of protection you can. And everybody would think, why that. But, if you have an
open Spleen, you let them get things. And then they become masters of them. If
you look around at the people that you know, invariably you're going to see that
undefined splenic people turn out to be a lot healthier than defined splenic people,
because defined splenic people don't pay attention to their health, and undefined
splenic people do.

RAVE ANATOMY II

The only way you can overcome the fear
of the past is to know that you have the
strength and the capacity to meet the
future. The 44/26, the hot and the cold
coming together, the turning on of the
immune system, what we're dealing
with is something we call instinct.
And if we go to the root of the instinct
we get to the 50th gate. And of course,
here in this configuration we see the
entire defense circuit, and the
significance of these two gates, the 50 and the 6.
The 50th Gate
But we stay on the splenic side—the 50th gate, this is the source of human
intelligence. It is the source of all intelligence. It is the font of intelligence, what
gives us our opportunity to be able to have a healthy mortality because we cannot
be immortal. We have to find a way to bring the force of generative power to the
heart, or the other way around.
The 50th gate, this intelligence, what flows out of this
intelligence, that is, judgmentation, intuition, instinct,
and it is here in this instinct, it is our instinct that is
there to protect us. It is the instinct that is there to
defend us against the weaknesses of the past. It’s
our intelligence, our instinct that allows us to meet
the future.
The 26th gate is the gate of the warrior. They are the
ones that lead the tribe into battle. The 26th gate is
also associated with the T cell. You would never want
to meet one on the same scale. These are vicious
things, T cells. They just destroy. They cannibalize
the enemy.
When we think about well-being our mind gets in the
way. Our mind says, well, the latest medical evidence
says that if you eat lettuce, blah, blah, blah, whatever
the case may be. One of the things that is at the very
core of Human Design it is only when the vehicle is operating correctly, which means
the vehicle is operating according to its consciousness, its intelligence, that only then
is the vehicle going to be healthy. Only then is it going to be able to eliminate the
resistance, and so forth and so on.

LESSON FIVE
The Mechanics of Immortality
And of course, this is the basic construct that is here. You notice that out of the
potential intelligence of the 50th gate, we have 3: judgmentation, the 58, the 18, the
48, the 16, the logical process and this becomes the
logical mind. As we transform from our mammalian
root to our very human mental construct, judgmentation
becomes the logical mind with its questions and answers
and its opinions and its facts. It's just that that's where
it goes. And when we’re looking at the intuition aspect,
the intuition aspect going up through the middle, this
becomes the individual mind. It becomes that “I know,
I know, I know,” inside of explanatory mind. But
instinct doesn't go there.
Your knowing, in that sense, isn’t going to keep you
healthy, neither will your judgmentation. It’s the body;
it’s a body principle. After all, this is what it’s about.
We cannot have the immortality. We will never know
what it means to feel the flow of energy between these
two incredible motors. We will not know. One can
imagine. The power of what formats are, because the
densest relationship of one motor to another is the
Sacral to the Root. There is only this single line here that bonds the Solar Plexus to
the Sacral, and the same is true of the ego. You can see this triangle in here.
The 50/27
The nurturer—well, what else would one expect; custodianship, to take
responsibility. What we know about the 50/27 is that in a mammal this is the herd
and the herding instinct to bond together, to stay together, to survive. And it says
something that it is not healthy to be alone. It’s something to think about. That’s
what it says. That’s what the mechanics say, that it is not healthy to be alone. That
you need to nourish and you need to be nourished.
And of course, we know that within the human context when we're looking at the
50/27, that we are looking at the way in which the tribe is nourished and the way in
which the tribe is educated. In other words, the way in which you are nourished and
the way in which you are educated is essential if you are going to have well-being.
It’s interesting when you think about that.
The root of the immune system side of well-being, which is obviously deeply
important, it is the foundation of the potential well-being of the vehicle, it begins
with this nourishment. It is at the core of PHS. Primary Health System states very
clearly that every human being has the potential to be differentiated through the
way in which their digestive system works and the way in which nutrition is taken
into their body. There is a dietary regimen strategy for every human being that
provides them with nourishment that is specifically honed to their uniqueness.

71
RAVE ANATOMY II

And the moment that you are specifically honed to your
uniqueness you enhance the potential of what is your physical
brain system, which obviously opens up the possibility for
extended or expanded awareness. Alok is doing a course on
continuity, and continuity is just one of those things that’s
everywhere in Human Design.
And you can see here in the foundation of what is there to
keep us healthy, what are the mechanisms of our well-being
within the construct itself, within the BodyGraph, because after
all, holistically this is what we have to live out. And basically
what you're getting here are eight rules, eight rules for well-
being in the life. You could end up writing one of these really
cheesy American get-healthy books just by using each of these
eight gates in order as a topic.
The 27th Gate: Correct Nourishment is the Bedrock of Well-Being
You start with the 27. And not only are you starting with the 27, but please
understand that this is a generated force. And what we know about generation is
that generation operates correctly only in response. When we look at this 27th gate,
understand that correct nourishment is the bedrock of well-being. One of the things
that I've shared whether in PHS clinics or in my teaching in PHS is the tragedy of
what happens to a human being.
A human being comes into the world, nine-centered being comes into the world, they
have the potential of a seven-year cellular process, they have the potential of seven
years in which the brain system and its neural environment can expand. The fact is,
through measurements that have been taking place since the late 50s, we know
clearly that the average human being has neural shutdown at three years of age.
We also know in evidence released a couple of months ago from a 20 year research
program that exceptionally intelligent children don't have neural shut down until they
are approximately 5. And that difference, by the way, is something that you can
only attribute to good fortune; literally to serendipity. Because the moment you
come into the world chances are you're going to be nourished incorrectly. There are
12 variations, six major thematics of diet with their “this and that” variations of it.
The chances that you are going to be nourished correctly are deeply, deeply, deeply
slim. And so you end up being immediately conditioned.
It is that food conditioning that literally lays the foundation for a not-self life, in the
sense that the mind not being able to fulfill its potential, the mind not being able to
go further, but being shut down. It gets locked in through the conditioning into the
way in which it's programmed by the display of its parents, in the way in which their
mental processes operate, in the way in which they express themselves to the child,
treat the child, the way they present the nature of being to that child through their

LESSON FIVE
The Mechanics of Immortality
particular performance. We’re all conditioned the moment we come into the world.
This is what this says.
Nutrition Impacts Intelligence
If you really want to be healed, you have to start with what goes into your body.
Again, this is part of the construct of the way in which PHS operates. That is, once
you’re operating correctly, that is, once you’re following your Strategy and Authority,
your vehicle is making decisions. These decisions are correct, it’s aligning you to a
correct trajectory. But there is an awful lot more that can be done as a healing
process. And that step is PHS. That is, aligning yourself to what is the correct
dietary regimen. Here it expresses it as a foundation. It says that this is a key
because nutrition impacts intelligence. And don't we know that.
You take a look at these children that are in famine areas, and obviously it's always a
tragedy, but one of the things to understand about malnutrition is that it creates
enormous problems, mental plane problems, biological mental plane problems,
where the brain systems themselves are damaged because of lack of nutrition, that
they don't mature properly, and so forth and so on. It is something to understand
about the relationship between what you take into your body and what level of
intelligence you have. And of course this is one of my standing teachings about the
relationship of what it means to have a correctly functioning brain system because
what we call mind is totally locked into whatever potential it’s given by the hardware.
And that's precisely what this is all about. That is,
that the proper nutrition is going to open up the
possibility for the potential of that instinct. And for
the depth of what that instinct can bring. Because
remember, one of the things about the 50th gate is
that the 50th gate brings the law, it brings rules.
And it says that one of the most important rules is
taking responsibility for yourself, taking
responsibility for yourself so that you can take
responsibility for others.
So, when we go from the 27 to the 50, and then
we move across this tight little space, they are
very close together no matter where you see them
in the wheel or here. And what you get is the
necessary intelligence, and that necessary
intelligence to guarantee that the species will
survive, that the being will survive.
It’s really two worlds. I think it's obvious to you
that this side, because it is so deeply connected to
the splenic system, the splenic system is the center of our immune system, that it is
natural and easy for us to see in the program, that is, how do we get to our relative
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

73
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
mortality, how do we get to the well-being that we can't get by not having this direct
connection, that this is the one that is obvious because it’s body oriented.
Intimacy and Community: Essential to Well-Being
But this side is fascinating because it tells us something that's so interesting for us to
think about, particularly given the fact that we have been living in the age of the
Cross of Planning and it's coming to an end. And this is so much connected to—it's
almost like a signal: look out, something is falling apart. One of the things that's so
interesting about this is that intimacy and community are good for us. I can state
that in an obvious way.
If you’re alone in the world and you
suddenly come down with some kind of
illness or you’re hurt, or whatever, your
chances are deeply diminished for
survival, deeply, deeply, deeply
diminished, unless you’re Sylvester
Stallone. But I don't think you are. I
don’t even think he is, but anyway.
But the tribe—intimacy and community
are essential ingredients to our well-
being. Without them we are less
protected. We are more vulnerable. And of course, there's the other side of this and
it is what the defense circuit brings and what we see it bringing within the context of
Design in humans is that this intimacy is a reproductive system. This is about
making children. It's about bringing children into the world.
And of course, what that's really saying is that if you look at the splenic side, this is
all very personal, in a sense. And if you look at the Solar Plexus side, it's very
transpersonal. It is about the survival of the species rather than the individual
survival, even though it's all tribal. The stream that is here on the splenic side has a
much more individual quality to it, than the stream that is on the other side, that is,
on the Solar Plexus side.
In the same way that because the tribe’s sole expression is material that when I do
business analysis, as an example, when you look at this side, the splenic side in this
structure, you're looking at capitalism, and when you're looking at this side over here
you’re looking at socialism. In other words, this is all about one person triumphing
and many others getting an advantage from that—the guy who makes it and hires all
his relatives and all his cousins, and so forth and so on. And of course, on the other
side is this we’re all going to make it together, and we’re going to share in it and
we’re going to support each other and we’re going to back each other up and we’re
all going to belong to the union and we’re all going to demand the same fee, we’re
all going to demand the same raise, and so forth and so on; the two sides of the
movie.

LESSON FIVE
The Mechanics of Immortality
So, when you're looking over here and we’re talking about well-being you have to
see something that the nine-centered being is designed to be healthy in a social
environment. It's not designed to be healthy alone. Again, I go back to the wonder
of the nodes, because when you look at Sun/Earth's you're looking at “I, I, I, I, I, I,”
it’s just “me, me, me, me, me.” And then you look at the nodes and the nodes say,
excuse me, Mr. or Ms. I, you have to become a “we.” The world is waiting for you in
your dance. You are going to meet this force and that force and all that stuff, and
you cannot be just “I, I, I, I,” you have to deal with the world.
And you can see that as a mechanism within us. It’s in us at the deepest, deepest
levels. We have an orchestrated trajectory in which we are going to have to deal
with all kinds of forces. We've got a genetic infrastructure that locks us into an
imperative that demands that we be reproductive in order to keep the species going.
Understand one thing about immortality, with immortality there is no need for
reproduction. One goes in and the other goes out, because immortality for us is
lived out here. The immortality of seeing your bloodline and your traits and your
children and your grandchildren and so forth and so on, this is the immortality. And
of course, it isn't, but it is. Again, it's not a direct connection.
Sexuality is Healthy for Us
Again, this says something very important about our health. The first thing is that
our sexuality is something that is healthy for us. If you strip away all of the mental
things that go along with all of that, just simply a fact that this is something that is
healthy. I don't think it's healthy for anyone, truly, to be celibate. I don't think that
this is what the body demands. The fact of the matter is that this is a mechanism.
Yes, it is a specieal mechanism in the sense that it's designed to keep on reproducing
these vulnerable forms. Yet the same time, to understand that seeking a partner,
seeking intimacy is something that brings well-being.
What we know about this is that here's the 6th gate. I enjoyed your piece on the
radio this morning, Alok, the dilemma of the emotional being where there is no truth
in the now. And one of the things that is so clear for us about the nature of intimacy
is that intimacy is rooted in the power of the motor wave. The 6th gate is the source
of the motor wave. And it means that all intimacy is locked into a wave system, the
up and the down of it, and the lack of the truth in the now.
Discernment
It’s something to see about what is healthy for us. It is one of the deepest teachings
of Human Design. What is healthy for us is discernment. You have to know how to
make a decision so that you can discern what intimacy is correct for you. The
incorrect intimacy, the incorrect sexuality, the incorrect anything is never going to be
healthy for you, it cannot be healthy for you. In the same way that the 50th gate

75
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
brings us a splenic intelligence, the 6th gate brings us an emotional intelligence. The
beauty of the wave is that it samples. And again, the sampling can only be
experienced by the passenger. And that means that you cannot be caught up in
your life. You have to be watching to see it.
And it's only then as you watch it, as you see it, it’s only then that ultimately you can
come to a place of discernment, and the discernment is rooted in one thing and one
thing only: patience. Patience is good for you. You’ll live longer if you’re patient.
You will. You’ll live longer if you have solid intimacies that are correct. That's what
it's saying. It puts enormous pressure on understanding that the social direction
that we are driven towards, that we cannot go there blindly as not-self, because that
is what is so deeply unhealthy for us, and I mean deeply unhealthy.
The 40/37
The 40/37 as always is an unusual element. It's an unusual element because like
the 43/23 or the 20/34 it is an opposition in the wheel. It is not often that you see
somebody that just has one gate or the other. It's more common to see people that
have the whole channel—their nodes, their Sun/Earth, this is a commonality. And
the thing to recognize about that is that it gives this channel tremendous power,
because it is a dominant force, because so many human beings have it.
And when you think about the fact that since the beginning of the 1600s we have
been in a global theme of the Cross of Planning, which is rooted in the 40/37 along
with the 9 and the 16, that this community and the building of community and the
bargain within the community has transformed our well-being, and it has. Think
about it. It is during this era of the Cross of Planning with the dominance of the
40/37 and its concerns for the infrastructure of the community, that we have
hospitals and sewers and schools and you name it, all of the things that have led to
what is an extraordinary well-being amongst common humans.
Human beings live longer than they have ever lived before. And this is all a
byproduct of the 40/37. It’s the byproduct of somebody that works in a lab and
discovers something that somebody else invests in, that somebody else puts on the
market that ends up getting rid of that horrible headache that you have. The fact of
the matter is that the whole institutionalized health system—if you want to talk
about the $30 billion a year that are invested in cancer research or the same amount
that is invested in AIDS research, all of this is a byproduct of the 40/37; all of it.
The End of the Cross of Planning Cycle
And in a very short period of time, 19 years, this cycle comes to an end, this Cross of
Planning cycle. It means that the infrastructure will deteriorate. It is something that
I have been teaching for a long time now relative to 2027. But just to see it here in
this way through this unusual frame. For me, when I look at this construct (next

LESSON FIVE
The Mechanics of Immortality
page), for me it’s something otherworldly that's been hooked in there that it doesn't
really belong with the rest of it. It really is its own system. It is the inner wheel that
drives the clock that's the holistic us. And what is healthy for us as a species, this is
going to breakdown. This is going to be a real dilemma.
It was very clear to me when I was first given this knowledge that I was given
something that if it were ever to be realized would lay a foundation for the way in
which people were prepared for life—reading, writing,
arithmetic and Design, whatever the case may be. But
it would become a way in which young people,
particularly children, the way in which they can be
educated in a way that is truly, truly nourishing for
them so that there is a future, because if this Splenic
side becomes weak, the decay on this Solar Plexus
side will all be too overwhelming for the species.
It is clear to me that human beings have started their
decline. The real decline will not begin until 2027
because that is when the real sort of the end of the dominance of the human form
begins to deteriorate. The fact is that with little more than a millennium left, at least
according to the Voice, we really have to see that we have to be prepared for what is
happening on the Solar Plexus side of the well-being program.
Now, one of the things that is so important, and again I return to PHS, because
obviously these themes are connected to each other in terms of health and well-
being, is that the nature of where we’re supposed to be and what we’re supposed to
see gives us the opportunity, along with our authority, to be able to align us to those
beings that really belong in our life; and yet, those beings who belong in our life in a
way that is going to be very different.
The mutation that's taking place in the 55th gate, its opposition is the 59. There is a
tremendous change that is going to take place in the way in which intimacy is going
to operate. The wave function is going to be diminished. We have the emergence of
the possibility, at least we see it in the architecture, of sensory capacity, awareness
out of the Solar Plexus system that is intended to emerge.
Enormous Pressure on the Splenic Side
But we really have to understand that there's going to be enormous pressure on the
splenic side. Everything that I teach, that is, my hammering away at Strategy and
Authority is so this splenic side can be looked after, because I see the disarray that is
coming to the Solar Plexus side. And it's not like anything can be done about that,
because as I said, it is as clear an indicator that the well-being of the species is at
risk; but not individuals. I guess for me the strongest marker in all of this, we are
not immortal. And the mortality of the species is definitely going to be at risk.
That's what this is all bringing. But at the same time, it says that for the individual
in that process, whatever is going on in the homogenized world around you, those
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

that know how to operate correctly, those that are properly nourished, those who are
properly educated will have the power to be able to find their way and stand for that
and be able to be functional in the world.
It’s a dividing line; it's a marker. It says that there is something really profound
going on. But this, our well-being, is no longer something that is going to be
guaranteed by the 40/37, nor is the reproductive capacity of the species going to
remain the same. All of that does not bode well for the species and its well-being.
So, let's make sure that we can keep individuals alive and healthy and correct
regardless of what is going on. But as a picture, it's saying that there's a great
change coming. It’s coming here. And it's a change that leaves humans behind.
That is, what we are, in that sense, or are intended to, if I can put it that way.
Immortality: No Such Thing
So, the secret to immortality, well, it’s not a secret; there is no such thing. Not for
us, cannot be. And yet knowing where it is, because that's the beauty of the magic
of mysticism, knowing where it is tells us something very important about ourselves
and our species. And it gives you a whole new way of looking at the relationship
between the Heart Center and the Sacral; to begin to see that there's something
deeply, deeply mysterious. And also to recognize that you can never, when it comes
to thinking about your health, the quality of your life, that you can never think of
that without linking these two centers together; the relationship between them and
what that relationship means for us as a species, as a being.
Again, it brings the final warning, a warning that has to be loud and clear. Educate
your children well; prepare them for a world that will not have the 40/37. Prepare
them for a world in which those people that may be hungry or diseased in this place
or in that place in the world that there is nobody to show up—call 911 and there's
nobody there. It is something to grasp.
And it means with that on the horizon, it’s not tomorrow. It's not even in 2027. All
these things take time. It's an evolutionary process. But from 2027 on you will see
this deterioration will really take hold, because it will no longer be the background
frequency. And in that sense you’re left on your own. Strategy and Authority, it is
the thing that carries us with dignity to whatever our future may be.
Well, I hope you enjoyed that. By the way, for the next three weeks I’m opening up
this class to outsiders because it is the first time in over a decade that I'm going to
talk about the three awareness centers. And I thought that for some students that
might be something that is interesting for them. I think that will be fun to take a
look at.
Anyway, to all of you, you take care; enjoy your weekend. And until next time, bye
for now.

Lesson Six
The Spleen
Welcome to all of you. Today we begin what is a three-lecture process of taking a
look at the areas of awareness in the BodyGraph, or the so-called areas of
awareness. I say so-called, by the way, in that both the Spleen and the Ajna are
true awareness centers. The Solar Plexus is a potential of awareness, a potential of
awareness that will emerge after 2027 in the completion of the mutation of the Solar
Plexus. So when I do say the so-called awareness centers, just understand why I
put the emphasis on so-called, it is really about including the Solar Plexus in that
grouping.
The Spleen: Our Survival Protection Awareness
But the Spleen is another story and it is the beginning of the story. I guess it’s the
basic place to start to understand within the holistic vehicle what our consciousness
is really about, or at least how our consciousness emerged, how our intelligence
emerged. The Spleen as we understand it within Design, we relate it specifically to
the immune system, to the lymphatic system. We talk about the Spleen in the
context that it literally is our
survival protection awareness.
Now, the thing that makes the
Spleen so foundational, in that
sense, is that when you look at all
forms of life, that is, when you
look at the complexities and the
various designs as we see in the
design of forms that all forms of
life have this awareness in
common, that is, this is the
historical root of awareness.
So, in looking at the Splenic
Center we’re looking at something
that is very special. But we're also
looking at something that has its limitations. That is, it has its limitations, because
in fact wherever you go out of the Spleen you're always dealing with fundamentally
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

79
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
the same theme. That is the theme of well-being, the theme of survival, the theme
of security, the theme of what it is to be a bioform is constantly to be at risk.
This is about, in a sense without being too cute, this is about risk management, this
is about trying to figure out on a moment-by-moment breath-by-breath basis,
whether one is safe or not, and in the moment that one is not safe, then the
spontaneous ability to be able to deal with it. The thing that is so difficult about the
Spleen, again within the context of how we understand it in the general framework
of the BodyGraph is that there are an awful lot of people on this plane who have
splenic authority.
I don't remember exactly the numbers, but I think that in human terms it’s about a
billion and a half people on the planet who have the Spleen as their authority. I'm
one of them. It is something that is very, very difficult to honor, I guess is the best
way to put that. And what I mean by that is that the Spleen is the most alien of the
awareness systems that we’re going to look at. It’s alien in the sense that it doesn't
communicate well. Not only doesn't it communicate well, because it's not a motor,
it’s very, very limited in its power to persuade.
Take the example of the Solar Plexus system, when you're dealing with the Solar
Plexus system you're dealing with a motor system. The moment that you're dealing
with a motor system it has an incredible ease in being able to impact the other. We
all know that. Anybody who has an open emotional system knows that somebody
emotional coming by, you take in everything. But you don't take that in from splenic
beings.
Holding onto What is Not Good for You
At the very best if you have an open splenic system and you take in a defined
Spleen, there is this feel-good which isn't something that you can really grasp. This
is one of the great dilemmas for beings who have an open Spleen. We know the
strategy of the open Splenic Center. The strategy the open Splenic Center is holding
onto things that aren't good for you. And this holding onto things that aren’t good
for you begins at a very, very, very, very early stage, it begins at birth.
You have to understand how profound the impact is on an infant to have an open
Spleen. They are fundamentally insecure, and they are insecure at the most primal
level, because this is the most primal awareness. They are insecure in terms of life
and death. So, imagine an infant coming into the world, has an undefined Spleen,
and within it is the insecurity, their very deep insecurity, and whether they're going
to be able to survive or not.
What is natural for these infants is that these infants naturally will cling to any
splenic force. So, the moment that you have this infant with an open Spleen and
you have a mother, for example, with a defined Spleen, this child is going to feel
very, very secure with that mother and is going to want to hold on deeply and not let
go.

LESSON SIX
The Spleen
And of course, this leads to certain behavioral phenomena. Think about the child
with the open Spleen, the mother with the defined Spleen, the mother goes away
because the mother needs a break because the undefined splenic child is very
demanding, it’s deeply demanding. It holds on and holds on and holds on, it can be
such a drag on the mother's psyche. And so the mother needs her space and she
goes away. And the moment that she goes away this infant is insecure. It feels
threatened. It no longer feels safe. It cannot just quietly play and go off to sleep.
It cannot. And of course, it starts to cry, it starts to demand the return of the
mother.
Now, think about the situation in which you have a child with an undefined Spleen
and it has a mother with an undefined Spleen and they don't define the Spleen
together. You have a child that does not feel secure with the mother. You have a
mother in which the child doesn't make the mother feel good. Think about that.
There are all these combinations. The mother doesn't have a defined Spleen, the
father does, the father makes the children feel better, but the father is probably
gone much more than the mother leaving anxiety in the child and tension that will
arise throughout the development of that child in terms of the way in which it relates
to either of its parents.
And then take that into adulthood and you can see the real dilemma of the undefined
Spleen in this holding on. The dilemma in this holding on is that there is no reason.
This is the most difficult thing about being a splenic being. I'm a reasonably
intelligent man, and I do not understand my Spleen. I do not know why it does what
it does when it does it. I do not. I cannot explain the reasoning behind the way in
which my Spleen operates. I cannot, I really can't.
And of course, that’s fine for me in the sense that I operate correctly and I'm
surrendered to the phenomena of what my Strategy and Authority happens to be.
But when you take that into the context of the not-self, and of course the not-self
being ruled by this homogenized mind, the mind that makes decisions, the mind that
makes decisions based on the conditioning, that even when you have a defined
Spleen, the not-self mind is not going to pay attention to it.
It’s There and Then It’s Gone
My favorite way of describing people with a defined Spleen is the person that you
visit in the hospital, the one that had the car crash or the skiing accident or whatever
the case may be. You go and see them. And in the course of the conversation they
will say to you, “You know, I knew it. I knew it was going to happen. I knew it.”
But of course, they didn’t do anything about it. They only claim to really know it
after it's happened because they don't pay attention to what is such a momentary
thing. It’s there and it’s gone.
It’s what makes the Spleen so different. You compare it to the Ajna Center, think
about the Ajna Center, what a torture, because the Ajna Center will process things

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
for life. All of you can look back 10, 20, 30, 40 years and look back at something
that you're still chewing on, that the Ajna Center is still chewing on; it will chew on it
forever. One of the dilemmas of the mind is this frequency of over all time, it just
never lets go of it.
The Spleen—it’s there and it’s gone. It’s there and it’s gone. This is the pure
mammalian consciousness, deep, deep, deep. And in order to be able to be splenic
you really have to let go of your mind, because your mind doesn't trust it. There's
no real explanation.
I had this incredible experience last year. I've mentioned it before. I live in the
countryside and I normally put on my seatbelt when I get to the highway. I get in
my car to go out and I sit down and I watch myself put on my seatbelt. And my life
is one of being a witness; I watch. I notice the fact that I'm doing something that I
don't normally do. I don't try to figure out why, because frankly I've learned from
experience that I don't know why it does that. As it turned out, 10 minutes later I
was rear-ended by somebody. And if I hadn't had the seatbelt on, I probably would
have been hurt.
I don’t know how that operates. And if I was not-self seeing myself do that, I may
have interfered with the whole process—what am I doing that for, I don’t need that
now. Because it’s so easy for the mind to jump in and say, what kind of nonsense is
this, I'm going to put on my seatbelt to save myself from a sheep. The mind gets in
and goes through its whole number. And of course, the mind has great, great, great
difficulty with the Spleen. It seems primitive to the mind. It seems almost dumbed
down, because it doesn't have this mental capacity to sort of get lost in explanation.
It's just there or not.
Awareness Exists Because of Fear
Now, we’re talking about awareness. For me the most interesting thing about the
way in which awareness operates in the holistic vehicle is that awareness can only
exist based on fear. It’s quite a thing to think about, that awareness can only exist
because of fear. When you think about the Spleen and you think about it being the
foundation for awareness for life on this planet, it is why when you look out at nature
that if you're walking in the forest all the creatures that are there suddenly go on
alert, anyone that hears you. Creatures are always instantaneously threatened.
They’re always ready to feel threatened, because the awareness in them is
something that is tuned to their fears for survival.
It is out of the fear of survival that the depth and possibility ultimately of our kind of
intelligence emerged. But it’s about fear. The whole nature of the Spleen is that it is
there to defend the integrity of the life, everything about it, which means that it is
both defensive and offensive and it is defensive and offensive in the moment. And
the Spleen can never come back and say to you, excuse me, I just told you
something. It can't remind you. It can't be rewound. It’s there and it’s gone.

LESSON SIX
The Spleen
The Spleen is Connected to Smell
The thing about the Spleen is that it is so deeply connected to our fundamental
senses. And what I mean by that is the oldest and deepest senses that we have
begin with smell. The Spleen is deeply, deeply connected to smell. And it's one of
the things about—I've had dogs all my life and I've had all kinds of dogs. And dogs
smell fear. They’ve got an extraordinary olfactory system and when human beings
are afraid they release minute amounts of ammonia in their sweat and dogs pick it
up. And the moment a creature knows that you are more afraid of them than they
are of you, you set up a very dangerous situation. We’re like that. It's what our
Spleen does.
One of those things to really understand about the Splenic Center is that it is not just
about defense. It is also about offense, and it's all about survival in the moment.
And when you deal with that in basic analysis there is something to grasp. Take the
example of somebody who happens to be a splenic Generator. It could be any
number of configurations, but let’s say it’s a splenic Generator. Now of course, we
know that the Strategy and Authority of a Generator is that they're here to respond.
That is their key. But think about what it means to be a Generator connected to the
Spleen. It is the awareness that is informing the Sacral. And basically when the
Sacral goes “uh-huh,” what it's actually saying is, “this is safe for me in the
moment.” It's not saying, “wow, that's such a great thing and I would love to do it,”
because it’s not this.
The Mind Makes Up Reasons for the Spleen
And of course, any of you splenic Generators and your Sacral responds, your mind
immediately tries to make up a reason. It will immediately try to figure out why.
And it won’t have anything to do with “this is safe for me in the moment.” It will
have to do with whatever the conditioning of that mind is and its projection on what
it thinks it’s saying yes to and why. It is the same thing for “uh-uh” because all that
is saying is, “this is not safe for me in the moment, this is not good for me in the
moment,” which doesn't mean the thing is bad. And yet, the mind will jump in and
say “okay, I never want to see you again.” It makes up a reason for the Spleen.
And the Spleen has no reasons in that way. It is simply: It's safe or it's not safe.
It's safe or it's not safe. It's safe or it's not safe.
What I understand about my splenic system is that in my spontaneous saying yes or
no to something, I realize that that doesn't mean anything more than that moment.
It doesn't. It may in fact last longer or it may not. You can come up to me at a
given moment and say, “would you like to,” and you hear me immediately say no.
And it comes out so fast that you may even be offended. Yet 10 minutes later, you
could ask me and I might say yes, because I don't know what the framework is. I
can’t.
The assumption is that the Spleen is assessing the question or the situation. But I
know that it's dealing with other things. And I know that in saying yes to somebody
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

83
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
going somewhere may have nothing to do with them being not good for me. It may
be where I'm going. It may be that while I'm going there something will happen. It
may be that when I get there and I have whatever is there that it creates a problem.
And I don't know that, but the Spleen does.
I don’t know the criteria. I used to tell that story in my early introductory lectures
about somebody with an defined Splenic Center arriving at some public lecture and
standing there looking at a poster or whatever and somebody walks up to them who
knows them and says to them, “are you going in?” And suddenly they hear
themselves say “no.” Defined Spleen, something inside of them says “no.” They
suddenly change their mind. And their friend says, “why not, you’re here already
anyway and it's free. Let's just go in there and listen and if you don't like it you can
leave,” all the mental stuff.
So, that person with the defined Spleen goes into that lecture. They go in looking
for a seat and there's this one seat that's available, and one of the people on either
side of that seat happens to have a cold, happens to have been brushing their
fingers against their nose, happened to have touched the arm of the chair or
whatever. And this person sits down there, puts their hand on that chair, eventually
puts it to their own face, listens to the lecture, enjoys it or not, but the fact is that
three days later they're sick. And it wasn't the Spleen saying, ‘look, the lecture is no
good for you, or this is no good for you or that is no good for you,” the kind of thing
that the mind would make up, the kind of thing that the moment that the Spleen
said no the mind would think, “yeah, this is really not for me.” The mind makes
things up instead of simply surrendering to it.
It is the thing to best understand about the Splenic Center: The Splenic Center
demands that anybody who has splenic authority simply surrender to it, because you
cannot grasp it, not from the mental plane. And we live on the mental plane. I do
not know how or what my Spleen bases its information on. I don't, because I realize
it has nothing to do with the way in which I think about situations or circumstances.
The mind has a certain way of dealing with phenomena, totally alien to the splenic
system.
So, the Spleen is always there to talk about in the moment whether something is
safe or not, whether it is free of fear or not. Because the moment that the fear is
there, is the moment that the Spleen is in its heightened state ready to deal with the
situation; and unfortunately, the awareness center that is the most profoundly
ignored is the Spleen, because it's so easy to override it. The Ajna is twice as
powerful. They're both non-motors.
And the Solar Plexus is twice as powerful as the Ajna, four times as powerful as the
Spleen. It is an enormous power. And the Ajna Center and the emotional system
can easily override the Spleen. The Spleen isn’t argumentative. It can’t deal with
the wave. It’s just that moment. Oh it's very hard to hold onto awareness in the
now when the mind is not-self and the mind is all over the place and when it is trying
to control the life. You don't pay attention to what's going on in here. You don’t.

LESSON SIX
The Spleen
The 50th Gate: The Root of Intelligence
Let’s shift for a moment and look at the structure in terms of intelligence. The first
thing to recognize about the Spleen is that the Spleen has a master gate; that is, the
50th gate. The 50th gate and the 6th gate on the other side, these mirrors to each
other, represent the core of the way in which their centers operate. It’s the 6th gate,
as an example, that brings the wave function to the Solar Plexus. And here with the
50th gate we have what we call the root
of intelligence.
It’s interesting in the old language, that
is, The Cauldron, to recognize that
within the 50 all of that intelligence is
really lumped together. It’s a kind of
soup, in a way. And it becomes
diversified as it moves out into the
frequencies, as it moves out from this
core. And you can see the basic
binaries that follow.
That is, the first frequency. The first
frequency is the tribe (44 and 32). And
what we call this intelligence is instinct. And of course, the instinct is so deeply
connected to the way in which we protect each other, the support mechanisms that
are there in the tribe. When we take the next step in the frequency we get to
individuality. We get to the acoustic plane, rather than smell, which is here at the
root. We get to the acoustic plane of the 57 and the 28.
And of course, when we get here, we get to what is called
intuition. So we have instinct, very tribal, very primal.
We have intuition, again rooted in the acoustic, so we
have smell and sound both of which are primary for our
survival. That is, sound which is at the very core of
integration, and here in terms of smell the core of tribal
success, whether they're going to survive as a species and
whether they're going to flourish into the future. Then
finally we get to the outside frequency 48 and 18), and
when we get to the outside frequency we get to logic and
we get to judgmentation.
These three areas of awareness; it is the frequencies
differentiated, broken down into potentials for different
kinds of intelligence. Now, we don't really notice it as
intelligence at this level. What we’re most familiar with is
the transformation of the collective and individual into
what becomes the bedrock of mental intelligence. In
other words, judgmentation becomes the root of logic.
And the intuition becomes the root of individual mutative insightfulness.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
Again, this becomes the framework of mental
intelligence. Instinct always stays within the
framework of the tribe. And one of the things
about the tribe is that the tribe is not connected
to the Ajna awareness, which is one of those
things to understand about the uniqueness of
the way in which tribal circuitry operates and
how different it is from the three major circuits.
It is really a very, very different construct.
Basic Fundamental Fears Leading to Specific Kinds of Intelligence
So, when we're looking at these frequencies we begin with basic fundamental fears
and these fears lead to a specific kind of intelligence. What we know, for example,
about the 32nd gate, which is the fear of failure, that this fear of failure coupled with
the 44, which is the fear of the past, is all about the instinct to be able to gain
advantage from experience. And of course, at the mammalian level this is a very
slow process, and very limited. That is, that the mother, normally the female, will
teach the young how to do the basic things they need to do in order to be able to
survive, where to hunt, where to find a safe place to rest and all of these basic
things, their basic hygiene of whatever level that is, their basic social relationships,
all of this is rooted in the survival of the group, the survival of what is basically in the
earlier sense the survival of the bloodline.
So here, what we're looking at are the basic environmental fears. Instinct is there to
deal with those environmental fears; in other words, those things that are going to
threaten the survival of the group. This leads to intelligence that has to do with
being able to protect ourselves, being able to build communities, being able to find
the kinds of shelters that are defensible and so forth and so on, dealing with the
general fears to the group itself.
It’s very different from the individual frequency; because once we move into the
individual we get to what is in fact, the core. And when I say the core because in
dealing with the splenic system, the fact is that and as we've seen with integration
this is the infrastructure for survival. It’s the infrastructure for individual survival.
And obviously the instinct is an interesting thing. That is, the maintenance of the
well-being of the tribe, that ability within that context to be able to nurture and
protect the young and all of the things that derive out of that.
But again, the underlying theme in order for that even to be possible is the potential
for individual survival. And individual survival is very much the underlying fear
inherent in the 57-28. The 28 is afraid of death. Death isn't a problem for the 44-32
unless it’s the death of the species or the death of the tribe. Individual death is
simply part of the continuity of life. Mammals don't make a big deal over the dead.

LESSON SIX
The Spleen
They don't, because it's not a threat to the group. But if the group is threatened
that's a very different story.
Here we’re dealing with the individual, and so in dealing with the 28th gate, the fear
of death, the way in which we look at this in terms of the sophistication of us as
humans is that of course this is a fear that death will come before you find your
purpose. In other words, this is the struggle, the fundamental struggle for life itself,
but life that must have a purpose. And when you get to the 57th gate, obviously you
get to something that is deeply, deeply complex and the most complex gate of all
the gates in the Spleen simply because it opens up to three other gates instead of
simply one. It's opening up to the whole integration system. It is the fundamental
awareness of individual survival.
That is the archetype, the empowerment of the intuition to find its perfected form,
and in being able to find its perfected form to awaken in the now. This is this whole
progression. And the thing to recognize about the 57th gate is that its concern is it’s
the fear of tomorrow. It’s not a fear of the past. It’s not the fear of extinction. It’s
the fear of the threat that's not there yet. And of course, this is an upgrading of the
system, because when you're looking at the 44-32 it's really connected to the pure
defensive. But this is something else. There is more an offensive quality in that
because that fear of tomorrow leads to intuitive action, the intuition guiding one
towards what in essence one doesn't really have access to.
Tonal Architecture
In the study of tonal architecture, tonal architecture is rooted in the same triangle.
And the tones are aligned to actual centers. In other words, the 1st and 2nd tones
are known as a Splenic binary, the
3 and 4 as an Ajna binary, and the
5 and 6 as a Solar Plexus binary.
And when you're looking at this
basic binary, that is, the primary
binary, the initial Splenic binary,
that in tonal architecture the 1st
tone has to do with smell and the
2nd tone has to do with taste.
One of the interesting things about
taste is that where the 1st tone is
purely defensive, the 2nd tone itself
is very different. That is, it is
waiting for something that hasn't
happened yet. Yet it knows that it
has to be ready for it. In other
words, this is a very, very different
kind of way of being prepared.
This is not about waiting for things

to happen and then responding to them. It's about being tuned into something and
having a hunch, in our language intuitive, a hunch about which way to go in order to
deal with what hasn't happened yet; the potential for uncertainty.
And of course, everything about the nature of purpose is this deep uncertainty,
which is a fundamental theme that rides through all of individuality, because it's in a
pulse, this “I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, oh, I know,” and
in this uncertainty, this ability to be prepared for tomorrow. And of course, the way
you prepare for tomorrow is that you're clearly present in the now. That’s what it
leads to, being rigidly present in the now.
So we see the two basics (32,44 and 57,28), because these are the two basics. In
other words, this is the bedrock of the splenic structure.
Written comment: And sound is the only thing that can attune to the new mutative
energy that has arrived as a vibration?
Ra: Oh, absolutely, Cathy, absolutely, the very acoustic nature of this is very
profound because it is mutation, which means that the intuition is tuned to mutation
and it's tuned to the mutation acoustically and in a way that again the mind does not
know how to grasp. So, in a sense there is always an aspect of us that is connected
to the future. The beauty of intuition is that it is something that is really able to, in a
sense, penetrate the illusion of time. And it picks up keys, it picks up cues. And it
picks them up and then if you're following, if you’re splenic, the Spleen is going to
lead you to what is a safer position.
Again, no matter how sophisticated we apply our language, we have to come back to
the splenic imperative, which is to maintain the safety and well-being of the vehicle.
And all decisions of the Spleen are rooted in is it safe or not. So, this is an
attunement to whether tomorrow is going to be safe or not, and the ability to be able
to deal with it intuitively, if one is paying attention. So, this is the bedrock.
The Fear of Being in the Wrong Pattern
And then of course, we have the outside frequency.
And really in looking at this to really see this all as a
frequency coming out of the 50 and to understand this
in this way so that you can see what the priorities are,
the core priorities are here. It’s not the collective
priority. The collective priority is something else. This
is really about the fear of being in the wrong pattern. It
is a very sophisticated step. And it’s all about trying to
align the pattern so that everyone can be safe. This is
not about looking after the tribe and your own kind. It
isn’t looking after yourself, but it is about looking after
everyone. And so, this collective aspect, because the
collective is the most deeply social of all the circuitry,

LESSON SIX
The Spleen
that it is this collective aspect that tends to establish the parameters for humanity of
what is safe or not—judgment. And the judgmentation that is the Iranians judge
that they're only going to be safe if they make atomic weapons. And the Americans
think they're only going to be safe if the Iranians don't.
Collective judgment doesn't mean that it is universal, nor is it an absolute. It is
simply about patterns and the way in which patterns are expressed and the way in
which the patterns apply. This is where the framework for war and peace is, in a
global sense. That is, is it possible to have a pattern in which we all exist as
“brothers and sisters”? We know that in the establishment of constitutions of laws.
We know the attempts at the internationalization of institutions, international courts,
and the United Nations, and all of these various transnational patterns, all of that is
here. What is safe for the collective?
And it's important to see it in that context, because distortion in this area-Americans
as an example in their constitution, what they consider safe is the right for every
human being to carry a weapon. That’s a collective judgment call. And as a
collective judgment call it all depends on where you stand in relationship to that
judgment.
Again, nothing is more argumentative than the collective. And there are all these
incredible arguments that exist over what is safe and what is not for us. Is the
environment safe for us or not? The whole scandal about Chinese toys that were
made with lead paint, this is where we have all of these protection agencies, and all
of these collective institutions that are there to look after our safety. They're all
rooted in this stream. And it says so much about the influence of the splenic system
in our lives. For something that is so deeply ignored at the personal level, because
it's not at the holistic homogenized level. At the homogenized level, what we're
looking at here is a foundation of the way in which we protect ourselves whether
we’re in the tribe or as individuals or within the collective.
And it's here in the collective that we vote, if we have a chance to, on what we think
is going to be safe for us or not, or which leader is going to be safe for us or not, or
which law is going to be safe for us or not. It's very, very important to see how deep
this is embedded in us and it operates through the not-self.
It is very easy for me as a dualist to look at any law, to look at any judgmentation of
collective safety and to see the “this and that” of it. When the American Constitution
was written, their fear of the possible retribution of what was then the greatest
empire in the world, the British Empire, their fear of being able to defend themselves
on a vast continent that it made sense that every single person, every adult was able
to bear arms. It made it much riskier for any foreign entity to contemplate, even
today, you cannot contemplate anyone trying to conquer the United States; it’s a
joke. There are a billion firearms that are there amongst the citizenry.
So, on one side you can say yes that make sense. The other side of that is it's
insane. This morning I'm reading that somewhere in Northern Illinois in some
regional university some crazy kid walked into a lecture hall and wounded 22 people
and killed four of them. The other side is the madness of it. And yet, at the same

time to see what the collective does with this. That there are these collective
judgments and because it's collective and it is shared it is argued, and because
ultimately that it is fulfilled in the 31/7, it becomes part of what we decide in our
political systems on what we're going to agree with or not. Do you have the death
penalty or not, do you cut somebody's hand off for stealing bread or not, all of these
various collective judgments that become embedded into the rules of our society.
The 18th Gate: The Fear of Authority
It's quite something when you think about it. When you look at the root of this, the
18th gate is the fear of authority. It is the fear of authority. And basically it is the
fear of authority that is unsafe. In other words, those that can have power over you
and it's more about the pattern that has power over you, and that the pattern is
unsafe. And so here is the potential to judge that.
Now, it’s often seen simply within its Oedipal nature, that is, the challenge to the
mother and father, the generational challenge that is inherent in the development of
patterns. And it is fundamental to see that every generation has a collective
rebellion against the previous one. They just do, it’s collective. It’s not tribal or
individual. It’s like looking at the hippies, it’s not a tribe. It’s a collective
phenomenon, a collective rejection of a previous pattern. It's rooted in this kind of
that is not what is good for us; this is what's going to be good for us, so we're going
to challenge the rules.
The 48th Gate: The Fear of Inadequacy
And when you get to the 48th gate, what you get to is a fear of inadequacy. The
collective is inadequate to protect itself, that we are helpless to protect ourselves
and so therefore we must invest all of our money not in schools and roads but in
warfare. And again, I'm being dramatic to give emphasis to these themes.
Obviously, it is not the only thing.
The 48/16 is obviously a talent and there is no question the judgmentation is
something that is essential to all of us. We are, after all, rooted in the 15/5, all
creatures are and that means that life itself is a logical process, is a logical flow. And
that it is essential for us as sophisticated beings to master the patterns and to do the
best we can at the collective level to ensure that the patterns are just and correct for
all.
You get to see the best intentions out there collectively. You do, but then again,
we're dealing with a not-self homogenized world, so we don't really know what the
collective judgmentation should be. We really do not know what the pure individual
intuition leads to. We really don't know what it means for the tribe to function purely
and correctly as a tribe. We don’t know these things. We only see the distorted
mirror of that through homogenization and nothing else.

LESSON SIX
The Spleen
Following Your Strategy and Authority
Again, it goes back to understanding that when you're following your Strategy and
Authority this (57,28) is what starts for you. Think about it, and again, it doesn’t
matter whether you have these things are not in reference to genetic continuity and
the way that the species as a whole operates. That the moment you are following
your Strategy and Authority you’re aligning yourself to your purpose and your future.
You're aligning yourself to the correctness of you in the now and this is what is going
to allow you to survive.
So this is the bedrock. Beyond that it depends on the expansion of it. Next month
here in Ibiza with the annual event, suddenly there is a Human Design community
and the Human Design community as a tribe has a very different function than one
would ordinarily see within a tribal configuration. Again, it's rooted in the fact that
there is this Strategy and Authority.
But for us to even get a glimpse, even of the tribal, because in fact for that to be real
you would have to see that in community groups emerging that are—there are some
on this planet that are deeply involved in Human Design—but again, that's
something that's off in the future before we can imagine seeing how that
configuration really operates. And way, way off and probably not attainable in a
sense, is the collective correctness and what that leads to in terms of the
judgmentations that will establish the “this and that” of the rules of our society for
now and into the future in terms of the way the pattern operates. In other words,
what is going to be presented to us collectively as the overall pattern for our human
process.
Judgmentation and Laws
This is deeply dominated by homogenization. It is unlikely that is something that is
going to be impacted, certainly not in my lifetime, anyway, and I don't imagine ever.
The fact is that, it’s so obvious to me that with 2027 and the removal of the Cross of
Planning as our background frequency that the way in which judgmentation has
impacted society over the last 400 years or so, there are more laws in the world
now, probably a hundred or a thousand or 10,000 times more laws now than all the
laws that have ever existed in human history.
There are so many rules in the world. It is unbelievable how much litigation there is,
the curse of the law and the lawyers and to see the curse of the law and the
lawyers—I don’t mean to play around too much, but it's fun. There is your great
alignment—the 50th gate, the source of laws. It starts with the tribal laws, the tribal
laws rooted in their unique deity, or whatever that happened to be and what their
basic laws were, the Ten Commandments, this kind of stuff. And out of that you end
up with the collective version, which of course is vast and diverse in which you just
have endless, endless laws.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
And the interesting things about laws that I find amusing—I don’t mean to digress
too much but—it’s very rare that laws disappear. In most major cities, for example,
in North America, the older cities in North America, the Eastern Seaboard, for these
cities there are still laws about where you can tie up your horse, all kinds of
antiquated laws that were there from another era that have never been struck from
the books. It’s just interesting about the way the collective—they establish a law
and then once it's there it is very difficult to get rid of it. It's often very difficult even
to change it, to make some kind of an amendment to it or whatever. It's like it's
been carved into stone and you've got to leave it there.
And it's interesting for me that as we move towards this transition of moving away
from this very, very organized background frequency, that the power of collective
institutions and their judgments, the power of these particular laws, this is
something that without question is going to break down. And of course, that means
that the moment that you start breaking the web of rules that maintain the integrity
of the way the planet operates, you end up with various different kinds of crises.
Splenic Authority: Let Go and Trust It
It's quite a thing, the Spleen, it really is. It is one of those truly magnificent
elements in the infrastructure of life. And it is something to see that if you are a
splenic being and if you operate out of splenic authority, you have to let go. You
simply have to trust it. If you can stand back far enough, you will see that it's
incredibly efficient at keeping you safe if you allow it to. That's really what it's
about.
And in terms of all of the ramifications of the way in which these fears drive the
intelligence that shapes the nature of our world, we can only hope that more and
more human beings, beginning with the core of this, that more and more human
beings begin to follow their Strategy and Authority so that ultimately we have a
chance of changing these frequencies into ones that operate correctly. Well, time
will tell.
Hoped you enjoyed that. To all of you, you take care, enjoy your weekend and until
next time, bye for now.

Lesson Seven
The Ajna
Good morning to all of you and to those that are downloading. This is part two of
our journey through awareness. Obviously, we're going to take a look at the big bad
evil one, so to speak. For me, everything about the nature of what it is to be
transformed as a human being can be pointed at this environment, this Ajna Center.
It is the thing that truly makes us unique. If you take a look at the design of any
form, and particularly if you take a look at the design of mammal, that mammal is
reaching out towards something that isn't there. That is, it has the potential of the
62 and nothing else. The Ajna, the Head Center is something that is deeply, deeply,
deeply human in that sense, and nothing more human in terms of the way in which
we understand our nature than what the Ajna Center represents which is our
conceptualizing capacity.
The Brain: A Binary between Storage and Calculation
Basically when you think about our concepts of brain and the way in which it is
organized that it is a basic binary between storage and calculation. And obviously
within the context of this construct, here
is storage and here is calculation. This
is the thing that makes the Ajna Center
so unusual. That is, that it is the seat of
self-reflected consciousness, and as
such it is the seat of what we refer to as
mind, that it is here that biologically
what is embodied here is the neocortex
and from the glandular perspective this
is the anterior and posterior pituitaries,
and basically this is a control
mechanism for the entire vehicle.
What's so interesting about the nature
of saying that this is a control
mechanism for the entire vehicle, it
doesn't mean that because it's a control
mechanism it has to make the decisions, and of course, this is the great dilemma.
The fact that this is a central zone for the distribution of information doesn't mean
that it also has to be the decision making faculty. But of course, what we
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

A Digital Book for Students
understand about the nature of the evolution of humankind is the moment that this
self-reflected consciousness began to emerge, and it began to emerge in essence out
of the 11th gate, that the moment that this began to emerge there developed
immediately a blind faith, if you will, in its capacities to make sense out of, to
understand, to deal with the nature of the world.
One of the things about the nature of awareness, at least looking at it within the
BodyGraph and the basic circuitry mechanics, is that we started with the
fundamental awareness, the root
awareness, the basic survival awareness.
And we saw last week that in this basic
survival awareness what we have is the
rudiments of or the source of what would
become intelligence. That is, intelligence
as we describe it in the way in which the
mind operates.
It’s very important to understand that the
Ajna Center is a mutation out of the
Spleen. And what I mean by that is that it
is the next step in an evolutionary pattern
in the way in which awareness is intended to function. Obviously, the next step after
that, the one that leads to the transformation in 2027, what we’ll look at next week,
is the movement to the awareness of the Solar Plexus, or the potential of the
awareness in the Solar Plexus.
We are Programmed to be Cognitive
And basically when you look at this construct what you're looking at is the basic tonal
architecture, if I can actually deconstruct
the Head Center for a moment and just look
at it as if it were the tonal infrastructure,
the thing to recognize about tone is that
tone represents what is the essence of, if
you want to ask it that way, why we are
here. That is, the underlying thematic of
the way in which we are programmed is to
be cognitive.
In other words, the basis of all bioforms is
that all bioforms are pointed towards some
demonstration of a cognitive presence. And
whether that cognitive presence is
something that is the relationship between
cells and osmotic connections to each other, or whether it is the relationship between
a form and its environment, the fact is that everything about the nature of being is
rooted in cognition.

LESSON SEVEN
The Ajna
And when we're looking at the cognitive process, that is, when we see it within the
context of tone, what we get to see in the tonal construct is that we have three
binaries. That is, we have a Splenic binary, an Ajna binary and a Solar Plexus
binary. In other words, the same illustration (below) that I just gave you on a larger
scale when you get to see the inner architecture transformed to the outer holistic
pattern.
The Cognitive Mutation
And one of the most fascinating things about the nature of tone is that when we’re
dealing with tone we’re dealing with the fact that
tonal cognition in the nine-centered being is
divided into two possibilities. That is, that there
is an inherent duality and this (right tones) is the
mutation. In other words, this is the presence of
the potential of cognitive mutation.
The cognitive mutation takes place in the Ajna
binary, and it takes place between the 3rd and the
4th tones. This is the difference between whether
one is going to be left oriented or right oriented
and of course the left is where we come from,
that is, that's what we inherited from the seven-
centered being that preceded us, right is where
we're going to in terms of the potential of the
conscious penta. All of this is inherent in this inner architecture, which is all about
cognition and this cognition that mutates here in this Ajna binary.
This movement from this place where this
mutation takes place is that this mutation
takes place in the visual cortex. Now, the
way in which we can pinpoint the visual
cortex in Design is that we can look at the
11th gate and we can look at the 17th gate.
And when you're looking at the 17th gate and
the 11th gate in many ways the 17th gate is
deeply connected to the 3rd tone and the 11th
gate is deeply connected to the 4th tone. In
other words, there is an inherent relationship
always between the underlying architecture
and the way in which the construct operates.
And it is this change in the visual cortex that is the greatest phenomena in terms of
the way in which the potential of mind can operate in this age, something that in
essence is totally new.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
The Fear of the Ajna is Anxiety
The dilemma for us is that historically because the Ajna Center is a mutation out of
the Spleen, that the Ajna Center became the next level of security, and it became a
level of security that inherited the fears of the Spleen, but translated these fears into
anxieties. These anxieties become the driving force in determining the direction in
the life. In other words, rather than the natural response out of the immune system,
what we have is a contrived response out of the Ajna system. This is the beginning
of the flowering of the strategic mind, and a strategic mind in the homogenized
sense. That is, the way in which the true self gets lost by the way in which the mind
determines what the values of the life are, what the direction of the life should be.
It’s really something to understand about this movement from the Spleen to the Ajna
in the evolutionary sense. To really grasp that what got transferred was the fear for
survival. And because the Ajna Center is more powerful, that is, the mind is more
powerful than the immune system and again, the immune system limited to its
single reaction, that in dealing with mind you're dealing with an entirely new
frequency, an entirely new frequency that is a frequency that literally operates over
all time. It is not the spontaneous reaction to the environment or to danger or
perceived danger that is a natural phenomenon out of the splenic system. No, it is
actually a collection of information that is held permanently that becomes the could
have or should have or might of or would have, whatever it is that the mind deals
with and it is through that the mind tries to determine where danger is and how it
should deal with danger.
Oh wow, the trips that we get into when the mind is in charge of dealing with
security and threat. We see the results of that, millions of atomic bombs and people
walking around with guns shooting other people and all kinds of stuff and this is all a
matter of the anxiety that exists in the not-self for its security in the world. And of
course, the fact that it determines that it is unsafe in any given situation doesn't
mean that's true. It doesn't mean that's true at all. We well know that the not-self
is going to take the priorities established by its open centers and its conditioning to
make up its mind about anything. And its ability to recognize threat, or not,
somebody with an open Spleen who holds onto things that are bad for it that
mentally it does not, cannot see the threat, because the mind has a different way in
which it operates. It is not the immune system. It is not capable of protecting us; it
does not know how to do that.
Out of that comes the distortion in the maia. And the greatest distortion in the maia
is the security distortion, the number of human beings on this planet who feel
threatened, the number of human beings on this planet who are ready to threaten,
and all of this operating out of the mental plane. And what you get to see if you just
see it mechanically out of the evolution is what you get to see is that the mind
carried over this deep concern about being able to survive. And in that the mind
suddenly became the most accessible and the easiest authority.
Oh, it’s so much easier to listen to your mind than to listen to your Spleen. It is so
much easier, because to listen to your Spleen first of all you have to pay a lot of
attention and that means that you can’t be paying attention to life, to your mind

LESSON SEVEN
The Ajna
being involved in decision making and this and that, all the problems that go with it.
You have to be relaxed in the back seat to even notice that the Spleen has said
anything to you. And you have to be very aware to be able to pay attention to it at
the moment that it tells you anything. It’s so easily gone.
It’s so hard to trust. It’s so difficult to rely on. And the mind, hey, the mind is going
to explain everything to you. It’s going to tell you precisely why you're going to do
that thing that shouldn't be done that you will do because you think it should be
done and you will make up every possible reason for it. Don’t you notice that about
your mind that the moment that you decide to do A that there's already a part of you
that's ready to do B? That it’s there. Mind is a dualistic thing. It is a “this and
that.” It collects “this and that.” The mind tells you to make a decision, you make a
decision; the decision is pointless. Everything screws up. The mind say, okay, let's
do this instead, let’s try something else. This is mind.
And the underlying theme is the anxiety. No intelligence without fear. No
awareness without fear. Yet, the fear is misplaced. It is not intended to be an
anxiety over whether one has the ability to be able to survive or not. It's not. It’s
anxiety over whether one can express real outer authority. That’s what the anxiety
is there for, to drive the outer authority. Mind is not intended to be inner authority.
It's not. But those beings who evolved at this time, who carried this mutation that
began with the 11 and the 12, this mutation of the larynx, this opening up of the
communicative capacity, this ability within the 11 to begin to store—remember its
relationship to the right—to begin to store information. That storing of information
becoming the history that leads to the ideas that expand the knowledge base.
For those seven-centered beings the mind was everything. It was everything. It
was theirs it seemed; it was what was going to discuss with it its life, its decisions,
its sorrows, its problems. It seemed to be able to look out on the world. And that
mind that looked out on the world with its deep strategic nature was only interested
in one thing, use the mind to be secure, turn the mind into the immune system.
You look at our history, whatever history that we've recorded over the last 3, 4, 5, 6,
7000 years and you see that all of it ended up being rooted in the security issues
that arise out of mind, these fears that separate us. These fears that place us as
enemies from each other, all about an anxiety over whether one will be able to
survive and you can tell that the moment that the not-self is running the life, it
better have anxieties, deep ones, because it is not equipped to manage the life. It
isn’t.
Fear Creates Deep Homogenization through the Mind
What we end up with is two things; a vast homogenized dishonesty in the way in
which human beings communicate with each other, vast homogenized dishonesty.
And at the same time, the gift of this knowledge to be able to see, in fact, what has
happened to this mind and its potential, the potential of the awareness of the Ajna,
and to be able to move towards achieving what that potential actually can be. We

don't know. Fear creates deep, deep, deep homogenization through the mind. You
see the way everybody huddles together on this planet. You know that motto of
“united we stand, divided we fall,” the homogenized fears. All that anxiety over
survival that has led to every single curse on this planet, every one of them, it
doesn't matter where you look.
When I look at the Ajna Center I think wow, no other place do you see this deep
dichotomy between darkness and light. No other place. There is so much incredible
potential that is there, potential that we can’t even—it is science fiction to think
about what's there. And to see how deeply, deeply, deeply it has distorted our lives.
Everything about Human Design is coming to grips with mind. It’s coming to grips
with the fact that you can't allow your mind to create an anxiety agenda for you that
forces you to abandon your nature, because the moment that you strip away from
mind its power to make decisions, then you begin to see the magic, what’s there,
what’s really there.
I started over here, so I will come over here (11th gate). One of the greatest gifts
that the mind has is that it has an ability to store information. This storage of
information ultimately provides depth. We know that the information gets stored
into the Head Center, that is, biologically the deep gray area is where the data
ultimately is stored. But the thing that is so interesting about the way in which the
abstract operates is that its goal is to be able to discover the gems in the flow of the
process. It's not about coming up with an idea of how you can be better than the
other, how you can succeed better than the other, whatever the case may be.
Everything Out of the Ajna Has an Agenda
One of the dilemmas of the Ajna Center is that everything that comes out of the Ajna
has an agenda, this is not correct. When somebody is talking to you, why are they
talking to you? I don't mean to sound banal, but when somebody is talking to you,
what are they actually trying to say? Are they telling you the truth? Can they? Is
there a reason they're talking to you? And if there's a reason that they're talking to
you, what do they want?
Human beings talk to each other in the most ordinary social situations. People
communicate with each other because they need something, they want something.
It’s not innocent. The not-self mind is never ever, ever, ever innocent. It's not. It’s
the conspiracy theory mind. The not-self mind hides the truth, shrouds it, is careful
with its language, and is careful with what it says. It only speaks when it needs
something from the other. And if you need something from the other, then you
speak in a certain way. There are things that you don't say. There are things that
you hide, and you don't do it consciously.
It’s not like you’re aware of the duplicity of your own mind. The not-self just blindly
communicates that way and thinks that's what communication is. And because
every human being is so afraid for their survival at the mental level, not the splenic
level, that human beings are very important for them. Are they friend or foe, are

The Ajna
they safe or dangerous? Can they be useful? Can I take advantage of them? And
so many other things that the not-self mind is so good at. And what it strips us of is
the potential that is there, this potential of outer authority. Outer authority is
expression without purpose. It’s expression; it's communication that is without
purpose. Actually a better word is without intent.
We have no choice. We are gregarious creatures. It’s why we have mouths. We
have no choice. We’re going to communicate anyway. It's what we do. It’s part of
what allowed us as homogenized beings to be able to develop strategies to destroy
anything that threatened us. And whether it was pumping arrows into things or DDT
onto plants, or you name it, we have communicated our way to being incredible
destroyers.
Endless Focus on Survival Strategies
The deepest fear in a human being is for their very survival and it doesn't matter
whether you have or you don't have in this life materially. You're not free from that,
you're not. As a matter of fact, in those that are successful and they’re not-self that
fear is deeper than it is in those who are unsuccessful and not-self. This fear that it
can all be lost, this fear that it has to be protected, this fear that there are always
threats, this fear that one will not be able to make it, period.
So there's this incredible endless, endless focus of the not-self mind on survival
strategies, how to deal with people, how to deal with situations. When you enter
into Strategy and Authority something very interesting happens. That is, that this
fear no longer has any resonance, that is, the anxiety fear. It has no resonance
because it isn't responsible anymore. It can't make the decision. It can't. The
moment you hand over decision making to your vehicle is the moment that you open
up the possibility that there can be healing and transformation in the way in which
the mental system operates.
We are Designed To Communicate through Outer Authority
Yes, indeed we are designed to communicate with each other. But we’re designed to
communicate through our outer authority, because we are choiceless in that. It’s
what we're here to express, the purity of what comes out of our differentiation. It
would make for interesting communications. But it's not that the mind has to
communicate in order to protect itself in the world, or that the mind has to
communicate in order to be successful or to win friends or influence their uncle, to
quote Bob Dylan. It's not what it's about, it isn’t.
The mind has nothing to do with the life. It's there to observe it. It is there to
house the potential of the awareness to experience the phenomena of existence in
this form. And the moment that your mind takes over is the moment you fall out of
what is the true natural order. That is, its true potential. For you to be correct

within the maia, to be correct within your movement, to be correct in your
discernment, that the physical life what is taken away are
these false fears, the lies.
If we look at the way in which the Ajna operates we see
basically that it is a binary within itself. And as I mentioned
its biological attributes, the anterior and posterior pituitary—
by the way, the Ajna for the seven-centered being was really
a holy seat. This is where they place Saturn and Jupiter, that
is, Saturn for the anterior pituitary and Jupiter for the
posterior pituitary. The pituitary glands are master glands
that basically control both the inside and the outside of the
functions of the body. And so in that sense, this is considered
to be a very special seat within the form. And for the seven-
centered being the Ajna was their glory. That is, they used it
as a purely strategic mechanism in order to be able to deal
with their anxieties.
The Shock Absorbers of the Ajna
If we look at the physical nature of the Ajna, or at least the way in which it is
constructed and operates, we see that it's also a binary in another way. Not only is
it a binary in the way in which it's split from this side to that side, but it's a binary in
which it’s split from the upper and the lower.
Obviously, they have very, very different
responsibilities. And one of the things to be very
clear about the Ajna gates that open up to the Head
Center, this is not really where the root of the not-
self mind is. It isn't.
In a car you have shock absorbers, the kind of
springs that when you hit some bumpy road that
the car takes the shock and you don't feel the
heaviness inside the vehicle and you don't start
bouncing all over the place. The first thing to
understand about these gates in the Ajna is that
they’re shock absorbers. They really are. They’re
unusual in their capacity to deal with pressure;
Head Center, pressure center. It is not to be
underestimated how powerful pressure centers are.
Obviously, the Root Center, which is the other
pressure center, that is, the two pressure centers in
the body, the Root Center is even more powerful in the sense that it is a motor. But
it is something clearly to understand that there is a tremendous pressure that is
there in the Head Center that these shock absorbers have to deal with. And basically
they are handling the pressure. It is only in their ability to be able to handle the

LESSON SEVEN
The Ajna
pressure, take the pressure that ultimately we get to this capacity for the potential of
expression, the expression, obviously being down here.
The Logic Side: The 63/4
So what's going on here is a very unusual relationship. Let's take the example of the
logic side for a moment. Here in the logic side we would have the 63rd gate up here
in the Head Center. And in the language of Design this is the gate of doubt. Now,
doubt is an incredible pressure. Think about it. Think about what it would mean for
you to always doubt. Think about it. It’s an incredible pressure. It creates an
unbelievable pressure, because if you cannot trust anything, and of course, logic is
deeply, deeply connected to having something pattern-wise that one can trust, that
one can rely on, and here you have this pressure of doubt.
That pressure of doubt creates anxiety. The shock absorber that takes it in, the 4, it
takes it in and it takes in the full blast of that anxiety. That pressure becomes a
whole fear system. Unlike the Splenic Center that is responding in its immune
protective response to the genuine threats that are there, that the Ajna Center, in
these three gates, these shock absorbers, they’re responding or reacting to what is a
perceived threat. Doubt is a threat. Confusion is a threat. These are threats.
Grasp that, because the moment that you have that, the moment that it gets to the
4, everybody looks at the 4 and says, aha, the gate of answers. Yeah, yeah; it
doesn’t mean those answers are correct. It doesn’t mean they’re right. The answer
is a panic response to the pressure. It is. It’s like oh, shit, I don’t want any doubt,
here’s an answer. And of course, we’re dealing with the not-self. That answer can
end up being their opinion. It can end up being what they decide to do, because of
that doubt pressure.
It’s a shock. This is what starts the whole anxiety process. It’s this constant
shocking that goes on from the Head Center pressure to the Ajna. And every time
there is an inspiration, because people look at the Head Center and say, inspiration
and they think it's all like wow, yes. But if you’re not-self, every single one of these
inspiring pressures leads to fear, to anxiety. So the first thing that the mind does is
that it takes the pressure and it tries to come up with some kind of way to deal with
it. You’ve a doubt about whether a person is really going to be reliable or not, there
are eight zillion answers aren't there? There are more answers than beings. It
doesn't mean any of them are correct.
And each and every one of them can lead down the wrong road, because the
moment that the mind is responsible for the doing, every single one of these threats
can become an action. So suddenly in your head you doubt somebody. It doesn't
mean that that's true. It doesn't mean there's any reason to doubt them. It
doesn't. It’s just a pressure. And the moment that that doubt is there you come up
with an answer, whatever that answer may be. That answer may be, you stop
dealing with the people, you stop being their friend, you divorce them, you send

them away, on and on and on and on and on, an answer to your fear that you doubt
that they can be trusted and you don't know.
It’s not what mind is for. And this is what human beings do. This is all they ever do.
They’re confused about something so they’re desperate to make sense out of it. And
they will act on that. They will act on that because they don't know any better, do
they? The moment that the mind is about doing, this inspiration becomes a curse, it
just does. You end up with this enormous distortion in terms of how to deal with it.
And it's not pleasant. You get a sense of that in each of these gates. This is not
pleasant. It's just dealing with pressure, and not knowing what to do with it, truly
just dealing with it.
It’s here in this box that we deal with the mind that we’re
familiar with, because this is the mind that opens up to
the Throat. It's the mind that opens up to the potential of
expression. It becomes the way in which we recognize
mind. The difference between inner and outer authority is
so profound.
When somebody comes up with an opinion and they're
not-self, that opinion is going to be there to support an
action. The same thing is true for the idea. The opinion
and the idea that in the not-self this is all about, this is
what we act on. It’s my opinion; I think that I should do
this. And I think that you should do that; it’s collective,
after all. I’ve got this great idea for us. Let's go do this.
It's all about doing. I know what you have to do. I know.
I know what I have to do and I’m going to do it now.
Two Ways to Look at the Ajna Center
There are two ways for me to look at the Ajna Center. One way to look at the Ajna
Center is simply to see the not-self, and simply to see the way in which the not-self’s
life is distorted by the way in which it makes decisions through these streams.
Ultimately, the end result is the same. The end result is the verbal gun slinging that
comes with a connection to the Throat and the urge, the need, the fear that if one
does not act on one's thoughts that one will be left behind, that one will lose and the
world will pass them by, and so forth and so on, that human beings must defend
themselves, and on an on and on and on.
And then you can take the other side and you can look at it as outer authority. It’s
outer authority. Have you ever appreciated a beautiful idea without ever having to
do anything about it? I have. It’s quite wonderful. It's just a concept. It’s the
same for any opinion. A well expressed opinion is interesting. It can be rooted in
fascinating understanding of the nature of patterns. There is an extraordinary
potential in these things as awareness. This is the platform through which we are
intended to express our outer authority. And we’re all gifted in different ways. After

LESSON SEVEN
The Ajna
all, this is about differentiation. Some of us have open Ajnas and some of us have
defined Ajnas and some of us have this and that and whatever the case may be.
But it is something to understand about the nature of mind, is that we have yet to
express it, to express its potential, because its potential is when the Ajna Center is
finally able to transcend what is its false anxiety. That it must be responsible for the
survival of the being; that it must be in charge. And the moment that the mind is
convinced that this is its role is the moment that we have not-self and the moment
we have the deep anxiety that leads to the distortion of the life and communication.
The other side is just to see that we all have a gift, each of us in our unique way. To
ultimately be able to express our unique take, that’s what we’re here to do. And
because we are gregarious social creatures, and because it is inherent in us to deal
with the other, it is part of what is our great trajectory in this process. That one of
the things that this knowledge opens up is the possibility of the development of what
is proper communication.
When you strip the mind of its agenda, when you strip it of its intent, the moment
that your mind needs to express with intent is the moment that outer authority is
being lost, because it can't be about what that is going to bring you or what that is
going to do to the other or what it can mean for you or the other. Or it isn't about
whether this one or that one should hear it, or this one hears part and the other
doesn't hear anything. It isn't about any of that.
We are Here to Communicate
It goes back to choicelessness, we are here to communicate. But the way we have
learned to communicate over the thousands and thousands of years of the seven-
centered being is that we have only learned to communicate for survival, nothing
else. To be able to come together and to be able to defeat the lower forms, to be
able to control the plane, to ultimately get to the point where the only thing left to
fight is each other. And all of this is out of a mind expressing a false inner authority.
Your mind is not supposed to be afraid of life.
It's like a lighthouse up there, it’s supposed to be watching the movie and
broadcasting at the same time. Look at what I see. Hey, cool. Look at what I see.
Hey, cool. It's not the way we deal with each other. It isn’t. It's the mind that
gives us this cruel sense that life is nothing but competition, that you have to win an
argument, that you have to have a better idea, that you need a pure insight. That’s
all the comparison bullshit of the not-self mind.
We don't know in the pure collective sense, we don't know how to share of ourselves
mentally with the other. We’re too afraid, we have too many barriers. We’re afraid
to reveal ourselves, to reveal what we really think. We are concerned about
consequences that may or may not happen. We’re lost in all of that. It’s the great
tragedy of the life.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
The Ajna’s Era is Over
To have such a spectacular mechanism, and by the way, its days are done. If in my
thinking about the nature of the Ajna, it is clear to me that its era is over. All of the
emphasis of the program since 1781 has been focused on the Solar Plexus system
and the emergence of the Solar Plexus awareness, that the Ajna itself has simply
become a bridge in order to open up the next mutative pattern. It no longer carries
the fertility of being the prime awareness. In fact, it has served its purpose.
It is clear to me that the program has no interest in unique authority. Again, I'm
anthropomorphizing, but to give you a sense of that. You can see what is normal.
What is normal is homogenization, what is normal is false anxiety, what is normal is
the paranoia of the mental plane. That's what's normal. And this is over. And it's
been over since 1781, it just takes time for these things in an evolutionary sense to
be grounded. There are no more seven-centered beings; there is no more true left.
This whole business about the mind taking over the security of the being, I tell you,
for any of you that understand the substructure and you look at the tonal levels that
are on the right side you will see that there are whole new ways in which the system
will be able to protect itself that far exceed the capacity that the mind ever imagined.
The Personality Crystal is a Filtering Agent
We’re here in a very special time to be able to achieve a possibility of mind that has
always been there as a hope, as a dream, as a vision. And that only in this era with
the mechanics, it is something that is literally possible. To be able to cleanse the
mind of its survival anxiety, to be able to transfer the responsibility to the life away
from the mind, stripping it of that anxiety that it would feed on, opening up a whole
new vista for the potential of mind to begin to experience what is its true power, the
power to filter phenomena. The personality crystal is a filtering agent. It is there to
filter life, to take it in. It’s not like the design crystal that filters in order to program
the vehicle. The personality is here to break down data, and to break it down into
unique streams, to break it down into the vast potential of the diversified
differentiation of mind.
I stand on a very, very tiny little space in my unique authority within the context of
my cross, my profile, my colors and tones and bases. I am one pure outer authority
in the potential of billions. It’s hard to imagine what a world can be like when true
outer authority can be expressed by each unique being, by any unique being. And
the moment that you see without the distortion of the anxiety you actually begin to
see. Oh, how blind the not-self is, how blind the not-self mind is. How can you see
if the thing that is intended to be the see-er is so lost in its fears and manipulations,
that it can only see what it needs to see, what it wants to see, what it has to see,
what it is forced to see, what it believes it should see and sees nothing.
This is the dilemma of this awareness. It’s grand; this frequency of all-time gives us
enormous access to information. Because it is a basic binary we have a tremendous
spectrum of the “this and that” that the mind can collect and absorb, that we have a

The Ajna
great gift of being able to translate what we take in into codes that we can
communicate it with others. It’s a brilliant thing. It is so sad to see it so deeply,
deeply homogenized and incorrect, the level of consciousness on this plane.
Take Away Decision Making from the Mind
There's only one way to deal with this. It's always the same. The first step is to
take away from the mind its decision making. There's nothing more profound than
that. It’s what Strategy and Authority does, it’s why it's such an incredible thing.
It’s why the life gets changed; it’s why it's easier to be you, because your mind isn't
making the decisions. The distortion and anxiety isn't making the decisions. And
yet, you still have to deal with it. You have to deal with what mind is. You have to
deal with the way in which it resonates as mind to the history of mind on this plane,
the way other people use their minds, the way they communicate.
In my process I ended up just simply speaking to fewer and fewer and fewer and
fewer human beings. I'm integration and I’m in a 2/4 Kiron phase, I’m withdrawn
anyway. It is just so clear that when somebody opens their mouth there’s not much
you want to pay attention to. You can’t trust it. You know right away, I’m a 5, I’m
inherently suspicious. You know right away that there is an agenda behind anything
that is being said to you, and how insecure that mind is, filled with its anxiety. And
you can't talk to it. You can’t. You can only hope that it's their serendipity to find a
way to transform their process, to free themselves from that curse, because it’s a
curse.
I love mind. I love it. I don't know any other way to say that. I love it, it’s
fantastic, but I also know what a curse it is. We are here for the beauty; we are
here for the magic of our own potential. And you only get there by conquering mind.
You do it through the vehicle. It’s the only way and slowly, slowly you begin to
watch the emergence of a different way in which this operates. Not as false outer
authority and false inner authority, but true outer authority.
Oh well, sometimes when I talk about mind I sort of feel like I'm beating on a dead
cat. What to do. It is what it is. Stay with Strategy and Authority.
Anyway, to all of you, I hope you enjoyed that. I hope you have yourselves an
interesting weekend and until next time, bye for now.

Lesson Eight
The Solar Plexus
Question: You keep talking about the not-self mind versus the form, do you feel
like maybe notself conditioning is almost like a ghost in the machine of the mind of
each human that has it happening?
Ra: I think that the not-self is what the seven-centered being delivered. And I think
that the dominance of mind is something that we’ve blindly inherited, when in fact
it's not our thing. So, the ghost of the seven-centered being is displayed every day
in the not-self world, in the homogenized world. The homogenized world follows
precisely the same kind of patterns. I don't know if that answered your question,
Cathy, but anyway, let’s get on—well, we’re really in the same subject; we’re into
the wonder of what it is that is taking place within the Solar Plexus. It’s not really
correct to speak of Solar Plexus awareness, not correct in the sense that the Solar
Plexus obviously contains within it potentially the most profound awareness that's
ever emerged out of a form. There is no question about that. That is certainly no
question for me. And it is obvious that the whole evolutionary process that has
brought about the advent of the nine-centered being that almost all of the focus is
on the development of and the final expression of the potential of Solar Plexus
awareness.
The Influence of the Solar Plexus
It is a great dilemma to deal with the Solar Plexus. It really is. It is a dilemma
because it is so incredibly powerful, and it is incredibly powerful not because of what
is the potential of its underlying awareness, but it is incredibly powerful because it
has an enormous direct influence on those beings that carry an active emotional
system and it is something that emerges from them with great force. When you look
at the rave anatomy, when you look at the vehicle itself, when you look at this Solar
Plexus, you're dealing with what is the most complex and the dominant motor on the
planet.
Despite the fact we know that the Sacral Center is the great reproductive source and
is in fact the key to life, when we speak strictly of influence, nothing has more
influence than the Solar Plexus. It has more influence than the mind. It has more
influence than identity. It has more influence than the will. It is an extraordinary
thing. It is incredibly powerful. Nearly 51% of humanity has a defined Solar Plexus
system. That means that we live in an emotional world and we can never be
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

107
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
detached from that. We live in an emotional world. If there is any single word to
describe the maia that we have inherited from the seven-centered being is that we
have inherited an emotional world.
When you look at the seven-centered being you see that the Solar Plexus was not
such a big deal at all. When you look at it in the context of the nine-centered being
you see the emergence of this incredible force. The fact was that it was always,
because it has arisen out of its motor function, it’s always been a motor force. But in
the nine-centered being it has become the dominant force. We know that in terms
of Strategy and Authority. 51% of humanity, their authority is the Solar Plexus. So
it is the most powerful authority on the planet.
There is rarely a couple that you see that are not emotional. It is the authority in
relationships. It is the authority in families. It is the authority in life. It is the big A.
It is the authority. And it is the authority because it's a bully, and I don't mean to
say that with any negative connotation. It’s just that it's the big dog on the block.
When this dog shakes everybody feels it. This is the great power of this instrument
because it's an incredible power.
Somebody who is emotional and who is on the high end of their wave, and it doesn't
have to be the top, somebody who is relatively in a good space, they’re emotional,
it's a nice day, and things seem to be working for them. If you're somebody like me
who’s unemotional, to encounter these beings is very pleasant. And you cannot
escape the fact that they are controlling the environment. You cannot escape it.
They are controlling the environment. This is what emotional beings do.
There is No Truth in the Now
And when we think about the emotional system as an authority, that is, as an inner
authority, we come to one of those extraordinary jokes. It’s a great joke. What do
we say about the authority of the Solar Plexus system? We say that there is no truth
in the now. This is the underlying mechanical exactitude that we can apply to this
center, there is no truth in the now, which means that there is no truth in the now in
the world. And there is no truth in the now in relationships and there is no truth in
the now in this and that. It makes it very difficult. It's very difficult for the
homogenized not-self being to have a sense that there is a possibility of an absolute,
that there is a possibility in their own correctness. What a challenge it is to be an
emotional being.
I do not know that. I do not know that personally, I know that through experience
and through taking in emotional energy all my life and being able to see what it is
and being able to see what it is in the other. What it has led to in me is an
enormous empathy. We are all helpless, after all. And to be helpless with such an
instrument is an enormous challenge because it never provides you with the one
thing that awareness gives you.

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
Awareness can bring you an absolute, a singularity, a truth. It is the possibility that
is inherent in all of us, this unique representation of truth. But it's more than just
the idealized value of that. It is about that no matter what you deal with in this life
that regardless of whether you go this way or that way and regardless of whether
you have gone this way or that way correctly, this is a motor wave. And even
though you know as you go down on the other side that it was still the right thing to
do, you still end up with all that stuff on the other side and all of the possibilities of
that leading to the not-self mind jumping in and making a decision for you.
Oh, it’s quite something to be an emotional being. We are here in a moment that is
so incredible. This is changing. It's changing right before our eyes. It is. Just the
introduction of the mechanics of the Solar Plexus, for those who are emotional, who
have embraced Human Design, what a transformation already in the ability of the
being not to be overwhelmed by the motor function, but to begin to catch a glimpse
of what lies underneath.
I use this term clarity. Clarity isn't an awareness, but clarity is the window to
awareness. Oh, it is. This ability to be able to go through one’s feeling system, to
be able to change the relationship to time. This is where the emotional being has
the most difficulty, is that in understanding that their relationship to time is different
than anybody else's. It's different. Everything has to be seen through the
movement, which means that everything is being broken down bit by bit, that there
can be no rush, that there can be no hurry. It's being able to find that place in which
you can begin to have contact with what's lying underneath.
The Motor Function is Breaking Down
This is a magical time. It’s really here in the 49 and the 55. What's going on here is
that the wave, the motor function, particularly the motor function as it affects these
two gates that that motor function is breaking down. It's like a loud noise that's
covering somebody trying to tell you
something important. That motor
function is the loud noise. It doesn't
give you a chance to hear what is
really being said. And what is
happening in these gates is that this
wave function is beginning to break
down.
As a matter of fact, in many ways it
has already lost its—the same power,
the motor function of the 49 and the
55, the power that it had with the
emergence of the nine-centered
being, now that we are 19 years away
from the end of this particular cycle
and the emergence of this mutation that these gates in and of themselves can’t even

be seen in the traditional way that we have looked at them in Human Design,
because there’s something that's changing there. It is this motor function, this wave
function.
Everything about the Solar Plexus that we experience, that we understand about it,
is its brute force. This is a very, very dense frequency, the emotional frequency. In
the study of substructure, when we go down to the tonal architecture and we take a
look at the right sidedness, in other words, the potential that is there to emerge
through a mutated Solar Plexus, because in tonal architecture the 4th, the 5th and the
6th tones represent the awareness theme potentials, the cognitive potentials that are
going to arise out of Solar Plexus awareness, what we see in those particular tonal
views is that each of them represents a sophistication of frequency and not simply a
sophistication of frequency in terms of the inner frequency but also the outer
frequency.
Think about the emotional system, because it’s unlike anything else. The emotional
system has its impact within the body to the being that is carrying the emotional
system and at the same time has a profound effect on those that are around it. In
other words, this is a center that expresses itself beyond the body powerfully. That’s
the brute surface of what lies underneath. That is, what lies underneath is more
refined frequencies, more refined frequencies that are both available as potential
awareness tools on the inside, but also in the same way being able to impact the
outside.
This is what makes them fascinating and what makes the whole thing about Solar
Plexus awareness so interesting. In other words, it is a new level of sensory
expression, but sensory expression that is able to tap into, impact, affect, and reach
out to the outside beyond the body in a way that competes with mind through the
Throat. Think about that. Mental awareness is something that impacts on the
inside, we well know, the not-self mind running around telling us what to do and all
that stuff, and impacts on the outside when the mind gets its opportunity to express
itself through the Throat. And that also requires a jump from one center to another,
a linkage. In other words, it’s much more difficult.
The Solar Plexus Center is the Awareness and the Delivery System
But the moment you look at the Solar Plexus Center the Solar Plexus Center is both
the awareness and the delivery system. It can reach out, it can impact the outside.
In the same way that that pleasant being who is emotional, who moves through my
aura has an impact on me, whether they know me or not. This is one center that
can so easily be felt. I want you to understand how penetrating Solar Plexus
awareness is going to be; how penetrating, how invasive.
Science fiction loves to talk about people who can read minds, to penetrate the other
person's mind. Well, the science fiction, when we talk about the Ajna, it’s not
science fiction when you look at the Solar Plexus. We're dealing with a cognitive
power that is able to penetrate the other. Now, there are levels of that. That is,

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
that specifically only the 5th and 6th tones have precisely the kind of thing that I am
describing, that is, the ability for example to be able to take information from the
auric field and at the same time put information into the auric field. This is very
powerful.
When you get to the 6th tone and you get to the thematic of touch, this is not simply
about taking information in through touch; it is putting information into the other
through touch. And it's not information in the way we can try to imagine it. It’s not
about having a sense when somebody puts their hand on you that they care about
you or they’re angry with you or whatever the case may be, the sort of very brute
superficial grasp. No, I'm talking about something that will be as sophisticated, if
not more sophisticated, than the way in which the mind, the way in which the Ajna
Center conceptualizes. In other words, this will be another level of conceptualizing,
but a level of conceptualizing that is not limited or locked in within the frame that
immediately has that capacity. As a matter of fact, it’s always going to be both in
and out at the same time, just as emotions are in and out at the same time.
The Age of the Ajna is Over
There is something underneath here that is incredibly powerful as an awareness. It’s
what we are as nine-centered beings, after all. We are an enormous complexity of
awareness potential. It’s what we’re here for. We are here to be cognitive; we are
here to express cognition that each evolutionary movement is a movement towards
the deeper and deeper refinement of the possibility of self-reflected consciousness.
And we have reached, frankly, in this era, right now where we are, we have reached
the end of what the Ajna can do for us.
For me, Human Design PHS and Rave Psychology represent the best that we can do
with mind in being able to understand the nature of our being, being able to discern
out of the mechanics the strategies that are going to be able to enrich and enhance
our process, this is the best that mind can do. Out of that comes its possibility of its
outer authority, the acuity of its intelligence expressed through its unique frame.
And all of that is now. That is, the
potential is now.
But this is where the seven-centered
and the nine-centered being part from
each other. It’s here in this Ajna
Center. This is where the great change
took place, where the mutation took
place. And it cannot stay here. The
mutation took place here, and its next
step is to move in this direction as the
mutation began out of the splenic
system to the Ajna, to raise us above
the mammalian level of conceptualizing
that was rooted to the primal. And now

that this level of conceptualizing has been raised to this point, our point where we
are, this is it.
The wheel is turning. And as the wheel turns the force and the movement, the
momentum of the program moves forward relentlessly. We have this sense in
humanity that we are at the peak, that we have achieved so much and that there are
all these dreamers still dreaming about what they think we can achieve, what they
think we can discover, what they think we are capable of doing. There is this illusion
that this is going on, and this is going to receive that deep fertility that's going to
drive it onwards. Well, I don't mean to put a crimp in that lovely piece of
propaganda, but that’s what it is.
The age of the Ajna, the age the conceptualizing mind being the great thing, you see
that in what we do, that is no longer true. Human Design challenges deeply the role
of mind in the life, strips it of its glory, and strips it of its power to control
everything. We're already putting it in its place, because its time is done. It cannot
help us anymore. It cannot.
The only thing that is going to protect us is our correctness. And our correctness
allows for the continuity with the momentum that is moving away from here (Ajna)
to here (Solar Plexus). All the energy, all the focus is here (Solarplexus). There is
enormous pressure on emotional people in this era. Again, it’s 51% of the planet.
There is this enormous pressure on the Solar Plexus system. It’s just enormous,
because this is where everything is focused in terms of mutation. This is where it's
all going. This is where the energy is going.
The 49th and the 55th Gates
I don't know what to do with the Solar Plexus any more. I know what you can do to
ameliorate its dysfunction. Human Design does well in that job. But I'm a detail
man, I'm a mechanical scientist. I like to see things for what
they are. And I like to know how they work and why they work
the way that they work. It’s what I do. And as a mechanic, I
look at the Solar Plexus system and I don’t quite know what to
do with it. As an example, I have the 49th gate. My
understanding of the 49th gate, which is one of these linchpins
to the way in which the whole of community has operated, it is
clear to me that there's something going on here. It doesn't
feel the way it used to feel for me.
It’s difficult because I don't really have the language to describe
the transition. And right now, anyway, it is a mystery. I will
wait until the end of the Neptunian transit to really tune into
this frequency. For me it is very simple, because every time my
emotional system is activated by somebody else I only have the
49th gate, so everything gets expressed for me. Emotionality is something that I live
out through the 49 and I've been watching it and slowly but surely I realize I don't

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
really know what it is anymore. I don't mean to create any kind of confusion. I'm
trying to point at something that is going on here.
I’m an individual. I understand that mutation changes the rules. It always changes
the rules. Any of you that are interested you can see the progression; I’ve done that
in the 2027 lectures, and so forth, looking at the way in which the mutation takes
hold and the way in which the Solar Plexus system begins to change. But we don't
know what it is until it gets to the other side, if you know what I mean. It is really in
transition. And of course, this is particularly true of the 55th gate. Obviously, the
55th gate is the key in all of this. I speak of the 49 because as many of you know
the 49 and the 55 share a very similar chemistry, they belong to the same codon
family—histidine. So there is this double mutation, in a sense.
But the keying of that is in the 55th gate. I look at that and I see the relationship of
the 55 to 59, its opposition, and it is obvious to me that the nature of love, romance,
the concept of passion, is something that is going to disappear. It’s a motor wave,
after all. The Solar Plexus system is a motor wave. So everything we understand
about these gates, we have to understand them in relationship to the motor wave,
because otherwise you can’t understand them.
It’s like talking about the 55th gate being fickle, the 55th gate that has the cup half-
full, the cup half empty. It only is that way because it's a wave. It’s always in that
wave. There is always the “this and that.” There’s always the marriage and divorce,
there's always the “this and that.” But there is “this and that” that’s connected in a
wave that doesn't have awareness; it is just a wave function.
We don't know what these gates really mean, because these gates exist for us within
the context of the emotional wave. What happens when you strip the wave away
from the gate of principles? Think about that. The 49th gate, the gate of principles,
but of course those principles always in the wave, they’re never consistent. They
can never be a real absolute. They can never truly be carved into stone. But what
happens if there's no motor? What happens when you take that away? When you
take that away whenever that being is correct they’re going to lock into a thing.
It’s interesting. It was one of my discussions earlier in Rave Anatomy to talk about
the influence of the Root Center and how profound the Root Center is and to
understand what the Root Center is always trying to do to the emotional system, it’s
always trying to fix the wave. The 19 is flirting away—look at me, look at me—so
you won’t look at anybody else, to fix that attention to, to fix that.
What we're getting is that this whole wave motor function, that’s what’s beginning to
break down. And as a result of that, there is a different thing coming out of here,
and what's coming out of here is not what we’re used to. That is, not what we’re
used to in the language that we use to describe this because we’ve got to find a
language that is much more similar to the language that we use in relationship to
awareness as a concept, because this is about getting information and processing
information and not only processing the information on the inside, but putting the
information out and putting it out in a much more subtle way.

After all, the emotions are not subtle. The wave is not a subtle thing. But what lies
underneath can be very subtle. What you can pick up in that aura and what you can
put into that aura, without it being something that you instantly have a sense of. As
an open emotional being, if somebody emotional steps into my aura I know it, right
away, instantaneous. But what I'm recognizing is the motor wave, that’s what I’m
recognizing. That’s what I'm feeling.
But what lies underneath is something else. What lies underneath is a
conceptualizing quality that can have the same influence on you as a mental
concept. Think about that. This is awareness. Everything about this is about the
other. That's what you end up with in this life. We’re not here to be alone, so
everything is about the other. How do we deal with the other in this life? We have
primary mechanisms for dealing with the other; are they safe or not? In most cases
it's just simply smell. You’re not going to have somebody in your life that you can’t
smell. This is built into the immune system.
There are two things that you know right away when human beings have contact
with each other. One is breath, which obviously gives off a lot of information. And
the other is smell. And in terms of getting information, in terms of the way in which
your holistic being deals with meeting somebody is that at a very deep level that is
an aspect that is being looked into and researched very carefully. In other words,
does this person smell right, do they do they feel right, there is all this stuff that has
to go on. It’s very, very basic.
And then you get to the conceptualizing. The conceptualizing part gets tricky
because of course you have the not-self mind. And the not-self mind is always
trying to calculate and it’s usually hiding something. So, it looks in different ways at
the other in terms of getting in the information. It looks at them visually and it talks
to them, and here's whatever it is that they have to say. These are ways in which
we assess the other.
Now, when you’re dealing with a splenic system, the splenic system doesn't affect
the other. This is the most primitive. It’s just checking out to make sure that you're
okay. But the Ajna Center, because of its possibilities, the Ajna Center in
conceptualizing with the other can say to them, look, I think you would be terrific
“if,” I’d like to spend time with you “but,” if only you could be this, that, or the other,
or there's this thing missing, or there’s that thing missing. The not-self gets really
screwy when it comes to all of that. You’re not what I thought I should get. It goes
on and on and on.
The Rave and the Penta
We have something very different coming. It's just different. Because what this
does is that it penetrates into the other; into the other. This is all about the
eventuality of the conscious penta. That is, eventuality of the rave. The rave that
emerges is there to give up of its unique identity in order to surrender itself to a
larger form. And in surrendering itself to that larger form, being able to, along with

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
others, contribute to a different kind of synthesized consciousness, the kind of
synthesized consciousness that will emerge out of that penta.
All of this ability within Solar Plexus awareness to go beyond the body is that the
rave actually exists beyond its body. That is, the rave is intended to function in
conscious pentas. It is the conscious penta that is going to take advantage of all of
this awareness that is made available because it comes out, and of course the
identities are surrendered. In other words, you have a deeply, deeply complex
awareness to deal with.
That’s where it's going. And what that means, of course, is that for those of us that
are Homo sapiens in transitus, for those of us who are just part of this nine-centered
interregnum, this transference from seven-centered to what ultimately would be
eleven-centered in this movement in between there is a potential for us obviously in
the awakening of certain aspects of the Solar Plexus.
Now, it will take hundreds and hundreds of years for all of this to unfold. I’ve
mentioned it many times, it’s a great privilege for me in the knowledge that I have
been given, that it’s my joy at being able to be a participant in evolution. That is, to
see evolutionary movements and to not see them from the distant past, but simply
to be able to see them from within them, which is an extraordinary perspective that
we get out of the knowledge. It's clear to me that the correctness of a being,
particularly the correctness of emotional beings, that it is so important to see that
we're going to have very different kinds of emotional systems as we move forward.
The Emotional Right Being
For example, those that are going to be right, those that are going to be at least
three parts right, or if they're both right design Sun/Earth and right personality
Sun/Earth, these beings who are emotional, because they will have to be emotional
as well, those are the ones in which there is the possibility for this new kind of
awareness to begin to present itself in such a way that we can begin to document it.
In other words, we can begin to understand the new values that are going to emerge
out of this center, because this is work in progress.
We’re never going to be able to get the full advantage, because it isn't intended for
us. That is, the full advantage can only exist if one is born as a rave. You wouldn’t
want that. From the human perspective they appear to be severely handicapped,
what would look like a severe autism.
There are physical things that are markedly different. They look like creatures that if
you're in Sparta you throw them over the side of the hill and if you’re in America you
spend millions of dollars keeping them in an institution in which ultimately alone they
never really would have anything even remotely close to life. None of us would want
that, frankly. The fact is that they're designed for something else. They are
designed to be the first multiple integrated consciousness form, something that we're
not here for.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
Humans are the Final Expression of Pure Uniqueness
We’re here in this final expression of humanness to be able to express the
uniqueness of what we are, the uniqueness of our particular absolute. We’re here to
give the last demonstration of the magic of unique identity, because after us there is
no more unique identity. There isn't. Perhaps the most profound thing to consider is
that we’re the final expression of pure uniqueness. I suppose conscious pentas will
claim a uniqueness relative to other pentas, if you know what I mean. But for us
this is the possibility, this is what’s there for us.
The dilemma of the evolving Solar Plexus system is a problem in terms of that so
many things have to be right, no pun intended, so many things have to be correct.
In order for an emotional being in their right-ness to be able to tap into what are
these mutative layers that are emerging and being able to access them takes a lot of
training. It is part of what we do in the higher forms of education in Design. It
begins with Strategy and Authority.
PHS and the Emotional Right Being
But nobody who is right and particularly right and emotional is going to be able to
tap into what are the emerging elements, and right now they're only emerging in the
49 and the 55, unless their nutrition is absolutely correct for them. One of my
strongest recommendations relative to PHS is how important it is for those that are
right to be able to provide them with the strengthening of what are dormant sensory
potentials. They’re dormant basically. They are the sensory potentials that we see
in the 4th, 5th and 6th tones that are so important in terms of they are the guidelines
to the potential of the kind of awareness that is going to emerge.
But right beings have been deeply, deeply conditioned in this left-oriented life. They
have never eaten properly, made decisions correctly as themselves, and so forth and
so on. So, you’ve got a deeply, deeply homogenized being in which these underlying
factors, and the fact that the motor wave is in transition, can actually create a great
deal of instability in them. And not being prepared for the kind of cognitive
possibility that can emerge out of the Solar Plexus they’re immediately at a
disadvantage.
For somebody who really has a chance to be able to explore what is the possibility
that is emerging out of the Solar Plexus, they have to be incredibly correct, they just
do. They have to make up for all kinds of deep, deep, deep conditioning in order to
open up these potentials, in order for all of us to have a sense of them.
I’ve thought about what that would be like, for example, for me, somebody who's
open emotionally, would I be able to sense it, what would it feel like to take that into
my system. I have noticed that in certain ways, I notice that emotional people when

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
they have a signature moment that you get something from them as an open
emotional system that you don't normally ever get. It's a different frequency. It’s
clear. Other than being able to recognize that it’s different, I think that will be the
limitation for somebody like me. That is, because I know there's been speculation—
will people that are unemotional be able to sense this awareness, will they be able to
connect to it. I just think that without being an emotional person, without being
right, I don't think that you can recognize anything other than the fact that
something is different. It's what I notice about my 49. There’s something that’s
really different. I just don’t know what it is. It’s in mutation.
The Breakdown of the 19/49
Again, it's one of those things. It’s obvious to me that it is not something that's
locked in. From what I was told in terms of all of this when all this was given to me
that this particular channel, the 19/49, is closing off. This is the most radical change
the actually takes place in the BodyGraph configuration. It’s why I pay attention, not
simply to the 55, which is the individual mutative key source to this, but also the fact
that it says something very profound about the 19th gate and on the way in which
the 19th gate has a relationship only with the motor function of the Solar Plexus.
When the motor function is taken away from the 49, this channel breaks down,
which means that the 49 has an entirely different function, a function that is going to
be oriented back into the Solar Plexus. The 49 and the 55, after all, are going to be
the first gates that are going to be able to demonstrate this kind of transformation,
that is, what happens when the motor wave disappears.
I don't know how it's going to express itself. Again, it will depend on what is the
tonal architecture. Those people that are right, those people that are emotional,
those people that are going to have the 49-55 are going to be the very first ones
that are going to get a taste of it, whatever it is. As I said from the very beginning
it’s one of those situations where I'm looking at something that is a basic construct,
the basic way in which it's operated, the basic rules of its operating are breaking
down. And that means that it impacts the larger continuity that is there within the
design itself.
The moment that there is a break between the 19/49, not only does the 49—for me I
always see these things as like neuro-receptors, neurons firing. This is shut down.
So, everything about the 49 is that it now becomes a foundation, an inner foundation
for the development of the awareness within and has a much greater impact on the
37 than it ever had before, but a very, very different kind of impact, obviously, once
the motor wave is gone.
It also means that the 19 is different. Where the 19 is in terms of where it brings its
pressure, that this pressure now is no longer a specific pointed pressure, but
becomes diffused as becoming part of simply what is the general root pressure. It's
losing its power, that power to pressure us, to have territory and resources and God
and all those things. We’re dealing with the cusp of one of these enormous shifts
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

117
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
that is taking place. We are in a time where the emergence of the nine-centered
being is something now slowly that is being recognized. As Human Design expands
day by day there are more and more human beings coming in contact with the fact
that we are different, that we are this kind of matrix that has different laws and rules
to the way in which it operates.
This is a Pluto Interregnum
And yet at the same time, that this in and of itself, this whole interregnum is deeply,
deeply, deeply mutative. It’s ruled by Pluto, after all. This is a deep transformation
that is taking place. Pluto down here in the 41st gate in 1781 when the nine-
centered being emerged and Pluto again is going to be in the 41st gate in 2027, this
is a Pluto interregnum and there is incredible transformation that is taking place.
In the end, what does it all say? It says that there is only one way for us. There's
only one way for emotional beings. It is this step-by-step journey that one takes
into the correctness of what is possible for oneself. Everything will sort itself out, so
to speak. But the fact of the matter is that for the knowledge for the future that the
more emotional beings who are aware, who operate correctly, the more profound our
understanding is going to be of the transitions that are taking place here. And not so
much, by the way, how the transitions are going to impact us necessarily directly,
they’re much more intended for the raves and what's coming, but it will give us a
way to be able to deal with it. It will give us a way to understand the shifts that are
taking place.

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
The End of the Cross of Planning
All of that, by the way, is going to take place against the backdrop of the end of the
Cross of Planning. And the end of the Cross of Planning is going to be a huge shock
in and of itself. The inherent support systems that are there in the Cross of Planning
are going to begin to break down at the same time that this mutation begins to show
its face. And it's going to show its face a lot more in the beginning in humans who
are right than the birth of raves who it is intended for.
And there are going to be those that in their correctness will begin to gain cognitive
access to this. I still do not understand the way in which it's going to work. In other
words, is the cognition that is going to be rooted in the Solar Plexus awareness, is it
still cognition that will need to be conceptualized at some level mentally for us as
humans?
Will it be possible for those that carry this mutation and who are correct to be able to
communicate with other emotional beings, and I mean communicate, I don't mean
feel each other, I really mean communicate, but without that needing the
intercession of the Ajna in the Throat. These are things we will ultimately discover,
but they are things that we need to know about the way in which this transformation
is going to operate.
It’s been so deeply, deeply hidden. It’s not like I was told reams of information
about it, I wasn’t. I was given very, very specific instructions about how to see this,
when it was going to take place, where the impact was going to be, these kinds of
things. But in how it was going to work in us, that wasn't the point, because again it
was how that was going to work in the rave, what's coming.
When I went through my process of teaching 2027, the eleven-week Rave
Cosmology program, it brought to me a recognition that I am really uncomfortable
with raves as a thing, whatever they are. My concern, my deep concern is about
those of us who are in this form who have to deal with this mutation that isn't
intended for us, and yet at the same time we're going to have to deal with.
Being that my focus is in the mechanics to be able to find a way mechanically for
those that are going to experience this mutation and who are going to experience it
in their process, to help them, to help them take full advantage of it and to help
them not to be victims of it. And at the same time, to understand what the changed
emotional system is going to mean in terms of the way in which the aura works. The
whole motor doesn't disappear right away, because it takes a very, very long time.
And in fact, the motor functions in the 30 and the 36 never disappear. They will
always be a motor function. That is, until the end of the round itself. This is just
motor function.
So, it doesn’t mean that all of it is going to become aware. The only one that will
not display it purely is the 6, because the 6 is the source of the motor, so it can only
go so far in terms of its balance with the awareness. But in terms of the 49-55, the
37 and the 22, these are the gates that are going to be there that are going to have

the potential to be able to express the deep, deep, deep cognitive possibilities of
what the Solar Plexus can offer.
I’ve got an Uranian body, and if I'm lucky I'll live a long time. I just hope to see
some of it. I hope to see the results in emotional beings that operate correctly and
go through a long process of deconditioning to get to that place where they can
begin to experience and be able to document the awareness that is going to emerge
out of the 49 and the 55, and ultimately the other gates.
What is that awareness? When we look at the Ajna Center, we’ve got it down pat.
We’ve got I believe, I think, I know, we’ve got all of these different kinds of formulas
that we can run by in terms of that process, the opinions, the ideas, the insights.
There is a change of language ultimately that will need to take place. But it's a
change in language that can only take place when there is evidence of what the
function is. It is a fascinating process. It’s one that is a great part of the verification
of this knowledge in a historical way. I very much look forward to all of this as it
explodes into the world. It was truly an extraordinary thing that I received. And it is
so obvious to me that this is a deep, deep physical process that we are so caught up
in and it’s one of the most fascinating things to watch.
The Emotional Left Beings
Written question: Would you say that left emotional people are more deeply
hooked onto the motor function of the Solar Plexus?
Ra: Yes, I would agree, Alok, I think that left emotional people are caught in the
motor function much, much more and particularly those that have the 30-36. If you
have 30-36 elements you tend to be hooked to it. I notice that, for example, in my
41 that my 41 is hooked to that motor function of the 30. It brings it out. Again,
the thing that ameliorates all of that ultimately is the enhancement of our awareness
core, which is still going to be the Ajna Center for us humans that we get to a place
where we can witness. When we get to the witness stage, when we get to the
passenger that is the observer, that's the moment that we can accept the
phenomena, if you know what I mean.
Living Correctly
I don't think it is unhealthy for a Solar Plexus being to be motor oriented, as long as
they’re correct. And there's always going to be, as long as we have this plane,
emotional beings who are going to be motor oriented and then there will be some of
them that are going to be deeply fucked up and confused by what has happened to
them. And there's going to be others that tap into the potential awareness functions
that are there. Because we have a group that over a long period of time has been
trained and will continue to be trained, it's my hope that this is something that we

LESSON EIGHT
The Solar Plexus
will continue to investigate and look at more and more as we approach 2027 and
beyond so that we can have a sense of it. It is fascinating.
Written question: Will the witness with emotional definition almost feel as a split
being?
Ra: I think the moment that you’re a passenger is the moment that there are no
“this and that” anymore in terms of the vehicle. The vehicle is just the life and this
is what you do. And whether you're watching your emotional nature, you're
watching any other aspect of your nature; I think that that's all it is. The one thing
that I know is that if you operate out of your authority you’re always correct, you’re
always perfect. So it doesn't matter how you display this or that or the way this or
that comes out. It’s correct. And as long as one stays with that correctness that’s
the only thing that is going to save us.
Watching the Transformation
My conversation today is really about pointing us towards watching this, being aware
of it, paying attention to particularly these gates in the beginning, trying to suss
them out, trying to get a sense of what that is. But most of all, it’s another way of
me reminding you how different we are and how lucky we are to have a mechanical
way of being able to deal with the complexities of not just simply being us, but being
us in this time of incredible transformation and mutation. May you live in interesting
times; well, we do.
Anyway to all of you, I hope you enjoyed that. And until next time, bye for now.

Lesson Nine
The Mystery of the G
I really enjoy these Rave Anatomies, because they give me over and over again
these wonderful opportunities to go back after going through layers and layers of
work to go back and to look at just basic ingredients of what is the BodyGraph and
what makes the BodyGraph such an extraordinary thing.
I have been involved in a lot of speculation now and thought about the nature of
being and one of the things that is fundamental to my understanding of the nature of
the biverse and the way in which the biverse operates, the way in which the biverse
came into existence is that it came into existence through the action of the magnetic
monopole. And the magnetic monopole has been one of the enduring mysteries of
my work over all these years. It is part of what is inherent in this titling of this
mystery of the G, what makes this center so fascinating in the way in which it is the
expression of an extraordinary and incredibly ancient process.
The Magnetic Monopole
The dilemma of the monopole to begin with is something that I've been discussing in
various lectures since Juxtaposition in December, and that is my contention that the
magnetic monopole is something that is neither magnetic nor is it actually in fact a
single thing. It functions as a mono-pole in the sense that it holds everything
together. But in fact inherently, that is, what it is in and of itself is that it is in and of
itself a binary. Ultimately, everything is rooted in the binary that is expressed
through the monopole.
There are some complex illustrations in
here, at least for some of you who have
not encountered or been part of these
various lectures. Basically, I will try to
keep it relatively basic and simple. In
the beginning, if I can put it that way,
the beginning before the start, let's call
it that, what we have basically are two
objects, these two objects. And you can
see that these two objects are in fact
the dividing up of this graphic (in the
blue box), which has always been the
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

123
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
graphic of the monopole. And these two objects are both deeply connected to each
other, and at the same time create what is referred to in terms of the monopole
rather than it being magnetic that the monopole has a capacity that we call capture.
Dark matter is a very strange thing. As yet, we can only infer its existence. What
we know clearly is that it is the vast majority of the mass of the totality. In other
words, it is everywhere, permeates everything, and holds everything within it. And
it is a continuity. That is, it is a continuity that is there throughout the biverse. It
means that the monopole, in a sense because I'm being metaphoric, that the
monopole is never separate from anything ever. It is always connected to it. And
the monopole has as a function this function of pulling things together and moving
them.
Basically, these two components represent two different ways in which the
movement from the beginning
evolved. And these two different
ways, in fact, lead to a
juxtaposition and it is in this
juxtaposition that life itself or
what we would call life, the
existence of the totality,
emerges. It is the same thing in
our microcosm of the vehicle that
we have these two distinct
objects and that these two
distinct objects form a
juxtaposition in which in that
juxtaposition the holistic reality
of the being and its life emerges.
The Magnetic Monopole Operates out of the G Center
The illusion, as the biverse is an illusion, and everything
in it, but so, we do live in it, don't we? Anyway, what
fascinates me about the monopole, at least for the level
of this particular lecture, is what it means when we begin
to look at it as it is brought to the surface and brought to
the surface, because this is what Rave Anatomy is about,
brought to the surface and is there in the G Center. That
is, it operates out of the G Center. We know that
technically speaking the monopole sits approximately
here where the 2nd gate is, the so-called mystically
anyway, the keynote of the gate of the driver. So, in
fact, we know that it actually sits here, probably actually
sits somewhere like this, quite frankly, but anyway.

LESSON NINE
The Mystery of the G
The fact is that what is interesting about this is that if you deconstruct out of this,
and of course what we have in these two elements of the monopole is we have this
element here and you can see that it has a coding, the ‘p’ which stands for pole, and
then you can see that there is a symbol. In this case, the symbol is a symbol that is
like this. And of course basically what you're looking at is you're looking at this. So,
here you see the symbol repeated. And if you look over here and if you look at the
configuration and the way it is structured what you get is that you get the trident, if
you will, of the Sphinx. In other words, this is what you're seeing here in this pole.
Again, you can see the appropriate configuration where the symbol beside the ‘p’ is
just basically a trident.
So, what we're looking at here is that we are looking at the G
Center representing something rather extraordinary. Let’s
think about it this way. The nature of
the design in terms of what the
design is, in terms of its holistic
presence in the vehicle, that it is
expressed as a key here (left image.)
We also know relative things like for
example the 46th gate is basically the
gate in the Vessel of Love that is
specifically directly connected to the
vehicle itself. We can also see that from the personality
perspective that the personality, that the relationship here is
on the Sphinx aspect of the G (right image.)

RAVE ANATOMY II

The Monopole Holds Us Together in the Illusion of Our Separateness
In other words, let's think about what the monopole does. One of the main functions
of the monopole is that it holds us together in the illusion of our separateness. So
what is it bringing together? It is bringing together this (pπ) and this (pψ). This is
how the G Center is created breath-by-breath, moment-by-moment, because the G
Center is not one thing. The G Center is a binary. We see them superimposed over
each other in the graphic, if you know what I mean. But it’s a binary, and it is a
binary that is being held together by the monopole. And this is the way that the
holistic vehicle is given the foundation of its identity.
Think about these eight gates that are there in the G Center. The best way to
understand the G Center is to look at the BodyGraph inside of the rave mandala.
This is part of everybody's introduction when they begin to get educated in Human
Design to be able to see, to begin
with, the relationship between the G
Center and the mandala. It's one of
the first ways to begin to glimpse the
complexity and at the same time the
beauty of the symmetry in the
mechanics.
We know that these eight gates in the
G Center divide the wheel into exactly
eight different parts, that they are the
key gates in what is a family of
chemistry. They literally represent
the breakdown of the year as a
calendar. This is the expression of
not simply the identity of the
potential of the individual but the
identity of the maia itself, because
when you put all of us together, this
is what is being created, this identity
of the maia.
Homogenization
We know, of course, that we have quite a dilemma when it comes to the identity of
the maia because we know that the identity of maia is distorted. We know that the
totality is not-self. That is, this is a homogenized world. And as a homogenized
world the true nature of our identity is something that is hidden. Think about it in
the sense of just about every human being at the scientific level in, let's say human
biology, that there's not any one of them that has any idea that we are not the same
species as the creature that was walking around prior to 1781.

LESSON NINE
The Mystery of the G
So, we live in a homogenized identity of what our physical nature is, what our mental
nature is. We live in a homogenized identity that has been established by the
supremacy of mind as a decision-making entity that has created out of its
homogenization, out of its distortion, has created the density of this maia, an identity
of what it is to be human. If you look at humans as a whole and you think about the
identity of them as a species, homogenization has not been kind.
But it says something very profound about the emergence of this knowledge of the
nine-centered being and the mutation that took place in 1781. It is the beginning of
the identity of the species actually having a potential to emerge, a new identity, an
identity that is very, very different from homogenization. It's what we live with at
the mundane level in your work personally with yourself in Human Design.
It is about establishing what your identity is. Now, I’m not talking about whether
you have a defined G or an undefined G, I’m talking about the holistic being that is
held together by the agency of the G Center, whether it's defined or not. It is the
holistic being, its identity that begins to be transformed when that being begins to
function correctly. In fact, your holistic identity is something that you find in your
cross, in your profile, in your motivation, in your “this and that,” there you find the
bits and pieces that synthesize as what your identity is.
We are a Very Complex Binary
Human Design brings this possibility by understanding something that the seven-
centered being could not grasp, that we are a binary consciousness, that we come
out of a binary root, that we are programmed by a binary system. And the illusion of
us being holistic, well, as I said, underneath no matter how much you want to see
this as a unity, it is always a binary. And yet, it is able to be held densely enough
together here by the agency of the monopole to bring about the phenomena of what
we call our lives.
It is only in our awakening to this duality, it’s only in this that we begin to define
ourselves as a nine-centered being. This is what makes us different. What makes
us different from all of our predecessors is a recognition that there is a consciousness
that operates within us that is actually there to be able to take care of most of the
things that we have labored with unsuccessfully all our lives at the mental level.
I remember those moments at the very, very beginning of my process in 1987.
Some of the very first people who got to look at what I was doing wondered what is
this second calculation, and why is it 88°, what is that? Out of the astrological
tradition all of them could accept some kind of breakdown of analysis rooted in birth
time. But there was this other thing; what the hell is this other thing, this so-called
design. And this is the beginning of the awakening of the nine-centered being. And
it's not about a mental concept. It's not about saying it’s there, believe in me. It’s
is about saying, hey look, it's there, try this, you'll see for yourself, because it's a
mechanism. It's a consciousness that rules the vehicle’s mechanism.

127
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
This is really where the opening up is for the nine-centered consciousness to begin to
emerge on this planet and it begins with recognizing that we are this very, very, very
complex binary. We are a true duality. We are dualistic beings, we have a dualistic
consciousness. We are “this and that” woven together through the BodyGraph,
through the agency of this.
Because when you understand that the eight gates of the G Center are the ruling
gates that divide the wheel, that in essence they create everything, they hold
everything together, they create the pattern of all existence. It’s all held together in
this illusion by that monopole. And it is expressed out of the G Center to the totality
that is our relative totality, our solar plane here.
But you have to grasp what we are. That moment when you turn over decision
making to your body, to your inner authority, to wherever that happens to be, your
Sacral, your emotions, your Spleen, your “this,” your “that.” And when you've done
it long enough to see the evidence of its intelligence, because it's really intelligent,
it’s only then that you can begin to really sense this difference that we are different,
that we do have these two consciousnesses, these two very different cognitive
potentials.
And it is about finding a way to bring them in balance within us, because in the end
it's all frequency. In the end it's all about being tuned. The tuning of the frequency
is the level of perfection in the correctness, finer and finer and finer in that tuning in
order to be able to express the potential of the differentiation of the uniqueness that
is possible. But it's only when you divide the roles, truly, it’s only when you divide
the responsibilities; this is a
partnership. The holistic being
cannot operate fully in its per–
fection without the arrangement
between the personality and the
design.
To be a nine-centered being is to
have an identity that is funda–
mentally dualistic and it truly is.
One of the things that you discover
the moment that you enter into the deeper intellectual aspects of this knowledge is
that you begin to recognize that the life is everything. That is, the vehicle’s life is
everything. It is the vehicle’s life that determines the nature of existence. It
determines the potential of the self-reflected consciousness.
And it is only then when one fully accepts that it is the vehicle’s life, can the
passenger step back and begin to fulfill its potential to filter the consciousness field
and to take in the experience of the existence in form. But they are different. What
the passenger sees isn't necessarily what the passenger wants; don't we all know
that about life. The passenger moves beyond its needs, its wants, because it knows
it's no longer in charge. It knows it can no longer interfere with the process, that it
is not in charge of a holistic direction, but it is an aspect of it.

LESSON NINE
The Mystery of the G
The G Center and the Nine-Centered Being
In Rave Cosmology the other day I was looking at the evolution from the seven-
centered to the nine-centered being, and of course, what is interesting in the
relationship between the Hindu Brahman chakra system and the rave centers is that
there is no relationship whatsoever in terms of the seven-centered to the nine-
centered being relative to what we call the G Center. Aspects of the function of the
G Center are in minor centers or aspects of other centers, but the essence of G
Center as we understand it is something that is very much a deep nine-centered
program.
Everything about being a nine-centered being is centered on the G Center;
everything. Now, I’ll tell you why. We are an interregnum; that is, we are a
transitional form. We’re neither “this” nor “that.” We are neither the past nor are
we the future; we’re the journey. That’s us. We’re carrying all of this through in its
process. And because we carry within this transitional form, the rave BodyGraph,
because of the way in which it is structured and because of the nature of the tonal
architecture underneath, that there are two things that are possible out of this
process. One is the achievement of perfected identity. And the other is the
achievement of perfected surrendered identity; to give it up totally, or to express it
absolutely.
This is a duality that the nine-centered being brings. And when I say that this is the
duality that it brings, please understand that in essence it brings a focus, a deep
focus on the nature of identity. No human, that is, no Home sapiens in transitus, no
nine-centered being in this transitional process is ever going to fully give up or be
able to surrender its identity. That is something that will only be possible for a rave.
For a human being, what it does mean is the risk of giving up any sense of needing
to protect one's identity. In other words, to be able to protect one's self.
And of course in that sense, they are very vulnerable to the way in which the
potential of the impact of the world is going to have on them considering that the
homogenized world, which will continue till the end of this round, the homogenized
world has a priority on survival, that the next cycle we enter into is a very individual
survival-oriented era that is going to last hundreds of years. So, the potential of this
mutation towards the surrender of identity mostly will result in beings being deeply
homogenized and never given an opportunity to be able to express their uniqueness.
The Expression of Unique Absolutes
Everything about the introduction of this knowledge, everything about the knowledge
that was given to me was all pointed towards the same thing. That is, it was pointed
towards the expression of unique absolutes. And that's an oxymoron. To express
absolutes that each being expresses an absolute in their own right, the great
differentiation of the consciousness potential of evolution is to reach that point in
which it is possible that a being becomes a unique force of consciousness, no longer
dependent but absolutely able to stand in the flow of the maia and to be able to

A Digital Book for Students
operate correctly. And for me in terms of my work as a messenger my message is
to those that can fulfill this promise. That's what Human Design teaches; it is what
we are here for. We are here to support the unique expression of individual
differentiation.
But at the same time, it's essential to see that this identity of ours, so-called, this
binary is still a binary. And it is part of the way in which we are divided in the sense
of the way in which we operate at the mental level. In other words, one of the
things about the nine-centered being is that the nine-centered being is a mutation,
obviously. And that mutation has opened up a different way in which the brain
system can operate relative to what the seven-centered being was. The seven-
centered being in terms of the way in which their neocortex operated is that they
were specifically strategic. In other words, everything about the way in which they
operated was based on strategic processing in order to be able to have the kinds of
agendas that would allow them to dominate.
The transition to the nine-centered being opened up a different possibility, a
possibility of receptivity, a possibility of being able to assess environmental
information at a much more sophisticated level. Within the context of the nine-
centered being since 1781 half of the population has always had this potential of a
new sensory possibility. Everything about us is this binary. And our identity is being
pulled this way and that. And one way it’s being pulled towards this perfection of
uniqueness and the other way it’s being pulled towards the complete abandonment
of the need for uniqueness.
The Rave
It's so different. The eventuality of the rave, the rave is a very, very strange
mutation. It is a strange mutation in the sense that it is only a step in the mutation.
It’s why it begins with the Sleeping Phoenix. The Sleeping Phoenix has to wake up
and then die and then be reborn. We are moving towards this profound mutation in
the way in which everything operates and we have this struggle in the sense of what
our identity is. Those beings that are born that are right, those beings are being
pulled into a strategic identity of what it is to be human when in fact it's not who
they are.
So, one of the dilemmas that we have in the era that we’re dealing with is that we
have a struggle going on between the dominance of the homogenized identity of
what it is to be a human being, the possibility of what Human Design brings in being
able to understand the mechanics is to break away from the homogenization to be
able to establish this unique identity. And yet, at the same time there is this
movement towards the mutation that says you’d better do it fast because the future
is about giving up identity to a larger whole, to the conscious penta. The rave is
going to give up its identity to a penta. It will no longer be an individual. It will no
longer see itself, think of itself as unique. It will no longer be connected to its own
personal process at all. I don’t want to have anything to do with that. I won’t
anyway.

LESSON NINE
The Mystery of the G
We are Objects Moving in Space
It's just something to understand about the dynamic of the tension that is there in
the G Center, and that this is our movement and that we cannot avoid this
movement. This is our movement in space. This is where we are going. I look at
the identity and I think about its central theme, this unique direction, this unique
movement. The moment the frequency is correct, that is, the frequency holistically,
this movement becomes everything. After all, I repeat it over and over again that
we are objects moving in space. I don't say that for the poetry. It says so much
about existence, that it's all about this movement, this flow.
We are not alone in this movement, so there are these beginnings of seeing a vast
choreography. And to begin to recognize that from the mental plane that we have
no way of grasping this movement. From the mental plane we’re locked into the
static nature of our physical maia. We sit in chairs and don't know that we’re
hurtling through space. We don't have that perspective, but the vehicle does. The
vehicle is deeply, deeply sensitive to its frequency, its movement. Identity arises out
of positioning. We are intended to be in certain places. It is why when you do basic
analysis and you see somebody with an undefined G you talk about the right place
with them, because it's the greatest truth of every one.
The Open G Center
In the beginning all centers were open. If you look at most forms of life and you do
their design they’re invariably Reflectors. Obviously, the smaller and smaller the
potentials in the matrix, the less possibility for what we call definitions. But, I talk a
lot about open centers being a source of wisdom and I think that sometimes words
don't really carry everything they can for you, because you're locked into certain
ways of seeing. We look at the open centers as a place that receives information
from the other, amplifies, in fact, received information from the other.
When I look at the open center I look at the basic receptors that have been placed
there within the relationship to the program. And when I look at an open G Center
it's like in baseball you look at the catcher. This is where everything is caught. This
is where the spider weaves its web. This is the core of the possibility of bringing
things into identity. Look at the design of forms, look at the inanimate; they all have
a G to establish that unique specieal identity. But none of them have a G like this.
The Monopole Cannot Control the Holistic Frequency
The monopole, this holding us together, I think one of the most fascinating things for
me about the monopole that is so incredibly powerful is that it has no control over
what it creates. I think that's magical. It's the thing I find so fascinating about all
this. We have this incredible agency. It’s able to hold us together in the illusion of
our separateness. It is able to hold these parts together. It holds these parts
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
together, out of what we get to see is the G Center. It holds the part together within
the construct of the totality within its relationship to the wheel, it holds it all
together. It gives it its direction, but it cannot control the holistic frequency. It has
no ability to be able to do that. It can hold it together. It can move it, but it can't
control it.
It can’t control it because the holistic, its frequency is the result of the work of the
monopole in pulling it all together, but the frequency has its own life, because the
frequency is a self-reflected consciousness. What is brought together is the
hardware and the software, the brain system, the ability to filter through it, the self-
reflected consciousness that's a result. And this holistic being, if it's not correct, the
frequency isn’t correct.
And though the monopole will always hold us together, this is capture. The crystals
are the same matter. Though it will always hold us together, it doesn't mean that it
holds us together in a way that is healthy for us because transference will take place.
The monopole cannot control the frequency it receives from the design or the
personality crystal. It's at the mercy of the holistic vehicle. It is at the mercy of the
monster it creates. How sweet. I really like that.
Homogenization is Being Out of Tune
Anyway, it also leads of course to the great mess—homogenization and all the things
that go with it. And the fact that we all end up not going exactly where we should be
going, not looking exactly where we should be looking, not thinking the way we
should be thinking, and it goes on and on and on and on. And yet, we have the
tools.
We have the capacity to look, to be able to see, to be able to see within ourselves
what is possible. To be able to operate correctly, to begin this process of fine-tuning
the frequency, because that's what it is. We are just this frequency. And this
frequency that's made up of all of these various levels of frequency from the density
of what appears to be our bodies to the ephemeralness of the aura. It's all
frequency, all the way down, deep as deep can go, down to our very basic atomic
nature; frequency, frequency.
Homogenization is simply a matter of beings being out of tune. And they're out of
tune because transference is taking place in the way in which the monopole is
receiving color information from the design and the personality. And that
transference is taking place because the one thing the monopole can't control screws
everything up, the holistic being. The holistic being being incorrect creating a
distorted frequency that cuts off the cognition that eliminates the possibility of
correctness and with that comes all of its consequences, the negative consequences
that are so much a part of the homogenized life.

The G Center is the center of our tuning. It is what it's about. It is frequency that is
going to give us our identity. An interesting thing for those of you that have studied
tone with me in the work that we do in tone and tone is the inner architecture of the
BodyGraph.
We have three binaries, sensory binaries, each of these binaries have two senses
related to them. And in the center is what is called the acoustic. That is, in the
context of the way in which tonal
sensory information works it’s the
seventh sense. And the relationship
between these two is not accidental in
terms of where they are and what they
are. In the same way that it is the
acoustic frequency that holds the whole
tonal process together, because tone is
only the differentiation of frequencies
based on architecture.
The thing to recognize about the G
Center and the monopole is that it's
holding together the frequency. It's
holding it all together here and this is why we give this the generic of being the
center of our identity. It is the way our frequency goes out into the world. It is how
we are met by the other. To enter into your Strategy and Authority is an
unbelievable thing. It really is. Because it opens up the possibility to fully embrace
what we are.
Turning Over Authority to Your Vehicle
The very, very first step in the true recognition of being a binary consciousness is
turning over authority, turning it over to your vehicle, to the consciousness that was
never recognized, to the consciousness that is so important to us. We’re not here to
be ruled by the mind. Not us, not nine-centered beings, we are not. We know
where the mind goes. We know that, we see what it does; we see what it is in a life,
what it has created in the world, this is not us. This is what we inherited from the
past. What Lao Tzu recognized right at the beginning of all of that that this mind
thing was going to make the world a horrible place.
We’re not the same creature. And the only way that you can differentiate yourself
from the seven-centered past, the homogenized seven-centered world that you live
in is that you operate as a nine-centered being, which means that you operate
according to your inner authority. This is the first step. And it begins finally to
separate these processes because they've always been separate, that they do not
have to worry about holding everything together, because it's not their job.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
I've been doing that lecture from the
very beginning of my career—three
components, the three components:
design crystal, personality crystal,
magnetic monopole; vehicle, driver,
passenger. If you allow the driver to
drive, if the vehicle is healthy, it opens
up all the possibilities for the
passenger. But everybody's got to be
allowed to do their job. The authority
for making the decisions of what and
where comes from the design crystal,
that the movement towards it is
controlled by the monopole, that the passenger sits back and watches the movie.
This is how we distinguish ourselves. This is why the foundation of the knowledge of
the nine-centered being has been the spreading of the message of what Strategy
and Authority is, because most people that come into contact with Strategy and
Authority don't think about following a strategy as being the recognition of another
consciousness operating within them and it is. It’s what makes us different. It's
what gives us our unique possibility, because we have the freedom to go through the
next evolutionary process of personality.
The Personality Needs Attention
There’s nothing new about design. This is an upgraded vehicle. It's hotter. It's
more complex. But the thing about the design is when it’s operating correctly one
does not have to pay attention to it; it’s a smooth running reliable mechanism. It’s
always the personality that needs attention, and the personality needs attention
because it's going through a whole new phase. One way of thinking about it is this
way. In the precursor to the seven-centered being, if we think about the
Neanderthal and we think about the personality of the Neanderthal, the personality
of the Neanderthal was simply passive. It was just passive. It just was aligned to
the natural order, not much differently than primates, in that sense.
When you get to the seven-centered being you have the personality taking over
control of the life itself. Now, at this point, not the passive, not the strategic, but the
observer is what we are. We’re here as personalities to observe. It is the last
chance for personalities to observe. They will not consciously observe as raves. It
will all function through the conscious penta. This is the challenge for our
personalities, for our personalities truly to fulfill the potential of what it is to be a
passenger, to observe the most evolved role for the personality, no longer having to
be in control of the mundane function of the life, freed of it, liberated, no longer
having to be concerned about where the vehicle is going, freed of it, able to begin to
enjoy the fruits of its correctness, the acuity of its awareness, its perceptivity.

LESSON NINE
The Mystery of the G
The whole story about the nine-centered being is the G. It's about identity. This is
the story. It’s what holds everything together. It is the very core of everything.
And in that, we are seeking the perfection of what is our dualistic holistic reality.
Who is this thing that is us? I think of myself as an us. I do, because I know that
I'm nothing more than the synthesis of components. And yet, the consciousness
within it is everywhere and there are such vast differences, that I just see myself as
a coordinating consciousness, participating in the advantage of all of these different
things at work.
But this is where the essential beauty of the passenger can be found. And as I said,
you know this is the end of this road, this road of moving towards more and more
finite examples of uniqueness. It is to create a basic diversity for what will
ultimately emerge as raves so that the components of pentas are sophisticated in
their differentiation, but sophisticated in their differentiation for the advantage of the
conscious penta, not theirs. We’re the last selfish form, the last selfish singular
form, because in fact the conscious penta will look after itself rather well.
The Great Mutation
It’s why I have this ongoing delight at seeing that the great mutation that we’ll meet
in 2027 begins with the 55.6 and the line of selfishness, what I like to talk about in
my black sense of humor as enlightened selfishness. It is the only way that we get
to achieve this unique identity. There is no other way. This is the lesson to
understand about where we are in our evolutionary process that this is not the
beginning of something. The knowledge that I was given is not beginning
knowledge, it is truly not. It is end knowledge. And the fact that the end isn’t
tomorrow isn't really the point. It is end knowledge.
It’s for the closing out of what has been an extraordinary process. And because this
is an age in which the duality is most intensely expressed, because the nine-centered
being represents this both within itself and the way in which the maia unfolds, that
we’re here to come to grips with the beauty of what we carry as an archetype of
duality. It is us. And we are given within the mechanics the ability to bring this
duality into harmony.
I used to talk about the great lover that one seeks is always within oneself, this
union that finally is consummated between the personality and the design instead of
the resistance that is there in the homogenized life, the denial and the destruction of
what is our inherent potential. We are here to embrace as deeply as we can duality.
This is us. And it's important to be reminded. No other class that I’ve ever taught
has had some of the things that I've mentioned today. And none have seen the G
Center just divided up in this way.
I think it's very important to see the G Center in this way to understand what it's
really doing. There’s nothing else like it in the BodyGraph. It is layering these two
aspects together and fusing them together and out of that comes this incredible us.
Obviously, there are many things to think about in relationship to this. That is, the

specific relationship of each of the crosses, that is, the Cross of the Vessel and the
Cross of the Sphinx, what their unique relationship is to the crystals and particularly
to the cognitive dynamic of the way in which the crystals operate.
To be Correct You Live Your Signature
There is years of material that’s there. How incredible it is in the confusion that
we've inherited from the seven-centered being and from homogenization, how
incredible it is to discover that this is not such a bad place to be, and not such a bad
mechanism to have as your guide on this plane. We are blessed with enormous
possibilities in our correctness that brings, ultimately, at the most mundane level the
most important thing of all. To be correct means you live your signature, that you
find within yourself precisely what it is that brings you that quality of resonance to
life that most human beings can only dream of.
As a Manifestor I know this, I’ve spent so much of my life being not at peace.
Nothing that I've experienced out of my process is more profound for me than the
sense of peace that I have within myself. It is design’s great gift to me, and in that
one sees differently, life is experienced in a way that is different. It's experienced
uniquely, it’s experienced through your perfected prism. This is the only way for us.
We’re not here to be surrendered, we’re not here to give up our identity, and we are
here to establish it absolutely and in that fulfill our process, and fulfill the
evolutionary process as well.
Well, interesting material, but as I said, it’s a good tease, as Cathy would say about
me. Next week is the history of the types. Anyway, to all of you it's been a
pleasure. I hope you enjoyed that, my sharing my morning coffee with you. Do
have a nice weekend; enjoy the entertainment. And until next time, bye for now.

Lesson Ten
The History of the Types
An Evolutionary View
It is, indeed, an interesting subject. Yet at the same time, I have to make a point of
what this actually is, what I'm about to share with you. First of all, I have absolutely
no idea the way in which circuitry operated in anything prior to the nine-centered
being. In other words, I am not a master of the Hindu Brahmin chakra system and
Nadi lines. As far as I can tell there is a vast, vast difference between what emerged
as that particular science and what, in fact, is the mechanics of Design. It is also
clear to me—it's built into Maia Mechanics—that you cannot calculate a nine-centered
being before 1781. It’s clear that they did not exist.
The language that has been developed in order to be able to describe the various
types—Manifestor, Reflector, Generator, Projector—this is relative to constructs as
we see them within the nine-centered being. And we understand them or are able to
grasp them relative to that. My point in this is that I'm talking about the history of
types and I'm going to be going back historically to the beginning of the species and
I wanted to be very clear that I'm not talking about type in the pure mechanical
sense that we understand it within the BodyGraph that we work with, that I'm
basically referring to type as simply a larger framework to try to grasp the way in
which the forms were intended to operate.
I'm not saying specifically that the way they functioned in terms of my relationship
to them as a type or giving them a name of a type, that I cannot possibly know how
they functioned relative to that. I'm just using the over-all quality of what type is in
order to be able to tell this story, because I think in its own way it is an important
one and it's an important one not so much about the past, but about the present.
And that specifically relates to Projector and this is why I felt that my speculation on
all of this might be interesting at this point. I want to reiterate that this is not
something that I was told, I was not given in this context any kind of evolutionary
perspective on type. It is something that strictly has arisen out of my own thoughts,
out of my own process in the knowledge.
The Most Basic Design is Reflector
Okay, so all of that said, let me give you an evolutionary view. Where do I begin—all
right, let's begin, first of all, with the basic binary. This (Reflector and Manifesting
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2007 Jovian Archive Corporation
137
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
Generator) is the basic binary. Let’s think about that for a moment. If we take a
look at the way in which the design of forms, if you take a look, for example, at the
plant, if you look at the design of insects or of fish, reptiles and birds, or the design
of mammals, and I've worked with many and you can also tell that those of you that
have worked with the Dream Rave where we’re working with the mammalian matrix
that people when they are sleeping, because they're in the mammalian matrix, that
the vast majority of them, about 85% of them are Reflectors.
It is one of the things to grasp about the limitation of the matrix. That is, one of the
things that brings about the possibility of the complexities that we call “type” is the
complexity of the basic matrix itself. And that the more possibilities, for example,
activations lead to greater possibilities of definitions. If we’re going back far enough
we’re going back beyond the seven-centered being, even the fifth or the five-
centered being. And by comparison, when I look at any five-centered matrix, you'll
see in a five-centered matrix that the possibilities of definitions are slim. Yes, they
are mathematical, they would exist at certain times, but the fact is that the
fundamental design, or the most basic design in terms of the natural order, is the
Reflector.

138
LESSON TEN
The History of the Types
This is basically what nature is. You look out in your garden or you look out in the
world around you, in the natural world around you, basically the natural world is a
Reflector world. It isn't to say that there aren’t other possibilities, but the vast
majority of the way in which the form principle operates on a grand level is that the
form principle operates through absolute conditioning. In other words, with all of
that openness everything moves very cleanly through the turning of the wheel. All
the forms, everything operating under the same influence, is being moved in the
same way and obviously being driven along in an evolutionary path.
But, at the same time that this is the
fundamental source, in that sense, that is, this is
the beginning of the programming which is that
there's nothing, in the Reflector sense of that
word. There is no defined life force. The life
force is something that comes from the program.
We can never escape the fact that we live in a
biverse, that we are a duality, that we live in a
dualistic reality, or a dualistic maia, however you
want to express that. The fact is that a
singularity is not something that could exist.
There was always going to be, whatever the
limitation was, there was always going to be
some kind of possibility for something else.
The Manifesting Generator
Probably one of the most interesting stories is the story of the Manifesting
Generator. It is clear for me that out of the Manifesting Generator actually came
everything else; everything else—Generators,
Manifestors, and by extension, Projectors. In the
very beginning, this is truly the emergence of the
unique, defined life force. Even if you look at the
seven-centered being you can see basically that even
if the mechanics aren’t true in the same sense,
they’re often just artistic. It appears that everything
is driving upwards. And there is a possibility, that is,
for this connection between what is the Throat and
what is a power center or what is the primary power
center.
We know when we look at the integration system,
which in the teachings of Human Design is
considered to be the bedrock of the framing of us,
that this basic integration is rooted in that 20/34. I
don’t know how many of you participated in the
mystic monologue lecture that I did on the mating
season. One of the aspects of the mating season was that the original mating
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

139
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
season was related to this 20/34. As a matter of fact, related through the 20/34 and
the 37/40.
For me it's clear that the Manifesting Generator, that is, the direct connection
between whatever the fertile power center was called, we'll call it Sacral, that there
was the possibility for a direct life force establishment between the Throat and the
Sacral. And for me this is the very beginning. That is, if I look back and I imagine
what was there and if I go back to the earliest forms, if I go back to, for example,
the Neanderthal, my assumption is that 90% of them, maybe more, were Reflectors.
And there were those, that minority, which would be similar today to the Manifestor
minority in the whole, that 8, 9, 10% would be this pure Manifesting Generator; that
is, the pure connection between the Sacral and the Throat.
The 34th Gate: Gate of Empowering
It establishes many things. We know from integration that the whole business of
integration is to be able to create the capacity within us to be able to survive on this
plane. Everything is about survival on the plane. Not only is it is about survival on
the plane, but the thing that is so incredible about the Sacral Center, particularly the
34th gate, is that it is this extraordinary gate of empowering. That is, it empowers
the archetype. That is, it empowers an intuition that can provide for protection. Not
only that, but it empowers more than that; it brings about out of that the perfection
of the form, and of course, the release of all of that energy into the now to the
Throat.
Now of course, what we get out of this is that we get a very, very powerful force.
We all know that about the nature of the Manifesting Generator. But if you go back
to what I am referring to, which is not what we think of as a Manifesting Generator,
and all the accouterment that comes with it in being a nine-centered being, but go
back to a Manifesting Generator in which it is not a question of unique mind, because
the question of unique mind, that is, mind establishing identity, doesn't emerge until
the seven-centered being. So, if we go back, as an example, to Neanderthal and we
think about the direct relationship between the Throat and the Sacral what we have
is a pure powerful responding mechanism.
The Neanderthal
If we talk about the five-centered Neanderthal, the thing to recognize about it is the
five-centered Neanderthal is right, and the seven-centered Home sapiens, Cro-
Magna man, our ancestors are left, and then we have the nine-centered, that's us
and we’re left and right. This is the transition. By the way, there was a transition in
here (between the 5 and 7 centered), but I don’t want to get into all the detail.
What I want to get to is that because the Neanderthal was right, in other words, they
were not strategic as a creature, not being strategic as a creature meant that they

LESSON TEN
The History of the Types
were in fact simply responding to the demands of life; nothing more nothing less,
like most creatures on this plane; simply responding to it.
Of course, the thing is here that in that context this power that is there between the
Throat Center and the Sacral then becomes a very, very correct, very perfect
expression of power. It simply does. There is no Head, there is no mind getting in
the way, there is no attempt to be able to try to create a mental identity. This is
simply a reasonably intelligent creature probably a little more sophisticated than a
gorilla responding to life and responding to life in two ways.
What’s interesting is that the moment that we have this, that is, the moment that we
have this connection that is there between the Throat and the Sacral that what it is
doing is that it is creating something that is counter to or different from the program.
This is the beginning of the journey to the liberation of, or the emergence of, a truly
individual creature, that individual creature that ultimately is us, in that sense.
Written question: Do you consider the Neanderthal as a direct ancestor or a
parallel form alongside with our ancestors?
Ra: Do I consider it as a direct line? Well, as far as we know scientifically there is no
question that in terms of the family tree we all come along the same tree. Wherever
there is a branching there is a unique genetic collection. But the fact is that the
genetic genome of the Neanderthal, which by the way has been worked on, there is
not a hell of a lot of difference to ours.
We’re all a part of the same family, whether it is a specific straight line, you can’t
really look at it that way. When Neanderthal was in existence in the latter end of its
existence Cro-Magnon began to emerge. My assumption is a mutation out of either
a common ancestor or a mutation out of Neanderthal itself. So for me there's no
way—I've seen every kind of illustration of the family tree.
What's interesting for me in this kind of context is not so much the specific as is the
general. That is, the right-ness of the Neanderthal. And understanding that this
mechanism here is the beginning of the emergence of something that is different,
really different in which the individual spirit or individual character begins to emerge.
This is something that takes a great deal of sophistication, because the fact of the
matter is that unless you spend 10 hours a day in a field with a herd of cows it
becomes difficult to discern their unique personalities.
There are remnants of that, there are the early stages of that, because again within
this modern context the fact is that because we have emerged with unique identities
we impose our unique identities on everything. We try to nourish unique identities,
for example, out of dogs and cats and horses, and so forth and so on,
anthropomorphize them, have conversations with them. It goes on and on; and talk
about how different this one is from the next one, and so forth and so on.

Distinguishing Uniqueness
But when you go way back to this where there is no strategic, where there is only
the receptive, that things are just simply being taken in, then you can begin to see
the nature of the Manifesting Generator and how the Manifesting Generator really
represents the very beginning of the process that we fulfill in our forms now, this
unique difference, a unique life force that stands on its own. And the moment you
have a unique life force that stands on its own you have the ability to distinguish
uniqueness. You can't distinguish uniqueness if you have a group of Reflectors.
They're all going to be moving in the program, uniformly.
It’s why we have herds and school of fish and flocks of birds, the way in which all of
a sudden they're all moving in the same way and take a turn at the same time, all of
that stuff. You cannot do that if you've got some individual in there going, excuse
me, no, I’m going to go over here now.
This is the beginning of the emergence of something different. And as I said, if you
go back to the five-centered being where there is no strategic mind that's very pure
and it begins to build a dynamic of the potential of individual response. And of
course what happens with the rise of these beings (Manifesting Generators) is that
they begin to condition these beings (Reflectors), as we understand conditioning.
And of course, this is again something that begins to have an impact on, in terms of
where we’re going to go in the evolutionary process, the impact of that conditioning
to try to take that majority and begin to break it down into its constituent parts. In
a sense it succeeded. That is, the nine-centered being with its complexity of
circuitry, that only a little over 1% of the population is Reflector, even though we
have a vast Reflector population when we sleep. Again, that is relative to the fact
that we reduce from a 64 to a 16 gate matrix and obviously that's going to lead to a
lot more openness.
The Emergence of the Pure Generator and the Manifestor
But the fact is that the emergence of this connection between the Sacral and the
Throat began to create this expanded differentiation and, in fact, as the evolutionary
progress went; in other words, when it went from five- to seven-centered, a whole
new process began. Just to be simple, leave this as the five. Let’s for now call this
the seven-centered being, the emergence of the seven-centered being and the
emergence of the seven-centered being and mind.
And for me it's at this time in this transition between the five and the seven (next
page), and again it would've gone through a transitionary form, that out of that
emerged two things. That is, the breaking up of the Manifesting Generator into two
constituent parts. That is, the Generator, or what we refer to as the pure Generator,
and of course, the emergence of on the other side the Manifestor.

LESSON TEN
The History of the Types
Now, it isn't to say that the Manifesting Generator disappeared, it did not. But what
I'm saying is that as a mutation in order to see the emergence of both Generator and
Manifestor, the Generator and Manifestor
emerged at the beginning of the seven-
centered process so that there was the
beginning of what in fact was this diversity,
and of course, a diversity that would have
been Manifesting Generator, Generator,
Manifestor and Reflector. So, we would have
had these four variations.
There was a lot of discussion when I
introduced the four types and there was a
period of discussion in which, because of the
size of the Manifesting Generator grouping,
that they were to be seen as a unique type.
But of course they're not; they’re Generator.
And despite the fact that they are the
historical source of both Generators and
Manifestors, which is very interesting in terms
of approaching an understanding to why the
modern Manifesting Generator, because
again, we’ve had three variations. We had
the five-centered Manifesting Generator that was pure and receptive and correct; we
had the seven-centered Manifesting Generator that created the whole frustration
process because the mind became the ruler and tried to establish the identity forcing
the body to do what the mind wanted to do; and of course, in that, all of the
dilemmas that would arise and create homogenization.
The Difficulty for the Manifesting Generator
But the reality is that those three variations, the seven and then finally into our time
of the nine-centered being where, for the Manifesting Generator, they have more
physical problems than pure Generators today; they have more sleep problems than
pure Generators, they meet much more resistance than pure Generators. They carry
a burden of carrying the remnants of this manifesting and that’s why it’s still such a
powerful addiction in the modern Manifesting Generator.
It is clear to me that along with the Reflector, it is the consistency that has been
there in terms of structure right from the beginning, and it's actually in a very
difficult era. Again, when we talk about anything having to do with the nine-
centered being, the answer is always the same, and the fact that you’re “this or that”
doesn't make any difference. The Strategy and Authority applied to Manifesting
Generator is going to bring the same successes it brings to anybody else. It's simply
about getting there, and it is often more difficult for the Manifesting Generator
because not only do they have to deal with their minds, which is the controlling
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

143
RAVE ANATOMY II

agent of the homogenized world, but they have to deal with the ancient impulse that
rides within them to move and take action.
The fact that it was pure once doesn't mean it is pure now. It isn't. But what is
interesting is that with the emergence of the seven-centered being is two things. I
look at the Manifesting Generator—remember that I'm not really talking about
Manifesting Generators, if you know what I mean, not in our context. I’m simply
talking about the Throat to the primary fertile energy source, whatever that would be
in that era, in that frame, in that body, in that biology. What is clear to me is that
this is the instrument of establishing our uniqueness.
The Emergence of the Strategic Mind
If we don't have definition, it is very, very, very difficult to be able to see the
possibility, and when I say definition, I’m not referring to Reflectors, I'm referring to
the vast population of humanity. If we didn't have definition, we would not be able
to have the emergence of what is the potential of our unique consciousness. You
cannot have the emergence of unique consciousness if everybody is simply open and
absorbing conditioning, because ultimately the results are the same. But we ended
up in a problem that beginning to establish the power of the individual life force, the
establishment of this bond of Throat and fertile power source, that all that was fine
except it came with the advent of the seven-centered being, it came with the
emergence of the strategic mind.
Remember that if we go back to the five-centered, we’re receptive, when we move
forward to the seven-centered we are dealing with the strategic. And of course,
everything about the strategic mind is focus. And it is focus in order to be able to
establish primacy. In other words, in order to establish not only survival but the
ability to be able to control the environment so that one can bring forth children, that
you can raise them, that they can be protected, that they can be nourished. In other
words, the whole survival mechanism becomes the focus of the strategic. The
dilemma is that this is not a response that brings about survival capability; this is
about initiating from the mental plane and initiating activity from the mental plane.
What happened with the seven-centered being is that we began to identify with our
minds. We began to identify with a unique mind. It would take until about 85 or
90,000 years ago when we had a mutation of the larynx through the 12th and 11th
gates, it will take until then before we begin to actually expand the size and depth of
that maia. In other words, through our ability to be able to expand our
communicative capacity, our articulation and our ability at the same time to be able
to store concepts that those two things together, that is, being able to give things a
name, being able to store them, being able to express them and share them with
others, this led to the great human revolution; that is, their conquering of the planet.
All of that being strategic; the conquering of the planet and the conquering of the
planet being driven by the mind.

LESSON TEN
The History of the Types
The Dominance of Manifestors
So what we ended up with is the dominance out of that of Manifestors. In the
seven-centered domain, it was Manifestors that rose immediately because they were
designed to act. This is their pure definition; their pure definition is to do. We know
they have to inform in the modern sense, but there are things to do. And of course,
once they were being guided by mind, they were very successful at being able to do
what their mind told them to do, much more successful at doing it than either the old
model or the variation of the old model. And of course, what emerged out of that
was this relationship between the Manifestor and the Generator in which the
Manifestor by being able to do with ease what the Generator couldn't was able to
dominate the Generators.
Identity
My whole thing about calling Generators slaves, they were slaves forever. And of
course, everything changed in that context, because the moment that you had the
emergence of mind as the identity—identity is an interesting thing. If you look at
the five-centered being, the identity was the program, it wasn't the species. They
got their identity from the program. They just hummed along to the program.
When you got to the seven-centered being, identity became something new, mental
identity. “I, I, I, I, I; I am therefore I can; I will; I, I, I.” And so you had this
mental identity that was at work for literally tens of thousands of years and it's out
of this mental identity that the world we inherited in 1781, we inherited this world in
which the identity was all mind and still is.
You look around you and you will see this
is how human beings define their lives;
they define their lives through their minds.
They decide with their minds, they decide
on who they are based on their minds, all
of that is a hangover from the seven-
centered era. Our identity is different.
The nine-centered being is not here to
establish its identity through the program.
It’s not here to establish its identity
through mind. But it's here to establish its
identity through its consciousness and
through its vehicular consciousness, its
true identity. And the reason that I am
circling the G Center as I talk about that is
that it is through the agency of the
magnetic monopole and the relationship of
the monopole to the design and to the
inherent consciousness of the design that
aligns this vehicle to what in fact becomes
their identity.

In other words, their true identity emerges out of the correctness of their vehicle,
not the program, not the mind, but the vehicle's consciousness. And if we would
take a step further, a step that won't happen, by the way, but nonetheless, a step
further, if we can go right down to the next level if it would exist, that is, the full
rave mutation of an eleven-centered being we would see that the identity has once
again returned to its original process, just in a spiral upwards. In other words, the
nature of the rave is, without choice, to surrender. It’s born to surrender its identity
to a larger form.
The Development of Cognition
You're seeing an evolutionary process that is not simply about identity, but is also
about the development of cognition. Intelligence here (5 centered being) was simply
a relationship to the program. The byproduct of the maturation process was simply
part of the natural movement within the program. The greatest learning period that
we’ve ever had was the one dominated by mind. That is, the expansion of the maia
led to an expansion of intelligence. If you're a very primitive person in the world
today living in some corner of the world where it really isn’t touched and you're
basically living the way people lived 4 or 5000 years ago, your grasp of the world is
limited. It’s limited to your specific demand, needs, and the demands of your
environment. We live in an age in which there is this vast amount of information
that is available that is taught to children, and so forth and so on, all of this is the
byproduct of the development of this cognitive intelligence.
But of course, the intelligence here (7 centered being) is the intelligence of mind,
which is very distorting because the moment that mind is applied to decision making,
as we well know, this just leads to distortion. But after all, this is the world we
inherited. When we come to the nine-centered being cognition is something that is
the main theme. Everything about being a nine-centered being is to understand that
we are designed for unique identity, unique individual cognition, a unique expression.
That's different from mental cognition. Mental cognition is always communal and
shared, if you know what I mean.
In other words, people talk about the fact there's a lot of ideas floating around, but
that's not really true. It’s basically finite and repetitive. It’s like books that you've
read; once you've read a hundred novels you discover right away that there are only
styles that can be better or worse, but the stories? How many times can you retell
the same story? And of course, this is the whole thing about mind and the way in
which mind conditions. So, what we consider intelligence is the kind of thing where
everybody has to grasp it and everybody is trained to grasp it and they all end up
holding onto the same concept.
It’s our homogenized world. It's our homogenized world of concepts, moralities in
which the vast majority of the population just nod their heads like those funny little
dolls, they just sort of keep nodding their heads and saying yes, yes, yes and they
don't know. The nine-centered being is about the possibility of the unique

The History of the Types
expression of identity. It’s the end of the movie, because there is no more unique
expression of identity after this. This is what we are and we are a transitional form.
We’re the transition between the seven and the eleven. And we are under enormous
pressure to develop our cognition, because we are the transitional form; we are the
true mutative form.
The Projector
Okay, to get back to my traveling story. So, we emerge into the seven-centered
being, into the realm of mind, and at the same time we have this opening up of
these other variations. Again, remember that this mutation isn't so surprising. It
isn't so surprising in the sense that the moment you expand the matrix, the moment
that you go from five centers to seven centers, and again depending on the way the
connections work between the various centers in the seven-centered being—again,
these are not things that I know, but logic dictates that you're going to have many,
many more possibilities within that matrix. The more possibilities you have the more
unique potentials for life force to be demonstrated.
And of course, this movement here
out of this, my assumption is that this
was one track once, just one track.
And if you had the whole thing you
had it. It was just one track. Where
as, the moment that you open up into
this there are very many new
variations that open up. And so out
of this come subgroups. And of
course, those subgroups again take
on their own life. They are a distinct
life force.
The most interesting for me is that we get to 1781 and out of the Manifestor comes
the Projector, and all of you Projectors out there, you’re welcome; just a joke.
Anyway, it's interesting for me to think about Projector in this context. That is, I was
told that this was an incredibly important era, this Projector era, the era that we’re
in, that the Manifestor at the end of the seven-centered cycle was basically done.
And that their power was no longer a power that served the totality. It's clear to me
that the emergence of the Projector is a refinement, a deep refinement on this
movement towards the coordination of identity and its movement towards surrender.
Preparation for the Rave Future
For me, the Projector stands between the human condition and the rave condition.
And not only do they stand between it, but they’re leading us towards it. That’s best
understood, for example, in the business work that I do in Human Design in which
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

147
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
we work with pentas and the way pentas can be managed. By far, the most natural
managers of pentas are Projectors. And in a sense, it is the Projector that is
beginning to prepare human beings for their rave future. That is, in a sense getting
them ready to be able to work in group consciousness. And despite the fact that
Projectors are in the world to do—we have a homogenized world so they go along
doing what everybody else is doing.
The thing is, though, the Projectors are here to be working on organizing humans
into groups and working with those groups and being able to develop intelligence out
of those groupings. This is what they’re really designed for. Whether they're doing
that socially or whether they're doing that as a profession, whatever the case may
be, one of the things to really grasp about the Projector is that it’s moving us
towards the penta. It is a master, in that sense, given its gifts of recognition to be
able to prepare us in that way for a future.
And yet at the same time, they are under the pressure, they are a new form, or a
new variation on the forms, it is very difficult for them to be able to assert their
authority. It's only now and we’re a couple hundred years into this process in 1781,
it's only now that you're beginning to see the rise of Projectors into all kinds of very
interesting positions of power. There is this beginning of the Projector to find its
way, but most Projectors are living with the deep bitterness of not being recognized.
And again to understand that not being recognized, this group over here is sort of
like—they’ve been around for a long time. They look at the Projector as a new kid
on the block and they don't really have a
lot of respect for it. It’s just interesting
to think about it.
And when you look at this group in here,
this is energy. These are very powerful
energy types. And then you get that
movement out and then you get the
Projector. You get this non-energy type,
you’re going to have a totally different
relationship to the rest of the planet, and
at the same time having an inherent gift,
an inherent direction in having to work
with those forces, particularly and
obviously working with the Sacral forces.
But they’re new. This is something that
has just emerged.
And what's interesting for me about that
is that I look at that and I think it's
probably an indication that post-2027
that rave children are likely going to
have a very, very, very high percentage of Projectors for parents. I don’t mean the
children themselves; I mean the most viable rave pentas are going to be rooted in
Generator power. But my assumption is that for every penta that will emerge
there's going to be at least a Projector in there. And it’s also clear to me that

LESSON TEN
The History of the Types
Projectors, particularly the Projector parents are ones that can—again these are my
speculations, but my assumption is that rave children are going to come out of
Projector parents more often than they’d come out of anybody else.
The Different Types of Projectors
Again, this is because of the whole flow of this evolutionary movement, because
that's what it is, it’s just a movement. The other thing is that we don't get past nine.
So it's difficult to speculate on eleven, but my assumption would be that out of that
would emerge different kinds of subgroups that would emerge out of the Projector.
I've made this comment many times and it was one of my responses to people years
ago who wanted to stress that Manifesting Generators should really be a separate
type on their own and my counter to that was have you really looked at Projectors.
There are so many different kinds of Projectors. It seems so obvious to me that if
we were going to go to the eleven, and again as I was told, we don't get there, the
round ends before we get there, that my assumption would be that it is out of
Projector that would come subgroups that would be different, and actually function
as different types. It’s clear to me, anyway, that's relatively true about the
Projectors that I know. For example, the difference between a mental Projector and
an energy Projector is enormous. They’re very, very different. If you just take them
in at a frequency level, they are incredibly different.
The other thing is that the mental Projector is really unusual. The mental Projector
harkens back all the way to the Reflector because there is no inner authority. There
are only mechanisms that they can use. It is very different from anything else we
know. The Projector has many, many subgroups to it. And of course, my
assumption is that they are the kernels of what will be possible different forking of
the paths if there was an evolutionary continuity of this bioform. But it does suggest
to me that within the rave context that certain aspects of Projector, that is, different
qualities of Projector, are going to be very important to different kinds of processes
in relationship to the rave and the conscious penta, whatever the case may be.
Projectors and Recognition
So, we have a very interesting movement in all of this. If this is where we’re at now,
then it's important to be able to see our world in this context. In other words, what
is there in the Projector that is an essential ingredient to establish the true identity?
And of course, it's inherent in what we describe of Projectors. That is, they bring
recognition. They bring forces of recognition into the matrix. This is their greatest
gift, after all. And because they are not oriented within themselves, that is, they
don't ride on their Sacral—Sacral beings have to by their very nature be pulled in on
themselves—that they are looking outward. And it is this looking outward and this
ability to recognize that brings a special quality.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
The fact that Projector exists is inherent in the fact that there is a Human Design
system. And what I mean by that is that here is recognition. This is the way it
works. At the same time, we have this force come into the world to be able to
recognize and to be able to guide others to recognition, we have this system that
provides the mechanics in order to make that possible. And of course, this is the
ultimate thing. It doesn't matter in our modern context. Any one of these
variations, whatever you happen to be, the fact is that the only way in which this is
going to be viable for you is that if you operate correctly according to the relative
Strategy and Authority of that vehicle. That's what's going to make the difference.
It is, after all, the individual lives that make a difference.
But what is fascinating for me is to see this movement of identity out of the
program, out of the mind and then finally to establish one's true identity. And out of
that true identity you get the clarity, the intelligence, the awareness, all the
language, you get those things that you need in order to be able to operate in a way
you were intended to operate. We've come a long way. This is a long process. And
as you’re moving through this depth of a process, to realize that what was created in
the time of the seven-centered being is the greatest burden that we carry now. And
the Projector is saying to us that we need to see that.
After all, their inherent gift is to be able to grasp systems, to be able to see things
for what they are, to be able to recognize. And all of this is about the potential that
is there for us. It's much less connected, the Projector, in that sense, to their own
process. They’re rave like, in a way. I don’t want to overstress that. But, Projectors
are not interested in themselves. They're not interested in that identity of theirs.
They’re interested in that identity of the other. That’s not a far step to go to the
rave that says I'm not interested in identity because I’ve already given it up to the
other; in that case the conscious penta.
It's a movement. The wheel is turning and the mechanism is moving. It's
fascinating to see, at least for me; after all as I said, it's my speculation on the way
in which all of this has emerged. It’s clear to me that in seeing it this way, I also
understand that time is running out. That is, time is running out for unique identity.
The Projector amongst us is already ringing the bell and letting us know that the era
of unique identity is coming to an end. And they’re here both to be what helps move
us forward and at the same time, help us to be able to recognize our identity. That’s
what they’re good at, to be able to recognize that identity in the other and to be able
to help that being. This is part and parcel of it.
The Projector Has a Lot to Learn
Yet, the dilemma for the Projector is that because the Projector is new on this plane
as a form type, they have a lot to learn. Having a lot to learn is a big story. It's a
very big story. This is the whole pressure now that is on Projectors that if they're
not prepared, if they don't have the knowledge that is necessary for them, that they
get steamrolled. They get rolled over by the energy forces that they've emerged out
of. It’s sort of a nice bookend with the Reflector up there and the Projector down
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

150
LESSON TEN
The History of the Types
there, it really is. It’s this full movement, and in this full movement getting ready to
complete this process. So the better that Projectors are equipped to be able to
articulate what they see in the other, what they see in a system, the system, any
system is enormously important for the completion of this process.
Manifestors aren't interested, Generators are looking in on themselves, and if they're
not-self, they don't see anything. So, there's a tremendous amount of pressure on
the Projector as a force to guide beings. When I say that, I don’t mean that
personally. It’s an energy that’s in the world. It is a conditioning force in the world.
So, the presence of Projector has already changed the way in which we look at
things. That is, if you take a look at the way in which intellectually we've developed
since 1781 that we’ve gone in two directions deeper and deeper and deeper inward
and deeper outward. This is the result of the Projector. The emergence of the
Projector is also the emergence of the scientific revolution. It is the emergence of
the modern world, not personal, if you want to pat yourself on the back you can.
Strategy and Authority
The fact of the matter is that the Projector in relationship to its own identity, the fact
is that the Projector only learns about itself by learning about others. And slowly but
surely, it gets to see in others elements of itself. This is the transition that takes
place. And of course, like anybody in Human Design, at the mundane level of
Human Design, it’s still only Strategy and Authority. This is a nice intellectual
journey about the possibilities of what may have been the evolutionary track, but it’s
not going to make a difference in your daily life. It isn’t going to help Projectors to
know that either that they are a new form or that they’re a special form, because on
a day-to-day basis they happen to be a form that is deeply conditioned and is very
far away from itself. And in the practicals of the world it still goes back to what is
my basic story over and over and over again, one person at a time, one experiment
at a time. There is no other way.
And it's only when you can go through that process and that is what is correct for
you that there is an element of transition or effect that can take place in the world
around you. Each type has its way. When the Manifestor is correct they have a
different kind of impact on people. When a Generator is correct their enveloping
aura is deeply nurturing to others. When a Projector is correct they make the
perfect guide. This is what we are looking for. And obviously, when we get to a
point where there's enough beings, at least at any given moment that are correct,
we have a transition, we have a transformation in the most important aspect that is
there for us, that is, the establishment of our unique identity.
Unique Holistic Identity
When I say that, I’m not talking about G Centers. I'm talking about our unique
holistic identity, that holistic identity that is rooted in your variable, in your type, in
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
your profile, in the nuances of your design, and all the things that lead to what is in
fact your differentiation. At the end of this line, at the end of this evolutionary path
of these particular kinds of forms, this is what we're here to do now. We’re here to
establish our holistic identity, a holistic identity that operates through a pure, correct
frequency.
And out of that correct frequency, the ability to tap into our cognitive depth and to
be able to express our unique cognitive intelligence to get it out, to express our
outer authority purely and to be correct in the world, to be correct in a way that we
haven't been since way, way back when this was all so natural. We’re recovering
from the seven-centered journey that led to such disarray and homogenization. And
by the way, it’s not their fault. It was the way it had to go. So, we have to see that
now it's time to settle down and to see things for what they are, to see them clearly,
to recognize them.
The Pressure on Projectors
Well, I don’t know what you think of all of that, but anyway, that was interesting to
get that off my chest. I've been wondering about that for quite a while. I’m deeply
convinced that the Projector is something that is just brand new. In a way it's really
changed my empathy for them. I had a very different kind of empathy for Projectors
before. The burden of having to master things over a long period of time before
there can be any real benefit for them. And I see that what they're doing is that
there's all this pressure on them to catch up. There’s this enormous pressure on
them to catch up, to get all that information, to get it in quickly, to figure it all out,
and to get a hold of it.
I think that's something that needs to be nurtured. I think it needs to be
understood, particularly Projector children, I think they need a tremendous amount
of stimulation, legitimate stimulation, and stimulation that really hones their
possibilities. And of course again, hey, it all goes back to how you live your life and
how you were raised. It goes back to parents, whether they raised their children
correctly, regardless of what type they are in order for each and every one of them
to be able to fulfill themselves.
Anyway, I thank all of you for participating in that. That was fun. Until next time, all
of you take care; bye for now.

Lesson Eleven
Advanced Imaging
The New Synthesis of Substructure and Surface
Just about everybody who meets Human Design meets Human Design on the
surface, because this is the only place where you can meet Human Design. The
graphic presentation for anyone entering into Human Design is a presentation in
which the BodyGraph, on either side of the BodyGraph there is a string of data
rooted to the planets, and the gates and lines of the planets are presented. It’s been
that way since I was given the knowledge, this basic construct. And despite the fact
that over the last 10 years particularly the depth of the knowledge, what is there
beneath the line and all of the investigation that has gone on, the teaching that has
gone on, that the graphic
presentation remained the
same even though the
programming was upgraded
to be able to give certain
students access to emerging
layers that were being
revealed as we moved
along.
For me there are two kinds
of Human Design profes–
sionals. The majority of
Human Design professionals
are the ones who are
professionals who deal with
the surface. The surface,
obviously, is the great entry
point. It is the only way to
enter. And it is through the surface that one first meets one's design and the nature
of one's type and inner authority, the dilemmas of one's not-self and so forth and so
on. It is this surface that is the bedrock of the expansion of the knowledge, the
delivery of this information to others. And yet at the same time, the professional
that operates on the surface is doing a specific task; that is, the task of being able to
help somebody to escape from homogenization and conditioning. This is what the
surface is about and this is where the surface is so important.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
And yet, that was and remained in so many ways the focused approach of a Human
Design for most of its history now. Over the last five years in particular, I began a
very intense process of laying out not simply the full foundation, that is, the
complete substructure, but getting to the point that three years ago to be able to
introduce the three-year programs for Rave Psychology and Primary Health System.
In their own way they are very, very deep explorations into the basic binary that we
are constructed out of, that is, the binary of design and personality and the way in
which that operates.
It is through the level of education that is there in those programs that it was
possible finally for me to be able to realize a number of goals, I guess I could say, in
terms of the evolution of the knowledge and the evolution of the knowledge as a
service to others. Once you have broken through on the surface, there is an
enormous journey in living out your design. It is often a very lonely journey. And it
has been for most of its history a journey in which there was very, very limited
support.
The MMAI
This ability to be able to care for, to enrich and enhance the process of somebody
that is experimenting with their Strategy and Authority, that this is the tool, that is,
Maia Mechanics Advanced Imaging, this is the tool that allows professionals who are
trained to the extent of PHS and Rave Psychology to be able to have the deepest
possible insight and the most efficient and effective tools to be able to guide
somebody in their process and to be able to guide them to a point in which they get
to live out that process.
This is not simply a graphic redesign, because it is not. It is mathematically set up
very, very specifically. So, I don't
want you to have this sense that it's
simply a way of adding more
information. Obviously, there is much
more information that is available at a
glance here, but there is also
information that the average analyst
in Human Design has no
understanding of whatsoever. There
are elements in here that are barely
understood by the best educated
students. This is an enormously
sophisticated database, and one that
will take many, many years to
master. My own teaching program
over the next years in terms of the work that I will do at the most advanced level will
be ongoing work in exploring the complexity of what is present in Advanced Imaging.

LESSON ELEVEN
Advanced Imaging
To give you a sense of it, I've laid out a little graph here so that you can sort of have
a flavor of the many different things that are being looked at that are being taken
into consideration. And again, to recognize that this is a tool that rather than looking
at somebody on the surface, this is radar, this is an x-ray, this is going deep, deep,
deep, deep, deep within their construct. And every single one of these elements
carries with them a collection of analytical data.
The Sun and the Earth
So, if we begin at the very beginning, what is familiar to most, as an example, are
the Sun and the Earth. Now, of course,
we’re used to seeing them on top of each
other in the traditional chart. Here you
can see that they are laid out beside each
other and you'll also notice that there is a
very, very specific reverse symmetry
here. You'll notice that the Earths, the
south nodes, in other words, where the
Earth is closest here to the BodyGraph,
the Sun is furthest away. In other
words, they’re opposite each other in the
way in which they work, or at least there
is a mirror effect in the way in which
they’re laid out, a way in the most
obvious sense of establishing their true juxtaposition.
So, we have the symbols of the Sun and the Earth. Now of course, there are things
that are obviously familiar. That is, that underneath you can see that the hexagram
gate and its line are given at the bottom of the solar boxes, as an example, so here
is the solar box and you can see that
this is the Sun that is in the 34th gate,
so we have a Sun here that’s down
here in the 34th gate, and of course, we
know that the 34/20 is always an
opposition so we’ve got the Earth up
here in the 20th gate, and they are
both in the 3rd lines and you can see
that.
But of course there is much more
information that is here. At the very
best, most people introduced to Human
Design never really meet a line right
away. An overview is not line oriented
until you get a really full reading, and even then there are only going to be certain
lines that are going to be focused on that are going to be incorporated into whatever
the analysis is. On the surface the line is pretty much as far as you go. The surface
Rave Anatomy II is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

155
RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
is about very basic things—type, definition, authority—this is what the surface is
about. And the activating elements don't have the same kind of requirement when
you're opening up the surface for somebody than when you go deeper and deeper
into their process.
The Chain
Obviously, somebody who has entered into the experiment that they are ready to go
deeper and deeper and particularly in terms of PHS dietary regimen, PHS external,
the transformation of passenger consciousness in the way in which the mind is going
to operate, all of this requires a great deal of detail. The fact is that one of the most
important areas of study that has been taking place in the IHDS is the study of the
chain. There's some interesting basic material, for example, in Channel 88, there
are a couple of different kinds of introductions to
what color is about, as an example, introduction to
basic understanding about what the chain is.
This really represents the deepest level of our
mechanical programming. That is, the movement of
the neutrino through the crystal and out of that we
get our base, tone and color chain that leads to the
surface ultimately, leads to the line. When we're
looking at these elements, each of these elements
has a profound significance. And of course, once one is able to deconstruct it, that
is, once one goes through the educational process and begins to gather information
about each of the elements, each element becomes a building block to a deeper and
more profound understanding of the person.
The Tonal Level
So as an example, if we begin with the tonal level. When we're looking at tone, we
are looking at the inner architecture and that inner architecture is about cognition.
In other words, everything about the nature of being, everything about the nature of
being alive is that we are designed to be
cognitive. In other words, we are designed to
display intelligence. What we get to see tonally
is we get to see that intelligence broken down
into what are in fact the sensory qualities, both
physical qualities and personality qualities that
take advantage of our ability to take in
information.
So here when we're looking at the tone, we're
looking at something very significant. In this particular example, we happen to be
looking at the design side. And of course, in looking at the design side and looking

at the Sun/Earth we’re actually looking at the design of the brain system of the
vehicle. And this particular tone will then become the most heightened sense of that
particular brain system of that particular vehicle. And that cognitive ability is going
to be expressed or communicated by a color.
Color/Determination
In the case of PHS color is about something that is called determination. Every
human being is born with the potential to
differentiate and that the only way that we
can truly differentiate is by being determined
in the way in which we are nurtured and in
the way in which we live our lives. And
anyone who enters into Strategy and
Authority and enters into that experience
begins to gain the benefits of cognition
leading to determination leading to
correctness in the way in which the inner
vehicle, the brain system and everything that it manages, the way in which it
functions and can function successfully.
Base Orientation
There is also the deep sufficient sophistication of the base itself. In other words, you
can see that there is this box. You can also see that the box has a particular
coloring. In this case, the coloring is in the upper right-hand corner and this has to
do with something
that is called base
orientation. It’s
actually very, very
deep knowledge and
in the simplest sense
represents at the
individual level, in a
way, what we are
attracted to or connected to, and the way in which we both take in and deliver from
a specific position. Each and every one of us is designed to have a unique
orientation.
So, in this combination of the database that is aligned here, that at first glance, if
you have the background, you have much more than the fact that you've got
somebody who happens to be a 20/34 3rd line, what you have is the depth of what
lies beneath all of that, that gets expressed through that 24.3 and beyond, gets
expressed through what is the nature of the vehicle. So we have the chain from the
base to the tone to the color to the line to the gate. And we have the complete

movement of the layers of information that are the bedrock of what finally is
expression.
The Arrows/Variable
The final element that is laid out is an arrow.
And perhaps of everything that exists in Maia
Mechanics Advanced Imaging, this is perhaps
the most extraordinary of all. It’s called
variable. Variable is a combination of the
way in which the internal, that is, the
Sun/Earth, the external, the south and north
nodes on both sides, the way in which we
are affected by cognition.
Cognition moves us to either the left or the
right. These arrows represent left-ness or
right-ness in the context of the internals and
externals.
These four combinations of right-ness and left-ness are something that is called
variable, and if you lay out all the
variables, there are 16 of them, in laying
out all those variables you actually lay out
the infrastructure or the plan of what
would be the true order of the bioforms on
this planet in relationship to the
consciousness field.
It is actually a very, very profound area of
study. As a matter of fact, this semester I
just completed the first investigations of
variable. It is startling in terms of its
beauty and its potential as knowledge.
But then there is more, much more.
The Link Nodes
The second thing to come to grips with are the nodes themselves. In dealing with
the nodes themselves we’re dealing with something here at this level that is
extraordinary. It is something that's called link nodes. The link nodes represent a
potential within the nodes to align to each other through the magnetic monopole.
And basically it is the nodes that through the monopole hold us together in the
illusion of our separateness. And the relationship between these nodes on the
design side to the personality side is one of the most fascinating areas of study.

Advanced Imaging
Let alone that the information here to begin
with is extraordinary, because it actually
allows us to understand specifically on the
design side, as an example, what is the
correct environment for us, an environment
that is nurturing for us, that is healthy for
us, that opens up the possibility to our
correct encounters with others and at the
same time on the personality side honing
us in on the perspective that's absolutely
essential if our passenger consciousness is
going to be correct in its outer authority.
The Lunar and Planetary Square
So we’re dealing with very, very profound elements
at deep, deep levels in Advanced Imaging. And in
many ways, because it is so complex, the most
mysterious, the most wondrous in a way, is the lunar
and planetary square. First of all, you can see in the
lunar and planetary square that gate data is given
with line and color. One of the things about planets
is that they resonate to color. And these squares
themselves, because it is a magic square and
because the positioning of the planets is not
arbitrary, and again, you can see that there is a
mirrored symmetry in the way it operates, you can
see that there is a difference in the construct on
either side, though it appears that
they're the same, they are not.
And that the magic square operates
both vertically, in other words, there is a
general value to each vertical column
with individual values in between,
there’s a general value to each
horizontal row with unique values in
between and there are diagonal values
that are there as well. In other words,
the magic square is something that is
deeply, deeply complex. And it adds
enormous depth; depth at this point
that isn’t even practically integrated into
the knowledge base yet. There is so much information that is laid out in Advanced
Imaging. This is bringing the entire substructure to the surface. And this is what
you get to see.

RAVE ANATOMY II
A Digital Book for Students
So, those students who enter into the
Rave Psychology or the Primary Health
System programs, their task ultimately
in their process is to master this tool,
to be able to take advantage of the
layers and layers and layers of
extraordinary information here and to
be able to transform that into an outer
authority for those who have entered
into their experiment and can benefit
from the knowledge that is locked in
the mystery of the these layouts.
The Surface is the First Step
Each step that you take in Human Design, basically there are these basic steps that
are there to be taken in the process of transformation. It all begins on the surface,
we know that. But only the first step is on the surface. Everything else is a journey
much deeper. The first step aligns you to the great truth of this knowledge that
mechanically we can be correct very simply. All we have to do is honor our inner
authority, follow the strategy and that we will move through and out of the
conditioned process into what is our own unique emergence. This is what Strategy
and Authority brings. It brings us an alignment, an alignment that emerges into its
correctness as deconditioning takes place.
But we know from the study of for example PHS is that we know that so much of
that process can be enhanced and can be enhanced at an early stage in the
development if the being is really there and truly involved in the process. The fact is
that PHS dietary regimen is a revolution for the vehicle. That is, it’s not about
bringing the vehicle correctness in the obvious sense, that's what Strategy and
Authority does, but it's about bringing the vehicle its correctness in terms of what its
actual physical potential is. In other words, the correct nutrition and the elimination
of negative nutrition, this in fact enhances the brain system and enhances the way in
which the sensory apparatus operates and ultimately benefits to transforming the
vehicle into an Uranian model that is healthy and is ready to live out the full Uranian
life.
Beyond PHS is the development of an understanding that each and every one of us is
designed to have an environment that is correct for us. And that the correctness of
that environment, the quality of the environment, the nature of that environment is
something that is revealed in this knowledge and something that can be brought to
the experiment, or at the right time to help them complete this physical alignment of
their vehicle, correct decision making, correct nutrition, correct environment all of
which leads to the possibility of the transformation of the personality.

Advanced Imaging
The Mind is Limited by Your Body
Remember that your mind is limited by your body. You must never forget this. This
is the greatest of truths. If you do not take care of the vehicle, if the vehicle is not
correct, the mind can never be correct. It can't. It’s dependent on the vehicle. It is
dependent on the brain system. It is dependent on the acuity that is there or not in
the hardware. So much about the knowledge in Human Design is about the
refinement of the hardware, how to transform these deeply conditioned dysfunctional
vehicles into ones that are healthy both on the outside and on the inside. Strategy
and Authority, dietary regimen, environmental awareness are things that lead to the
establishment of the potential of the passenger.
The work of the passenger is very complex. And where the database on the design
side is as deep, the need to be able to explore all of it with somebody who is
experimenting is not necessary. But on the personality side, every single aspect of
the database can be of value in liberating the passenger. And it is a journey of
educating the passenger. Once the mind is freed from decision making, it needs to
be trained. If it isn’t trained then that mind is always going to want to resort to its
old habits.
And even though you're there desperately holding onto your Strategy and Authority
you're very uncomfortable because your mind is going to make you afraid, this is
how the mind gets you to follow the not-self, and it fills you with fear. It is
important that the mind gets trained, gets trained on how to operate as outer
authority, how to operate as passenger, how to operate as the observer, the
watcher, how to operate outside of the mundane connection. This takes education
and not the surface. You all know that. You all met Design on the surface. The
surface can immediately touch the vehicle. It doesn't necessarily immediately
transform the mind, it doesn't, that in and of itself is a much longer process. This is
a process of training.
In my conclusion to all of this, as a basic guide to those of you that may never
actually work with this I think it’s very important that you know that it exists. It is
something that is a treasure that is held amongst a small group of people right now.
And for all of us, including myself, it’s very, very special to have this tool.
But it's also very important for the community to understand that there is an
analytical tool in Human Design that is extraordinary in its potential to be of service,
and that it brings a depth that is really remarkable. And all of that is for the benefit
of those who have entered into this process. It is there to give you the support that
you need and to be able to make sure that everybody who enters into the
experiment of Strategy and Authority has the best possible opportunity to fulfill their
purpose in that. This is the tool that will be the bedrock of how we provide that
service to the community. So, it is extremely exciting and I’m just glad to have a
chance to give you a sense of what is.
