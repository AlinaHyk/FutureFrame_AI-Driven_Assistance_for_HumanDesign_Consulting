The IHDS PHS Certification Program Year 1: PHS Analyst
The Primary Health System (PHS) is a revolutionary approach to well being. PHS was
first introduced by Ra Uru Hu in April 2003. As empowering as Human Design is for
the Personality Passenger, PHS is the awakening key for the Design Vehicle.
PHS is the result of years of ground laying work in the sub-structure of the Line. PHS
is based on Design COLOR. The Primary Health System Analyst is trained in Internal
Color Fixing, the key to Personal Health Strategies.
The PHS Analyst program is open to any student who has completed the ABC and
Rave Cartography Levels I and II. The IHDS is the official Human Design and Global
Incarnation Index certifying and licensing authority. The IHDS offers programs
leading to official certification in both teaching and practice.
The PHS Analyst is such a credit program. To complete this program for certification,
students are required to complete the entire program of three semesters. This book
is a transcript of the first semester originally taught in the Fall of 2005.

Lesson One
The Nature of Duality
Welcome
Before I go anywhere, I really want to let you
know how much I appreciate your being involved
in this program. It’s very important for the
development of the knowledge of Human Design.
The more people that are involved in these
programs, the better the foundation is laid for the
future. Going through this PHS program over this
three year period is something that I am only
going to do once. I hope by doing so that we lay a
very important foundation in terms of being able to
really be of value to others in a practical and
effective way.
It’s deeply clear to me that we need to understand
the vehicle within the context of Human Design. Only when we truly understand the
vehicle within the context of Human Design are we going to be able to find those
things that are going to be the most productive and the most effective in being able
to help people in terms of their vehicle. It’s a long road. So, I just want to welcome
you and I want to get this process started.
Beginning with the Illusion
Where we’re really going to begin, we have to begin with the illusion and everything
about the illusion. It’s interesting that so much of my work in Human Design is
selling the mechanics of the maya. What is it that we do in Human Design? For me
this knowledge is the science of differentiation. This is what it is. And the
differentiation is all on the surface, and the science is all underneath. It’s not like
when I say Human Design is the science of differentiation that that literally is what
you are. In the sense that it’s a science of differentiation, so there you are doing a
reading and that’s what you’re doing. Actually, it isn’t. The science is something
else.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The differentiation is a highly, highly synthesized quantum illusion that we present to
people because that’s what we are. That is, we are a very sophisticated quantum
illusion. We’re in the illusion business when we’re working on the surface. That
isn’t to say that it doesn’t provide essential truths. We well know that it does. We
know that when we’re looking at somebody’s bodygraph that we’re not looking at
duality at all. In fact, what
we’re looking at when we
look at the bodygraph is we
look at this illusion, this
quantum illusion that is
created by the power of the
Magnetic Monopole to pull
the phenomena of Design
and Personality together
into this complexity that we
live out in the illusion. But
it’s still the illusion. The
surface really is a chimera.
That’s why so much of my
work over the years has
been about simple formulas
for people, because when
you live on the surface, and
we all live on the surface,
we all live in this illusion of
that bodygraph. We all live in an illusion of differentiation that obviously, if you don’t
have a way of making decisions correctly, then you cannot display the correctness of
your differentiation. Therein lies the dilemma in the illusion plane. So what we do in
Design is that we offer people mechanics so that they can be properly equipped in
the illusion. But my goal in PHS, as it is in Rave Psychology, is to get to the science
underneath the illusion. In other words, get to the science before we get to the
quantum. Think about it.
Inanimate Objects
This coming Sunday I do one of my Sunday lectures and it’s going to be on the
Inanimate and Magic. It’s one of those extraordinary things that one can look at and
perhaps understand the power and the seduction of what the maya is. If you take
an inanimate object, an inanimate object operates out of one center, the G Center,
and it operates out of one gate, the 25th gate. It has a potential, in that sense, to
meet the 51, but it’s still just one gate, and as one gate, not only is it inanimate, but
it’s only endowed with a design crystal. There is no Personality to the inanimate;
there is no Personality to a grain of dust.

LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
The Single Cell
When we go across to the next stage, we get to the single cell. The single cell is the
first example that we have of form that is defined. In a defining of that single cell
form, what we get is a life force. It’s so interesting for me in Design in the work of
presenting the surface how attracted people are to gates and how little they know
about channels, even people that are well-seasoned in the knowledge. You ask them
about a channel and they’ll immediately tell you about the gates. But the gates
aren’t the channel; and the channel isn’t the gates. It’s a life force; it’s something
else.
When you meet that inanimate object through definition, you bring a life force to it,
you just do. But the life force is not the same as the inanimate object. Nor is it the
same as the being or the conditions that bring that definition. It is this illusion that
emerges in the quantum. Everything that everyone has ever been taught about
Human Design with the few exceptions of my Global Incarnation courses that I’ve
done over the last few years in Ibiza, everybody has been taught to analyze the
maya. And of course, that was the job. It is the mechanics of the maya, that is
what the surface work is all about.
The Potential for Science
But there’s something that we have to be able to deal with if we’re going to be
practical. If we’re going to say to somebody that we can understand the nature of
their vehicle and what is correct for their vehicle, then you have to see that we’re
stepping away, in that sense, from the maya. And in stepping away from the maya,
we enter into what is the potential for science. I want you to grasp something.
We’re going to enter into a realm that you can no longer see with the same eyes that
you’ve seen the surface of Design, because again, everything on that surface is the
illusion. It arises out of the fundamental duality.
Juxtaposition Theory
When you look at juxtaposition theory and you look at the basis of juxtaposition
theory, you see that everything about it is about the yin and the yang being
juxtaposed to each other. This term “juxtaposition” literally means “placing things
beside each other”—jux-ta-posed. And when you place them beside each other
nothing changes except what is the interactive field between them. It’s like looking
at the bases and you see that the four bases make a box and the fifth base is the
illusion out of all of them.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Maya is All about the Illusion
It’s all about the maya, and the maya is all about the illusion. But it’s not about the
components themselves, and that’s what’s so fascinating to me. It’s the illusion
that’s taken 18 years; it’s taken me an entire nodal cycle to present the mechanics
of the illusion, but not the science underneath it, because in order to get to that
science you have to get to the components. You have to be able to look at the basic
component and separate it from the illusion.
The Importance of Components
It is not an accident that we have no conscious access to color. It’s not an accident.
It just isn’t. What is below the line is below the line. We are intended to operate
blindly, in a sense, in the illusion. That’s what we’re intended to do. Beneath the
line are just components. And yet, how important those components are. And
whether that component is the design crystal and the way in which the vehicle truly
is designed to operate, the vehicle separate from the Personality, the way it was
before the incarnation in its purest state with its Magnetic Monopole imbedded, this
model of vehicle without the illusion that the Personality will bring. After all, our
vehicles, in a normal pregnancy, go through two-thirds of that pregnancy without the
burden of carrying this disturbed, psychotic passenger.
So, when we step beneath the line and we step into the component, we’re stepping
into something different. Let me give you a sense of what this actually means. Let’s
say that we discover something extraordinary about the vehicle that allows us to be
able to provide real help to that vehicle. But remember, you’re applying that only to
a component and you have no idea how that component is going to change the way
the quantum is. We don’t. You see, we’re in a place where we’ve never been
before. We’re actually exploring the way in which the program operates the life
game. We’re dealing with it, for me, at the profoundest level in PHS.
I am a form master. I am here to serve the yin. Everything about the knowledge,
as given to me, is so incredibly clear that this is all about form. Yes, I understand
the dilemmas of the passenger, blah, blah, blah and all of that. Yes, I know. But I
also know the joke. It doesn’t really matter how well the passenger does in this
journey. It doesn’t. It’s not the way the game is played; nobody is keeping score.
It’s just a process; it’s about the magnificence of this vehicle and the way in which
the vehicle is constructed.
Duality
Let’s go back to our basic duality because today is the last day in what will be 99
weeks together, that’s quite a journey, this will be the last day that I’m going to talk

LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
to you about duality. And we need to look at it for a moment, and remember it and
keep it in the back of our minds as we probe deeper and deeper into the nature of
the vehicle, that we understand what we’re looking at. That we don’t get misled into
thinking that we’re seeing the whole.
PHS is about the knowledge in relationship to the vehicle and our capacity to be able
to provide a service to the vehicle. So the duality in the beginning was the so-called
big bang, I really like that. It’s obvious to me that everything about the nature of
the totality is that it is a binary. That’s why I call it the biverse, it seems so obvious.
Everything that we understand about the way in which we filter consciousness,
because, of course, when I say it’s obvious that it’s a binary, it’s obvious to us
because this is the way our form is constructed. Can you really grasp that and how
important it is to grasp that?
We are deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply limited. And you can add a hundred
zeros after that number of deeply limiteds that I repeated over and over again. We
are so limited. And the most extraordinary limitation of all is the way in which we
take in the frequency of existence. We’re limited. We’re limited in the quality and
the nature of our vision. We are limited in the wavelengths that we can actually
interpret. We don’t see neutrinos programming us. We would see nothing if we
actually could see them. We’re deeply, deeply limited.
When I was being educated, the concepts in physics were the most startling for me.
They were so startling that I didn’t know whether one was supposed to giggle at
these things or not. I can remember a physics teacher of mine saying to me, “Do
you realize that you never sit on your chair?” And I thought, “Yeah, well.” But we
don’t. Not only do we never sit on anything, stand on anything, we never touch
anything. We’re flying at incredible speeds in space.
We have millions and millions and millions and
millions and millions and millions of functions
taking place within our vehicle, in any
nanosecond, that we’re not aware of. We are so
unbelievably dumb, ignorant, blind, deeply limited
and it’s something we need to grasp. The
moment that we begin to look into things with the
illusion of our depth, we need to keep it in
context.
We Operate through a Binary
We see a binary because that’s the way in which
the life force is conditioned to operate. We are
designed to operate through a binary. So,
everything about existence is a binary. If a
scientist finds a zorbal, two days later another
scientist finds the anti-zorbal because you can’t

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
have a zorbal without an anti-zorbal. You can’t have a neutrino without an anti-
neutrino. You can’t; because this is our illusion. You can’t have a black hole without
a shining star. You can’t; it’s our illusion. The up and down, the in and out, the he
and she, this and that, on and on and over and over in everything, in the way in
which everything works it’s all a basic binary. This is the game.
It’s beautiful in a way. You see, when you look at things outside of the illusion you
realize that they can only be what they are, and how perfect it is. The yang will
always be yang. And the yin will always be yin. It’s only when they come into
juxtaposition with each other that something else happens. It’s that something else
that grows, that changes, that morphs, that mutates. It’s an illusion, because
underneath that illusion, at any time in any place in the whole history of existence,
underneath are these rock solid, differentiated components.
Life is Controlled by the Yin
What we have in the beginning, on one side says Design, there is a Design Crystal
and there is a Personality Crystal. They are prime, in that sense. They are
unshattered. And in that unshattered, or lack of shattered, is something fascinating
to ponder. Life is controlled by the yin. And it’s very easy to understand how that
works because when you look at this illustration, and you’re looking at the left-hand
side, when you look at this illustration what do you see? There is this Monopole
imbedded. And the whole thing to understand about the yin is that the yin comes
with the power to control the illusion.

LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
One of my favorite—for me it’s delicious, but then again, I do have a black sense of
humor—well, I’ll leave that for a second. Everything about the form principle,
because this is what we need to understand, is that the Monopole is what makes the
illusion work. People are always talking about love. Love. I know that there is only
one thing out of which all of love is initiated. It is initiated in the lack of love. And
that lack of love in the moment that we incarnate into this illusion in order to make
the illusion work, the Monopole has to disengage from the Design Crystal.
Now, I can’t anthropomorphize these things because it’s not the way it operates in
its reality. But if I could, I would describe the Design Crystal and the Magnetic
Monopole as lovers. As lovers that are lovers in a way that is so profound that we
truly do not understand it; deep, deep, deep lovers. And they have to do something.
What they have to do is that they have to give up their love. They have to give up
their love for a lifetime, and they can only get it back when that lifetime is over.
That’s what our lives are to our Design Crystal and our Monopole. Our lives are an
interregnum that interferes with their perfect love. Think about that.
The Magnetic Monopole
Every Magnetic Monopole that sits in the sternum, that sits in the G Center,
establishes your illusion. It establishes your aura, your mask, your type, all of it. It’s
the Magnetic Monopole that controls the timing of the sperm, which sperm will enter
into the ovum. It’s the Monopole that calls the Personality Crystal out of its orbit
from its bundle down into the life. It’s all a Monopole game illusion. And yet, the
Monopole does not serve the Personality. The Monopole is one with the form
principle because it’s all about form.
It’s like talking about the mutation that’s going to come in 2027. What are we
actually talking about? We’re not talking about a transformation in consciousness
because that’s going to be a by-product of the physical mutation. It’s like the
difference between a Neanderthal brain and a Homo Sapien brain. I’m sure
Neanderthals did as best they could with what they had. And we do as best we can
with what we have. And Rave children will do the best they can with what they will
have, which is a transformed vehicle.
The Form Principle
It’s the form principle. Everything about it is the form principle. When you get to
the surface of Human Design you can see that this is all we’re telling people. We’re
saying, “Look, here’s where your inner authority is. It’s your body.” Your inner
authority is your body. Inner authority is below the throat. It’s a body thing; it’s
your form that will tell you the truth. It’s the form that has to make the decisions.
It’s the form that will liberate you. It’s all form.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
We’ve had thousands of years of people juicing up the Personality, thousands of
years. The whole patriarchy, god is male, all this stuff—pumping, pumping,
pumping, pumping, pumping. It’s the form principle. It’s not about the Personality.
It’s not. Personality has its own problems stuck in the back seat, helpless and
incompetent. Why do you think that human beings have such funny, funny minds
and lives? Helpless and incompetent.
The Personality has no way of being able to impact the form. They are components
beneath the surface. The Personality struggles with the maya and it’s helplessness
within the maya, because the maya is ruled by the form principle. But you see,
without duality there’s no game. There just isn’t. We could have a very interesting
kind of existence, I guess, if we kept on reproducing ourselves, cloning outwards.
It’s not what it’s about. The life force is about the dynamic of juxtaposition. It’s a
dynamic.
Wherever you see anything about life—boom—you’ll see this dynamic of
juxtaposition. What is mating after all, bonding after all, all of these things? You
juxtapose these forces and you create an illusion. Joe meets Mary and suddenly
they’re an illusion, they’re a couple. Give me a break. We all know that when you
get down to the component, the component doesn’t think it’s a couple. It doesn’t
understand its relationship.
The Illusion of the Juxtaposition
Everything about life, everything about the life that we live in is all based on this
illusion that is generated, and it literally is generated as an illusion that is generated
out of the juxtaposing of these dualities, wherever they are. We’re looking in PHS
beneath that to the singularity. And that is less—if you add up the knowledge of the
Design Crystal and the knowledge of the Personality Crystal and you add those two
together they’re not the same as what happens in the illusion of the juxtaposition.
The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.
It’s why in my discussions leading up to PHS I have talked about how we will have to
go through a clinical phase; at least an investigation and experimentation. Because
what we will see, and what we will understand about the nature of the vehicle and
what we can do directly for the vehicle; we still cannot predict until we see it, what
actually happens when it juxtaposes and becomes an aspect in which the whole is
greater than the sum of the parts; becomes an aspect of whatever this juxtaposed
quantum maya illusionary form is going to be. Because everything out here,
everything that we are looking at, we are looking at the world of illusion.
The Separateness between the Design and Personality
I love this drawing; I hope you all see the illustration. When I had my experience
with the Voice, this is basically what I drew. The only thing I didn’t draw by hand in

LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
the actual time of being taught were the chops of the hexagrams around the wheels.
When I did the first readings and when I first began to teach Human Design, this was
the layout. That is, the bodygraph, and on one side you’d have the left side, the red
side, you’d have the Design. Basically what you would see in that is it looks similar
to the way in which you would see an astrological chart, except it wasn’t, the wheel
itself isn’t turned. The other thing was that it did not show aspects in the same way.
But it did show the placement of the earth and its direct polarity to the sun.
But it was very important to see the Design as it was given to me this way.
Because, for me, when I look at this illustration, I see the three aspects that create
what we call life. That is, on the left we have the Design Crystal and we have this
ability to transform neutrino information into essential form information. And on the
right-hand side, the black side, we have the Personality. And obviously the
Personality Crystal filtering the neutrino field and filtering the neutrino field as a
differentiated consciousness.
But they’re so separate there. You can really see they’re not together. We know
they’re not together. It’s funny because I can really tell how settled, in a way, this
knowledge is in the world now because in the first years the most common question
among students I had was “Why 88 degrees?” which I loved to answer because I
could always say I don’t know because it was just what I was told.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But the thing that is so extraordinary about the Human Design bodygraph is that
these are two calculations. They’re really different from each other. Oh yeah, they
have what we would call generational things in common—outer planets—but they’re
really different from each other. One of the things that the computer age brought
for us and trying to simplify Design and trying to get away from Design being
confused with its components, that the graph was changed so that we just had the
bodygraph as it is today with the numbers and symbols on either side. But, in fact,
it takes away a magical understanding of the Magnetic Monopole.
If you had the Design Crystal on the left and the Personality Crystal on the right, the
Magnetic Monopole is sitting there in the middle. And it is its work, this mono-pole
that only attracts, it is this work that pulls together in the illusion of our
separateness, it pulls together these two things. They’re not alike. Many times I’ve
talked about the real sacred marriage, boy it’s inside. It’s when the passenger can
finally accept its helplessness and its incompetence and let the vehicle have its life,
because in the illusion it’s all controlled by the Monopole. There’s no escape until
death. And then you’re out; then it’s ok.
Journey to Master the Form Principle
But the reality is that when you’re looking at the bodygraph you’re looking at
Monopole land. This is illusion land. This is the quantum field. Let this, as I said, I
will not talk duality again; let it settle in very deep. It’s very important for us to be
able to differentiate between what is the illusion on the surface and how one deals
with it, how one analyzes it, and what it means to go into the science of
understanding its component. We’re on a journey to master the form principle. For
me, intellectually, that’s the most exciting journey of all. It’s to really understand
how this whole mechanism works. And in finding out how it works, in exploring how
it works, the enormous opportunities to understand what can be done to help people
in their vehicles.
There is an enormous lack of well-being in the world. Physical well-being. I can
remember many years ago in California I did a number of things with doctors. They
would say to me, “Well, the open centers, obviously this is the place where you take
in the conditioning, so this is where the physical problems are going to be.” I looked
at them and said, “Well, yes, that would be really nice.” They were always surprised
by my reaction. And I’d say, “Yes, that would be really nice if everybody was living
correctly, then obviously any open center would remain a vulnerability.” But the fact
of the matter is that because of the nature of the not-self and its pervasiveness in
human life, human beings don’t operate correctly.
The Vehicle’s Vulnerability
I’ve seen more people with the 20/34 have thyroid disease than people with
undefined throats have thyroid disease. Here you have beings who put enormous
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

10
LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
pressure on their thyroid system and don’t operate correctly, and of course, they do
tremendous damage. The vehicles of humanity, these vehicles, they are fragile,
after all. They’re extraordinarily fragile. It’s not like we have some kind of
protective armor, we really don’t. We are a naked ape. There is great vulnerability
in our vehicles. And obviously, if you’re not operating correctly, if you’re not making
the decisions that are correct for you, there are going to be consequences to that.
We will look in depth at the way in which the bodygraph expresses in the illusion
illness.
Here again, and it’s my reason for beginning with duality is to recognize something,
that in order for the Personality consciousness to grasp that there is truly something
wrong with its vehicle, it takes a long time, and it’s usually too late. It’s like all of
these people who suddenly decide to go to a doctor after many, many years only to
discover that they have something that they should have gone to the doctor about.
It’s just one of those things. It takes a very long time because we don’t translate it
directly. If the vehicle is not operating properly and it’s building up deterioration,
wherever that deterioration happens to be, it’s not like the passenger is tuned into it.
The passenger is absorbed with trying to control its life, and neither one of them
operate purely within the quantum that’s controlled by the Monopole within the
illusion. You may end up on the surface with a Personality that’s not aware of its
vehicle, not aware of its body. You can have somebody that has definition that is
only conscious and has no unconscious definition and has a poor sense of their
vehicle on the surface. And the vehicle is screaming there’s something wrong,
something wrong and the Personality doesn’t get it.
Our job is to be able to see it in the vehicle long before it becomes a risk to the
Personality. But again, to really understand that wherever we go beneath the line
we need to recognize that the moment that we see something, we are seeing an
aspect before it becomes part of the quantum. The only way ultimately, that the
work that we’re going to do in PHS is really going to be of value is when on the
surface beings are at least operating experimentally correctly. Because this is going
to truly provide the opportunities for us to be able to fulfill our role, to be able to
provide for the well-being of the vehicle.
It is clear to me, and for
those of you that
participated in April in the
last of the build-up to this
PHS program, that there are
extraordinary therapeutic
possibilities in what will be
our work. And yet, I really
caution you. For me this is
about science. It’s not about
jumping to conclusions. I
look forward to the
possibility of moving slowly,
which for me is quite
something, moving slowly

11
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
through this process to make sure that we truly understand what the consequences
of anything we will do with the vehicle can be. This is why our whole work in PHS
will begin with really grasping the dynamic of how the vehicle operates, which means
the real mastering of the nature of the chains in order for us to be able to begin to
read the physical dynamic.
When I pull back to this picture, and this picture truly is one of those things—
tomorrow you get to download these illustrations—it’s one of those pictures where
it’s great to put it somewhere that you see it every once in awhile. That it reminds
you of what this illusion is all about. But also, for those of us with our goal of being
practitioners of this knowledge, that we see very clearly our limitation within the way
in which duality works. We are penetrating the quantum. We are going into the
component itself. And we have to understand that anything that we change within
the component, we don’t know precisely, we cannot know other than through
experimentation, what it will mean when it interacts with the whole quantum
process.
So, for us this is a very, very interesting challenge. And at the same time, it gives
us the correct humility. For me, to even be able to see at this level is a privilege that
I address every day in my life. I’m deeply grateful that I understand the nature of
the maya. It has not changed my life in the sense of we all have our geometries.
And being in a vehicle in the quantum is what it is. But there is this serenity, and it
is a serenity that comes with the aesthetics; it’s so beautiful, this mechanism. It’s so
intricate and logical and perfect. It is just utter magic. And to have the privilege to
see it, to really see it, to see these mechanisms in their detail, this is an enormous
gift.
So, having this gift and having this time, because we have the time, there opens up
the possibilities that we can end up with something that is deeply of service. But we
have to keep our humility. And remember this duality, and remember the Monopole.
Ah, the magic. I’m really cute. I’m sitting here and I’m pointing my finger at the
screen, it’s very funny. But it really is—I’ve been very lucky. I’ve watched a lot of
the elements of Human Design get the substantiation that they need. And I wait for
the Monopole to have its day. There is nothing more extraordinary.
Monopole Disengagement
We will look at it because we’re going to look at this whole process of Monopole
disengagement and what that means for the vehicle and what kind of shock that is.
And this is something that takes place very early after conception. The Monopole,
this illusion, how dense it is. My real concern is that it’s obvious to me that the
vehicle is in mutation. The fact that the vehicle is in mutation is creating distortions
in the quantum field, what I talk about in terms of the rise of prostate cancer or
autism. One of the things that is very important for me is that we really begin to
understand where the mutation is taking the vehicle. One of the things that I am
clear about in the process that we’re going through here in PHS is that we will finally
have an opportunity to really focus on the Solar Plexus Center. Focus on the Solar
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

12
LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
Plexus Center not the surface, but on the dynamics that are impinging on the Solar
Plexus Center now.
The Duality of the Wheel
Ah, the duality game; I actually like it. I think that that’s one of the things that
really helps being able to penetrate it, is that I find the maya rather delicious. It’s
such an interesting construct. It’s one of the things about the nature of the wheel,
something that is always very clear to me about the nature of the wheel. It’s
interesting because when it comes to the wheel I’ve taught quarters, and obviously
I’ve gone through all the gates and all the crosses and all the profiles, but I never
taught halves. And of course, that’s what the wheel is. The wheel is a clear duality
and you can see that duality in the chops. That is, if you go from the 2nd gate to the
44th gate you’ve always got a bottom line yin. If you go from the 1st gate to the 24th
gate you’ve always got a bottom line yang. Here you have the wheel divided into its
two.
Everything about the whole business of looking at the surface is realizing that
wherever you look, you’re looking at the various dualities. They create the
necessary tension; the polarities that are there in your sun/earth; the polarity that is
there in the nodes that you have—how magical it is. The wheel, for me, is I think
one of the real joys that I had as a teacher in my early years, because I did so many
introductory teachings, was to describe to people how magical the wheel was. Some
of you know those early trainings of mine. One of the things that I always talked
about in conjunction to understanding the wheel was that I always began with my
description of the G Center. And of course, these two crosses, they’re quite unusual
because they’ve got all four of their arms in the G Center. That is, the Vessel of
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

13
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Love, and the Cross of the Sphinx. Talking about how those eight gates divide the
wheel into eight equal parts.
The G Center and the Monopole
Within the context that we’ve been talking about tonight when you think about the G
Center always think about the same thing. Think about the Monopole, our
descriptions of the G Center, that the Monopole holds you together in your illusion of
separateness and gives you your direction. Everything about those two crosses, the
Vessel of Love, this is the function of the Monopole. The Monopole is always trying to
pull back the Design Crystal. It’s always trying to get its love back. And in a sense,
it’s sort of like those dogs chasing the eternal flying rabbit at these game parks.
Until the ticket runs out the Monopole is always chasing after the Design, in a sense,
and it doesn’t get it.
This duality is so deep. The dilemma I had when the names of the channels became
known, I kept on telling people, look, you can express them the other way—the
channel of succeeding where other people fail, or the channel of failing where other
people succeed. The channel of a social being or the channel of an anti-social being;
the channel of perfected form, the channel of the totally messed up, absolutely
ridiculous form; the channel of talent, the channel of the talent less; the talent of
structuring, the talent of de-structuring. It goes on and on and on.
Everything is a Duality
Until you really understand this, it’s just all duality. Look at the lines. It’s all a
duality game wherever you look. It’s why it’s so difficult to really be able to help
anyone in a therapeutic sense. I got a lot of flack in the early years because my
standing joke was, “Do you see what therapist spells?” And of course, it spells “the
rapist,” which isn’t a very nice thing. It made a lot of therapists very uncomfortable,
I’m sorry for that. But nonetheless, it really is a delicious kind of language trick.
The reality was that for me it was clear. And most of my concern about that was
people in white hats doing black work. That is, you’re a wonderful person with a
great heart and a great training, and you want to help children and you happen to be
emotional, and you’re getting all these unemotional children and you’re just messing
them up even more. There was all of that.
But there was another level of that for me, and a deeper level. That therapy is
something that you cannot apply on the surface. This is why we’re here. It is clear
to me, and obviously there would be all kinds of beings out there who would
disagree, because they make their living in the illusion plane providing those
therapies on the surface. But you see, the surface is an illusion, it’s a quantum. It’s
not really getting to something. It certainly is not getting to its source. It’s already
moved up the whole chain from underneath until it finally blossoms on the surface.
And then on that surface, which is the surface as it appears in the illusion, it’s not

14
LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
the parts. You’re not fixing anything when you’re fixing the illusion. You’re not.
Again, that’s why the message of Human Design over and over and over again is just
listen to your body. At least you’re trying to align the form.
But there is duality everywhere. The magic of the wheel—you look at your sun/earth,
look at their hexagrams. Ah, it’s so beautiful; they’re mirrors. They’re just mirrors.
They’re this incredible duality. Perfect. Thirty-two perfect mirrors all around that
wheel. And this is what’s keeping everything humming. Look at the bodygraph.
The bodygraph is nothing but opportunities for quantum—gates pointed at each
other. And the gates in and of themselves? Dead. I mean, they are.
We have nice words in Design, we say dormant; they’re dormant. They’re dead.
They have to come alive. They only come alive—why do you think it’s so attractive
to meet the polarity, to meet the opposite, to be attracted by the opposite, to get
what you don’t have? Because we’re set up that way. It’s the game. When I say
“game” it’s my '60’s showing. It’s a '60’s expression. And I don’t really mean
“game” in the sense that anybody is really playing at it. It’s just the way in which
the rules of life are structured. Everything about illusion is built on the duality. And
if you break down that duality, if you eliminate that duality, you get dead gates. You
get a lack of life; nothing’s going to happen. Nothing.
One Cannot Help Others from the Surface
But it’s obvious to me that if you’re going to be able to truly help someone, help
someone whose body is diseased, help someone whose body is deteriorating rapidly,
if you’re going to be able to do that, you cannot do it from the surface. You can’t.
You have to go directly to the source. You have to go beneath the illusion. Beneath
the illusion, that because the symptom appears to be over here, that the source is
over there too. It’s not. And the assumption is that if you can see the symptom in
the illusion that you know the source in the illusion. “Well, it’s a heart problem.”
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s not true. It’s obvious to me that it’s not true.
Duality is such a trap; it’s so seductive, it’s so perfect. I mean it’s so perfect. The
program is a binary, it’s perfect. They never let anybody really see underneath. If
you think about the development of human civilizations and articulated intellectual
civilizations, maybe the last couple thousand of years or so, it’s only in the last
hundred years really, that we’ve been able to look underneath the illusion,
exoterically, as well as esoterically. You see that in science today, where what
percolates up to the top in the illusion is now being looked at deep, deep, deep
down, is somewhere locked in on the chromosome somewhere. We are penetrating
deeper and deeper.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Work of PHS
This is our work. But we do have an extraordinary advantage. Everything about
existence is seeing, it’s just seeing. If you see with a certain perspective and that
perspective is in tune to what you’re looking at, there lies the gifts of serendipity.
You get to see things that are extraordinary. We have a very different way of
looking at genetics. We have a very different way of looking at the vehicle than the
way in which the exoteric world does. In the same way that Human Design on the
surface is so different from psychology on the surface, in the way in which it looks at
a being and a being’s potential, and a way in which it can provide a being on the
surface with a way in which to operate correctly.
But operating correctly isn’t going to stop a body that’s diseased from being
diseased. It isn’t. More than that, these vehicles are bio-masses ultimately; they’re
chemistries. They’re chemistries operating in different times in different
environmental conditions. Our ability to go down deep, deep and deep in a sense
that it is our equivalent to penetrating down to the genetic core, to be able to see
from the base up—and we’re going to find it going down, by the way—from the base
up to be able to see all the possible chain configurations that lead to specific body
types.
Obviously, when you’re dealing with five Bases and then you’re dealing with the six
Tones, and you’re dealing with the six Colors that obviously there are a lot of chains.
Many of you have taken my various chain introductory courses. This is something
that is essential for us as our primary work. That is, the first thing that we need to
be able to do is that we need to be able to define all the vehicle types. Again, we’re
not talking about type as it appears in the illusion on the surface. We’re not talking
about Generators and Projectors. We are talking about various physical, vehicle
types as components. These design components are different from each other.
They’re all these different kinds of vehicles. And there is an underlying theme. In
other words, there is a finite number of vehicles that exist. Once that is established
and once we have looked at each of those finite vehicles, we have the bedrock upon
which we can begin to see where dilemmas arise. It’s all about getting away from
the duality; getting away from the illusion on the surface.
Personality Crystal and Motivation
In this illustration, we’ve suddenly dropped down for a moment and we’ve gone
below the line. We’ve gone below the line on the Personality side. It’s totally the
Personality. Everything about this illustration is about understanding that when you
step into this, if you look at any keynote, remember something, you can never apply
it to the quantum, you can only apply it to the component. In other words, this
information here is something that only applies to the Personality Crystal. It’s the
way the crystal is motivated.

By the way, I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but it is a nice exciting edition. The front
page of Jovian where you have the bodygraph that displays the activations of the
moment, underneath the data for that bodygraph on the left-hand side of the body-
graph, we’ve now entered in the Color of that particular moment. It takes the Sun
approximately 24 hours to go through a line. You’ve got six Colors. So,
approximately every four hours the Sun is moving through a different Color. On the
front page of Jovian now you have a Color guide that lets you know what the Color
is.
This applies to the way in which the Personality takes things in. Just as a sidebar for
a moment, because it really is something to consider, think about what that actually
means for you. Let’s say that you’re somebody who has a 1st color Personality
sun/earth, it means that for four hours every day, whether you’re awake or not,
there is resonance for you. In other words, the imprint from the transiting
Sun/Earth is going to be imprinting you with the correct motivation. But one of the
things that we’re going to be dealing with, so much in our work is that we’re going to
be dealing with the theme of Color transference. Of course, Color is always
transferring. Color is never fixed. It’s always transferring.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Every time, on the surface, when one aligns oneself, one aligns oneself temporarily
to one’s correct motivation. But the moment that one encounters any next
experience, there is always first the pull to the transference. So, for example, there
are four hours in any given day that is going to bring you your harmony. That is, if
you’ve got a 1st Color the harmony is the 4th Color which is need. So, instead of
being motivated by fear, and remember that fear is about finding security, so it’s the
bedrock of what it is as a motivation; whether that security is personal security,
whether it’s material, whether it’s intellectual, whether it’s about, just in that sense,
fear driving one to be secure, that instead of being motivated through fear, the
Personality is being drawn to be motivated through need. The moment that one is
being motivated by need, one is not going to operate correctly.
So, in any given day one is looking at a spectrum in which there are possibilities that
are very positive, and possibilities that pull one to one’s transference. All of that is
only impacting on the way in which the Personality Crystal operates. You still don’t
get to see it in the quantum. In other words, until you get to somebody who is
awake and their passenger is just watching, only then is the passenger really going
to be able to participate in a clear way, with understanding the way in which its
motivational forces are moving.
Importance of Transference Reading for Projectors
By the way, this is enormously important knowledge. It’s why I offer transference
readings, and particularly if you’re a non-energy type, particularly for Projectors.
Basically what it does is that for a non-energy type, it gives you a signpost that you
can have that is as effective as aligning you, as what strategy is for energy types. In
other words, a non-energy type doesn’t get to use their strategy frequently, so it’s
difficult for them to see clearly that they are operating correctly. For any non-energy
type to understand their underlying Personality motivation, in other words, what’s
correct for them as a motivation, it is important that they can begin to see those
experiences and those people around them that pull them away from what is their
correct motivation.
So, let’s say a projector that has a 1st Color Personality, they’re going to find there
are people in their lives that make them feel needy, that bring that neediness out in
them. Those are the people that draw them into being novices, or draw them into
being masters. And of course, that neediness is not correct for them, which means
those people in that circumstance are not correct for them. This is a way for them to
know, because in that encounter with those other forces, there may not be the kind
of situation that opens up the potential for decision-making. But at the same time,
there can be this deep perception, the understanding that these beings, they’re
pulling me away and moving me to another motivation.
So, being able to understand that when we’re talking about Color, and we’re talking
about, for example, here Personality Color, to really grasp this as a tool, to be able
to benefit from it as a tool, you have to have a passenger that is already
surrendering responsibilities. As long as the mind, which is the tool of the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

18
LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
passenger, as long as the mind is controlling one’s destiny, as long as the mind is
making decisions, there is no way to really see the signposts and to really be correct
in one’s process.
The Color Illustration
When we shift over to the Color, we shift into a different realm; it’s a totally different
realm. And the values are totally different. I’ve left behind, because this was just
an original illustration that I used in April, I just left it in there for reference, that is
the Personality attributes—leader/follower/desire—just to see the differentiation and
also to understand that this is a great, deep binary to grasp; the binary between
appetite and fear. The moment that you begin to think of what is the result of the
juxtaposition with appetite and fear, or the juxtaposition of taste and hope, thirst
and desire, need and touch, sound and guilt, light and innocence, there is a
fundamental tension between these aspects. A deep one that only gets pulled
together when it comes to the surface; it gets pulled together by the Magnetic
Monopole that brings it out through the expression in the line.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But how different the vehicle is—this term, it’s a personal mystery for me, this term
Color, it’s just what I was told so I call it “Color.” I laugh. I describe myself as a
good dog; I do what I was told. And yet, the way in which color is used in the
common sense in all languages, it does and it doesn’t have anything to do with this.
I make a great effort not to use color to illustrate the six Colors because I was never
given a color that went with the Colors, if you know what I mean. I was given no
shade of this or that, or this clip of frequency, or this or that. But it’s obvious to me
that for the Voice, Color means something totally different than what a human being
understands it to be. I mean truly.
The Difference between Personality and Vehicle Motivation and Nodes
I’ve tried to give an expression, or a description of it. I try to talk about how it
shades things, colors things in that sense of the word. However, it doesn’t really get
there. And how different motivation to the Personality is from what motivation is to
the vehicle. There is something very interesting about the difference between the
Personality and the vehicle. The Personality is incredibly seduced by difference.
That is, it is the filter of the consciousness field, and the trick of the consciousness
field is to trap us in the illusion of duality. So it’s really into difference.
Bodies aren’t into difference. They’re into sameness. It’s like the nodes that you
have. We’re going to take a look at this because it really is fascinating, the
difference between Design nodes and Personality nodes. Your Personality node is a
perspective. That is, it’s a limitation on the way in which you can see the world
around you, and what you see in the world around you.
But when you look at your node on your Design side, this is what they want to
harmonize with. The vehicle naturally avoids resistance. This is one of the first
things that I understand about the fundamental nature of the Design Crystal. The
fundamental nature of the Design Crystal is that it is here to guide us away from
friction, away from resistance, so that we do not deteriorate. Its goal is not to
deteriorate.
The whole thing about the Personality is that it’s always into interference. It’s very
different. The vehicle, the form wants to find its correctness within the whole form
principle. It wants to fit in. If you ask a monkey what is the difference between
what you look like and what I look like, they’ll say they all look the same. It’s true.
It’s the way we’re conditioned to see these particular nuances. Human beings can
see thousands of movements in somebody’s face that gives them all kinds of
information. We’re designed to see these nuances that differentiate us facially. But
to the average dog, if it weren’t for our differentiated smell, they would have a hard
time telling one of us from the other. We look a lot alike; it’s the form principle at
work. It’s form. You can see that in the fact that basically your genetic code and my
genetic code are just—we have the same form. We do.
So, when we’re dealing with the form, we’re dealing with something different. Again,
what that takes from us intellectually, because this is tricky intellectual ground, we
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

20
LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
are taking our limitations with us as we explore here. It’s a conundrum. I’m so
aware of it. I’m so aware of how ironic all of that is. It’s almost a catch-22. It’s
dangerous, in that sense. But, at the same time there is nothing else that we can do
but approach it this way because that is our limitation. But you have to see the
Design outside of thinking about your body.
The Vehicle Wants a Harmonious Life
Think about it as a crystal for awhile. Try to think about it within its crystal context.
That the crystal is very, very much like other crystals. It really is. And however we
want to describe the programming of these crystals, these crystals are programmed
to create as best they can a non-resistant life. After all, the sophistication of your
Design Crystal is what determines in many ways the longevity of the specie. Now
I’m not talking about the relative sense of the different life expectancies that we may
have. I’m just talking about general life expectancy for the specie. In other words,
the Design Crystal that you and I have is going to be very different from the Design
Crystal of mammals. It’s going to be very different than the Design Crystal of single
cells that may have a second of life, or whatever the case may be.
In other words, one of the things about the nature of the Design Crystal is that it is
trying to create within its limitation a harmonious relationship with its physical
environment. Of course, it’s like all these discussions that we have with seeing the
advanced effects of a great tool-making specie like humans—the degradation to the
earth, the depletion of resources, pollution, all of these various things. And to see
some of the reflex actions of people who want to return to nature, want to return to
harmony, but more than that, you see that in the idealization or romanticism of
cultures that are one with their natural environment. This is a very deep theme
within the vehicle. The vehicle needs very much to be at home in its environment.
One of the jokes for us in this is again to go back to the mastery that the Magnetic
Monopole has over our destiny. It’s a Monopole game, it just is. That Monopole
sitting in that G Center, that place where if you have an undefined G Center you’re
always looking for the right place. That’s where love is going to be, that’s where the
right people are going to be, that’s where everything is going to happen. This is the
mystery all wrapped up of the Monopole. It is about place. It is about whether
you’re going to be in the right place and how do you get to the right place. You get
to the right place if you’re operating correctly in the illusion on the surface that the
Monopole controls. The moment that the vehicle is already in the right place is the
beginning of a process in which healing can take place.
Healing and Place
I’m convinced that the worst thing about healing is that healing takes place so much
in places that are places where people die. There are places for things. I think we
will get to a point where we will see that the moment that we institutionalize healing
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
21
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
and we create institutionalized hospitals and all these things, that we are being
suckered into the Cross of Planning game that’s dying. It’s not about that. It’s
about a new kind of generation of shaman. This is something very different. And I
don’t say shaman in the context of it being esoteric or exotic, because I don’t see
PHS as esoteric or exotic. I see it as realistic, practical science.
But to understand the delivery system, it is about place. It is about harmony of the
vehicle. One of the main things that will be a bedrock of what it is to be a PHS
Practitioner is that the PHS Practitioner serves the client in their environment. I
know that this is going to bring out many discussions. But it is something that is
very clear to me. And that the only exception to not serving the client in their
environment, is serving the client in another environment that is of the client’s
choice.
Place, and we’ll talk about the technique of making sure that the client knows that
it’s the right place and so forth and so on, we will see very clearly that physically
being in the right place and being healed in an environment that is harmonious and
being healed in an environment where one’s form is secure is very, very important.
It all goes back to understanding the pressure on what is the Design Crystal and
what is the form principle.
We have an enormous dilemma because in the illusion we have a dysfunctional
Personality that’s trying to direct the form. Not only is it trying to direct the form,
but under conditioning it is getting the form to be involved in things, because
remember the Design Crystal doesn’t directly impact the Personality. It’s all taking
place through the illusion of the Monopole in the body chart. So you end up with
somebody that consistently puts the wrong things into its vehicle, in the wrong
place, all the time. Well, yes, sooner or later we know what kind of dysfunction is
going to come from that.
Healing is in the Quantum
We have many things to consider. In order to be able to heal somebody’s form, on
the surface they have to play the game. Because if they don’t play the game, that
is, if they don’t experiment with operating correctly, it’s going to very difficult.
Because so much of what is primary healing is healing that has to take place in a
binary with the client. And you’ll notice the binary. Because you see, the healing is
not direct, it’s in the quantum.
Oh, the mysteries of it all. I really do love it. But think about it. Think about what it
means. You have somebody and they’re distressed. And you have knowledge. You
have knowledge that can alleviate whatever it is that is distressing them. But the
fact that you have the knowledge and the fact that they’re distressed doesn’t mean
that healing is guaranteed and we all know that. It has to do with the quantum. The
healing doesn’t take place anywhere else. It takes place in the quantum. And it
takes place in the quantum in the program, after all. Oh, there are some
extraordinary things that I can share with you, and one of them that is so
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
22
LESSON ONE: The Nature of Duality
extraordinary is the 32 healing days. The 32 healing days, the polarity of the
Sun/Earth and what each of those 32 different healing days represent for the
different vehicle types that we are going to explore through the chains. It’s a good
thing we have 99 weeks, or 98 now, in front of us, because it is really going to be a
very profound journey.
Once we have the knowledge, once we’ve been able to disengage from the duality
and go into and examine the component in its depth, we have to come back up and
enter back into the illusion. It’s this wonderful Jovian logo of this old woodcut and
this guy with his head through the sky. It’s great to look through the sky; you put
your head through, you see the gears, you get the whole movie, but so what?
If you’re going to be productive, if you’re going to be useful, you have to bring it
back into the illusion. So not only do we have to journey out of duality into the
component, but we also have to recognize what it means to bring what we will learn
back up to the surface. And the way in which we can integrate this knowledge on
the surface so that we can truly be of benefit to people, well, that’s quite a journey.
So, let us not forget the duality that we live in.

Lesson Two
The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
Now, I don’t want you to think that you’re in the wrong course because it’s not
Thursday and it’s not Rave Cosmology. But if we’re going to talk about the vehicle
and we’re going to talk about the nature of the Design Crystal, we really have to go
back for a moment and we have to look at the construct itself. And the moment that
we really go back and we really look at the construct, there’s something very
profound, in that sense, that you have to deal with. You have to deal with the way
in which we speak of this binary that we call Design and Personality within the
context of the illusion we live, and what it really means in terms of looking at the
components separately and just looking at the nature of the Design Crystal itself.
One of the things to really grasp in terms of the basic cosmology is that everything
about the nature of the totality is that the totality has not received its Personality.
This is something very grand to grasp. But, of course, the moment that we talk
about the larger themes, the macrocosm in that sense, that we’re also looking at the
microcosm. We’re looking at an illusion game that we play out in what we call our
reality.
The Quantum of Juxtaposing Form
Principles
If you go back in the cosmology and you look at
this very early panel, I think it’s the fourth panel
in the Bhan Tugh series, it says “A Rave has a
Personality Crystal and Design Crystal.” Then it
says, “They are the same.” And that’s really
something to try to grasp. It’s about as deep as
anything can take you, in a sense, in this
knowledge, because it really speaks so clearly for
what has always been my point of reference,
which is the form principle, that this is all form.
That in the quantum there is this illusion of
consciousness and light and all of these things,
but all of that is an illusion that is simply the
quantum of juxtaposing form principles.
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

25
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
It’s the thing that’s so amazing; it’s the thing to think about when you think about
two gates making a channel. The gates are just an inanimate form principle; they’re
not anything else. But the moment that they come into juxtaposition with that gate
at the other end, it’s the quantum that’s the life force. The life force isn’t within at
all. It’s all form principle. We live in the illusion.
So, the first thing to begin to grasp is the great lie. The great lie is that in fact there
is a Personality. Well, there isn’t; there is the preparation for the Personality. See, I
have an enormous luxury in these 99 weeks that I get to teach you this program.
It’s an enormous luxury that I can give you as solid a grounding as anyone has ever
received in this knowledge. In order for us to really understand the form principle,
we have to recognize, even though it is exceedingly difficult to accept, that it is all
form. It’s all form. And it started right from the beginning. There wasn’t some
magical Personality Crystal on the outside coming in. And first of all, the inside was
already there.
Two Kinds of Design Crystals
We have two kinds of Design Crystals. We do. Within the context of the way in
which we operate, we call one of those kinds of Design Crystals a Personality Crystal.
You see, because everything about the development of consciousness at this point in
the grander themes of this evolutionary process, and I mean the grander themes,
that what we are actually involved in is something that we see in microcosm, in a
way that only, I think, Design can show you is this preparation for the coming of the
Personality Crystal.
It’s in our deepest mysticism, it’s in our religious beliefs, this ‘coming of,’ that it’s
going to come, that it’s going to arrive, that the spirit of God is going to show up in
whatever flavor you happen to be connected to. We talk about it within the context
of the normal superficial Design world. We talk about this moment when the
Personality Crystal enters into the vehicle. And in our journey in this first semester to
go deep into the form principle, we will look at the way in which the Design Crystal,
at least in its early stages, works in establishing this form mechanism.
But what does it work with? Think about the way in which a Design Crystal works.
What is its job, after all? It has this extraordinary job. The job is to run this
immensely complex bio-mechanism. It’s immensely complex. You don’t want to
spend your life counting the cells in your body. But Human Design tells us
something. It says that every single cell has a Design Crystal, no Personality, but
every single cell has a Design Crystal. It’s something to think about.

26
LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
The Prime Design Crystal
Now let’s go back out to the macrocosm, to the cosmology. And you will see that
there are these two kinds of Designs. There is a prime Design Crystal and this is a
controlling mechanism. And there are basic cellular Design Crystals that have very,
very limited manifesting functions, very limited functions in terms of the way in
which they can translate the neutrino information. In fact, the only way they can
translate neutrino information is when a prime Design Crystal informs it.
The crystals that we have that we call Design Crystal and Personality Crystal, these
are two prime Design Crystals. Our body is made up of all of these other cellular
crystals. So if we shift here, in the illustration it says, “The Personality Crystal of the
child has not yet entered the body.” In terms of the mythology that I was given,
that when this round comes to an end—
now, I’m not talking about the cycle of
2027, I’m talking about the full round—
that when this round comes to the end
and life as we know it as a construct of
this illusion, when that falls apart,
basically that is the timing for the entry
of the Personality Crystal from the
outside into this totality of ours that I
refer to as the biverse.
For me, and it was part of my earliest
introductions to this knowledge as
general thematics, was to introduce the
concept of this unborn entity. For that
to actually sink in for some people, it
was a natural for them to grasp. At the
same time without an ability to
understand the limitations of the way
our consciousness deals with scale, it’s
often difficult to understand that we’re
simply dealing with one life. That it is
this one life. And that the programming
of this greater life is the preparation for
a stage that we play out as a drama in
our experiment in consciousness. This illusion we play out of what happens when
the Design Crystal doing its function, suddenly has to accept the presence of another
Design Crystal disguised as a Personality Crystal living out the potential of the
function of Personality.
Think about what it means in our biology, and in our biology what it really means is
the establishment, at least in us humans, of what we call the neo-cortex. When you
think about the way the Design Crystal operates at a cellular level, it is all those cells
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
27
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
coordinated. All of those cells, all of them operating in the coordination that’s
provided for them by the prime Design Crystal that organize the development of the
physical brain, and the physical cortex.
So what we’re looking at are different levels of Personality Crystal, the form principle
at work, and for us to begin to understand what our grand experiment is about. Can
form build a housing for Personality? And the question is not about us at the
personal level. The question is, “Will the totality as a form principle be ready for the
potential of Personality consciousness as a whole?” Well, that’s quite something.
Design Crystals are Binary
Design Crystals are binary by nature. That’s as revolutionary as you want to be.
Please don’t try to drag this information upward into the quantum illusion of what we
are, because it doesn’t work, in the sense that what we live out as a drama of the
Personality and the Design. The fact that we can understand at a very deep level
that these are form principle crystals, that they are not Personality Crystals, but they
are form principle crystals, is something that is of value to us in our work looking
deep beneath the surface. It is not something that is significant when you step into
the illusion because frankly, it doesn’t matter. But in terms of the science, it
matters.
Here [see illustration on previous page] we have the Tugh, which is the prime Design
Crystal, this is cellular, and the Bhan, which is also — here, is this other illusion, this
other kind of Design Crystal. It’s the two of them meeting that creates the potential
for the quantum that we are going to call ‘life.’ But I want you to grasp something
why it is so important the knowledge that we are exploring together, is that when it
comes to the form through this knowledge nothing will be left out. Because in this
knowledge, it’s all form; it isn’t anything else. PHS is really about the form and only
about the form, and the form without the Personality; remember that. The form
without the Personality. Because again, we do not know what is going to happen
with that juxtaposition. We are operating beneath the surface dealing with the
component.
What I want you to grasp is as we’re going to go deeper into our work in the way in
which Design operates, that it’s very important for you to recognize that there are
two kinds of ways in which the Design principle operates within the form. Two ways.
That’s going to make a very important difference when it comes to our ability to
understand why things go wrong in the vehicle. And I will show you there are many,
many ways for us to begin to understand the relationship between the prime crystal
and the relationship between the cellular crystals that have to do specifically with the
way in which our vehicles are actually run.

LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
The Nature of Design Crystals
So, I will move away from Rave Cosmology and we begin our process of returning
here to the nature of the Design Crystal. From now on everything is red and that’s
very important. I don’t want you to try to relate this information constantly back
upward to the quantum. We need to go down into the exclusiveness of the Design
and its function, before we can really begin to understand how it works coming back
up.
You can see something very important about this entire construct, that everything
about this wheel on the left [see illustration on next page] is rooted in the Ajna
Center. The thing that makes that important, at least from the cosmological point of
view, is that basically all of us, the consciousness field that we participate in, are part
of what one could call the cosmic Ajna Center. In other words, this is the
headquarters in that sense. And not today, because it’s not part of today’s lecture,
but obviously the biological associations that are there in the Ajna Center, that is,
the posterior and anterior pituitary and the way in which they are the biological
instruments of the Design Crystal is something that is going to be very important in
our exploration.
But I do want you to see that
whenever you’re really thinking
about the Design Crystal, that it’s
very important that you understand
something. Not only is it housed in
the Ajna Center, but more than
that, the Ajna Center being the
center of conceptualizing, that one
of the most important things about
the Design Crystal is the fact that it
is sourced in being able to construct
out of our potential intelligence. In
other words, everything about our
incarnation, everything about the
incarnation of self-reflected
consciousness is not about simply
giving things the ability to have a
sense of life; we see that in the
lower forms of life on the planet.
The goal is to see whether or not
the quantum field itself displays
intelligence.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Everything is about Scale
Remember, this is all an experiment, in a sense, an evolutionary program preparing
to establish the physical framework. I wish we had the eyes to see. Many, many
years ago, I think it actually was in 1986, somebody had passed me a National
Geographic and there was this huge segment that had been dedicated to what was
the physics of the time. There was an extraordinary illustration. It was a computer
projection of what the universe would look like if we could see neutrinos. It was
amazing. I’ve never been able to get access to it again; I guess I should just go flag
through all the old National Geographics of that period. But it was an incredible
thing to see. It was this kind of amorphous-it looked like a cell quite frankly, but
nonetheless it had a body, at least in the graphic.
We don’t think that way. We only see the spaces between the stars. The fact is we
don’t have the perception. That’s the grand difference. Everything is about scale.
It’s one of the most important things to grasp if you want to really be able to see the
whole at any time. Is that you have to grasp that this is just a question of scale.
Don’t be overwhelmed with what appears to be these vast numbers and spaces.
My favorite illusion to that is what it would be like to be a neutrino just about to
penetrate a neuron in the brain. The neuron is like Mount Everest to the neutrino.
And that neutrino, if it could see and look, it would look out at these vast, vast
spaces of darkness with blinking lights everywhere, neurons firing. It’s all a matter
of scale, after all.
The Form Principle is Focused on the Development of Intelligence
But I do want you to understand something about the form principle. The form
principle is focused on the development of intelligence. And in the end you get to
see that both the Personality Crystal and the Design Crystal are housed in what we
call the mental centers: Head and Ajna. It’s one of these very, very basic things to
really understand why there is this illusion, because it is the goal of the form
principle.
The Design Crystal is Inanimate
The thing about it that’s so fascinating for me is that the Design Crystal by itself—
let’s say you could isolate one, put one under a microscope—it’s not conscious. It’s
not like you have a conversation with it. It’s not a conscious thing. It’s just an
interference matrix. And it’s inanimate. It’s as dead as any rock. And yet, the
extraordinary thing about juxtaposition and the quantum field, is that the moment

LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
that you bring that inanimate in juxtaposition with the other and you get this life
force that emerges in the life force, in the illusion, this is where the intelligence is.
You can get into all kinds of discussions about the nature of who made Design
Crystals, or what made Design Crystals, or how did Design Crystals, or how did any
of these crystals come into being. I have no idea; I don’t care quite frankly. There
is always a Ring Pass Not. And there is nothing that anyone can do about that.
The Beginning of the Illusion
In this illustration we begin to see something, and I want you to look in reverse. The
first time I presented this illustration, it was about explaining how the Design Crystal
gets called up into the Solar Plexus Center of the male, and how that is called up by
the male, the yang Monopole initiating frequency, which is this illustration.
But one of the things that I want you to grasp is that this is the way in which things
are brought into the illusion. Everything about the Magnetic Monopole, the moment
that you see a bodygraph, is the moment that you have to say, “I am not seeing
things for what they are. I am
seeing the by-product of those
things as a quantum illusion.” The
moment that you see the
frequency being drawn upward by
the Monopole into the form, that’s
the moment that the illusion
begins. That’s the moment that
we no longer can see the form
principle for what it truly is. And
that’s something for us to keep in
mind.
We’re going to go back down.
That’s really what it’s all about.
We’re going to go back down to the
heart of what is this thing to begin
with. And the first thing that we
have to understand is that, that
white hole in the Earth that you
see, that illusion to the Design
Crystal being pulled out from the
Design Crystal bundle from within the Earth. Think about that Design Crystal. That
Design Crystal is very, very different from the Design Crystal, the Personality Crystal
that we call. The Design Crystal has an impression in it. It has a special, unique
impression.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Magnetic Monopole Tries to Get the Vehicle to “Die”
What sits in that impression is the Magnetic Monopole, its Magnetic Monopole, and
they fit together. This is what everything is about, is this tension that results when
they separate from each other, which is what the illusion brings, because they carry
a Monopole that is embedded. The moment that Monopole is set loose, it loses its
mono-polar power to try to pull everything back. In doing so, it creates the
quantum. And it’s not trying to create it. Think about that. It’s not intelligent. It’s
not trying to create the quantum that becomes the illusion of all of us together here.
It doesn’t. All it’s trying to do is get its Design Crystal back. In other words, all it’s
trying to do in terms of the illusion is get the vehicle to die. Think about that.
Not so much that it’s actively trying to get the vehicle to die. But then again, we
know the law of this illusion, this quantum illusion, is that it’s a limited ride. This
illusion is rented. We don’t get to keep this illusion for very long. The only reason
that we don’t get to keep this illusion for very long is the Monopole. It’s the very
pressure of the Monopole, the very power of the Monopole to hold everything
together that also leads to deterioration that eventually leads to what we call death,
and happy, happy Monopole. It gets to go back into the Design Crystal.
The Personality is Just an Add-On
But there’s something else to really grasp from their relationship. And it’s very, very
important for us to understand because it gives us a certain advantage in the kind of
work, ultimately, that we’re going to be able to do with this knowledge, is to
recognize that there is an intrinsic relationship that is unique between the Monopole
and the Design Crystal. And it is in that very unique relationship that the game is
stacked on the side of form. The Monopole works in conjunction with the Design
Crystal, that is its greatest interest. So the moment that we’re dealing with the form
principle, we’re dealing with something else. The form principle has a much greater
power to sway the impact of the quantum than the Personality does. It’s why the
Personality is a passenger and is not the vehicle or the driver. It’s an add-on.
Think about the nature of life, because we’ve got all kinds of religious thought about
when life begins and when it doesn’t begin, does it begin at conception, whatever the
case may be. In Human Design it’s obvious that there is no quantum. That is, there
is no true human until the Personality enters the vehicle. This means that in a
normal pregnancy of three trimesters of approximately three months we’re dealing
with six months in which there is this package, this meat package, form package that
is within the womb that is not human. It is the perfection of the work of the
Monopole with its Design Crystal.
There is no quantum in that. That is, there is no quantum in the sense of what
happens when the Personality Crystal enters into the vehicle. So we already have a
mapping of the very play that we are living out. Because you see, the Personality
Crystal cannot be there from the beginning, there is no place for it. There is nothing
for it to do. Nothing. It’s an add-on. And it doesn’t really matter whether it shows

32
LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
up or not. It certainly doesn’t matter to the Monopole and its relationship to the
Design Crystal.
These beings that have certain kinds of brain damage where their consciousness in
the sense as we understand it doesn’t function at all. And yet, the form principle is
ready to continue its journey. This is something, again, that’s so important to
understand about the turmoil of the passenger, because the turmoil of the passenger
is that it is truly helpless and incompetent within the vehicle and the way in which
the vehicle is managed by the relationship between the Monopole and the Design
Crystal.
One of the things that we really need to understand is the way in which the Design
Crystal operates before the Personality Crystal comes into the vehicle. I am
convinced, and it is something that is so obvious, at least it seems obvious to me,
that what we call genetically-inherited predispositions for this kind of disease or that
kind of disease, the kinds of things where there is early damage to the fetus where
there are things that arise at very early stages in the fetus’ development, that this is
something that clearly can be understood at the very, very beginnings of the Design
Crystal and the Monopole’s work in the vehicle. And this is something that we’re
going to take a look at because it’s very important knowledge.
Strategy: Aligning Beings to Their Vehicle
But this relationship is one of the keys
for us to really grasp. It’s why I have
a great deal of confidence in the goals
of PHS because there are ways to
influence the way in which the illusion
operates. By the way, in just simply
understanding this in a general sense,
you can see why the application of
strategy on the surface in Human
Design is something that actually
works. In other words, what you’re
doing is that you’re aligning beings to
their vehicle and the more aligned the
vehicle is, again given its relationship
with the Magnetic Monopole and the
way the illusion works, that the
healthier your vehicle becomes, the
more influence it has on how the quantum feels. That again is something that’s very
important for us to understand. Breakthroughs of the passenger have very little
impact on the vehicle.
Think about that. That’s something, again, to understand about the helplessness of
what it is to be a passenger. You can have an extraordinary epiphany as a
passenger and it has almost no impact on transformation in your vehicle, because

33
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
the vehicle and the Monopole have a specific, very important relationship to each
other.
Crystal Conception Mechanics
In this illustration, and again here we are just simply looking at conception
mechanics, and in looking at these conception mechanics, this relationship, think
about what you’re actually looking at for a moment. You have the Design Crystal
and its Magnetic Monopole. That Design Crystal and its Magnetic Monopole are
sitting in the Solar Plexus of the male. That Design Crystal and its Magnetic
Monopole are going to give a specific advantage to a set biology. That is, one
spermatozoa is going to have the advantage of being very clearly and carefully
directed in its movement by its Monopole.
But think about the other side; think about the egg that’s going to be fertilized.
Think about that egg. That egg is made up of cellular Design Crystals. That egg is a
cellular environment. And yet it is a Design Crystal environment. What you’re really
marrying here is a cellular Design Crystal environment, because there are going to
be tens of thousands of Design Crystals in that egg. And you’re going to have this
relationship, this cellular Design Crystal structure is then going to be given its prime
direction. In other words, that prime crystal is going to come in and this is going to
be the master crystal. In other words, it’s through this master crystal that this
formation of cellular crystals is going to be informed. It’s the way that it works at
the crystal level.
You can already see that here we have the true microcosm to the larger mythological
macrocosm that I showed you at the beginning. In other words, here you have the
cellular egg, and here is this cellular egg waiting for its prime mover. Not only its
prime mover, but remember that that Design Crystal is carrying with it its Magnetic
Monopole. The moment that these elements are together, this is the moment that
this singular, primely-directed inanimate force takes on its direction. That is, its
evolutionary movement. It actually, in that moment, is instantaneously separate in
its direction from its host, the mother. In other words, it has its own Monopole and
it has the ingredients that it needs.
The Design Crystal’s Goal is the Perfection of the Vehicle
Remember, that Monopole within is already creating this juxtaposed program. It is
bringing together these two elements, the prime crystal that is going to order
everything and the cellular crystals that are going to respond to it. This tells you
something about, let’s call it trickle-down, what it really means when the Design
Crystal is operating with perfection. If the passenger is to be enlightened, whatever
word you want to use, awakened, that when you’re looking at the Design Crystal
itself that its juxtaposed goal is the perfection of the vehicle. That’s what it’s all
about.

34
LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
The moment that you see that the Design Crystal can operate correctly, and
correctly for the Design Crystal is only—it has nothing to do with the surface of
strategy, please understand that, because again you’re not specifically talking about
the Design Crystal when you step into the illusion. What I’m talking about is the
therapeutic and realignment processes that we can do for the Design itself, things
that we looked at, for example, last April in PHS where we begin to really work with
the crystal at its deep level separate from the illusion.
When that crystal is operating with greater efficiency, let’s call it efficiency, then
every one of the cellular crystals that’s receiving the information, all of them begin to
operate more efficiently. The only way that we’re going to understand at our level,
at a deep level, the way in which we can truly work with the physical form, is that we
have to realize that it is the Design Crystal through the agency of all of the cellular
designs in which the whole process of maintaining and moving our form takes place.
So, this is a very, very basic thing for us to grasp in our understanding.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
STAGE I: Energy Conversion
What you’re looking at here is a series of illustrations that is actually part of my
conception series and some of the most, at least for me, intriguing work. This is
where we need to begin. We need to begin with a real understanding of what the
Design Crystal actually represents. What does it actually do? Think about it for a
moment. We’re going to see that the Design Crystal is faceted. And we’re going to
be able to discern those facets, and we’re going to see the way they work.
It’s so important to see that once we understand the way in which a specific Design
Crystal filters information, that we begin to see how that filtering moves down to the
cellular level. And that any adjustment that we make to the prime Design Crystal is
going to make an enormous difference at the cellular level. So, we’re going to be
able to deal with a system of delivering information into the form itself that is really,
in a sense, highly superior in the way in which that can work.
Think about birth, think about conception. Here what you’re looking at is stage I of
the first 88 degrees from the moment of conception. In other words, give or take a
day or two, the first trimester of the pregnancy. Here is where the most important
work is done by the Design Crystal and the Magnetic Monopole. After all, it has to
establish the basis upon which a form, our form, can ultimately come into existence
and be sophisticated enough to be able to house the potential of Personality
consciousness.
Stage I is at 2 degrees of solar arc from the moment of conception. Now, again, the
Sun basically is moving approximately a degree a day. So, what you’re looking at is
two days from the moment of conception. At 2 days from the moment of conception
the first thing to understand is there has been no separation between the Design
Crystal and its Monopole. And at the very, very, very first place that the Design
Crystal functions from, and the very first center that is established as a center, is the
Throat.
Now, we’re going to discover that every single one of the concepts that we are able
to discern that can be of value to the form in one way or another has to be delivered
through one of the 11 gates of the Throat. The Throat is a place in which the entire
form structure, the whole underlying theme of the form structure, is all written in the
Throat. And the very fact that we have differentiation is written in the Throat.
Again, we’ll talk about those biological associations to the thyroid later, the whole
endocrine system, for that matter, because in terms of Human Design the endocrine
system is enormously important for us to grasp.
But here at this point of 2 degrees of arc, what is the very, very beginning, the
foundation of what the Design Crystal has to establish? The first thing is, and the
main theme is, energy conversion. Energy conversion. This is a bio-form. Its ability
to convert energy is something that is so important because it’s everything. It’s
what the whole life process is going to be all about, everything about that. So at the
very beginning the ability to be able to work with energy, the understanding of the
basic quantum that is there in E=mcQ, if you do not have the counterpoint of energy
with matter, if they are not interchangeable, you cannot have life.

36
LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
So energy conversion is at the very, very source, it’s the very first thing. Now, think
about that Design Crystal, this is not even a fetus. We’re talking about cells here.
We’re not talking about a huge cellular mix, either. We’re talking about a very, very
closed circle where the Magnetic Monopole embedded in the Design Crystal is pulling
everything very, very, very close, pulling the cellular design very close around it, and
in doing so being able to inform it, and to inform it with this capacity for energy
conversion.
The Heart of Life is in the Throat
It’s not like that prime Design Crystal knows how to do that. But the moment that
prime Design Crystal is within the cellular matrix is the moment that the neutrino
stream working through that prime Design Crystal, working through what is its
design, that through it the informing takes place. Because, remember what we’re
going to see is that each and every one of these forms needs to be differentiated.
It’s why the thyroid is so amazing. No two thyroids are alike; they just are not alike.
They are all different. And this is one of the secrets of life. You can see in terms of
the language here this is the path of manifestation. This is where it all begins and
this is why the Throat is Rome. All roads lead here, everything leads there.
It’s something very interesting to understand that all illusion leads to the G Center.
All illusion leads to the G Center. But the heart of life, you go to the Throat. This is
where it all begins. And you will see that the very first thing that will really be a
marker for life, because remember this is not alive. It’s two days old in the womb, it
is still not alive. It can’t be. This is a center with no gates. This is as inanimate as
inanimate gets. It’s inanimate; it’s not alive. It has to go through certain stages.
This is the path to manifestation. But life does not begin until the Magnetic
Monopole dis-embeds from the Design Crystal. It is the only way in which life can be
measured; the only way.
Serotonin
There’s something that will be part of later work, but very important to mention at
this time. One of the things that this two-day old inanimate thing is doing, is
preparing to create serotonin, or preparing to create the potential to create
serotonin. This is something very important to grasp about the Monopole process in
controlling longevity of human beings.
I have cautioned many times in the past, I don’t think it’s general knowledge in
Human Design, but there are a great many people trying to merchandize serotonin
for people to take as part of all kinds of therapies, this and that, whatever. Neither
add nor remove serotonin. This is not something to play with. I think that it is, as a
neuro-transmitter, is one that is still truly not really grasped, the deep significance of
what serotonin is about.

37
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Basically, the potential to produce serotonin in your life is actually the limitation on
the potential of you to be alive. That very, very determination of what will be your
ultimate serotonin capacity, this is something at the very, very beginning of the
game. This is something that is at work here in this inanimate object. Ah, the
inanimate is amazing. It’s amazing. It really is. We tend to think of it as lifeless,
instead of understanding that any inanimate object can be the instrument of a
potential quantum; any inanimate object. It’s just something obvious to keep in
mind.
Life Comes from the Inanimate
So here what we’re looking at is that we don’t have life yet. And yet, the moment
that you bring together the cellular and the prime, what you get is a building
program. Now, go back to the mythology at the beginning of this class and you will
see that that’s what it was all about—a building project. The Big Bang is about the
beginning of building a universe; building this biverse of ours. It’s a building project.
That building project doesn’t require what we call Personality consciousness. As a
matter of fact, that whole building program can be what we call inanimate. But you
see, without the inanimate matrix there is no potential for evolutionary
consciousness, none, none, none. None.
This is one of my favorite drawings because it’s so incredible. To understand, as a
kid, because I was a nihilist even from a young age, there was this wonderful
comment in Genesis about God making us out of clay or something, I don’t know.
And I used to think how ridiculous. How does life come out of the inanimate? Oh,
boy, how foolish a child I was. How extraordinary it is to understand that there isn’t
anything but the inanimate; nothing—all this gloss, all this covering of skin, organs,
cells, genes, chromosomes—illusion, illusion; it’s all inanimate. The thing that seems
warm and fuzzy and talks a lot, that’s just the quantum out of the inanimate.
So this is how we begin. The thing to understand about our form principle is to
really see very clearly it has its own process. And it has absolutely no regard for
what the experience of the passenger is. It’s only concerned, if we can use such a
terminology, with building a proper vehicle, nothing else. It’s not like it decides what
the serotonin production will be. It is set in the differentiation of the crystal.
The thing that’s so interesting—I love Einstein’s line about “God doesn’t throw dice,”
which I think is kind of cute. But, in a sense, it was sort of like that. When you
think about the crystal shattering, this shattering of the crystals, this kind of, yeah I
guess you could run a very profound quantum computer program analysis of fractal
possibilities and so forth and so on, and you could probably be, if you had a vast
enough capacity, maybe you could even see the order in all of that. But, in a sense,
these Design Crystals, all of these crystals, there is a kind of random differentiation
to them that really makes all of this possible. It was, in that sense, a throwing of the
dice. But perhaps all we can say is that the dice were rigged. It was built in.

38
LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
The Design Crystal’s Singular Imperative
So, when we come to the very beginning of looking at the Design Crystal, we have to
see that it has a very, very singular imperative. And that its very, very first thing is:
Can it develop a relationship, a form relationship with the energy field? Can it create
the potential of a bio-mechanism? That’s the first step. The only way that this is not
a miscarriage, a lack of fertility, this and that, the only way that this works is that, if
in this process at this stage, that this Monopole Design prime with the cellular
crystals can actually begin to develop the process to actually produce serotonin. If
they can’t do that, you’re never going to get to a life. And if it is interrupted in any
way, if it’s disturbed in any way, then you can have forms that will last another day.
You can have a form that might make it a couple of months, you might have a form
that emerges into its quantum world and doesn’t have either a healthy form or
whatever the case may be, or may not live long. But it’s all there, right there at the
very beginning.
The Monopole is Responsible for Type
I’d like to return to this theme that we’re looking at in this illustration, the energy
conversion. I want you to think about something. It’s the Monopole that ultimately
is responsible for whether or not a being is going to be a Manifestor, a Generator, a
Projector or a Reflector. After all, that terminology only exists in the illusion that the
Monopole creates. And it is only in that illusion that energy conversion is of any
importance, after all. The energy conversion in and of itself for the actual Design
Crystal doesn’t mean anything; it’s inanimate.
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
39
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But the way in which it’s going to work juxtaposed, the way it’s going to work in the
quantum, which is what the Magnetic Monopole is going to determine, this is the way
in which the potential of the energy conversion that we see here emerges ultimately
as this or that. Something for you to think about is that your type is something that
is built in two days after conception and before you’re even alive. Wow, think about
that. That is really something that is incredible.
This is this unbelievable relationship that is there between the Monopole and the
Design Crystal. And of course, the way in which the body is going to operate as an
energy principle is something we get to see very clearly from the surface. And there
is a vast difference between sacral beings and non-sacral beings, energy types and
non-energy types and all of the variations in between. But all of that is operating in
the illusion established by the Monopole.
The potential for that illusion, what that illusion is going to be, because remember
that the vehicle and its type exists before the Personality comes into the vehicle.
The stage is being set from a very, very early point. And I think, for example, that if
we could do the kind of research at the real basic research level, to look very clearly
into the differentiation that exists in the cellular construct, the basic construct in
those first two days, what we would see is that we’re already seeing a division of
four, that it’s already there. In other words, that there are going to be four basic
variations of what takes place in this first two degrees of solar arc that ultimately is
going to produce this type or that type.
Energy conversion is an extraordinary thing to grasp. Because it really is telling us
something very mysterious about the nature of being, that the very potential of how
we are going to live out our process, the way in which we’re going to operate in an
energy environment, the kind of being we’re going to be. After all, who better than
you to understand that simply by saying somebody is a Generator, you already
understand so much about their energy process. And yet, all of this is established,
and it is established before there is even the actual live, or the beginning of the life
process.

LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
STAGE II: The Descent Into Form
Here we’re looking at stage II and this is 4 degrees of solar arc, so we have a binary
progression, the 2 to the 4. This is called the descent into form, and I’ll get to the
theme in a moment. The descent into form is something that’s very interesting. In
the Sunday lecture series, I did this lecture on the inanimate and its relationship to
Design. It really is one of those things to really grasp about the progression of forms
that were given to me. That is, moving from the inanimate to the single cell and
then finally getting to the plant. And you’re looking at a progression in terms of the
complexity of the form until finally you get to humanity.
When you’re looking at the inanimate, you’re looking at something that has no
channel. Within the sense of the general inanimate, what we’re looking at is this
hanging gate that’s there, the 25th gate that just sort of hangs there. But the
moment that we have a channel, and again, this is the cell, the moment we have this
channel then what we have is the life force. We do not have consciousness. The first
step of consciousness is when you get to the domain of plants. And the moment you
get to the domain of plants, you enter into the beginnings of the consciousness
program and you enter into the beginnings of the binary crystal process.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But here when you’re dealing with the cellular construct, and of course, the Design of
a single cell is the 15/5 with the 3 as an integral Design. What you’re looking at is
simply the life force. So what’s taking place here in the fourth day, and the way in
which we see that concretized is that you look at that and you see the G Center and
you see this channel, the 31/7, or at least what we will call ultimately the 31/7, as
the bridge for this. It’s one of those things that I mentioned once in awhile in gray
courses that we all have special crystals in our Throat, cellular crystals in our Throat
that have specific functions, and there is this specific cellular crystal that works with
each of the 11 portals that are there in the Throat Center.
G Center: The Importance of the Liver
But here we have something very important to grasp about biology, and about one
of the main indicators of well-being in life. When you move to the G Center you go
to the liver. One can never, never underestimate how important the liver is. One of
those things about the cleansing that’s possible in the de-conditioning process is that
everything about the de-conditioning process is predicated on the fact that we have
cellular renewal. In other words, basically on a seven-year cycle, humanity will
reprocess, in a sense, will come clean with a new set of cells. But in fact, that is not
100 percent process. There are cells that do not go through a death process. Liver
cells, you kill a liver cell and it’s not like you’re going to have one that suddenly
emerges to take its place.
It’s fascinating for me about the liver. When I first introduced this knowledge to
medical people, at first they looked at that and thought, “hmmmmm.” But if you do
the research you’ll see that the liver is something that is there from the beginning.
It makes its primary appearance.
It’s also interesting from a mystical point of view. For example, Hindu Brahmin
tradition has it that we incarnate in and out of the liver. Now, for me that’s always
been a concept deeply connected to the reality, which is that the G Center is where
the Monopole is and the Monopole organizes our incarnations. Not only does it
organize our entering, it organizes our leaving, and it organizes everything in
between. Because, after all, everything we experience as life, we experience as a
by-product of that illusion.
The Framework of Life/ Creation of the G Center
So, here we have the descent into form, but the descent into form is something
interesting. This is the beginning of life. It is the beginning of life. But, it’s not yet
life, which is really an interesting thing. In other words, this step is absolutely
necessary because if you don’t get to this step, it’s not possible for life to take hold.

LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
But we’re still dealing with an inanimate process. And basically, if we could see it,
what we would be seeing is a speeding up of cellular division; in other words, the
growth of the physical environment and the expansion of the physical environment
through cellular division. This is the beginning of this descent into form.
The by-product of that, or coincidental to that, is that this very expansion of cellular
division is what creates, in that sense, the G Center. In other words, this is part of
the mechanism of the prime Magnetic Monopole creating its launch pad. In other
words, you’ve got a life force; you’ve got the potential of the life force. But as long
as the Magnetic Monopole stays embedded in the Design Crystal you still do not have
life. You have the potential of life, you have the framework life.
The Theme of Suffering
The other thing is the theme of suffering. There is a price for expansion. And it’s
the lesson of the form principle. The more demands that you have on the needs of
the form to sustain itself, this is the beginning of the struggle, and this is the
beginning of pain. This is the beginning of what it is to be in a bio-form. Though it
can sound rather dramatic—the theme of suffering—it’s one of the basic things for all
of us to recognize about form, how fragile it is. It’s extraordinarily fragile. It’s so
easy for us to distort it, to disease it, to damage it, all of those things. So, the
moment that you enter into this form principle, you enter into the potential of
suffering that goes with it.
I don’t think that we’re talking about suffering here at a psychological level. It’s like
watching your children grow, that kind of event where suddenly they have a high
fever and they’re very uncomfortable and you think they’re sick, but they’re not,
because basically they’re just growing—growing pains, these kinds of things. The
moment that you enter into this kind of form experiment where we’re sensitized to
the form, then obviously it is not something that is necessarily going to be always
comfortable, it just isn’t.
But again, the real key is to see that still we do not have life. And yet, the Design
Crystal has these two imperatives: It has to set up the possibility that we can
convert energy, it has to begin the process of establishing a platform for life, and it’s
doing all of that on, let’s call it automatic pilot. This is its primary program at work.
You don’t really know what’s going to happen. In other words, you don’t really know
whether that life is going to take hold or what that life can possibly be until the
illusion begins. And the illusion can only begin the moment that the Magnetic
Monopole is going to dis-embed itself from that Design Crystal, only then, because
only then does the illusion of a new life begin. It’s only then that the impregnated
female suddenly has this sense that ‘something’s different.’

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
STAGE III: The Dis-Embedding of the Monopole
So this brings us to Stage III and it brings us to 8 degrees of solar arc;
approximately eight days after the conception. Here is the dis-embedding, and you
can see it highlighted, of the Monopole. Now, it’s interesting. Look at that
configuration. If you’re looking at the bodygraph configuration, the dis-embedding
of the Monopole means that basically what the Design Crystal has done in the
previous stage, it’s something to look at; I take you back for a moment.
If you look at the previous stage this creation of the G Center, this is establishing the
potential for the life force, because it opens up a way for the Design Crystal and
Monopole to separate from each other, that the Monopole has its place to go to. And
so when you think about the descent into form, think about what it really is. What it
really is, is that built into the Design Crystal is to establish a physical environment
where the Monopole can go and begin its process of creating the illusion of form and
all the suffering that happens to go along with that.
So when we come back and we look here at this third stage, here we’re really seeing
the beginning of life; of life, not consciousness, life. And it’s very, very important.
In other words, look at it and see something. The Monopole is going to its correct
environment. In other words, it’s going into the G Center and from the G Center
there it can establish the quantum that we’re going to, slowly but surely, refer to as
a fetus because it is going to take on a nature and an identity, that G self identity.

LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
Birth of the Aura
The other thing is that the moment that the Magnetic Monopole dis-embeds from the
Design Crystal and goes into the G Center, it does something else, it creates an
aura. This is when the aura is born. This aura being born is a number of things.
The moment that the Monopole gets into the G Center it begins its job. And we
know it has two jobs. One is to hold us together in the illusion of our separateness,
so its job is to make sure that what will be the fetus is protected from the mother,
it’s protected from the environment of the mother, in that sense. It’s also not only
holding it together in that illusion, but it is giving it its direction. That direction, at
this phase, is a developmental direction. In other words, the whole program that
has to unfold that’s going to create the illusion of a human being. It’s going to
create the illusion of a human fetus. This is this mask projected outwards; this is the
aura that is established in this moment.
But notice something; the Design Crystal is still in the Throat. Again, how important
it is to understand that the relationship between the Ajna Center and the Throat
Center is one that we can see with certain obviousness in the surface. In other
words, the relationship between conceptualizing and the potential to be able to
express oneself; but how really important it is to see that there is a profound
relationship between the thyroid system and the pituitaries.
The Relationship between the Design Crystal and the Throat
Basically, these two things, they’re the instrument of the fulfillment of the
Monopole’s illusion. So the moment that you’re looking at Stage III and you see that
the Design Crystal is still in the Throat, understand that when it finally goes to its
proper place, in other words, on the other side, then you can see this basic tension.
The tension between the separation of the Monopole and the Design Crystal, and
they separate in stages. But that the Design Crystal, because it is housed here in
the Throat, this is one of its most important relationships, is its relationship with the
Throat. And one of the most important relationships of the Monopole is its
relationship with the Throat.
So, there is this enormous focus. Again, it goes back to our very first illustration of
this sequence of conception where you see that everything is there in this closed-off
Throat Center. It is the beginning, and it is the core throughout the life process.
And the relationship between the Design Crystal and the Monopole is a relationship
that operates through the Throat.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Moment of Dis-Embedding
So, what do I tell people? Operate correctly. The Throat is responsible for ultimate
manifestation on this planet. To operate correctly, we all, in one way or another,
have to do whether we’re asked, invited, whatever the structure is, the doing is what
turns the world. And that the whole fundamental relationship in the illusion is this
binary on either side that takes place at this stage. This is the dis-embedding; this is
the moment that you have something that is alive. This is the moment that you
have something that has an aura and its direction is the direction of life itself.
STAGE IV: The Building of the Ajna Center
Finally, in our sequence today, we
get to the fourth stage. Here we
see the completion of the first
stage of a binary progression; the
2 degrees, the 4 degrees, the 8
degrees. Here we have 16 degrees
of solar arc. Here we have the
building of the Ajna Center.
This is something that is very
important. This is this moment
that we set up what is going to be
the whole intent and purpose of
incarnation. After all, this is what
it’s all about. You can see a
manifesting self that is self-
consciously aware. This is what we
are. This is the core of being. The
primary work of the Design Crystal
is to reach this stage. And that
you can see that this stage
represents something very
interesting that is not there in Stage III and that is the separation of mind and body.
What that literally means is that it is opening up the work of the Design Crystal to
establish the framework for potential self-reflected consciousness. In other words, in
terms of the energy that is going to be used to build that fetus, there is going to be a
disproportionate amount of energy that will be absolutely necessary to be able to
create the platform that we call the human brain. It’s an enormous job to do so.

LESSON TWO: The Functioning Of the Design Crystal
Separation of Mind/Body
It’s all about setting up the potential for the separation of mind and body. Please
understand that it doesn’t mean that separation within the context of that stage.
What it means is that it is setting up the environment in which the Personality
Crystal, that has nothing to do with this Design Crystal or Monopole, is going to be
imposed upon it by the way in which the structure of the life program works. And
out of that will be the absolute separation of mind and body.
So, here is a very, very important place for us to keep in mind. And it’s something
to understand is that the Design Crystal as its work, as its primary work, is here to
make sure that the passenger has a nice place to sit, which I find hilarious, actually,
because, of course, the dilemma between the two of them is amazing, and all of the
conflicts that arise out of all of that. The dilemma with trying to understand the
nature of being, the dilemma with being finally at peace with oneself, the dilemma of
how difficult it is for a passenger to become awake. So, you can see that inherent in
the Design Crystal is that it is here to offer its services, if I can put it that way, for
something that is not it, that it doesn’t like, in which it will lose its capacity to
determine its pure direction, because the illusion changes everything.
Re-Aligning the Design Crystal
So, it’s all built in from the beginning. For us, in this process, we’re here to read the
crystal. And in being able to read the Design Crystal and the way that it interacts
with the cellular crystals, we will have an ability to be able to re-align the Design
Crystal to its nature. And re-align it to its correctness. However, this is something
that will always have to be in conjunction with the preparation of the passenger,
because in the quantum, in the illusion, we have no way of knowing how the
properly operating Design Crystal, in its relationship with its cellular alignment, how
this is going to affect the overall illusion.
It’s the first thing that you have to grasp about what we’re really looking at. We
need to see the way in which the vehicle is designed. That’s the work. And we need
to see the way in which, not only the vehicle is designed, but the way in which the
Design Crystal ultimately is going to translate that information into what we call the
bodygraph. It’s quite a journey. But I hope that with today, you have a new
appreciation of this very special relationship, this relationship between the prime
Design Crystal and the cellular Design Crystals.
When we begin to investigate the various aspects, from Color downward to Base, in
relationship to the chains, this is when we’re going to begin to understand how we
can take this information, the way in which the Design Crystal operates within the
form, and the information of how it is differentiated to bring the two of them
together. And to be able to give us the advantage of understanding how somebody’s
vehicle operates and at the same time, being able to provide them with techniques
or therapies that will align them to what is correct for their vehicle. Interesting stuff.

Lesson Three
The Pre-Personality Vehicle
Tonight we’re going to begin a journey into what I think is one of the most
fascinating aspects of the potential of PHS. There are two things that concern me.
One is the infrastructure of the vehicle. We’re going to take a look at that today.
The infrastructure of the vehicle tells us a lot. It is a way of understanding the
predispositions that exist within the vehicle itself; predispositions that are positive
and predispositions that are negative within the infrastructure itself.
Design Controls Everything
We have two kinds of things we have to deal with when we talk about Primary Health
System. One is to understand the relationship of the Design in its relationship to the
Personality. In other words, what happens in differentiation, because in fact, it is in
differentiation that we really can be of great value in the sense of attuning the body.
And attuning the body in many ways based on what we can understand from the
Color down; in other words, to be able to provide proper guidance or therapies.
But when it comes to infrastructure, when things go wrong in the infrastructure, then
we end up with problems that exist in the differentiation that are no longer really—
they may be solvable, but it may mean there is a great deal that has to be done, all
kinds of rather exotic things. Basically, what I’m talking about is that the Design
controls everything. Today is really about grasping that.
The Personality, in essence, doesn’t really matter because the Personality isn’t
responsible for building the infrastructure. The Personality isn’t present in the
building of the infrastructure. Now, the graphs that I’m going to be using today are
from the Design of Pregnancy. I’ve asked Andrea, and we’re just working on
scheduling, which will be in the next couple of weeks, to hold her first workshop
directly related to a deeper look at the Design of Pregnancy, because in fact that’s
not my purpose of taking you through these illustrations today. I really want to talk
about underlying themes of how we’re going to investigate transitions that take
place, impacts that take place on the infrastructure itself and what that actually
means.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Need to Have Accurate Time
There is something that is obvious to me. We have two kinds of things that we’re
dealing with. One is that scientifically understanding how the infrastructure works,
how it’s built and how it is altered in one way or another is very, very significant.
But it leaves us with an essential dilemma. The essential dilemma is time. And of
course, everything that we’re dealing with when it comes to PHS is really about a
problem of time. We need to have very, very accurate time. I’m very lucky in the
sense, in the case of two of my children I have relatively accurate conception time.
It offers an enormous wealth of information.
One of the things that I will ask all of you, and it’s very important to the work that
we’re going to do together, it’s clear to me not in this semester, but particularly in
the middle semester, which will be very important work that I want to hold
workshops with you. We need to go through the analysis of material together so
that you can understand what I see when I look at all of this, which is something
that is very important for me to ultimately be able to share.
So, what I really want to ask you is to get as much conception data if at all possible.
Friends of yours, people that you know, women, for example, who have just become
pregnant, they tend to have a clear memory of when the conception was. But
conception time is something that we need to cultivate and it’s very important for
the advancement of this research. It isn’t as sexy, if I can use that language, as
what we can do with understanding the Design and the way in which we can impact
differentiation on the surface. Because obviously, on the surface this is where
everybody is trying to deal with whatever it is that are the dilemmas of their vehicle.
But the fact is for us to be able to grasp this
knowledge at the structural level, to be able
to see what goes on at the structural level
is something that is very, very important.
So, conception data is something that we’re
really going to need.
No Stage: Conception Moment
In the illustrations that I’m showing you,
this very first illustration, if you look under
that very cute picture of three hands
holding a pregnant belly, underneath that it
says Conception Analysis and it says No
Stage because this is the actual conception.
What you’re looking at in the small graph
above is the actual Design of the mother as
it will impact the structural development.

50
LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
I’ll talk about that later, because obviously conditioning is a very important factor.
However, I want to give you a time sense. So, as an example, if you can see the
date this was a conception—by the way, this is a legitimate conception. It’s
somebody I actually worked with. This is Saturday and it is the 18th of September
and it’s 1999 and you can see the time is given there. It was actually a woman I
worked with in California that had problems with the child that was born, and it was
my analysis of it. So, here is the conception timing. And by the way, she said that
conception timing was plus or minus a few minutes because she actually saw a clock,
this kind of story. Anyway, she knew the timing.
So here you have the conception moment. What you’re just seeing there on the
right, you’re just seeing the imprint of that moment of conception. But I only want
you to pay attention to this in terms of the timing. We’re dealing with Saturday in
the morning.
STAGE I: Building the Throat
If we go to the next graph, this is, as you can see above the bodygraph, to the right,
it says Stage I - 2 degrees. I was given so many forms by the Voice. It’s one of the
things that was so extraordinary. In a way, it was one of the things that as part of
my own inner process, gave so much
verification to what I was being given,
because it wasn’t all being homogenized
into some single vast archetype. It’s
clear that each and every one of these
forms deserves a very deep analysis
because they are really very important
to understand.
The first thing to grasp, the deepest
thing to grasp, and I will repeat this over
and over again, is that all of this is the
agency of the Design Crystal. Now,
think about what you’re looking at 2
degrees. You’re just looking at cells.
You’re looking at two days have passed.
This is Monday, still in the morning; this
is the 20th of September. So there are
two days.
Here you have the building of the Throat. It’s one of the things to grasp about the
Design Crystal, how deep its connection is to the thyroid system. One of the things
that all of you can do as part of your own process in this, and it is very important, by
the way, that for every step that we take along the way, that if you have the time
and the inclination, really look into these things—the thyroid system, the whole
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

51
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
adrenal gland system, particularly if you’re not familiar with human biology. It is one
of those things to just Google it and get some background information so you have
some depth with it.
It’s very important to see that no matter where we’re going to go in the bodygraph,
and no matter what level of understanding we’re going to have, that it truly does
come back down to the Throat. It comes down to the thyroid and the incredible
relationship between the thyroid system and the Design Crystal.
Design Crystal Creates without the Personality
The other thing, this vehicle and everything that this vehicle can potentially do,
every aspect of this vehicle, every center, every gate, every channel, every circuit,
every biological function, all of it is being created by the Design Crystal without the
presence of the Personality.
It’s so important to understand the limitation of the Personality for us in our work.
This is where we get caught up in the not-self illusionary realm where the passenger
is always getting in the way, and to understand that the passenger has absolutely no
connection to this. When we’re dealing with infrastructure, when we’re dealing with
the vehicle we’re going to be given, that we’re going to sit in as the passenger, we
are totally helpless and incompetent, which is why I love to wear that hat. People
think it’s about the total being. It isn’t; it’s about the passenger. The passenger is
helpless and incompetent.
Let’s think about something else. We talked last time, because we’ve been through
these very early stages, so I’m just going to touch them briefly here. But in looking
at that and understanding something, that here is the beginning of the process, here
is the building of the Throat. We talked about energy conversion, this path of
manifestation, and the fact that this is something that is deeply inanimate at this
stage. There is no life force yet.
STAGE II: Building the G
So that when we step into the next stage [image below], and here we have
Wednesday; so we have a conception on Saturday, it’s Wednesday, the mother does
not know unless it’s some kind of an unusual, sensitive being that can just grasp it,
the reality is that in most cases there is no awareness of it. But here is the first
beginnings of the life force, because here is the establishment of the G Center and
the establishment of the channel 31/7. We will talk a lot about activations to the 31
and the 7 and what they really mean when we look at them below the surface.
Again, we’ll get to that point.
Here what I really want to point out is that, think about what you’re looking at. We
think about the bodygraph, for example the Throat and the G Center, we think about
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
52
LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
it in the context of the surface, and the quantum differentiation is created by the
Monopole pulling together
the Design and Personality.
So we tend to think because
we have a Personality
activation in the 31st gate
that somehow the
Personality has something to
do with this leadership. The
reality is that the centers,
the channel, this is
established by the Design.
The game, that’s just me
playing, but I like to call it a
game, whatever you want to
call it, the matrix is rigged.
It’s rigged because the
Design creates it and the
Design runs it. Let’s not
forget that. The human
primary Design Crystal is
going to run the vehicle it
builds. Again, if you’re
looking for some kind of
spiritual value out of this
side of the knowledge, this
is where you come to, this deep understanding of the helplessness of the passenger
in this configuration.
STAGE III: The Dis-Embedding of the Monopole
Ok, the next step. I talked about this last time. This is a major step in the process.
This is Stage III [image below], this is 8 degrees, it’s the following Sunday, it’s the
eighth day. There is no expansion in the sense that there are no more centers or
channels. But what is so important here is that this marks the beginning of the life.
That’s something very important for us to understand. This marking of the
beginning of the life is deeply significant.
There’s something else. If you look over to the right, you can see that the data for
the day, it’s very, very gray, so you don’t really see it clearly. But the data for the
moment, this moment of the staging, and remember we’re talking about a very, very
specific marking of a cycle. What we’re marking with in degrees is the movement of
the Sun. So, when we’re talking about Stage III and we’re talking about 8 degrees,
this is the exact movement of the Sun since the moment of conception moving 8
degrees of arc. That takes us to this particular stage.

53
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Beginning of the Potential for Life
When you come to this third stage, you come to the beginning of the potential for
life. This is the dis-embedding of the Monopole. In other words, this is the
separation of the Design Crystal from the Monopole, but you can see again that the
Design Crystal is there in the
Throat and the Monopole goes
down into the G Center.
What is so significant about the
Monopole going into the G Center,
aside from the fact that we
understand it in the mystical sense
that the separation of the Design
and the Monopole is the beginning
of the life process, is that to
understand that the moment that
the Monopole is then locked into its
position in what will eventually be
the sternum in the G Center, that
what you get is the unique
direction and the unique aura of a
living thing. Only when the
Monopole dis-embeds, only when
the Monopole enters into that G
Center, only then do you have the
unique life force that has its own
aura, it has its own direction, and it
has its own illusion of
separateness.
I want you to think about something. It so happens that at Stage III at 8 degrees of
the Sun, on this September day that there were no planets either in the 31st gate or
the 7th gate. But if they were, they would make a difference. This is really the
subject of our investigation today.
STAGE IV: Building the Ajna
Let’s take a look at the next example, and here you’ll see what I mean. This is
Stage IV; this is where we left off last time, the building of the Ajna, the brain, the
separation of the mind/body, the path of wholeness. But what is interesting about
this Stage IV, 16 degrees of the Sun in arc from the point of conception, that what
we’re looking at is we have the Moon in the 7th gate in the 5th line.

LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
For the purposes of today, I’m not
going to get into the Color and the
Tone and the Base, but that’s where
we’re going to go. It is very clear to
me that activations that take place
during the building of the
infrastructure have an unusual
impact on the Design, the ultimate
Design of the vehicle. It is essential
for us to be able to explore that, and
particularly to be able to explore it at
the tonal level.
What I’m interested in is there are
certain aspects of every single one of
the building of the various stages of
this infrastructure that are directly
related to specific inherited genetic
diseases, or inherited dispositions to
this or that, whatever the case may
be. I am certainly not a doctor, so
it’s not like I can rattle off all the
various diseases that relate to the
various endocrine biological associations that we’re going to look at. Obviously, this
is something that we’re going to need that kind of input in the larger drama of what
we’re doing.
The Building of the Form is Set
But it’s clear to me that the Design Crystal has a plan, if I can put it that way. It
has a plan based on the way in which its facet operates in terms of how it filters the
neutrino information. As a Design Crystal it is filtering the capacity to inform the
cellular crystals how to build a specific form. The building of the form is set. It’s not
like some don’t build an Ajna. The building of the form is set. What isn’t set is that
you have a larger movement that’s taking place in which you have imprinting of the
actual structure itself. I’m not talking about the imprinting of Personality
consciousness or the imprinting of Design consciousness; I’m talking about the way
in which the vehicle is changed in the way in which it’s built.
Basically, what it means is that rather than a generalized infrastructure, the moment
that you have an activation here of the 7th gate, what you’re actually creating is a
very, very, very, very limited point. Let me explain that. They have a very common
heart disease, the hardening of the arteries. Basically, what you have is fat, grease,
that is clogging up the artery. Basically what happens with that artery is that it
narrows. And of course, that narrowing can lead to all kinds of problems. It can
lead to it being closed and there is an aneurism, and all kinds of things.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
What I want to give you with this is not necessarily to say it’s unhealthy, by the way,
in this context, but just to give you this sense of the closing off of a structural tunnel
or a structural movement zone. Think about the 31/7 just as infrastructure. In other
words, you have a highway tunnel system that’s being built. Highway in the sense
that Personality will cruise above it and the tunnel for the Design, but just thinking of
it as a kind of movement zone.
It’s building the infrastructure for that, nothing more, nothing less. When you build
that infrastructure it has a certain number of, let’s call it a highway and say it has
lanes. We know there are six lines, so it is a six-lane highway. But we know there’s
more than that. We know that there are six Colors, so there are 36 lanes. And we
know there is more than that, there are six Tones; and we know that there is more
than that, there are five Bases. Think about what happens when you have an
activation in the infrastructure. Think about it. It narrows down to a very, very,
very, very specific, very narrow way of operating. In other words, suddenly you
have this huge, wide highway system that is being focused through one narrow path.
That’s one way of giving you the metaphor, but like all metaphors it can be
misleading. It may be of an enormous advantage to us that these activations take
place. In other words, it is a very specific honing of the infrastructure. It may, in
fact, be detrimental to us. I don’t know. Oh, it’s a joy, you see, to be a knower
because when you don’t know you just don’t know. It’s something to be found out.
We cannot do that without research, and we cannot do that without valid data, and
we cannot do that without children who have problems after birth whose data we can
look at so that we can begin to compare and measure. What we’re going to be able
to do is to see what the fixing actually fixes to. It would be a joy if all of us could
have access to our conception data. It would be a joy if this was something that was
really available because this is extraordinary knowledge. And we need to understand
how it works.
I’m convinced, for example, that when you get to individual channels and you get to
activations that take place from the outside on those individual channels during the
infrastructure building, I’m convinced that there is a mutation in the vehicle itself.
Where that mutation is going, whether it is a positive or negative, it’s all duality after
all, it’s a duality movie. Wherever we’re going to look we’re going to see ‘this’ and
‘that.’
But this is the beginning of understanding something about these vehicles of ours.
It’s not so simple that you sit there and you look at your bodygraph. I’m trying to
teach you at a totally different level. If you’re looking at the bodygraph you’re just
looking at the way the illusion works. So, you’re looking at the way in which the
Design aspects and the Personality aspects, which are imprints, the way those
imprints are operating in the infrastructure. After all, you don’t take the Design data
until the vehicle has been built.

LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
The Completion of the Design Crystal’s Work
That moment 88 degrees of the Sun before birth, when the Personality comes in,
that’s the date for the completion of the Design Crystal’s work. What you’re looking
at on the surface is you’re looking at the way in which the specific imprints for
differentiation work. But you’re not looking at the infrastructure. You’re not. You’re
not looking at the vehicle that was there in the womb at that moment when its
Personality consciousness arrived. It’s that vehicle that we’re talking about. This is
the vehicle that you’re operating in. And the Design imprints, and the Personality
imprints are operating through the structure that was build in these first 88 degrees.
So, this is essential knowledge for us. This is going to give us an extraordinarily
deep understanding of the way in which the vehicle is built and the way in which
centers optimally align to each other. If you look to the upper left where you see the
mother’s data, forget about her data or that it is the mother, you’re looking at a
specific configuration of channels that, like in a kind of a cycle, each center being
created, each channel going along, and then you have this matrix. Of course, all the
other channels are missing.
It’s something to understand about the basic relationship between centers that they
have a primary channel. They all do. The other channels between the Throat and
the G will emerge. But they’re all going to be, in a way, in a sense, not so much
secondary to, but very different from these primary channels. And we’re going to
see that dilemmas in these primary channels matched by the way in which it
operates on the surface, we’re really going to see the way these problems can
emerge very, very powerfully.
STAGE V: Building the Heart, Starting a New Cycle
Let me not get sidetracked here because I find all of this rather exciting stuff. Let
me get you to where we haven’t been before. Here we’re dealing with Stage V
[image below]. You can tell something immediately about Stage V. We went 2
degrees, 4 degrees, 8 degrees, 16 and now we’re 18. The thing to recognize about
Stage V is that it’s actually starting a new cycle. The primary cycle, the very first
cycle, the thing that creates the potential for life is over. Now, it’s about whether or
not this life, the form, can actually be built.
In other words, when you’re looking at the Ajna/Throat/G configuration, that you see
in Stage IV at 16 degrees, to get to that point is the establishment of the potential of
an individual life. But it isn’t the establishment of a human yet, at all. There is a
great deal of work, in that sense, to be done. And again, the work is being done by
the Design Crystal. It’s the thing that’s so astonishing, to understand this is the
Design Crystal fulfilling its true purpose. We do not see the Design Crystal’s true

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
purpose when we look at it as an imprint in the quantum on the surface. We don’t.
But here, this is the Design Crystal’s realm. This is what it does best.
Think about the mutation that’s coming. That mutation, the evidence is here in this
construct. It’s here in the vehicle. It’s not a mutation that’s taking place in the
illusion on the surface, it can’t be. It’s a mutation of the Solar Plexus system. The
Solar Plexus is enormously complex. It’s taking place in the infrastructure itself.
The Personality, like all Personalities, when it enters into the Rave vehicles it’s going
to be just as surprised that it has arrived. It’s the vehicle; it’s all about the vehicle.
So, Stage V is the building of the Heart. When you’re looking at the G Center you’re
looking at the liver. It’s so clear to me that this is one of those very, very special
organs in the human body. It’s almost mystical for me. It’s one of the reasons why
I consider the abuse of alcohol to be
the least spiritual of all acts. It’s so
astonishing that for so long on this
planet in terms of the eras of
civilization, the last 5 or 6,000
years, that alcohol became deeply
associated with religious rites, to
this day, sacraments that are still
alcohol. The fact of the matter is
that alcohol is devastating to the
liver. The liver is, in fact, the
concretized spirit of the self. Give
your liver a hug, will you? It’s a
nice thing to do.
Anyway, aside from my liver
speeches, the Heart Center, here
you’re dealing with the power, if you
will. You can see that this step is a
step of initiation. In other words,
this building of the Heart Center is a
true initiation because it establishes
something that is extraordinarily
unique: Ego, willpower. More than just willpower is the power to fight for one’s
survival at the deepest possible level. At the deepest possible level. Everything
about the success of our immune system is something that can be seen in this stage.
It is clear to me that activations to the 25 or the 51 at Stage V are going to be very,
very significant in their impact.
The Motor of Competition/The Theme of Survival
The keynoting here is The Motor of Competition and The Theme of Survival. But it’s
something else. It’s heat. This is something that’s so interesting. We are mutative
because we are hot. It is one of the things that is so interesting about us. Most of

LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
us would be very uncomfortable living in a world that had our body temperature.
The reality is that we’re hot creatures. And this warmness is something that has to
be maintained; obviously, the competition that comes into this.
The other thing is that what you’re seeing here is the capacity of the infrastructure,
the capacity within the infrastructure to develop resources of power. The building of
the Heart is developing these resources of power. It will lead to the whole T cell
immune system warriors. It will lead to the capacity of the vehicle to defend itself.
Remember, we’re talking about cells now. Yes, it’s very tiny, it would look kind of—
I’m sure you’ll get to see some nice illustrations of it. Take a look, by the way, it
really is something to see photographs of the various stages of the beginnings of
pregnancy and to look at it through the first 88 degrees and match it to this
knowledge. It’s an extraordinary experience. It really is. It’s something that’s
fascinating.
By the way, there is a wonderful book, The Design of Pregnancy, which is available.
Unfortunately, right now it’s still available only in German. It also has footnotes
from Andrea, so it’s really a perfect opportunity to get some deeper insights from her
when she does the workshop. But there is a translation in English that has been
going on for quite awhile and hopefully not too long before that’s available, because
it’s interesting material. [Note: the English version of The Design of Pregnancy book is now
available in the Jovian Archive online store.]
It is not dealing with the material in the way I’m dealing with it with you now,
because I’m really looking at another level of this. I’m really trying to get across
that one of the things that we’re going to do at the very beginning of our Color work
is rather than relate our Color work to the bodygraph as a whole, that we will do our
Color work in association to the stages of conception in these first ten stages. It will
give us an opportunity to understand at the deepest possible level, not simply the
way the infrastructure is built, but again, these variations that are going to emerge
through the imprinting.
You can see, for example, here in Stage V that there is no activation to the 25 or the
51. If we were to take the road example as an infrastructure, all kinds of potential is
available there. For example, let me give you something to think about. I want to
go back a step for a second where we had this activation. Think about it in this way.
Let us say that what was possible with this imprint is that the very narrowing of the
gateway into the 7 may predispose that 7 to not be open to anything other than
exactly the right resonance or harmony from the 31.
Questions That Need to be Explored
As an example, one of the things that needs to be explored is that we have to begin
to understand these activations that change the way in which the infrastructure
works, to be able to look at these activations and to begin to understand them. So
here in this case, this is going to be a standard infrastructure, it’s going to be a
standard roadway, so all the possibilities, in a sense, are there.

59
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Are we going to discover that activations, for example, cause an impact in the way
ultimately that the person is imprinted? Will it mean that there won’t be an imprint
there when it gets to the surface? There are all these things that we need to look at
and explore, and we can’t do that without data. I don’t have enough. I think I have
five conceptions that I’ve worked with and still have on file. That certainly isn’t
enough to do any kind of comment about the relationship between what we get to
see at the infrastructure level, and what ultimately we get to see when the vehicle
emerges.
It’s the same thing with parental imprinting. That is the imprinting of the mother.
Now, the mother doesn’t imprint, but she conditions. So, there is a tendency in the
vehicle, and again this is something that we’re going to have to look at carefully,
because it is a tendency in the vehicle to be drawn to forces that are not necessarily
healthy to them as a result of the conditioning.
STAGE VI: Building the Spleen, Channel 44/26
Let’s move on here because we have
quite a few of them. Here we’re
looking at Stage VI. In looking at
Stage VI this is going to be one of the
most—I am absolutely fascinated by
this channel. Truly, I’m just fascinated
by it. Many of you know my concerns
about avian influenza and the fact that
from the time that Pluto entered into
the 26th gate that it was clear to me
there was going to be a lasting impact
on birds and fish and reptiles. Again,
to keep in mind that Pluto really is the
master of this age. It is Pluto that
began the nine-centered process in
1781; it is Pluto that will close this
process in 2027, and Pluto going from
41st gate to 41st gate, the initiating
codon. So, Pluto, for me, entering into
the 26th gate was something that was
going to have an obvious impact.
As a matter of fact, my first impression, because I have been looking at these things
for years, that it was simply going to impact the food chain because that’s what
seemed obvious to me. I had already seen the impact of what happened, for
example, with Neptune in the 19th gate and the 49th gate where there were all of
these mammalian things that were showing up; the Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease, the
various forms of scabies, the disease in pigs; obviously, the avian flu and the fact

60
LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
that it has had an impact, in the sense that tens of millions of birds are being
destroyed.
The 44th gate on the surface, when we talk about the fears of the Spleen, this is the
fear of the past. It’s a fear of the past that runs very deep because this is a reptilian
gate. What I mean by that is that it’s a fish and fowl gate as well, but it really is a
cold-blooded gate; whereas, the 26th gate as we have seen the building that takes
place in the 5th stage is the building of the heat engine.
Something else to think about for example, if there had been an activation in the
building of the Heart Center, would that have been a limitation on the mutative
potential of the person, as an example? Would it have closed off other areas? Or, in
fact, does the imprinting bring out a specific mutative quality that makes their
vehicle different?
Here you can see in this aspect that we have an activation that is not in the channel,
that is, it’s not in the 44/26, but is part of the configuration. Again, this will be
something that is adjectival that we will have to look at going down to, particularly
Tone. Because remember Tone is going to take us into the biology and it’s going to
take us into the sensory system and it’s going to give us the necessary alignments to
understand at a very deep level what is actually going on in the infrastructure.
Building of the Immune System
But the 44/26 is the building of the immune system. Obviously, when it comes to
looking at immune system dilemmas and immune system protection and the
strength of the immune system in terms of the infrastructure, what you’re born with,
this is where we are going to see it. Obviously, it’s going to be very, very important
for us to track what the variations are.
For example, what happens when somebody has the whole thing defined? I can
remember a whole period where we had this channel defined. Obviously, there were
women who were going through their conception stages at that time. And obviously,
there were all of these infants whose vehicles were being conditioned by this. Again,
it opens up so much speculation. I don’t, because it’s my gift, I can take this and
start extrapolating and I’d rather stay just with the framework because it leads in so
many directions to begin to see that we have a map way of understanding the basic
health quality of a vehicle. For me it’s clear that when we investigate the chains as
they relate to the building of the infrastructure, it’s going to give us the key in many
ways to understanding what actually goes wrong in the illusion. And this is what I
want to get at.
Remember, the Design does not want there to be the Earth in the 51st gate, if I can
put it that way. In other words, it’s not part of the Design’s plan that there’s going
to be an activation. The Design is just building a form. So, these activations that
take place, the fact that they’re changing the basic infrastructure, does that impact
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

61
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
on the way in which the Design operates in terms of the way it tries to run the
vehicle’s life? These are questions that we really need to answer.
STAGE VII: Building the Root
Here we come to Stage VII, and Stage VII is 24 degrees. So you’re talking about
somewhere around 23 or 24 days. Imagine how fast all of this is taking place. What
an incredible thing. We’re talking about 23 or 24 days. It’s a fantastic thing to
realize. There’s also something else to realize. I guess the bodygraph does that.
The bodygraph gives you a sense that the center system is as big as we are. We’ve
got Ajna Centers that are a foot across and point down.
I imagine them as just kind of like energy hubs with sparks flying. I really don’t see
them as concretized shapes, and I certainly don’t see them as being big, because it’s
obvious to me from the very
beginning of my work that the
whole Design fits into a couple
hundred cells. It’s clear to me
that we have to see that this is
just a graphic way to understand
things more than anything else.
But the fact that this
construction, when you think
about how sophisticated we are,
how extraordinary the end result
is of this process, it’s really
amazing how fast this program is
at work.
Stage VII is the building of the
Root. The building of the Root is
interesting because the keynote
here is memory, and it is about
success or failure. We’re dealing
with what we know as the 32/54,
the channel of Transformation.
One of the things that is
interesting is that whenever
you’re looking at a bodygraph in
the illusion, you’re always looking at the energy moving upwards. One of the things
that’s so interesting here in this is that it really is a kind of spiral. In other words, it
spirals down from this trinary configuration of G/Ajna/Throat. It spirals its way
downward.

LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
Competence Given in the Root
So, this movement downward from the Spleen to the Root is a very different thing to
try to imagine. That is, basically, the Root is the thing that gives us our competence.
And it is the grounding force and the deepest grounding force we have for whether
or not we are going to be able to be a success. Basically, what that means is
whether or not the fetus is going to be able to go to term. It’s clear to me that this
is the place where miscarriage, serious problems that will arrest the development of
the fetus or stop the development of the fetus, or whatever the case may be, the
fact is for me this is the place where there can be problems in terms of the
completion of the development process.
It is one thing to be able to establish the ability to be able to defend one’s existence,
in that sense, but unless one is empowered and it is this empowerment of the Root,
and ultimately what we understand in the Root as the adrenal system and what
mystically you can think of as kundalini or the source of it, that we are simply not
going to be able to get the job done without the Root Center.
Everything ultimately from this point onward is almost, in a sense, guaranteed once
the Root is established because the pressure is there. And it is the pressure to
complete the process. One of the things that we understand about the Root Center
when we come to the surface, that when you look at the Root Center it always wants
to get things over with. That is the whole nature of the Root. In other words, if
you’ve got an open Root Center you don’t like being placed under pressure. But
when you are placed under pressure you have to get rid of the pressure as quickly as
possible.
See this in reverse, in understanding that it is this very pressure to complete the
process. This is the competence. The very pressure to complete the process is the
key to moving forward in this stage. You can see we’ve had, of the nine centers in
the graph, we’ve had two sequences of three. And they very much can be seen that
way. The establishment of the individual aura and the establishment of the ability to
defend oneself, to protect oneself, and at the same time to be able to complete the
process, to have the energy necessary to go through and to complete the entire
process.
Potential Conditioning of the Mother
The other thing that I have a feeling about is that this stage and the following stage,
which is its mirror, they’re very much connected to the potential imprinting, or the
potential conditioning of the mother. This transition here, the end of this process
here where there is this ability to go forward is very much dependent on accessing
enough energy from the mother. This is an area where the condition of the mother,
the well-being of the mother, but more than that at the microscopic level, is the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

63
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
fetus able to gain enough access to the mother as an energy source, as a nutrition
source, and so forth and so on.
My concern here, again, is the narrowing of potentials. Does the narrowing of
potentials act as a positive or does that act as a negative? And my assumption is
that it acts as both. In other words, that we’re going to have to deal with the duality
and until we parse it right down to its deepest level, we’re not yet going to be able to
understand what the impact is. Again, here in Stage VII you can see that we have
two activations: again an activation in the 51st gate, again we have here an
activation of Mercury in the 44th gate.
To understand the variations in the
form, this is something that is so
important for us. We’re going to be
able to get there and I think that that’s
going be part of the fun. I have
already started doing, so that I would
be prepared to teach you, I’ve been
doing Color/Tone/Base analysis of the
conception charts that I worked with.
It’s inspiring. It’s also a cornucopia, or
maybe a Pandora’s Box, because it’s an
enormous amount of information to
filter through. Yet, at the same time
it’s the deepest look that anyone has
ever had into the underlying themes at
work in the building of the vehicle
itself, and in the building of all the
ancillary things that have to take place,
the organic mirrors that emerge as this
configuration is operating, as the
structure is being built. It’s an
extraordinary thing.
So for us, there is a great opportunity. Not simply to see that there is a formula for
building a vehicle, we know that. But we also know something that these vehicles
are different from each other when they come out of the womb. And they’re
different from each other in many, many ways; physically, the physical side, just the
infrastructure side. So here we’re going to begin to understand not only the
template, but the way in which the template is altered through imprinting.
SATGE VIII: Building the Solar Plexus
Here we have Stage VIII, 32 degrees of the Sun. For me this is one of the real keys
in understanding. For example, this is a child that has been diagnosed as autistic.
You can see that the channel that is at work here in Stage VIII is the channel 19/49.
Of course, it’s been the subject of many, many, many of my discussions about the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

64
LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
coming of the Rave children, 2027. But mostly about the things I’ve talked about in
terms of autism, prostate cancer, the kind of dilemmas that have arisen out of the
arising of this mutation. Here is an example that both the Uranus and the South
Node in the 19th gate activating the 19th gate, activating this channel when the
channel was being initiated.
My immediate feeling about that was that there obviously was something, that in the
building of the infrastructure, this is where the dilemma took place. Now, it’s
something that has to be shown; over and over again we need to have the evidence
in order to really be able to see these things. But, it’s clear to me that there is a
very strong pattern, generationally, because of course the 19th gate, a whole
generation of people were deeply impacted by the outer planets and their effect on
the 19th gate, all kinds of children, whole grouping of children that came into the
world with activations during this stage that would have brought the 19th gate into
effect.
So, it’s very important to discern, does it, in fact, lead to problems in the way in
which the neural system develops? Because you can see here that this is all about
the building of the Solar Plexus so it has to do with the nervous system, the
incredible amount of activity, neural
activity that is there in the Solar
Plexus. It’s obvious to me that
because the 49th gate is Histidine,
the Histidine codon and its
relationship to the 55th gate that
there is a change taking place at
the infrastructure level in what the
19 and the 49 do in relationship to
each other.
The other thing that deeply
concerns me is that one of the
things that we see about the
Voice’s description of the form
principle as we move towards 2027,
is that when you look at Rave
children there is a break between
the 19 and the 49. In other words,
that channel no longer will function
in those that are born with a
mutated Solar Plexus. From that
perspective, when I look at these
kinds of configurations, for example this child, it seems to me that it may be an
indicator, in that sense. We may be able to map, if we have enough conception
data, we could potentially map whether children have the potential to be born as
Raves or not. All of that is something that is going to be visible, and it’s going to be
visible here in this stage. So this stage has enormous importance.

65
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Length of Time to Establish This Stage
When we’re looking at the building, you can see that if we move from this stage to
the next stage and, just for a moment, because I will go back, you can see that
Stage IX is 64 degrees. Think about that. Ok, let’s go back. When we go back here
to Stage VIII [previous page] and this is at 32 degrees. So there is this enormous,
and when I say enormous I’m just saying relative to what we have seen in the
developmental process, how long it takes, this stage, to really be established. It
takes a long time.
In other words, this is something that is compared to so many other areas in the
way in which this whole form is being built, this is one where you’ve got literally a
month where this stage is the dominant
stage. It also means a month where there
can be all kinds of activity in terms of
imprinting. This is at the point, and this is
the way I would do the calculation, but it
means that there is a lot of conditioning
that will go on as well.
This is something of real interest. Here
again, is an example where the thing is
clouded because the mother, and you can
see in the mother’s design in the upper
left, the mother also has the 19th gate both
in the Personality and the Design. So the
mother was already conditioning the child
very strongly in the 19th gate, plus the
activations were there.
Again, perhaps what we’re looking at is the
way in which the mutation takes place. In other words, the activations taking place
either in the 19 or the 49. Or, perhaps, what we’re really looking at is the influence
of a specific generation, in that sense, on the way in which that function between the
Root and the Solar Plexus system is going to operate.
The Need for Research
But again, we need to have enough information. The only thing that I can rely on is
that somehow we can pull that together in terms of our clients, people that we know,
analysts that you know that you can ask to keep their eye open for these situations.
It’s a very, very important one for us. If we manage to get together a couple of
hundred conception charts, we can actually begin to look realistically at statistical
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

66
LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
comparisons that will tell us a lot, but we need to have the numbers in order to be
able to take what I’m going to give you as theoretical knowledge.
After all, this is theoretical. The only way we’re going to be able to see it, is that
we’re going to need to investigate it, and we’re going to need to investigate it
through numbers. We’re going to need to see the conceptions, we’re going to need
to know whether the pregnancy was viable and that we need to see if it was viable,
the Design of the child. In that way, because one of the things that I would be
interested in developing over the next three years of this program are software
applications that are specifically associated to what we’re looking for and what we
need.
Jovian’s programmer, Asi Farran, and I have already been discussing developing a
Human Design research spider. Basically it will be a software program that you can
dump in a whole bunch of charts and say, how many of them have the 17, 5-4-3-1.
Line, Color, Tone, Base are those numbers in the series. It’s going to be very
important for us to go beyond theory because theory is only going to leave us with
an open duality that we need to explore. And the only way we can explore that is
through data. So, I really put as much pressure as I can on you out there to see
what you can do to pull together conception data, because it certainly would be
something that would be very, very useful for us.
A Conception Road Map
So, this theme in Stage VIII is one that really is of extraordinary importance. I think
that it really says so much about the changes that are taking place, how we can
begin to see that changes in the infrastructure are going to have impact on the
surface. It’s not like you can say to somebody, “Look, don’t conceive right now
because I know that in four weeks that you’re going to have a bad transit to the
infrastructure of the child and it’s going to lead to whatever.” It’s clear to me that
that is the potential.
It is also clear to me, and I don’t wish to sound science fiction, but it is obvious to
me given the cycle change that is coming, that the fertility of humanity is something
that is really going to crash. It’s obvious to me that the various techniques that we
have been developing for the last several decades, beginning with in vitro to all kinds
of other techniques to try to create viable pregnancies, that it’s clear that we’re
going to be doing a lot of engineering. If we’re going to be doing a lot of
engineering, conception in a test tube is something that can be controlled to the
millisecond. It really is something to keep in mind that being able to see this data in
this way means that we can have a conception road map, and that, in and of itself, is
fascinating. Aside from the fact that the very thought of that brings out all kinds of
things both nice and not nice about the potential of that kind of information.
But nonetheless, what we are looking at is that by being able to dig into the way in
which the infrastructure is built, that we’re going to come up with basic maps. So
that the moment that we put in conception data into a conception program, we’re
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

67
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
going to automatically be able to see what’s coming down the line. My assumption is
not to look at all of these activations as a problem, but to see that certain
disharmonies from the Tone level to this structural level, I think that there are
certain disharmonies that will certainly with time and investigation, prove to be
things that bring about problems in the eventual birth of the eventual form,
whatever it happens to be.
But it’s also clear to me that the activations themselves are instruments of keeping
our genetic viability going. In other words, that we don’t all have the same
infrastructure, that there are variations in the infrastructure and variations that are
not just provided by the conditioning, which is what the mother brings. The mother
brings the variation of the initial conditioning to the life form. But that there are
these unique imprints that take place in the basic infrastructure, is also something
that leads me to believe that this is the thing that keeps us genetically viable, in that
there are fundamental differences in the way in which the whole form principle
operates as a human being.
STAGE IX: Building the Sacral
This leads us to Stage IX, and you can see again this is 64 degrees of the Sun. This
is the building of the Sacral. The best way to describe this is—it’s hard to find the
words for it. You see, I’m deeply in
awe with the power of the Sacral as
it emerges on the mundane plane,
the illusion plane. It is clear to me
that the Sacral is in many ways a
completion process for the
development of the infrastructure.
It’s a completion process in the
sense that it brings the capacity for
replication. That very capacity for
replication, the thing ultimately that
we see as our fertility, that this
gives the life force itself fertility. At
the deepest level I see that as a
form of creativity. In other words,
it is a deep creative resource as a
life force.
It is the primary motor in the sense
that it is the Sacral Center that
makes the illusion happen. It
makes it happen. It is the Sacral
Center that is the perfect
attunement to the life itself; in other words, this response mechanism. It’s also
important to see that because response strategies, and you can see it written there

LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
in the keynotes, all of our vehicles, funny thing to say, but it’s true, all of our
vehicles are designed to respond. Some just respond better than others in the sense
that some people in the illusion have defined Sacrals and other people don’t. But the
fact of the matter is that to be human is to be designed to respond.
It tells you that anything on the surface that’s not Sacral is not truly participating in
the life force. They’re not. It’s one of my jokes about myself and Projectors and
Reflectors that we live off of the sacral world. And you can see that it is a sacral
world. We are all given machines that are designed to respond. In essence we all
get to understand that. It doesn’t mater what type you are, every type has to wait.
I’m a Manifestor but it doesn’t mean that I just manifest. I manifest when it
happens. When it isn’t happening, I guess you could call it waiting. Whatever you
want to call these things, it’s built into us. And this really is the extraordinary
capacity. Really extraordinary capacity.
The other thing is that the moment that you have the Sacral, and you can see the
channel that builds the Sacral. This is one of my things about trying to understand
how incredible the 6th gate is, because it’s the 6th gate is really an incredible gate. It
is the 6th gate that is the source of all of the waves. It’s the 6th gate that actually
creates, in that sense, the Sacral Center, gives the Sacral Center its life. The whole
genetic imperative is built in here. In other words, this is where the illusion trap is
built. This is where the vehicle that’s designed to be fertile is then designed to seek
out difference in order to maintain the uniqueness of the form. And all of that is built
in.
So, one of the things that you can really understand about our sexuality, in a way, is
that our sexuality is our deepest connection to duality. If that sounds obvious, it’s
also very profound. The Design itself designs itself, setting itself up for what the
quantum is going to be, setting itself up not simply for the duality of male/female
that you get on the surface, but the inner duality. This is not a complete process yet
until the Personality takes its place within the vehicle. And yet, the vehicle prepares
for that; prepares for duality.
This is a very important place. And again, what is the impact of variations that take
place? What is the impact of these ancillary activations, the 31.5, the 19.6 that are
there? This is one of the things that we’re going to explore. And we’re going to take
a look at a mapping of the Color and the Tone and the Base chains for all of the
activations and begin to see the patterns that are established in the building of a
unique infrastructure.
STAGE X: Building the Head
Finally we come to Stage X [image next page]. You can see that two things happen
in Stage X. They’re interesting. The first one and the essential one, in a way, is the
15/5. What makes the 15/5 interesting is that—and you’ll notice that, in essence,
it’s the last thing. It completes this spiral. Have you watched this spiral as it twists
down through the G to the Heart and then over to the Spleen and down to the Root
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

69
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
and up to the Solar Plexus and back
across to the Sacral and then
completing it, completing that spiral
and going from the 5 to the 15.
One of the things about the 5/15
that everyone in Design is taught is
that it is the universal life force.
Wherever you go down to the
cellular level with the 15/5 and the
hanging 3 as its cross-cellular,
cross-specieal function, that
everything that you’re looking at in
life is rooted in this 15/5, this
channel of rhythm, this channel of
being in the flow.
The Theme of Time
So, this links this form to the world
it’s going to enter into. And I think
that that is fascinating. It’s this
theme of time. It’s one of the more
interesting aspects of the development of the fetus in these first 88 degrees is that
it’s this finishing touch, if you will. This finishing touch says, “Look, excuse me, but
you’re not going to be alone out there.” This is preparing the vehicle not to be alone
out there. It’s preparing the vehicle to be in the world and to be in the world of
other creatures, others things, and to be in the world of time. Now, that is
something interesting because this time mechanism is connected to the sudden
appearance of the Head Center.
Suddenly, the Head Center is there and you’ll notice something, there are no
channels between the Head Center going downward to the Ajna. This is the setting
up of what in terms of the biology is the readiness of the neo-cortex, or the proto
neo-cortex, at this term in the development of the fetus to be able to open up that
passenger’s door and invite the Personality in.
One of the things to think about is that at a biological level this is about initiating the
pineal. One of the things that is interesting for me is that life span. For me the
vehicle is not human until it’s endowed with its Personality. That’s the moment that
it has its humanness. That’s also the moment that the pineal gland is initiated. And
it’s also the moment that the production of serotonin is initiated. Serotonin is so
important to us, because serotonin literally marks out the potential of the life span of
the vehicle.
So, one of the things about the 15/5, it’s not simply about the abstract concept that
the vehicle is being prepared to be in a realm of time. What it’s really being
prepared for is a realm of deterioration. That’s what time represents to all forms,
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

70
LESSON THREE: The Pre-Personality Vehicle
regardless of whether they’re animate or inanimate; time can be represented by
deterioration. The coroner looks at a corpse that’s three days old and it will tell you
how much time has passed. It’ll just look at it and it’ll know through the
deterioration. And whether you’re a geologist looking at the side of a mountain that
has been slowly eroded, whatever the case may be.
So, this is a theme of entering into the field of, or the pathway of deterioration, and
at the same time this is a path that has a time span on it. In other words, it’s like
measuring your journeys by how much fuel you buy at the gasoline station. In other
words, I need 110 liters to get to where I’m going. Basically what this sets up here
is the production that we’re going to give you in a life time. And that production that
we’re going to give you in a lifetime, this is the ride that you get.
Don’t Mess with Serotonin
It’s why I have expressed over and over again my concern about people who are
using serotonin derivatives or serotonin therapies or people that want to increase
your serotonin or reduce your serotonin. Don’t mess with your serotonin is my
advice. It’s like if you want to get to that place that takes 110 liters, don’t decide to
give 20 away. It just isn’t going to do a lot of good. And adding more, the vehicle is
not designed for it. It’s one of the things about terminality is that it’s one of my
standing mystical jokes is that if there was a channel between the Ego and the
Sacral, a direct channel, we would be immortal, but there isn’t. It’s not built that
way. Our Design Crystals do not build a channel there. We are designed to be
temporary.
No matter how sophisticated we get at aligning the vehicle, my goal when I think
about old age is that the form maintains its integrity. I hope that my brain will, but
it’s the form maintaining its integrity. The ideal for us is to die with healthy bodies.
It’s true, because that’s in fact the way it can simply be. The reality is that this
vehicle is designed to operate until it stops and it has a set time to stop. It doesn’t
mean that that deterioration on the way to that stop mark has to be something so
terrible and painful and uncomfortable. It doesn’t. One of the answers to how that
works, not about finding immortality or all of these things that make no sense when
you’re talking about our form, but talking about the possibilities of how the form can
be maintained as a healthy form regardless of how long it’s moved through the
resistance field. This is something that is here.
The other thing, by the way, and again an interesting thing, is the relationship
between the Monopole going into the G and here the establishment of the auric life.
One of the things that’s interesting about this is that when you’re dealing with the G
Center, the 15th gate has a very unusual capacity. That is, it is more magnetic, in a
sense, in terms of from the Monopole, than any of the other G Center gates. Of
course, on the surface this is the love of humanity and so forth and so on.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Need to Reduce Resistance
It’s something to understand that the moment that you have the 15th gate there,
that auric life is about how good your aura is going to be at helping you cut down on
resistance in your life. And of course, this is one of my main themes in teaching
anyone about what it is to operate correctly, is that if you cannot reduce the
resistance, then you cannot operate correctly. There is an aerodynamic way for us
to move through life. But even something that is aerodynamic will deal with limited
resistance problems.
It’s not that we don’t age, our skin won’t wrinkle, or whatever the case may be. But
there is a fundamental integrity of the vehicle that once we understand the way in
which it operates, then it’s clear that there are ways in moving to the Design, in the
way in which it operates in the illusion, that we can provide therapies, that we can
provide remedies that are going to help the vehicle align itself to its true structure,
or its true infrastructure.

Lesson Four
88 Degrees and the Sacred Marriage
Our basic theme for tonight, because it’s an important one, and that is the
understanding of the limitation of the Design Crystal. It’s something to think about.
Perhaps the most fascinating numbers in Human Design are simply 88. For me
they’re magical, this slightly off, where does it come from, what is this? This 88
degrees of the Sun and we can see 88 degrees of the Sun is a binary. The 88
degrees in from the beginning and the 88 degrees back from the birth.
Design Crystal is Complete/Personality Enters the Vehicle
These 88 degrees are very special, but most of the time we don’t really isolate them
for a moment and think about it for a second. Think about this calculation, what
does it actually mean, that moment, 88 degrees of the Sun before birth? That’s the
moment that the Design Crystal is complete. Its process, in the sense of its
developmental process, the way in which it’s going to operate throughout what
ultimately will be the entire life, that’s the moment that that process comes to an
end.
It is a deeply significant moment. It is a lock on the limitation of what that Design is
going to be. More than that, it represents a moment of, like the magic of the Big
Bang, like the magic of singularity, it represents one of these extraordinary
moments. That is, the exact moment that the Design Crystal has completed its
process, its developmental structural process at that same milli, milli, milli,
millisecond, whatever that may be, that’s the moment of the Personality coming into
the vehicle. That is the very, very, very, very last moment that the Design Crystal
will function purely.
Even in saying “purely,” and you will hopefully get to see all of that in terms of the
illustrations, there are enormous conditioning forces that impinge on that Design,
and the way in which that Design is going to have tendencies. Those tendencies are
very interesting, and they are something that is rooted in the conditioning of the
mother.
But I want to stay with this spectacular moment, because that’s what it is. When I
look at the Design and I realize that its process is complete at that moment, 88
degrees retrograde of the Sun at birth, it also means something rather odd. The
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

73
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Personality Crystal now has to go through its process. And it has to go through its
process, not alone, not in the purity of what it is to be a Personality Crystal, not at
all. One of the deep limitations of the Personality.
But the reality is that from the moment that the Personality comes into the vehicle, it
is caught within the embrace of the potentials of the vehicle that have already been
structured. Over and over again in this, what is for me beginning to be a rather
remarkable process of going through all these programs, over and over again you
can see how Design, how THE Design, how everything is so dependent on
understanding this Design.
You see, the last opportunity that we’re going to have to look at the Design Crystal
as something that is pure and separate from the vehicle, this is this moment, this 88
degrees before the birth. It’s something to see that the Personality Crystal can only
develop an illusion before it is even born. Its entire development takes place within
the illusion of a wholeness.
Ah, the Personality Crystal coming into the vehicle. It was one of the things that so
fascinated me in the very early years and it was at that time, where in the
community that I lived, there were a lot of women who were becoming pregnant, a
lot of it was going on. I was somebody in the kind of job where you hear about
those things and ultimately you do their readings. Whenever I had friends or people
that I knew or I had met who were in the early part of their pregnancy I always
talked to them about the approximate end of the second trimester. Obviously, that’s
dependent on normal birthing, which normally is the case.
But nonetheless, I wanted to put out that information to see what would come back.
What came back was really extraordinary. Some of the stories that I had been told
about the experiences of women, which turned out to have been that moment, are
really something. There was an incredible story. I had met a woman and her young
son. She was pregnant, in the early stages of her pregnancy. She had a reading
from me and I did a reading for her son. At the end of that I explained to her how
the Personality comes into the vehicle approximately three months before the birth,
and just for her to have an openness to that period, or that slice of her process.
I did not see her again for a number of years. But when I did see her, she was
almost overwhelmed in describing to me her story. Her husband was somebody who
suffered from drug abuse and he ended up in an institution where he could be
cleaned out and whatever. It was State run; obviously, he had been arrested or
something, I don’t know what the story was exactly. All I do know was that she was
not permitted to see him for months. She went through a huge process of filing
papers, and this and that. Eventually they finally arranged a visit. She was able to
see him; she was able to be in his aura. As it turned out, that was the exact time
that their child received its Personality Crystal.
You can’t call this scientific verification, but the more of these stories you hear, the
easier it is to understand that this is a particular event. Remember, that this is the
moment that there is this beginning of who is this being; the experience of the
mother as the carrier of this emerging life. Who is this being? What is coming here?

LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
And how interesting it is because the Personality develops over 88 degrees. Think
again about the fundamental duality of this knowledge and of the mechanisms of life.
You can see very clearly that in the first 88 degrees, this is the whole process of the
Design Crystal. And it is all about the ability of the Design Crystal to be able to
establish a proper format for consciousness and form.
The Emerging Bodygraph
Yet, you get to the other 88 degrees, the 88 degrees that marks our charts, and you
get into this process that is dedicated to the development of the Personality; but, the
Personality isn’t fully developed until birth. In other words, it is going to go through
a structural process. The only difference is that because there is a Design, and now
with the Personality there is no longer simply a Design Crystal. There is, in fact, a
bodygraph. There is, in fact, a bodygraph that is a merging of this life. And it is this
illusion.
Again, remember the relationships between what are source data, or source filtering,
which are the crystals themselves, and what happens to their contribution in the
illusion of the maya, or in the quantum of the bodygraph held together by the
Monopole. In other words, the Design Crystal is what we experience as the vehicle,
but it’s not the same thing. The Personality Crystal is what we experience as the
passenger, but it’s not the same thing. Those are the constructs that have emerged
in the whole that’s greater than the sum of its parts. And we know from the simple
evidence of looking at anybody’s Design where you have conscious and unconscious
aspects forming a definition, you know right away that something is emerging in the
bodygraph that didn’t exist in the originals, didn’t exist in the source.
So this moment of 88 degrees is a very, very special moment. It is a magical
moment. And for me it’s magical in the sense that it is part of the way in which the
cosmology of Human Design was expressed to me. In other words, in the larger
story of the larger life from the perspective that I was given by the Voice, that the
Personality of the totality has not arrived yet. In other words, from a cosmic point of
view we are still in a stage where the Design Crystal is operating alone. It is simply
focused on the function of the vehicle, focused on the potential of the vehicle.
So, this moment, 88 degrees, for me is why I would mention it to as many pregnant
women as I encountered because I wanted to have the chance to try to smell
something more extraordinary under the descriptions that I was given. In other
words, to try to extrapolate out of the microcosm to the macrocosmic example,
something extraordinary is going to happen. As an example in the cosmology, the
thing that precedes the Personality Crystal entering into the totality or entering into
the biverse, is that the crystals have to bundle again, which means that the
incarnating process comes to an end. There is a fundamental termination of what we
would call the life process in order for that to be able to take place, so that the
consciousness field itself seems to prepare to receive the larger Personality Crystal
without the dilemma of the form.

75
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
When I try to relate that to this moment within the fetus it’s very difficult. What
actually happens biologically at this moment? For me, there must be something that
is quite extraordinary that is going to take place in the moment that that happens.
When I say “extraordinary” it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s obviously evident,
because we have learned to see that minor changes in obscure places lead to
extraordinary transformations.
But it is a point for me that is deeply fascinating because it is this potential to
understand a much larger process. And also, something else, there is a certain
trepidation that, and again I’m anthropomorphizing here so I have to be careful,
there is a “concern” that the Design will fail. It’s interesting even to contemplate
that. In other words, I think it’s built into all of us, the fear of the failure of the
vehicle. What we experience as a by-product of that when we get it to the mundane
level, the fear of physical deterioration, the body dying. But the real fear of the
vehicle, if I can describe that, is that it will fail its most important test.
Remember that in order to really understand our program, one must recognize that
the goal of this program is the potential of consciousness in form; this is it. It
doesn’t mean that we are the only evidence of it because we see that the program
itself instills this potential in all of the forms other than inanimate, all of the forms
that exist. It is part of what this experiment is all about. And it’s not even an
experiment; I just use that so that I don’t sound like a spiritual mystic. It is clear to
me that this is the way in which the program operates and that the whole form
principle and everything about the individuation and differentiation of form is
ultimately a test as to how well they can house and represent the potential of self-
reflected consciousness.
The Personality Develops During the 88 Degrees
It must be an extraordinary experience for the Design Crystal in a sense, that when
it meets the Personality Crystal it meets the Personality Crystal in the darkening of
its light after all. It meets it at its most limited and primitive potential, because we
know that the moment that the Personality enters into the vehicle, this is not the
Personality that we’re going to acknowledge at birth. It isn’t. It is a Personality that
is moving towards its readiness. So in moving towards its readiness it’s going to
move from, in essence, not being ready to being ready. That is a journey, and it’s a
journey that takes many, many months.
Everything about the potential in this journey, so much of it is going to be
conditioned by the partnership that emerges the moment that there is this potential
of the developing Personality along with its Design. The moment that there is this
aura that is on its own, an aura that begins to speak, in that sense, to its mother, a
recognition of the beginnings of Personality. More than that is the influence of the
fetus in that final trimester, or in the last 88 degrees, its influence and the power of
its influence on its own mother.

LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
The Personality is Helpless and Incompetent from the Beginning
So there is a lot that is going on. But it’s so important to grasp that the Personality
has to go through a developmental process that it is not in control of. Ahh, don’t we
come to a delicious subject there? Everything that I teach about the Personality is
that it is helpless and incompetent. And there is this assumption that this is some
kind of whatever. And certainly the assumption that it takes place in the vehicle as it
intellectualizes and develops, it’s not true. Helpless and incompetent from the very
beginning because you can see that the Personality Crystal is helpless in the way in
which its developmental process is controlled by the form, and by the potential of the
form.
We saw the last couple of times as we went through the various stages in the first 88
degrees that we began to grasp how significant those developmental stages are
because they set the foundation. They set the foundation through which the
potential of self-reflected consciousness is going to be expressed by a Personality
with this form.
For me, Human Design is the science of differentiation. And to begin to understand
differentiation is, first of all, to see that the vast majority of the responsibility, if I
can use that kind of language, for differentiation is in the Design Crystal. More and
more and more as I grow in this knowledge am I left with the acknowledgment that
it is all form. It is so obviously all form. And that the potential of any Personality is
going to be determined by the potential that it is allowed from the vehicle. It is so
easy to turn off the potential of the Personality. It is, actually, biologically very easy.
And it’s something to understand that the Personality Crystal is so helpless. It is
helpless before it’s born. Helpless. Nothing that it can do, totally overwhelmed by,
first of all, the quantum of its relationship to a very, very powerful and complete
Design Crystal, full force, fully integrated, its vehicle, it built it, it’s running it. It’s
housing the Personality. It’s making it possible for the Personality.
Our study of the Design, this is what makes the difference. This is what will give us
the capacity to go beyond whatever it is that the whole represents. You can already
see that no matter how far you go into the illusion of the quantum, if you go back to
the earliest stages of the development of what it is to be human, all of this is being
controlled by the Design Crystal. All of it.
One of the things that is interesting is our ability to be able to see where the Design
Crystal is able to impact deeply the Personality. And of course that’s going to be
what we see in the quantum when we see these Design Personality electro-
magnetics. This is something that later on I’m going to talk about quite a bit
because it is by far one of the few places where we’re going to see how dilemmas
within the body transfer directly to the Personality. In other words, who you think
you are, the way in which the passenger ultimately operates, is that the passenger
itself is going to demonstrate and be very aware of some kind of problem, some kind
of affliction. Isn’t it interesting how many people don’t know when something is the
matter with them until it gets to a stage where it’s unavoidable? And there are other
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

77
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
people that have a sense of the onset of something long before it is something that
is truly active or very powerful.
Personality Stages are Conditioned by the Design Crystal
This is an example of the relationship that we’ll ultimately be able to see between
the Design and the Personality when we get into bodygraph analysis, this transition.
I think the most fascinating thing for me and I think it was probably very revealing,
the Voice gave me a very, very clear—I had to draw them all—gave me a very clear
layout of the first 88 degrees. It made quite a point of it. That is, I had much more
time in my experience with the Voice looking at the first 88 degrees than I did even
looking at the bodygraph. It was a lot. Then you go to the final 88 degrees and
there’s nothing. I mean nothing. I wasn’t given anything there. There obviously
isn’t anything there and for me that’s something that says that the stages of
development of the Personality are not something that the Personality brings. It
doesn’t.
It is clear to me that because there is no breakdown and no breakdown whatsoever
for the cycle of the Personality, then all of that is being conditioned by the Design.
It’s not only being conditioned by the Design but what we will see is that it’s being
deeply, deeply conditioned by more than simply the Design. It’s being conditioned
by the mother. It’s being conditioned by the quantum that is emerging that is the
child itself. But the Personality, in and of itself, it’s not in charge of any of it.
I really want you to grasp how profoundly limited the Personality is. Wow.
Profoundly. It doesn’t even bring its own check list. “Ok, we’ve got to do this and
this and this; and we have to do this at 2 degrees and this at 4 degrees,” none of
that’s there. So everything about it is being conditioned; everything. And then we
wonder why it’s so difficult to wake up passengers. It’s practically impossible. I
know; I keep on trying. This is why I’m so clear that the only path for the passenger
is intellectual awakening and that those of us involved at this end of the spectrum of
the knowledge can just be concerned with the one thing that really matters, the
form.
Dysfunction in the Design Brings Dysfunction of the Personality
There is something else it says. It says that if the Design is responsible for
programming the development of the Personality, then the Design not functioning
correctly will bring about the dysfunction of the Personality. Oh, that’s something to
really think about. My first perception of the potential of PHS was to be able to
provide very accurate individual—I think it was Martin who said Personal Health
System, it’s a personal health system—and my thoughts on that were that the
physical well-being of the body is something that is so significant and is so
important. But I did not attach that to the actual transformation of the body actually

78
LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
impacting the potential of the Personality. That’s something that I’m beginning to
see is really a potential.
The moment that you grasp, and for me this was a real wooof, the moment that you
grasp that the Personality doesn’t have anything to do with its development, it
doesn’t, then you begin to see, you come out of the womb, you have this potential,
and because of the way in which you’re raised, because of the nature of the world,
because of the lack of awareness, that instantaneously you place your vehicle on a
path of ill health. And not so much ill health in the sense that it has to demonstrate
itself as physical ailments — I’m really speaking of it in the sense that it takes time
for the vehicle to deteriorate, but the vehicle is not operating correctly. If the
vehicle is not operating correctly, and I think now something that’s obvious at this
point is that the first three years out of the womb, the years in which the thymus
gland is designing the immune system, the years in which the neural paths are
expanding in the brain until they reach their limitation, that in those years having the
vehicle not operate correctly is going to impact on the potential of the Personality for
the rest of its life. For the rest of its life.
The First Three Years of Life are Critical
From the moment that the knowledge was given to me, it was so obvious to me that
the great work of Human Design isn’t the work that can be done in my lifetime
because it is my burden, in that sense, to deal with adults. This is the burden of
introducing knowledge. But you see, unless we get to people and we get to their
children young enough, I’m convinced now that these first three years are so
essential because the moment that you grasp this, and it’s so obvious, there’s all this
structural programming for the first 88 and there is nothing there, there is no
inherent structuring for the Personality itself. That’s as profound a thought as
anything. And just to see the consequences of that. The consequences of that are
that the vehicle is going to determine the potential of the Personality, but to a point.
We know at a certain point, around three years of age, we know for example that
neural track growth stops. Not only that, some of it atrophies. Certain things that
opened up that don’t get used simply just turn off in that sense. We know that the
immune system that is literally the one thing that’s going to keep us alive, that its
process is complete at that stage. Obviously, if the vehicle isn’t operating correctly,
the potential of the Personality is going to be deeply limited. So I think that in being
able to align a human being to their Personal Health Standard—I like that Martin—if
that starts early enough in their process, then I think that the ultimate beneficiary is
going to be the passenger.
The Design Crystal Needs to Successfully House the Personality
The one thing that the Design Crystal needs to succeed at is successfully housing the
potential of self-reflected consciousness. It’s entirely its responsibility, and entirely

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
only in the sense that it provides the programming. It is the Monopole that will pull
it all together in the illusion. But it is the Design that provides this deep
programming.
So, when you’re looking at a Design, or you look at your own Design, that moment,
we just tend to look at those two streams of data, even if we’re professional analysts
you’re describing the data and you just do your thing. But rarely do you really see it
by itself in that singularity, in that moment before the Personality Crystal comes.
This is the perfection of its work, after all. And it’s at this moment that it runs its
greatest risk. For example, I wonder if there is a rush of adrenaline in the fetus
when the Personality comes. I have a hunch that something is going on in the Root
system when that happens.
It’s clear to me that this is not—again I’ll anthropomorphize because I think
metaphors help—the Design Crystal only has one lover, that’s the Magnetic
Monopole. And for the Design Crystal, the Personality is going to be an enormous
burden. After all, in the same way that for those of us operating through what we
have access to, which is only the Personality, another of the great jokes of the
programming, then we have this ordeal that we have to go through by living in form
and having to deal with the laws of the form principle, which are not necessarily
pleasant. After all, the Personality, which has in and of itself as a passenger, no
form, but is simply taking a ride to be locked into the form principle, is its own
ordeal.
But in this moment, this wonderful moment, you can see so many profound truths.
And the limitation of the Personality and what it means to heal the body becomes
something very, very different. This healing of the body is also the re-aligning of the
vehicle to its purpose. We talk a lot about the purpose of the Personality, and the
purpose of Personality consciousness. But the vehicle, it too, has a purpose. In the
larger sense in the illusion we see it in the Design profile. But the vehicle’s purpose
is to fulfill the potential of the Personality and there are always conflicts.
Major Conflicts of Nodes of Design and Personality
One of the major conflicts that you get to see is when the Nodes of the Design are in
different gates than the Nodes of the Personality. Remember that Nodes often can
stay in a configuration for four or five months. There are many, many people who
have Nodes that are the same, both Design and Personality. There are people like
me who have different Nodes between Design and Personality. Those different
Nodes between Design and Personality predispose one to have a real problem in
fulfilling the required purpose of the Design.
Remember these Nodes are so revealing from the Personality point of view, from the
perspective of the passenger, the Nodes represent the way in which you see, your
slice of the world, and what you see in others. But the Nodes of the Design are
about seeing the geometry of least resistance, seeing the world in which they can

LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
meet the least resistance as a form principle. When they clash, this is a dilemma for
the Design. And I am convinced that it leads to its own problems.
We need to be ‘Design-ists’
We have to begin to be ‘Design-ists,’ if I can use that terminology. In other words,
for the fulfillment of our purpose it’s a good idea to be in balance within the context
of PHS. That if we are constantly looking only from the Design perspective, if we are
analyzing the vehicle and the way in which it operates in the illusion as a bodygraph,
if we do so from the Design perspective then we’re going to be able to see not only
where the dilemma is and how the dilemma can be dealt with, but more than that,
we’re going to be able to see where the Design can impact the Personality, not
through the perception of the maya as a consciousness, but through the very well-
being of the vehicle being transferable to the Personality. And that’s something.
This period, this interregnum, as the Personality is shaped by the forces closest to it,
it’s being shaped by its Design Crystal, it’s being shaped by the Monopole and its
illusion, it’s being conditioned with tendencies by the mother. And we have this
unusual configuration because we have—wouldn’t it be nice, but it’s a hell of a good
metaphor—we have the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Doesn’t the fetus go
through this wonderful thing? It spends two-thirds in a normal pregnancy of its time
as a trinary crystal consciousness. The single Design Crystal dealing with the Design
of the mother. So you have this trinary crystal form, something that ultimately is
somewhere out in our future. And from that trinary crystal form, from the moment
the Personality vehicle enters in, we have this quaternary, the four of them all
together within this tight aura.
And obviously, we’re dealing with a very unusual conditioning environment. It is this
environment, along with the work of the Design itself, and again where we’re going
to see the impact of the Design in the Personality is if we go back to the first 88
degrees and we see where there are imprints to gates in the activation process and
the developmental process through the stages, when you see the very same gates
emerging and you see them emerging in the bodygraph, then you can see very
clearly this early impact of the Design, and often its impact on the Personality itself,
or what the potential of the Personality is going to be.
Two Kinds of Conditioning
The thing that’s fascinating is that when we finally do our calculation and you do the
calculation of the Personality you’re looking at a final imprint, but you’re also looking
at something that has been completely conditioned to get to that point. Completely.
So, we have two kinds of conditioning that we’re going to be able to see in the
emergence of the final Personality calculation. We’re going to see the influences of
the Design Crystal and its 88 degree program, and we’re going to see the influence
of the tendencies and the conditioning of the mother, and we’re going to be able to
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

81
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
see that in the emergence of the Personality because every single activation that the
Personality has is not its own. It didn’t build it. It was given. It was conditioned
right from the beginning. It’s something so beautiful.
The Form Gives the Personality Its Costume by the Conditioning
I’ve made the joke many times about death, that when the Personality leaves the
vehicle it’s not like you’re going to be able to contact it through séance. Yet, at the
same time there is a frequency to it. It is an existence frequency. At its simplest
level it’s a kind of “I am” mechanism. Every time that the Personality goes in, it’s
given this costume by the form. It’s given this costume by the conditioning. It is
this costume over its pure essence, that through that it gets to experience the
consciousness that the form permits. You can only see with the physical eyeball and
its connection and its rods and the neurons and everything else, you can only see
because of that. And the quality of your seeing is conditioned by the form itself.
Every single aspect of the Personality, think about it. Because it says so much about
what the potential is in being able to heal the form. It’s like the being that’s told it
can be granted any wish. Health is always in that request list, always. And it’s not
the obvious of yes it’s good to be healthy. It’s more than that.
There is a perfection possible in the limitation of the form. After all, every form has
a different potential. There is a limitation in that form that can be fulfilled. This is
where transcendence lies. If the form is perfect for what it is, perfect in its
differentiation, and it operates perfectly in the illusion, it’s going to have an
enormous impact on the way in which the Personality operates.
So, we have to begin to see that everything we’re seeing in terms of the way in
which the Personality works, that to really understand that, not from the point of
view of how the passenger experiences that, that’s Rave Psychology, but to
understand why the passenger has to deal with it, because it’s out of the form
principle. There is something in the form principle, there is something in the way in
which the genes are lined up, there is something in the way the whole thing is
constructed that the outcome is a Personality that will operate in that way. Then we
get back to the basic tenant of the knowledge. That regardless of the illusion that
this is a form domain.
Illustration of the Point 88 Degrees before Birth
This illustration [next page] is the Design of the fetus in its complete process at the
point that it’s just about to enter into the 88 degrees of the Personality’s
development. From the earliest days of Design, from my own earliest beginnings
with the knowledge, everything had to be hand-drawn. I mentioned this many
times, the process of drawing in a graph. And of course, you have to start with the
unconscious because it’s red, because a black will—so, there I am coloring in the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

82
LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
Design first. I guess maybe the first thousand charts that I looked at I had colored
in by hand and I had colored in the Design first.
Every time I would color in that Design I would have this odd sensation. It began
with my own Design. When I look at
my Design I’m a Projector, in that
sense, it’s not a Projector, but
nonetheless just to give you the
idea, the only thing I have defined is
my 43/23 mind. And everything
else is enormously open. It’s very
different from what my quantum
looks like. I would always stop there
and stare at this thing, because
we’re so anxious to get the black in,
to get the whole story together that
we don’t see it.
But we also forget something. That
when we’re looking at that
calculation we have to see that the
Design at the beginning of that 88
degree process is going to be the
same Design at the end of that
process. In other words, when you
go back 88 degrees before the Sun,
that moment, that Design is going to
be there throughout the rest of the
development of the fetus.
Two Kinds of Approaches in the Investigation into the Form Principle
Whenever you put up a chart now, because it is the beginning of our deep
investigation into the form principle, one of the things that is going to be very
important for us are two kinds of approaches. That is, the approach in terms of the
first 88 degrees and their significance as we investigate them through Color, Tone
and Base, and the Design of the vehicle itself, the Design of the vehicle when it’s
complete. In order to be able to see through this configuration what the impact is
going to be, of this form on the development of the Personality, and ultimately what
its relationship is going to be with the Personality. That’s something that is an
incredible journey.
You can already see, as I mentioned to you this was an infant that had problems. If
you look at this Design and you see that the Personality is going to have a form that
is rooted in crisis, we can just put it that way, you’re going to have this very, very
powerful 36.6 polarity that is going to be there and you’re dealing with a 3rd line
profile for the vehicle and we already know what that is. We know that this is highly
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

83
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
mutative, that this is where you have different genetic possibilities that emerge. The
6/3 is what embraces difference as an intimacy.
It’s why we end up with very strange genetic combinations because of the capacity
or the imperative that’s rooted in the 3rd line theme in our reproduction. Here, just
having a 3rd line as the way in which the form is going to work, also tells you about
the kind of conditioning that the early Personality is going to have to deal with.
Obviously, when we go through the analysis, we are only going to go through an
analysis like this in terms of the surface, what I’m showing you now, after we have
worked it up from the very root of that.
The other thing is, what is the connection between the activations that ultimately
represent the finished Design process, what we’re looking at now, and the
activations that took place through the development of the form. In other words, we
have a number of areas that we’re going to explore. And again, the goal of this is
not to be at the surface. So, for each and every one of these activations of the
vehicle, remember what you’re looking at is the possibility of having a physical
framework that will benefit the reflection of consciousness. So, every single one of
those gates can be seen in a different light now. In other words, we’re not simply
looking at those gates the way we understand them in superficial Design analysis,
but to begin to see that each one of these gates represents a form process that is
going to impact the way in which the Personality is going to operate within the form.
Each one of them, at a deep level, is going to be part of this process that determines
how the Personality is going to be costumed when it emerges.
Tone Level: Where the Form Consciousness Potential is Created
So, these gates, when we take them down at every level, because we’re going to
need to look at them in their genetic relationship as codons and what that can mean.
We need to look at them in terms of the Color and to be able to understand the
dynamic of the vehicle in eliminating resistance in its process, we need to look at it
at the Tone to see quite specifically the way in which each of these form aspects
opens up a potential in a sense. Think about that, because it’s not like—every single
gate has the potential to impact us in a sensory way. It’s simply about recognizing
that that’s what Tones are all about, that Tones are a chemical alignment to a certain
way of interacting.
At the Tone level is where you really get to see form consciousness potential being
created. I think that Tones are remarkable. We will have our opportunity to look at
them in great depth because they are the core of understanding the PHS chains, to
be able to understand what the sensory direction is. In understanding that sensory
direction, beginning to get an image that emerges and an image that emerges that
clearly shows us where the potential of realization of the Personality can go. And
then to come back to the physical reality that if the form is not operating correctly,
and the form operating correctly is more than simply operating according to its
authority and strategy at the illusionary level. That’s the surface. And yes, it makes
an enormous difference.

84
LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
But even as the form is operating correctly in the illusion on the surface, the vehicle
itself can still be perfected. Again, there is no such thing as awakening for the
vehicle. There is no such thing. So, it’s very important to see that what we’re
dealing with is the perfection of its differentiation. It’s not the perfection relative to
anything else. It’s not about this body being better than another body. It’s about this
body being the best body it can be. This vehicle being the best vehicle it can be,
operating in the best possible way it can operate. When we begin to examine the
way in which the Design of the vehicle impacts on the Personality, we’re also going
to be able to see the way in which it is moving the Personality to a specific way of
taking in the world.
Tone Makes Us Conscious
If you want to answer the question of what makes us conscious, it is not the gate or
the line or the Color. It is the Tone. It is the Tone itself, all by itself. At a practical
level Color is something that is so helpful to us because it gives us a way in which we
can really see through transference how the body is drawn away from what is best
for it in terms of eliminating resistance and perfecting its process. But, of course,
that’s something very mechanical in terms of simply the alignment of the vehicle to
its correct fractal.
But the moment that you go down to the Tone level, you get to the mystery of life
itself, at least the mystery of life as we know it. Here you’re dealing with the fact
that everything about each of the six Tones is an ingredient of what we know as
consciousness. And of course, these aspects, or these streams of consciousness as
they impact the Color, as they impact these particular gates in this configuration and
the way in which these gates interrelate or connect to, in the illusion, with the
Personality, the way that the Personality is going to operate is being impacted
directly from this lower, if you will, under the line, chemical biological realm.
It’s like Crick saying before he died, he said he wouldn’t be surprised when they find
a gene for free will. We need to move away from thinking about the passenger as an
integral part of the way in which the form principle operates. And simply leave the
passenger to Rave Psychology and realize something, that the perfection of the
vehicle will result in optimal possibilities for the Personality but that is still no
guarantee that the passenger is going to wake up, obviously, no guarantee at all.
The passenger, and you can see this from the discussion in this lesson, the
passenger is totally disconnected from the structural process of the vehicle, the
dynamics of how it is going to operate, and it simply goes along for the ride. It’s not
even “it simply goes along for the ride,” it has no choice but to be caught in the ride.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Neo-cortex Completes Development after Birth
So our work at the vehicle level is deeply significant. It means that not only are we
going to be able to see a way in which we can improve upon the perfection potential
of the vehicle, but there’s going to be a by-product to that. And the by-product to
that is an understanding that is very deep. What is actually going on in those 88
degrees that needs to be shaped by the form? It’s the way of the neo-cortex. The
neo-cortex is so complex that it doesn’t simply take those 88 degrees; it’s going to
take another three years. Another three years in terms of being able to determine
the ultimate working potential of what we call brain.
When the Personality enters into the vehicle, and this is something that we can look
at in fetal development and in the biology and particularly in the way in which the
brain is layered and there are many levels to what we call brain, that the moment
that the Personality comes in, it starts linking into the potential of brain at a very
primitive level first. The so-called reptilian mammalian going through this process,
beginning to filter what is the potential that is laid out for it.
I know I keep stressing this, but I can’t stress it enough. It’s only then that we’re
really going to be able to see the secrets. It is up to the vehicle and what we’re
going to learn is that these 88 degrees, we’re going to have the ability, along with
being able to do analysis in the first
three years, we’re going to have an
ability to see the road map for the
building of the brain. And this, for
me, is something that is deeply
exciting.
The Artists of the Brain
It’s clear to me that in Rave
Psychology that the goal is a
mapping of the way in which the
Personality perceives reality. That
is, the way the Personality
integrates with the illusion. But
that’s a very different road map.
That’s a by-product of the form
principle itself. What we are
looking at is the potential of
understanding not simply what the
first 88 degrees show us, which is
the whole building of the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

86
LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
infrastructure of the vehicle, but we’re going to be able to see the building of that
brain. And the building of the brain is in every single one of those gates that you’re
looking at in this illustration.
It’s the thing that’s so interesting. It’s not so much that they are the builders of the
brain, they are the artist, if you will, that shape and configure it. And each one of
them has a unique way in which they operate and all of them form an orchestration
of the physical plan’s capacity. So much of that can only be discovered through
analyzing these aspects through Tone. Because in analyzing them through Tone
we’re going to begin to see the way in which the Personality is designed to perceive
awareness, and begin to understand the physical mapping of the brain.
It’s always so fascinating for me. At the same time that I began to publicly share
Rave codon mapping, the scientists were rushing to fill out the whole genetic code
and write that out for everyone to see. Here we’re in a position to begin to map out
the way in which the brain is structured and the way in which the vehicle forms the
brain, and not just the brain, but the potential, the nuances of it. This is what
science is doing at the same time, this enormous effort. And every day brings new
information. This enormous effort to map the way in which the brain operates.
Here we’re dealing with something that is very special, and something that is very
unique. The magic is in this drawing. All these years, I don’t know how many times,
millions now, all the beings that have gone through all the charts and over and over
again, they pull up those bodygraphs now, but rarely do they right click and click
Design only, and it’s always been there. At every level of the knowledge in Human
Design there’s always been this open invitation to just look at this Design. It’s really
something special. We’ll look at each and every one of these gates differently when
we analyze them after the birth.
When we’re looking at them at this stage and what their influence is going to be,
what we’re really looking at is their biological positioning. For example, the 6 and
the 36 being in the Solar Plexus as an example, and looking at their tonal quality and
being able to see from the tonal quality what their actual influence is and where that
influence is going to emerge. That’s quite a
journey.
The Mother
I thought how fascinating, here’s a mother
who has her Personality Earth in the 54.4.
This was one of the first cases that I had of
somebody actually hiring me as a
professional to do this analysis. Of course, I
think it was the first actual professional
analysis that I had ever done on a
conception. I thought how remarkable that
you have this mother with this 54.4 with this
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

87
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
deeply mystical 4th line of the 54 to enter into such an enterprise. And obviously,
somebody so deeply concerned about their child.
There are many things that we can look at in the conception data that we have. By
the way, I have received conception data from two people, and I appreciate that.
But please, in order for this to be effective I do need to have more material and it
would really be a valued contribution to our work if you can come up with some
additional conception charts and you can forward them to our office. The more we
have to work with, the easier it’s going to be to be able to see clearly patterns that
emerge. Something that is very important for our theoretical work is to have
legitimate examples and particularly examples in which we have the Designs of the
children and also advantages if we can have the Designs of the children who are over
three years of age as well.
The Importance of the Three Years After
You can tell just from the nature of our conversation tonight that my deepest
concern is for these first three years. It’s so interesting for me; I don’t know so
often where the road leads me as an intellectual explorer of this knowledge. There
are moments of extraordinary clarity
for me. One of them is this
understanding of this dominance of
the form principle and this phase of
88 degrees before the birth, and three
years after the birth that, in fact, one
of the most profound responsibilities
that any mother and father can have
is to be able to provide the right kind
of environment during that period.
It’s interesting. There are many fads
that come and go with the pregnancy
game. People who want to give birth
in water and people who want to give
birth the old way and all of these
various things. There are all kinds of
stuff that float around. But one thing
is clear to me. These people that
everybody thinks it’s odd that they’re
late in their pregnancy and they’re
reading to their belly and they’re
playing music and all of these kinds of things. What’s so obvious to me is that that
is something that is very, very significant. There is this enormous potential for
conditioning.
Remember, this is the joke of the Personality that the moment that it steps into the
vehicle it has surrendered. It doesn’t matter whether ultimately the passenger gets
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
88
LESSON FOUR: 88 Degrees & the Sacred Marriage
that message. But the Personality Crystal is a surrendered aspect in this totality.
And it surrenders to the deepest conceivable conditioning. We’re not talking about
the conditioning that comes through into the being after they emerge and they have
the construct. I’m talking about conditioning before they even come into the world.
The responsibility to a fetus, those 88 degrees, becomes very, very significant that
there is a great deal of impact that can come from recognizing that one can influence
in a very positive sense the development of the fetus. It also says something about
the first three years of the life.
I remember vividly, and it’s something I will carry with me always, the birth of my
youngest child. It was an enormous trauma; it was a trauma for all of us. He was
very premature. Within about 15 minutes of finding out the timing, it was an
emergency caesarean, I immediately did a chart. I was deeply concerned that he
would survive, he was so incredibly tiny, and it was unbelievable. But there was his
Design. There was this incredibly powerful, powerful motor being—three motors to
the spleen—and my first thought was, “Ah, thank the gods because this one is going
to make it.”
It is something to recognize in the magic of what a chart gives us, is that it gives us
the being. And let us not be confused that the child that comes into the world with
an open mind isn’t already an intellectual. It’s just not crafted; it hasn’t matured
and been honed. All the aspects that are there are enormously capable and open.
Positive conditioning in that environment, in that time frame, in those first three
years of the life, the impact on the child is extraordinary; and in saying “the child,” I
mean both its vehicle and its passenger.
This is our deepest responsibility. I think that we’re going to be able to help a lot of
people. But I don’t think any of that measures against the potential of being able to
help millions of children coming into the world to have the best possible advantages
for their self-reflected consciousness. To have vehicles that in their first three years
truly operate correctly. That means that vehicles that are operating according to
their perfection modus, whatever that happens to be. We will look, as we did in PHS
last year, we will look at the way in which Color can help us align the parents to what
the child needs for nurturing in order that that vehicle can operate correctly.
PHS is in the Perfection of Form Business
It’s very beautiful. But it begins with a very, very deep, deep recognition. You have
to see it; you have to feel it inside yourself. You have to understand this incredible
limitation on the Personality and how important, therefore, our work is, to be able to
heal the form, to be able to perfect the form. That’s in my Design. It is something
that enriches all life, is the perfection of form. And all of us are in the perfection of
form business. It will make an enormous difference. But we need people who are
young, people who are fertile, people who are beginning their families; we need to
be able to have an influence in that environment and that will take time. You will all
take time, but we have to start somewhere and I think we’re on the right foot.

Lesson Five
Birth & Maternal Conditioning
Today we’re going to be looking at one of those deeply profound subjects. We are
looking at the history of the conditioning of the vehicle. That history of the
conditioning of the vehicle cannot be separated from the experience of being within
the mother. As you can see from the subheading here, Trinary Crystal
Consciousness, that what you’re dealing with is a situation in which the fetus, which
again, you’re looking at something
that does not have a Personality.
You’re simply looking at the Design
Crystal fulfilling its function, and
fulfilling its function to literally
materialize the form.
That Design Crystal of the fetus
obviously is within not only the
physical body of the mother, but is
totally enveloped in the aura of the
mother. As was noted with a
number of questions last time,
obviously there will be differences
in the sense of the nature of the
mother’s aura, or the nature of the
child’s aura in relationship to each
other. Obviously, the aura of the
mother at this stage—when we’re
looking at this calculation, that is
here under the name, The Design of
the Vehicle, what you’re actually
looking at is the millisecond that the
Personality arrives. So, in that
sense the Design Crystal has
completed its process and the net
result is that we see the specific
imprinting of differentiation that is
there at the end of that process.
In other words, any time you look at your Design separate from your Personality, in
fact, the last time that that existed like that, the last time that there was only the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
91
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Design, was in this moment just as the Personality Crystal enters into the vehicle.
That millisecond in a sense before that happens, because the moment that the
Personality Crystal is brought into the vehicle you immediately have the quantum
and you immediately have the juxtaposition that leads to an illusion of a whole. This
is something we’re going to look at, though it has a much more to do with
Personality than it does with the actual Design. But, it’s important for us to see this
process through to its conclusion so that we can begin to draw our own conclusions
about the influence of the Design in our lives.
Here you can see this moment, and in this moment you’re looking at the Design
calculation. Again, this is precisely your own Design calculation. If you were, for
example, a normal term pregnancy, this is the sixth month point and this is the last
time that you have this configuration standing alone.
What is very interesting is the correlation that, and again this is something that is
about getting enough information. Again, I appeal to all of you to do the best you
can to come up with conception data. It is very important for us to be able to have
enough. I have already put out my feelers in that and I’m even thinking of putting
out a general research request to Jovian’s entire mailing list for a number of things
amongst which would be conception data so that we have enough material to begin
to work with.
The 10 Stages of Development and the First 88 Degrees
I plan on doing a lot of practical work as we move along in our process. This first
semester for me is very much just setting a theoretical foundation. But, it’s also
important for us to begin to look at this in terms of various levels of analyses. When
you’re looking at your Design, what is so fascinating is what is the relationship
between the 10 stages of development in the first 88 degrees and what ultimately
becomes your differentiation imprinting.
This is something that we need to research. It is not information that I was given.
In other words, no direct correlation was suggested to me between the 10 stages of
development and what ultimately is the Design differentiation. That is not to say
that there is not one. In the same way that I was not told that on all the transitional
profiles that you’re going to have beings whose Personality are 6th Color. Obviously,
these are the kinds of things that emerge when we begin to do analysis.
In order to be able to do a proper analysis in terms of being able to establish the
links between the 10 developmental stages and what ultimately becomes the
differentiated Design, we need not only conception data, but we obviously need the
data of the mother and we need the data of the child when it is born, and if there is
any distance in that. In other words, if the child is 2, 3, 4 or 5 years old, the
opportunity to have some kind of background or history about not so much its
Personality development, but if there had been any particular physical problems that
had emerged after the child was born. This kind of information is going to be
essential for us.

LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
The Bodygraph is Only Differentiation
Remember what you’re looking at. This is the great wonder of Human Design. It is
the thing that really provides us with the quality of tools that we have is that what
we’re looking at when we’re looking at the bodygraph and when we’re looking at this
calculation is that we’re looking at the differentiation only. When you think about it,
when you think about the fact that if you take all of the gates that are there in the
bodygraph, all of those gates all together represent our basic genetic infrastructure
of what it is to be alive and human. Every single codon grouping, all of the
necessary chemistry for life is spread out throughout those 64 different zones.
Yet, when we look at our Design and particularly in the sense that we’re looking at
the Design of our Design, we’re looking at this deep, deep limitation of, in fact, what
is truly imprinted. And obviously to recognize, because it is our business, we begin
at the surface, we will take a very deep ride downward. And to begin to see the
extreme differentiation that is there in this graph. In other words, you’re looking at
the 36th gate Sun, the 3rd line, but there is going to be a Color and there is going to
be a Tone and there is going to be a Base. So, ultimately what you’re looking at is a
very, very specific differentiation.
Genetic Connections Differentiate Us
So what we’re looking at is not what makes us human, that’s so important not to
confuse that. What we are looking at is what makes us relatively different from
other humans and that’s the miracle of our work. This specific imprinting, what is
going to make this vehicle different? First of all, this is the heart of biogenetic
inheritance. In other words, when you’re first explaining the difference between
Personality and Design, you have this Personality, that’s who you think you are, and
you have this Design that represents your biogenetic inheritance. In other words,
part of what differentiates us is the genetic connection.
The 3rd Gate
When we’re dealing with the mother and the mother is going to be the host, in that
sense, not only is there the potential of a very strong genetic relationship, an
influence from the mother, but also something that we’re going to take a look at,
which is part of information that very, very rarely have I discussed. The theme of
this will be our examination of the 3rd gate. When it comes to understanding the
way in which differentiation operates you cannot do so without understanding the 3rd
gate. It is the 3rd gate that is the control mechanism for various levels of genetic
transference. In other words, the movement of recessive genes, the connection

93
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
from three or four generations back that suddenly emerges, as an example. And
that the 3rd gate is the trigger for that.
Many, many years ago the second book that I ever released was actually a book that
had nothing written except keynotes, and it was called Rave Anatomy. Rave
Anatomy contained all kinds of images that I had created when I first learned how to
do graphics in order to kind of make a historical note for myself of all the various
things, all the little bits and pieces that I had been given information about. In that
original Rave Anatomy was a breakdown of the 3rd gate and the way in which it
operates.
The reason why I’m bringing this up today, because I don’t want to tease you with
this information, we’ll get there, is what we’re looking at is the relationship between
the mother and the child. So, for example, one of the things that I’m very, very
interested in is how much of genetic inheritance is rooted in the child itself. In other
words, does the child have a capacity to pull the differentiated genes itself? My
assumption is yes, if it has this specific 3rd gate activation as part of its 10-stage
cycle.
The other thing is the influence of the mother and her 3rd gate, if she has it, and also
the influence of the father. That is, whenever the father is in the aura. It’s
something that is fascinating for me to think about because I’ve never had the
opportunity to actually do the research. Our ability to be able to tap into real
information, real conception information, family information and then in seeing
specific problems, if that’s something that arises, then to be able to see whether
these things can be traced genetically.
There are a great many things involved with what is the influence on this developing
vehicle. Remember what we’re looking at here is the finished work. All of a sudden,
88 degrees of the Sun before birth, the Design Crystal terminates its work, it’s done.
It’s done in the sense of constructing the form. The form is constructed. It may be
constructed to grow, it may be constructed to evolve in the normal sense of what a
life development process happens to be, but the fact is that the infrastructure is all
built.
So, my point is this configuration, this Design information, isn’t something that
comes out of nowhere. More than that, and this is the thing that’s so interesting, is
that not only doesn’t it not come out of anywhere, but technically speaking it is there
when the Personality Crystal arrives. Now, obviously we’re talking about
milliseconds, but that doesn’t make any difference. In other words, it is there so it is
a by-product of this developmental process.
So, the relationship between the mother and the child, the relationship between the
transiting field, the impact of the mother and the transiting field on the 10 stages of
conception, all of these things, there are patterns that are going to be able to bring
us to this specific differentiation that is there.
The other thing is, no research whatsoever has been done on trans-generational
Color. I think that trans-generational Color, because Color really is the final below-

94
LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
the-surface construct, that there is going to be a very significant relationship trans-
generationally through Color. Again, that’s not something that can be stated
unequivocally until we get to a point where we see the research. I don’t mean to go
tapping along on this story, but it’s something that is very important.
The Cross of Life
I want to move for a moment to look at some aspects here. What I want to look at
first is the form principle that is going to be inherent in that Design Earth.
Remember something about this Cross of Life; it’s a foundation in the knowledge.
Basically, when you’re looking at the Cross of Life you’re looking at two things:
you’re looking at being, or purpose; and you’re looking at vision, or you’re looking at
path of least resistance.
When we’re looking at the form, the thing to see very clearly is that that Sun/Earth
represents a form principle. It is a differentiation in the form. And it is a
differentiation in the way of being. If I were just to look at that, in terms of, for
example, the 36th gate and the 6th gate, both Solar Plexus gates, they are potentially
highly emotional gates which mean that there is a tremendous amount of volatility
that is there. We know that there is potential crisis. We’re not talking about crisis in
the context of the illusion; we’re talking about potential crisis in the vehicle itself.
That doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to be a difficult birth. It doesn’t
necessarily mean it’s going to be a difficult life; but anybody who has the 36 knows
what that brings.
One of the things we need to see is that the only way that we can explore the Cross
of Life in terms of the vehicle is when we explore that cross at the Color level.
Because, the moment that we do that, we enter into the way in which the vehicle is
going to handle crisis, and the way in which the vehicle is going to deal with conflict.
So, these are going to be very important keys for us.
The Nodes
When you’re looking at Design Nodes, they’re very, very important and they’re very
different from Personality Nodes. When you’re looking at your Personality Nodes,
they’re about the way in which your passenger is designed to see; in other words,
the slice of the maya that it has the potential to grasp in its lifetime. But more than
that, what it gets to see in others. For example, if you’re designed to see corruption,
you will see corruption in everything. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s overwhelming,
but you will certainly see it. You’ll see the smallest minutiae of it. If anybody is
going to be able to see that, you’re going to be able to see that. But it also means
that there is a limitation because it doesn’t mean that life is corrupt. There’s going
to be 31 other polarities that are going to look at the very same thing and not see
corruption in it. They may see hope, or beauty or whatever the case may be.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But we’re not talking about the Personality. We’re talking about the Design Nodes.
The Design Nodes are deeply connected to the thematic of geometry. Everything
about your Design Nodes is trying to align you to your geometry for one purpose
only. That is to eliminate resistance and the thing to most deeply understand about
your form. You can understand when I teach Human Design on the surface, and
when I talk about strategy, I’m always talking about how strategy eliminates
resistance, this is directly connected to an understanding of the way in which the
Design Nodes operate.
Forms by their very nature, this form by its nature, does not seek resistance. It
doesn’t. It naturally seeks a harmony in movement. In other words, it’s always
looking for a way to keep in its geometrical flow, always. So, one of the things that
you’re looking at when you’re dealing with a Design and you’re dealing with the
Design Nodes is that they’re looking for the forms in which they can flow with the
least resistance. So, they’re only going to see certain beings physically as being
complementary to that geometrical flow.
This is something that is often very, very difficult for the Personality to grasp. “Why
are we hanging out with these people,” says the Personality. “What are we doing
here? We seem comfortable. However, what are we doing here?” The Personality is
always disadvantaged in its process. One of the things about the correctness of the
vehicle is that the moment that the vehicle is operating correctly, it begins to align
with forms that provide it with the least resistance.
So, this is a form that’s going to enjoy being with beings who enter into new
experiences, whose forms are comfortable with new experiences, because this is
what this vehicle is going to be attuned to at the South Node level. And obviously,
for us in any kind of analysis in dealing with the vehicle, we’re going to have to go to
the motivation, we’re going to have to go to the Color underneath. The way the
Color is going to move the Design is different because it’s going to move it through—
every vehicle and its direction is determined by how it survives and how it can
survive best.
Let’s say that at the Color level you’re attuned to liquids, and this is the right
environment for your physical body. You’re the kind of being where that physical
body is going to move in those directions. But not only is it going to move in those
directions, it’s going to be very important that the beings around it have the same
kind of approach. This is going to be about satisfying the vehicle in a certain way.
We have a great deal to explore about both the Nodes and the Sun/Earth as the
peak differentiation of how the vehicle is going to operate. If we are going to find
larger levels of generalized understanding about the pathology of things, of the way
in which vehicles are damaged, the way in which vehicles can be distorted, the key
to that is really going to be exploring these four aspects at a very, very deep level.

LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
Relationship between the Design and the Mother
We go back to our theme now and this is the relationship between the Design and
the mother. When you look at the vehicle right now, as it stands alone that’s one
thing. But what is going to happen to it, and here is the mother, it’s interesting
about this mother that her Personality Earth is in the 54.4, so here is the host and
this is the auric host for this child.
If you go back into the illustration packages you have from the earlier classes [see
Appendix], you’ll see very clearly that we always had the mother in the upper corner
and you can see the impact of that on the various stages in the Design. Each and
every one of those stages, any impact in that ultimately—the most beautiful thing
about Human Design is that it is not illogical. That is truly its magic. That’s why it’s
verifiable, it’s why it’s stood the test now of nearly 20 years in the world.
The reality is that it is logical, and it’s obviously logical to me that as we move
through these stages and examine them in depth, that we’re going to find the keys
to why we have specific differentiation in the Design vehicle. And that specific
differentiation in the Design vehicle is absolutely essential. Ultimately, it is about
what you’re going to look like, what your body is going to be like, what it’s going to
be like in terms of what it is on the outside and what it is on the inside. This is the
life that is being created. And here, of course, when it’s in the mother, it is then in
the embrace of that aura.
A Projector Mother
Now, here’s a classic situation of a Projector
mother. What we know about the nature of
Projector auras is that Projector auras are
deeply focused auras. And they focus on
the identity. The natural state for the
Projector aura is that what they want is to
be enveloped. Now, the reality is that until
that Design has its Personality, and I’m
referring to the fetus, it does not have a
large aura. It doesn’t. As a matter of fact,
it has a similar kind of an aura to a plant.
What I mean by that is, that I know there
are people who sing to their plants and play
music to them, but the reality is that what
plants truly respond to is touch. Their aura
is very, very tight to the surface. And it’s
being held, in that sense, to the surface by
the way in which the 5/15 operates as a
magnetic field.

97
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But the fact is that the fetus with only its Design only has this very, very tight aura.
This is going to make a real difference between the way in which a Projector mother
is going to feel about its fetus, and the way a Generator mother, as an example, is
going to feel about that fetus. Because the fact is, not just the Generator but the
Reflector and Manifestor mothers are going to be surrounding, if you will, the fetus
aura. The thing that’s interesting about the Projector mother is that she is going to
be penetrating but she’s not going to have a great deal of sense of the aura
connection of the fetus. I think that’s something that probably has some very
interesting significance. But again, without research material, without research data,
none of these things are possible.
One of my goals, because we’re involved in very complex programming now and
programming plans, is that hopefully by the end of our three-year process [2008] I
will have established an on-line research center where we can receive data from
people and we can process it into various areas and be able to have all of that in a
large data bank so that we can begin to collate information. Many of you know that
in the Human Design Resource Center there is a global survey. Right now there are
over 79,000 entries in that survey. We’re beginning to build up a huge data base,
and all of those that are surveyed, we have the information down to the base, down
to the specific base crosses. So, we’re collecting a vast amount of information. As
we see what information we need, we can begin to actually find it.
Just something like this, the fact that you have a Projector mother, what is the
impact of the Projector mother? It’s not so much that the Projector mother does not
have its connection with the fetus. It does, it has a very powerful focus connection
on the fetus. But it’s interesting about the fetus’ relationship to the Projector
mother. It strikes me that this is not a powerful two-way communication of basic
information that way, because information is moved through the auric connection.
So, there must be something to that. But nonetheless, research will tell us.
The Impact of the Mother’s Conditioning
When we are looking at the mother, we’re not simply looking at the nature of the
mother in terms of our normal perspective on her Design, we are going to look for
what aspects of the mother are aspects that impact the grid that is established
through the 10 stages of conception, and what aspects of the mother within that
grid, because that’s how the Design is doing its job. What aspect of the mother
activates aspects of the grid itself? Obviously, this is going to have an impact. It is
clear to me that the impact of the conditioning of the mother is something that
carries difficulties psychologically later in life.
It’s hard to say because again, I want to be very careful with this. I treat this course
as a new science course because I think that’s the respect it deserves. I have to be
very careful about making absolute statements because I need to have the evidence.
There are two forces that are work. I discussed this last time and Andrea and I had
some discussion about that in the question period. There are two forces at work.
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

98
LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
There is the force that is there that is the nature of the mother’s conditioning on the
child. When I first gave this pregnancy course I talked about hard-wiring and the
potential for hard-wiring. And there is a second force, which is the transiting
program itself.
I’m convinced now, myself, from my own looking at things and from the conception
material that I’ve been able to work with, I look at that and I’m convinced that the
transiting program does the hard-wiring, but the conditioning of the mother is a
conditioning at a very, very deep level in which the form principle of the fetus is
actually opened to personalities that aren’t necessarily correct for it.
Think about the deeper philosophical aspects of what we’re discussing. This vehicle
only has one purpose, and we have to be clear about that. The purpose is to fulfill
the imperative that a form can be established that can house self-reflected
consciousness. This is what it’s all about. The only thing that the form wants to do
is to be able to be ready to receive Personality consciousness.
Think about the nature of the mother’s influence. For me, it is clear that the mother
is influencing the vehicle as to what personalities it will be receptive to. This is
something that is fascinating for me. And in many way, it’s funny, in a way,
connects me to a Freudian inspiration that I wouldn’t necessarily have ever in the
past given any credence to. The only difference is that I see it at the pre-natal level,
and he was trying to see it in the post-natal environment, but the stage is already
set. In other words, for example, the way in which the child will take the
conditioning of the mother and transpose it to the nature of its relationships in life.
One of the things that’s so interesting is that the child will be open to personalities
that the mother herself would not be open to, but in fact, conditions the child to be
open to. That’s something that’s also very unusual. I think it has to do with the way
in which the differentiation is keyed. But it’s clear to me that there are these two
forces. So, from my perspective, my way of looking at this to try to make that as
clear as I can, is that theoretically what I’m saying is that the transiting program will
physically rewire the way in which the fetus ultimately will be differentiated,
physically rewires it.
The mother’s conditioning brings receptivity and attraction to specific personalities.
One of the things I’m convinced of is this has to do with the built-in reproductive
imperative that has to be built into the vehicle. It’s not just about saying, “Ok, it’s
got a Sacral.” It’s about understanding something else, that there is a programming
here to have a relationship with other personalities. And this is the programming
that as far as I can tell is the programming that the mother is bringing.
We’re going to have to look at these things. There may, in fact, be situations in
which the mother does change the wiring. I mentioned that at the beginning of this
class because I’ve been giving these things a great deal of thought, much more than
I have ever done so in the past. It’s obvious to me that the 3rd gate is a very
important key. And it seems to me that it may be the exception, in that sense, of
the way in which the mother programs the fetus, that there may in fact be a wiring
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

99
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
that takes places if the mother specifically is bringing the 3rd gate. Again, the only
way we’re going see that is by having enough examples and enough comparison.
Isn’t it wonderful the way the maya works? The maya is all about measurement and
here we are so deeply involved in the analysis of the maya and its minutiae and what
we come up with is the need for comparison and measurement. Comparison and
measurement is what is going to be the key. So, these two premises, and they’re
premises, and in no way am I suggesting to you that I am absolutely certain, I’m
not. I really am not.
So much information was given to me but so many things don’t have the strings
attached. They don’t have these looping connections that bring one thing to the next
thing. Here is where there is this dilemma. As I said, I was given the stages in such
detail and yet, I was not told whether this or that changes this or that because it’s
there. I assume, because it’s all logical, that it is an obvious. And after all, it is
conditioning and it is what we understand as the way in which the form in influenced.
So, the premise is there theoretically; the research, one way or another, is going to
substantiate it. As I said, I can’t imagine that it’s not that, at least that’s my feeling.
The Mother and the Design Together
Let’s take a look here at the illustration of the mother and the Design together.
Again, this is the completion of a process; to see the completion of this process, and
obviously here when you look at this
Design you immediately see that
there are things. There are electro-
magnetic connections; there is a lot
of definition that’s added. But, this
isn’t another person. I don’t want
us to get into thinking that we can
analyze this just in the way in which
we would analyze a partnership. It
is not possible. When we see the
child born, and we’re able to have
their complete Design, then
obviously we’re going to be able to
have a traditional partnership
analysis, which by the way is totally
different from any of these stages.
It’s totally different.
What the fetus is for the mother in
the first 10 stages, in the first 88 degrees, what it is during the interregnum as it
builds towards the completion of its process, what happens to the mother when the
fetus gets its Personality and there is the final 88 degrees? And then there is the
breaking of the biological bond and the moment that there is true differentiation

100
LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
when the fetus physically leaves the body of the mother. There are many stages
that are taking place. Each of them has a different quality of potential analysis.
I wanted to use these particular graphs because they were the originals that I had
put together. But I would never show this graph again this way. In other words, if I
were to show this illustration, what I would really be interested in is two things seen
separately: the Design of the mother and its relationship to the Design, that’s
something that obviously is going to be very important, and the relationship between
the two vehicles themselves. I have been developing a whole new series of charts
that I’m going to use for these kinds of analyses, charts that are going to be able to
operate at the lower levels of the substructure. Again, I’m just generalizing with you
to give you a taste.
The Design information of the mother, I think, carries many keys in terms of, and
again I’m only talking about those things that are actually going to make a difference
in the first 10 stages. This image that you’re looking at is only possible the
millisecond before the Personality comes. Again, that’s the completion of the
process. And there’s a mystery, as I mentioned earlier; we’re trying to resolve this
mystery, this mystery of how does the finishing of the 10th stage lead to the
differentiation of the Design.
Trinary Crystal Consciousness
I think that that differentiation can be influenced in a modest way by the mother’s
Design. What is particularly fascinating to me, and what I would be interested in
looking at as an illustration, is the Personality of the mother with the Design because
that’s something very interesting. That, to me, is where there is a secret that will
reveal many, many things. It’s a trinary crystal consciousness. Is it possible that
the Personality of the mother has a unique relationship with the Design of the fetus?
Remember that Personalities and Design together become a quantum. You would
have a very odd chart, if you looked at it. You would have the mother’s Personality
with the fetus’ Design.
One of the things that is interesting in all of that for me, I think this is where the
mother has the deepest influence on the way in which the child is going to deal with
others in its life. In other words, the way in which its vehicle is going to be attuned
to the other. Now, there are two things that attune your vehicle to the other. One is
the nature of your profile, and whatever goes underneath. The other is your Nodes.
So, I think that there are some very, very profound solutions that are there.
What I would like to do, and these things are voluntary, but it is something that I
think is very interesting to do. I thought about laying it out myself for you today,
but again I don’t really want to get into that sidebar until we can explore it at lower
levels. But, what I would like each and everyone of you to do is take the information
of the mother’s Personality and take the information of the child’s Design and put
that together in a bodygraph. Tell me what you see. In other words, what you’re
looking for is the way in which the mother is going to influence the way the vehicle is
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

101
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
going to be open or closed, receptive or not to other types, to other differentiation.
Built into all of this is that there is this genetic imperative. And that genetic
imperative cannot be solely for the vehicle. It can’t. The Personality has to go along
with it. [Note: A blank bodygraph is in the Appendix for combining the mother’s
Personality gates and the child’s Design Gates.]
Imagine what that would be like if your body was driven to the sex act and your
Personality didn’t know anything about it. That would really be quite something, and
not very nice, either, actually. One of the things to grasp about how complex and
how profound the vehicle is, is that it establishes all of these possibilities for the
Personality. One of the things that it gives to the child is a certain quality of
Personality in its vehicle that its vehicle will resonate to, but more than that, that
goal of the vehicle is to create an environment that will support self-reflected
consciousness. But self-reflected consciousness within a vehicle’s Solar Plexus,
brainpan, neo-cortex—it’s the vehicle, after all; it’s the body that has the life, it’s the
body that determines whether the Personality is going to know love as romance,
desire, need, and it’s the body doing it. It’s all the body.
It was interesting; I had friends over for dinner yesterday, visitors from Asia. One of
them had been a Buddhist nun for 18 years. We were all sitting around and there
was this wonderful conversation going on. I just suddenly said, “Ah, mind; all this
mind, mind, mind.” There was this delicious laughter from this person. It’s one of
those great jokes to really understand. We’re set up by the vehicle. So, one of the
things that’s fascinating to grasp is that the mother, and for me the mother through
her Personality, actually influences the way in which the vehicle is going to be
sensitive or not, interested or not, fertile or not, blah, blah, blah with the other. And
this is an area that’s going to be very fascinating to explore.
The Form is the Only Creative Force
We have to be at the extreme of the spectrum when we are looking at the nature of
being. It doesn’t mean that that extreme is something that you take with you into
any kind of holistic analysis. But what I really mean is that we’re here to see clearly
that everything is the by-product of the work of the form. Everything is that by-
product. And we need to prove it. We need to prove it. How interesting it is that on
one side Rave Psychology, where you can map the response of the passenger to the
way it’s going to decision-make in its process, but all that is predetermined
physically. It’s not like the passenger is creating anything. It isn’t. The only creative
force we have is the form. It is the creative force.
It doesn’t matter that our self-reflected consciousness displays all of this whatever.
It’s all possible because of the form. And not only is it possible because of the form,
it is determined because of the form. And not only is it determined, it’s specified
down to nuances. So, if you want to get really annoyed with your mothers,
understand something, that from what I can tell mothers set us up for who our
lovers are going to be, and I think that’s rather hilarious.

LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
Mother’s Conditioning May Not be Correct for You
I don’t necessarily think it’s particularly funny in the sense that what you’re set up
for may not be for you. It does not mean that because this is the way that you were
conditioned, that that in fact is what are going to be those personalities for you and
if you do not have the knowledge of how to operate correctly as yourself, chances
are that you’re going to get precisely those forces that you were conditioned to be
receptive to. By the way, in many cases, what we will discover is that what you’re
set up to be receptive to is a specific dynamic in the gene pool that you’re being set
up to reproduce with, all of us. And it’s from our mothers. The joke for me is that
it’s the impact of their Personality, because only the Personality can give clues to
other Personalities.
In many ways it may even be the mother’s Personality that helps the Design Crystal
of the fetus create an environment for Personality, a guideline of how Personality can
operate through it. But here is where there is this very profound influence and it’s a
profound influence that affects the deepest, deepest level of our physical being.
When I gave the very, very first lecture to healers in the States, in California, the
very first thing that I said to them was that illness belongs to no single form. It
doesn’t. It just doesn’t work that way. We are all connected through auras, Pentas,
you name it, and we are all deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply connected to each other.
If you follow through on this deep conditioning, and remember it is not hard wiring.
That’s my point, that’s what makes it so interesting for me. It is another conditioned
element, yes, a very deep element. And for the mother it may be entirely correct.
After all, it’s not a conscious thing that’s she’s doing. But entirely correct in the
sense that the way in which she would continue the genetic line, would be in a
certain way, if I can put it that way. But the fact is, that being emerging with that
conditioning, if they’re not going to operate correctly in their life, then those are the
other forms that they’re going to be attracted to, those very forms they were
conditioned to be attractive to, to be reproductive with. And those very forms may
be detrimental to them physically. I mean physically.
If you bring somebody into your life, and they apply amplified pressure to a center
long enough and you are operating incorrectly long enough under that amplification,
it is going to lead to problems. It just will. And I’m convinced that most of the lack
of well-being in the world is about who you’re with. It’s all about that. Who you’re
with; who is in your aura and not just that, of course. To remove any connotation of
vanity in that, to understand what you do to somebody else’s aura. How easy it is
for any of us to disturb the other.
It’s a standing joke of mine that if every time you meet somebody you say to them,
“Gee, you don’t look well.” Eventually they’re going to get sick; they just will. The
not-self is so deeply, deeply influenced. And of course, here we’re seeing the
earliest possible conditioning, being conditioned to be genetically available and
attracted to a certain type, to a certain quality, to a certain whatever, aroma, skin
tone, eye color. It is being triggered here. That is the deep influence of the mother.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Conditioning of the Transiting Field
The other thing, obviously, is that when you go back and you look at the fetus itself,
you can see that here is an openness to very, very deep conditioning, deep
conditioning from the transiting field. The more data we’re going to see, for example
when we’re looking at the 10 stages of development, we’re only looking at a certain
number of maximum gates in a progressive formula over time. Then to be able to
track the transits, and to be able to see, for example, in looking at this is one of the
things that the program is going to do because I’m convinced that I’m not going to
get good conception data.
One of the things that I want to do is create is a theoretical program that will take
theoretical conception dates based in real time and will begin to run variations on
themes of how long the pregnancy is, what the transits are, what the child’s Design
will look like, and of course we’re very quickly, with that kind of programming, going
to be able to discover these kinds of linkages that I’ve been talking about. That
software isn’t that far away. It won’t be available to the public. All of you who are
graduates of this program will have free access to this research library anyway. It’s
a tool that’s going to be there for everyone, but the programming will operate online.
It will operate in a very different way, because it will be directly connected to our
data resource base, all the information that we will collect.
But it’s very important to see these progressions. We need to understand, for
example, what’s the difference between an Aries and a Gemini. What we’re going to
begin to see is that when you track this way through the stages of development,
going back to the conception stage where the eventual Arian or the eventual
Geminian is going to be produced, we’re going to see that you have certain transits
that take place, as an example, that take place during that particular 88 degree cycle
only when you’re going to have a birth in that sign. We’re going to be able to see
differences in the establishment of what the difference of the vehicle is going to be.
We’re looking at absolutely fascinating data. And again, theoretically it’s easy for me
to talk about each of the aspects and what they can mean in the same way we went
and looked at the 10 stages, but the real work in this area, because we’re going to
travel into other places and come back to here later when we have the tools, is that
you have to have the programming capacity. You have to be able to crunch the
numbers. If we do 100,000 theoretical conceptions to birth we’re going to end up
with extraordinary data that’s going to be able to show us transiting linkages and
what transiting linkages lead to because they lead to different forms that are going
to be born as—if you talk to a good astrologer one of the things they will tell you is
how they can see the body, you can see the Taurean body, as an example. You can
just see it if somebody’s strongly Taurean; that is, if their Sun in Taurus is actually in
a gate that’s defined because then of course it’s going to stand out. You really get a
sense of it.

LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
Time Chains
One of the things we have to see is that there are actually time chains, and those
time chains lead to not only a certain kind of body, and in that sense we’re going to
be able to track that. But it’s also going to lead to a certain kind of body that’s going
to be receptive to certain other kinds of bodies and that’s going to be based on the
conditioning of the mother.
The Chart of the Child
Obviously, the moment that the child is born we have a totally different story. This
is the moment that everything that has been set in motion, that no longer is it
standing on its own and everything about the nature of the Design now becomes
absorbed and transformed in the
quantum. Obviously, the Design is
different. That is, it is different in the
sense that you have the addition of the
Personality activations, you’ve got a
defined 8/1 from the Personality. You’ve
got an electro-magnetic with the Design
in the 42/53. You’ve got a split
definition Generator and so forth and so
on. You have a human being.
You have somebody that could have
been, for example, a 6/3 in that sense,
they had a 3rd line Design. However,
they come in as a 1/3 and that profile in
and of itself is the way in which the
illusion is going to operate. The other
thing is how important it is for us to be
able to see that at this stage the Design
stops being Design and it becomes the
differentiation of the vehicle aspects, and the Personality stops being the Personality
and becomes that differentiated passenger and the way in which it operates in the
consciousness field that has been provided by the form.
A Differentiated Geometry
The moment that we have this configuration we have the Monopole pulling all of this
together into this illusion. So, the child itself is very, very different from the fetus.
It’s an obvious thing, I guess, to say. But it’s really something to grasp. And the
child outside of the mother’s body, not only does it have the power of its aura, but it
also has something else. It has emerged into a differentiated geometry and the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

105
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
differentiation is not just in the way in which its vehicle is, but it’s a differentiation in
the way in which its Personality is going to operate.
Obviously, when we get to this stage in many ways our analysis potential is very
limited in the sense of what our primary work is. In other words, we’re here to
understand the process and we’re here to understand the underlying themes so that
we can recognize what the dilemmas are going to be for this particular form. But it’s
also so different that the moment that you step into the illusion of the separateness,
and you step into the illusion of what it is to be a child, that child is something that
now it’s got to operate with the set structure.
These two calculations are deeply, deeply important to grasp for what they simply
represent. They represent completions of processes. They don’t represent
beginnings. They really represent completions. So we see that the moment that
you have the Design configuration, at that point the process is complete. By the
time you have birth, the Personality has had 88 degrees of the Sun and has taken
every drop of them, all 88 degrees to reach its point of differentiation.
How the Personality Differentiates
Well, how does the Personality differentiate? The Personality can only differentiate
based on the possibilities that the form provides. The Personality Crystal does not
come in differentiated. It doesn’t. Otherwise, it would just come at birth and away
you go. And it doesn’t; it takes 88 degrees. And it is the mirror to that process of
those opening 10 stages. But here what you’re dealing with, is the Personality
beginning to adapt to the limitation of its environment.
It’s so important to grasp. The Personality comes in ready to be molded. What does
the Personality do? All the Personality is intended to do is to be able to filter the
neutrino stream through a physical construct, what we call brain. Its only job is the
filtering. It doesn’t do anything else, nothing. It’s not responsible for building its
brain, its neo-cortex, all of this stuff. It’s all there when it arrives.
So what it’s really doing is adapting to its environment. It’s like getting onto an
airplane and you have to adjust yourself to the environment. You’ve got to fit in and
all these things. It’s adapting to the environment. As it adapts to the environment,
the potential of the physical environment is what’s going to allow it, in that sense, to
find its various limitations. The environment is going to make it possible to be a 12th
gate Sun. It’s something to think about.
In the same way that we calculate 88 degrees back, because it’s the only way that
the calculation works, the fact is that it’s actually going the other way. It’s an 88
degree program for the Personality to adapt to its physical environment. And it’s the
physical environment that is going to establish that.
One of the things that interests me is the nature of the transiting field during these
88 degrees. It’s one of the things statistically that I’m going to be very interested in
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

106
LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
looking at the results of. Again, the deeper I have gone into the form side, and it
started years ago when I first began to contemplate teaching PHS and going down
and doing the chains, it was just so obvious to me that everything was set up for the
Personality which means that the Design, because it’s actually 88 degrees from that
moment, it’s the Design that ultimately is creating the 12.1 at the end of the
process. It’s the very Design and its limitation, that the only way that the
Personality is going to emerge is with that configuration. And it’s all built in. How
different they are.
Vehicles Shape the Personality
We’ve got these two things that we’re looking at. How does the first 10 stages lead
to the differentiation of the Design? And how does the Design, through its
differentiation, establish the limitation of
what the Personality can be? And then
we’ve really got something because this is
the way that it works. When you see it, at
this level, philosophically it can be very
beautiful. To really understand the
helplessness and incompetence of the
passenger, to understand the deep, deep,
deep limitation of what it is to be a
passenger, to realize that all of that is a
setup. The whole thing is a setup. The
passenger must see out of the vehicle’s
eyes. And must see out of those eyes
through a whole series of deeply complex
electrical neural firings and data collection
and all kinds of things that are going on that
are absolutely extraordinary. It’s this
enormous physical process that is at work.
And the assumption that the reflected conscious, vain not-self passenger, that even
its very Personality is its own when it’s not. It’s being defined by the vehicle.
It’s like the way in which you look at the driver of a beat up old car and the driver of
some sleek incredible car. You don’t even have to see the driver to realize that if you
look within yourself you’ve already postulated out of that a certain kind of
Personality goes with that vehicle. Vehicles shape their Personalities.
Perhaps with this kind of understanding you can begin to grasp why on the surface
teaching people to honor their vehicle as an authority is so essential, because it is
the vehicle’s game, everything about it. And any assumption that the passenger is
able to make a decision that is truly its own and truly for the benefit of the vehicle
just doesn’t work. It just doesn’t work. There is this phenomena of who we think we
are. There we are, who we think we are; we think we’re very important and we think
we’re in charge. We think all these things.

107
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
In fact, the very way in which we think we think we are is already set up. Not only
that, the person that we’re talking to has already been setup. The passenger had
nothing to do with it. And now you can begin to see that it’s the Design that
establishes what the differentiation of the Personality is going to be. Think about
that. It lays out the parameters. It says, “Well, you can be this kind of Personality
because this is the way that this vehicle is designed to display Personality.” It just
is.
Two Kinds of Healing
So, when I look at anyone’s chart and you look at those two sets of calculations,
they’re really magical. They’re really magical. And they take you to the deepest core
of what it is to understand that we are the form principle at work. It says a lot about
the potential of healing. I think that there are two kinds of healing that directly
come out of understanding this process. One is a biological, physical healing, the
alignment of the vehicle to its correct Color. That’s something that will be of an
enormous advantage to the vehicle.
But also, realigning the vehicle socially; realigning the vehicle socially is something
that is enormously important for the vehicle, because it is so vulnerable to the
influence of other vehicles. And it’s these two areas where understanding how the
form principle operates in these two areas, this is where we can really bring solace to
others. And it’s a key for us, clearly, to be able to grasp that because the
Personality is defined by its Design, that all the Personality can do, ultimately, is
surrender. It can’t do anything else.
We also see something the moment that you see a human being come into the
world, not only can we at our level talk about deep conditioning forces that are there
in the life, but for example here you have a vehicle that has five open centers. The
first question is, why? Why? It doesn’t just happen; it’s all a program. It’s obvious
to me that if we go back and we look at these stages statistically, we’re going to be
able to see patterns and to begin to understand patterns. It is the Design that
establishes the openness. I think that the very openness in a Design has so much to
do with the mother; again, with the way in which we are predisposed and influenced
to connect to the other in our lives.
At the bio-vehicle level, reproduction is as important as consciousness. The reality is
that if you cannot be reproductive you cannot maintain the experiment, you cannot
continue the evolutionary process, you cannot get to the place where you perfect the
potential of consciousness in form. After all, we are at the height of one of the most
deeply mutative times in history. And all of this pointed towards a mutative
transformation in the way in which consciousness is going to operate, and the way
consciousness is going to operate through form. There are tremendous mutative
forces at work.
I’m very interested in tracking what are these incarnating generations that are at
work now. We are living in a time where there are children incarnating into the

LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
world today that are going to have an enormous influence on the future of humanity,
and to begin to see that they are carrying certain specific activations. And those
activations, if we see them statistically in the way in which the conditioning process
works throughout the development, we’re going to begin to see very significant
relationships in these things.
Openness: The Way We Were Set Up to Be
What I want you to get is that when you’re looking at your Design and you see that
you’ve got an open this and an open that and an open gate and an open channel and
all this stuff, understand this is the way you were set up to be, after all. This is the
way your form was designed to be. Let’s say, you’ve got the Personality forming the
definition between the 8/1. The assumption would be that it’s the Personality that is
eliminating a certain level of openness. But it
isn’t. The Personality can only activate those
gates because of the Design. When I say the
Design, I’m not talking about this calculation
that’s here. I’m talking about the Design’s work
in establishing a vehicle that is only going to
operate in that way.
Design Nodes: Line of Least Resistance
Remember, when I talked about the Design
Nodes being about the line of least resistance,
that’s something to be taken very deeply, very
deeply. The form principle creates the way in
which there should be the least resistance. That’s why the Personality comes out so
easily the way it does in fact. It comes out because of the form. And it says so
much about the nature of a Personality Crystal. That, yes, each and every one of
them are unique aspects of the original shattered crystal. And yet, they’re very,
very, very limited. They’re very limited. If you take a crystal away from a form it’s
nothing. What is it? It isn’t anything. It’s not alive, it’s not conscious. It doesn’t
matter that neutrinos are going through it. It isn’t anything.
The thing that’s so fascinating about the Design Crystal is its relationship with the
Monopole. This very tension between the two of them being separate from each
other is the very tension that creates the dynamic that establishes the form. But
once the form is established the Personality comes in. It doesn’t do anything, it
doesn’t change, it’s not like its facets are altered, or whatever. It comes in and it
filters what it can. And it filters what it can, given the limitation.
The Personality Crystal out there that’s, like your Personality Crystal, instead of
coming into a relative healthy form, with a relatively healthy brain, you have one of
these things that come in and you’ve got some kind of genetic problem and whatever
the case may be and you have somebody who comes in and the physical structure

109
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
doesn’t operate correctly. It’s not like that Personality Crystal is going to be able to
shine. It’s limited by the form. It’s just limited.
It was my favorite joke that nobody ever got. What’s the difference between a man
and a dog? Well, a man’s not a dog, and that’s the only difference. And nobody
ever found it funny. Because it’s about Personality Crystals and I don’t think
Personality Crystals make people laugh. I don’t think they do. But me and my dog,
I have a lovely dog, and her Personality Crystal and my Personality Crystal quite
frankly, there’s no difference between them. There isn’t. The only difference is that
her Personality Crystal is in her vehicle and mine is in mine. And mine has different
equipment. It just does. I can’t discuss Einstein with my dog, it yawns, it’s not fair.
And yet, the Personality Crystals have precisely the same potential.
Personality Information is What the Vehicle Permits
So here is the beginning of the unraveling of a real mystery in a way. And it’s not so
much a mystery, it’s just the truth revealed; another level of trying to get into the
mind of anyone who can handle it, that the passenger is just that; nothing more,
nothing less. And that whatever it is and whatever it displays is not something that
it has absolutely any control over in any way. It’s all set up. This is the nature of
being. It’s why the form is so important and why we need to grasp it at a level that it
has never been grasped before because it is the whole game.
And to see very clearly that whenever you look at your Personality information,
understand it’s what your vehicle permits. It’s what your vehicle permits. It doesn’t
matter how much work ultimately I’m going to be able to do with the intellectuality
of the passenger. The best I can do with a passenger is bring it to a point of
recognizing that it has no control over anything, so it might as well just relax and let
go. But when we deal with the form there is so much that we can do. It starts with
the surface in Design; everybody knows that who experiments with strategy.
Aligning the Vehicle Aligns the Well-Being of the Whole Process
The moment that you start aligning your form to what is correct, things begin to
change, they work differently, there’s less resistance, all of these things. But the
level that we’re interested in is much deeper than that, so that we can begin the
process, particularly in understanding the Tone/Color chain, that we get to a process
where we can provide for the vehicle’s well-being at a deeply nuanced level, this
individual health formula, this individual vehicle therapy so that the vehicle is given
the attention that it deserves. If we align the vehicle, we align the well-being of the
whole process. It isn’t, however, going to change the passenger. It isn’t.
The fact that you can operate correctly according to your strategy doesn’t mean that
you’re awake. It means you’re operating correctly according to your strategy. For
the passenger to awaken is really very profound, because you see, in a sense there

110
LESSON FIVE: Birth & Maternal Conditioning
is nothing to awaken to. There is only the potential to observe, to watch, to look out
the windows, to see the movie, there isn’t anything else, there’s nothing else.
Intellectually I know that the passenger can only be brought to that state through
proof. So much of what we can accomplish theoretically, let along practically, but
theoretically at this level of our investigation ultimately is beneficial intellectually to
the passenger, to reaffirm the helplessness of the Personality, to reaffirm that it is
not the passenger that should be given the responsibility of running the life.
So, we put our emphasis on where the power is, where the real truth is about the
nature of being. The nature of being is there to be found in the form.

Lesson Six
Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
One of my goals in this first semester of PHS is to give an overview of various
developmental processes. Again, as with this evening, or today, we will have that
kind of counterpoint. That is, two different perspectives on two different areas of
development, so that you have a real general understanding of the way in which the
mechanics works.
This happens to be one of my favorite subjects, because I’m somebody that has,
how shall I put this—Saturn is not easy to love, but I come pretty close to loving
Saturn, if I can say that. Saturn would blush, wouldn’t like that at all. Anyway, the
planets in and of themselves are something that we are going to have to take into
consideration in our work. After all, these are the agents, they are the imprinting
agents and the moment that we’re gong to talk about a Base, a Tone, a Color, we’re
going to talk about what is imprinting that. And what is imprinting that obviously is
going to have an impact.
I do not think that there is significant non-mythological information about the way in
which planets deal with each other, or what the specific relationship is between
planets, a subject that I find fascinating. I’d had always hoped that amongst the
many different disciplines that have come to Human Design, obviously there have
been many astrologers and it had always been my hope, because they deal with the
phenomena that are very unique, and they have a basis of knowledge that is very
important and it is the relationships specifically between planets.
The fact is that we talk about quantum and quantum is one of those things that you
have to grasp in order to understand the way anything operates. The moment that
you have a planet and it has a value, and the moment you have another planet and
it has a value, and the moment they are beside each other, the moment they are in
physical connection with each other in that sense, what you have as the result of
that is the quantum. That is, it’s not this planet or that planet, it’s something else.
And it’s that something else that is very significant and very important. We will see
that in part of the discussion that I’m going to take you through today.
Why Saturn? And why would I bother to bring Saturn into this whole process? Over
the years I’ve never given much time to involve planetary descriptions. As a matter
of fact, I do so in much greater depth in the gray areas of the knowledge I give than
in the exoteric parts of the knowledge. Saturn is almost treated with convention.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Saturn: The Place of Suffering
But however, there is something I have pointed out through all of the years that I
have discussed the planets, and in particular in my discussions about the nature of
Saturn, is to understand that when you’re looking at Saturn in your chart, and this is
something that is easily forgotten because it’s not necessarily what people like to
see. But wherever you’re looking at Saturn in your chart, you’re looking at that
place within you where you have your deepest potential to fail, and when I mean fail,
that is the deepest potential to suffer in this life. And whether that suffering is going
to be psychological or whether that suffering is going to physical, the reality is that it
doesn’t matter. For example, if you’re operating incorrectly out of a gate that’s
activated by Mars the punishment, if I can put it that way, I don’t want to be so
melodramatic, but it’s accurate, the punishment is experienced through Saturn.
When I look at somebody’s chart, and I’m speaking specifically of their individual
Rave chart, their birth chart, when I’m looking at that chart, Saturn for me is a key
to understanding where the real dilemmas of their life ultimately are going to
emerge, because it’s going to be displayed through those aspects of where the
Saturn is activated. And of course, they’re going to be limited in their expression
through whatever Saturn itself is activating. In other words, in many ways, it is a
very refined way to understand where the deepest weaknesses are in a human
being.
For me, Saturn is the only planetary object that in a sense, and I must be careful
here because the gods do listen, I trust Saturn. I trust Saturn in a way that I don’t
trust any other imprinting force, with the exception of the neutrino-based
information of the Sun, this is essential. But if you go back into the traditions of the
ancient mystics, one of the most common things that the ancient mystics expressed
was the sense that the planets themselves were inherently evil. I don’t believe that,
but that’s not the point. The point is that they were evil for the reason that they
interfered with the information that was coming from the stars. In other words, they
were filtering, censoring, depending on how you want to look at that. Within the
context of the knowledge it’s true. That is, the planets do interfere with the neutrino
ocean and the way it’s streaming and change its value.
Saturn’s Moons
There is something that I don’t think even astrologers particularly pay attention to.
I’m not anyone to wag a finger, but I think it’s something that is just an obvious.
When I think about Saturn in the chart, I don’t just think about Saturn. I think
about all of its moons, every single one of them. The fact is that the neutrino
information that is filtered by Saturn isn’t just filtered by Saturn. It is filtered by all
of those objects that we take in as a Saturnian field of information. And the same is
true, obviously, of other planets. When you’re dealing with Saturn, or you’re dealing
with Jupiter, you’re dealing with an enormous number of these objects, Saturn in
particular.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
We’ve just had a very interesting visit to the largest moon in the solar system, the
great moon of Saturn called Titan. This was an extraordinary event. One of the
most phenomenal things about the discussions about Titan is the fact that its surface
really represents a primordial model of what life looked like long before there was life
on this planet.
Saturn: Cronus
In changing the illustration here, I want you to think about this for a moment. First
of all, the original name of Saturn, Cronus, these were the original gods, the original
gods before the Olympians. The ruler of the Titans was Cronus. He created giants,
was part of a whole—the name itself, the Titans. And you can see on the left-hand
side of the illustration all of the various Titans. And there were, in fact, many, many
of them.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
What is interesting about all of this is that each and every one of these Titans have
had an impact in one way or another, or a designed impact on humanity, all of them.
And all of them have a specific relationship with planets. So the illustration on the
lower right-hand side, the planets, their powers and their Titans, you can see here
that there are all these various relationships that are there between the planets
themselves, specific planets, and the Titans.
Saturn Represents a Diagnostic Tool for Development
Let me take this to another level. I’m convinced that in the same way that we can
look at the 10 stages of the first 88 degrees of life, that for me, it is Saturn that rules
the life and specifically rules the life for the first half cycle of Saturn. Now, this first
half cycle of Saturn, approximately 14½ years, this whole cycle is governed by
Saturn. The whole growth of the vehicle and the way in which the whole vehicle is
going to operate is being conditioned by Saturn.
When we’re looking at Saturn, what I’m really trying to show you here in terms of
this example of all of these various Titans is to see that not so much that the Titans
are connected to the planets, but the planets are directly connected to Cronus, to
Saturn, to that entire sphere. In other words, when I say if you’ve got an activation
that is a Martian activation and you’ve got it in a specific gate and you’re going to
get punished in Saturn, well how does that work? This is how it works. Every single
one of the planets has a relationship to these Titans and has a relationship to the
overall Saturnian field. What that means is that, what I’m really trying to give you a
taste of is that Saturn represents a diagnostic tool for looking at development, and
particularly development in the first 7 years of the life, particularly, in the first 7
years of the life.
So, in my discussions today, it’s something that I want you to keep in mind. Saturn
is something that you need to begin to look at very carefully because Saturn is going
to give you a great many keys. When you look at somebody’s natal chart, by the
time we’re through this long process of ours, you’re going to be able to see those
Saturn configurations and you’re going to be able to understand what the potential
physical dilemma is that can arise out of that.
Remember that I said there can also be a psychological dilemma because here we’re
not looking at what is below the line, we are not looking at the separation of the
crystals into their constitute properties, we’re looking at the illusion itself, the way
the illusion works on the Rave, on us. So, in looking at that illusion we always have
to realize that anything that is taking place there is going to impact both the
passenger as the Personality expression of consciousness and it’s going to impact the
vehicle. We are going to see symptoms that are going to emerge through the
Saturnian gate. It means that the Saturnian gates, wherever Saturn happens to be,
are going to be a gateway for us to be able to understand both the physical problem,
where the physical problem is emerging.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
Remember, that isn’t going to tell us where its source is. It’s going to tell us where
it’s going to come to the surface and it means that this can be deeply important as
preventive diagnostics. In other words, to be able to warn people when you look at
their Design, hey you know you have your Saturn here and you’ve got your Design
Saturn over here, and this is where you’re going to run into dilemmas and this can
affect you physically, and so forth and so on.
Understand this relationship. It’s not that Saturn specifically has a relationship to
each of the planets. But all of the planets have a relationship to the Titans. And all
of the Titans are ruled by Saturn and everything we experience in terms of the way
in which we’re imprinted by the neutrino field is that we’re being imprinted by this
Saturnian field, and it’s this Saturnian field that, in fact, is giving us an incredible key
to be able to look at somebody and to be able to see where the dilemmas are.
The Developmental Process
The next illustration I want to share
with you is that, I have a whole
series of calculations and these series
of calculations are very simply built.
In other words, what you’re going to
see is that I’m going to take you
through the Saturn Sixteenth, the
Saturn Eighth, the Saturn Quarter,
and the Saturn Opposition. I’m not
going to go to the Saturn Return,
that’s another story, and you all know
about that in terms of analysis. But
what I really want you to see is that
by being able to pinpoint these
special Saturnian movements, and
they’re very, very important, we’re
going to be able to see thematic
positions of Saturn. And what we’re
going to see is that there is a
developmental program, or there is
development process that Saturn is
ruling and we can have a key to each
of these stages.
Let’s begin here by looking at this
chart. I recently gave a special course on the Witness Generation, called the Forking
of the Path, which is about a generation that’s incarnating now between August 2005
and January 2006, and this incarnating generation is going to divide humanity into
two parts. They’re not equal parts, there’s actually going to be more of one than the
other, but nonetheless, it’s a forking of the path.

117
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
This particular chart is of somebody of this generation. You will see that the
Incarnation Cross is the Right Angle Cross of Eden. This is the Eden generation. Out
of this generation comes the possibility, or the potentiality to be able to engender
the arrival or the conception of a Rave child. In other words, this is a generation
that when they reach their early 20’s it will be the turning of the cycle in 2027 and
out of this group will be those that are able to give birth to, in essence, this new
Eden generation.
Personality Saturn: 33rd Gate
So I’ve just taken this
particular chart, it’s for the
17th of September as you
can see. The first thing
that I want you to look at,
and only look at are these
Saturns. The first thing
that we’re going to see is
the Personality Saturn
that’s going to be in the
33rd gate. The 33rd gate is
a stop codon. The 33rd
gate is a gate of retreat.
But the 33rd gate is also a
gate that impacts very
strongly on the thyroid. It
is one of the things about
the fact that it is a stop
codon. One of the things
that can happen with the
33rd gate is the limitation of
growth.
When you think about the
abstract circuit, everything
about the abstract circuit is
rooted in a growth format.
That is, the 42/53.
Everything about the
completion of the abstract
process is the process
takes place in the 33/13,
because the 33/13 is the end, in that sense, as if you can have an end in a wheel,
but it’s the end in the circuit of that process. This is where you have the secrets,
information of what you’ve learned, what has been learned along the experiential
way, and then in the 33 the ability to be able to express that.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
So what we’re looking at in the 33rd gate is a number of things. We are looking at
the possibility of problems with memory, as an example. So, this is something that
can be very important to keep in mind. There is a physical memory circuit and this
is something I will show you in the next semester, it is part of another investigation.
But nonetheless, this can be a problem with memory. This can be a problem with
the ability to speak and to speak about the past. This can lead to all kinds of
different physical dilemmas.
Punishment: Saying the Wrong Thing at the Wrong Time
If you’re looking simply at the punishment, the punishment is that at most levels, if
we’re looking this at the simple level, at the surface for somebody’s reading, what
you’re looking at is you’re going to get into trouble every time that you shoot off
your mouth about the wrong thing at the wrong time. Because of course, this is
where they will really get punished. They’ll end up getting punished because they
say the wrong thing. Or they’ll end up getting punished because they can’t say the
right thing, in that sense. This is going to be Personality related, mostly dealing with
the Personality. But again, remember in the quantum there is always a bit of ‘this’ in
the ‘that.’ So there are potentials for dilemmas in this 33 that could impact
physically.
Design Saturn: 56th Gate, Punishment: Stimulation
When we go over to the Design side, we come to the 56th gate. Again, we are
dealing with a gate that’s in the Throat Center, so again we’re dealing with the
thyroid, so the thyroid is going to be an issue. Of course, where this being is going
to be punished is where their decision-making takes them, because this is a gate of
stimulation. This is a need to be stimulated.
So, for example, physically, these can be beings who are over stimulated, or
physically they can be beings that are going to be under stimulated, which means
they may have thyroid difficulties in terms of the way in which their thyroid works,
dysfunctional thyroid. They can end being hyperactive, or they can end up being
deeply docile. The fact is there are the potentials for problems that are going to be
there. But throughout this person’s life, if you want to talk about an Achilles tendon,
or you want to talk about that kind of thing where there’s always a weak spot, those
are the two places where there’s always a weak spot.
I guess the thing that I really love about embracing Saturn, is part of a great deal of
respect that I have for Carlos Castaneda’s concept of the petty tyrant. It’s one of
the cleverest things that any of the New Age thinkers came up with in the 20th
Century; it’s beautiful. This idea that only when you can accept and surrender to the
petty tyrant and remain true to what is to be yourself, then there is no concern
about the tyrant, that there are no buttons to be pushed, that there is no built in
weakness.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
For me, one of the great tests of my process has always been Saturnian transits that
are significant to me and my life. In dealing with Saturnian transits I’ve learned to
see the difference between when I was unaware and how painful they were and what
it has meant for me in all of these years in my process. How extraordinary it is to
have a clear and a clean, if you will, relationship with Saturn. It’s all of those forces
out there, those old gods, the old gods that prepared the way for the form itself.
This is something that one needs to keep in mind.
The First Saturn Sixteenth
Here we have this chart.
If we move along, and
remember this is the
17th of September, what
we’re looking at here,
you can see it up here,
is the first Saturn
Sixteenth. You can see
the date, so you’re
approximately two years
away. Remember, there
is not going to be any
perfection, in that sense,
to the gaps between
these sixteenths,
eighths and quarters. In
other words, because
Saturn may go
retrograde, these things
are very different.
However, where you get
to see the continuity is
that it’s very easy to do.
When you look at your
Saturn look at its
comparison in its right
angle cross, for
example, in the Rave
I’Ching you can look up
the 59th gate, what the
original one was, if we
go back for a moment,
the 33rd gate, if you go to the 33.1. We know the 33 is part of the Right Angle Cross
of the Four Ways, and exactly opposite is the 19.1. The 19.1 would be when Saturn
is going to be in exact opposition. So, the 44.1, which would be in Scorpio, that’s
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

120
LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
going to be the quarter. Then if you go to the exact, in hexagram movements, in
line coordination, then what you get to is that to come up with the sixteenth moving
from the 33rd gate, that first sixteenth is Saturn in the 59.1. The Design Saturn is
going to be in the 4.2. [Refer to Appendix for 33rd gate Incarnation Cross Mandala.]
Remember, what we’re looking at here is sort of like what we would look at if we
were doing somebody’s return chart. The only difference is we don’t superimpose
this chart on the other.
In other words, what
we’re looking at is we’re
just looking for what the
Saturns are going to be
because they are going
to give us a theme for
that developmental
phase.
Of course, this is the
beginning of this second
phase. The first phase
is from the birth itself
and the Saturn positions
there. This is something
we need to keep in
mind. In this particular
case, the difference
between the birth and
the sixteenth is
approximately two
years. One of the
things to realize, one of
the most important
aspects of the quality of
life is that the way in
which the mental
capacity of a child is
going to be structured,
is that almost all of it is
going to take place in
the first three years.
Not only that, in the first two years, again here within this context, within the first
two years, there’s an enormous expansion of neural activity, the neural pass being
opened up. What we know is that by the time the child is 3 years old many of, if not
most of, those neural tracks will be abandoned and they will atrophy. In other
words, within the first 3 years, the basic capacity, or if you look at it the other way,
the fundamental limitation of what we call our minds through the neo-cortex is going
to be established.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Physical Problem: The Thyroid
So the first phase is very important. And it’s very important because it’s going to
give us an insight, and again, this is the sixteenth, so I’m going to take you back.
Here again, we’re looking at the birth chart. In looking at that birth chart we’ve got
this 56-33. So what we know is that if there is going to be a problem, it is going to
show up in the thyroid of the child. This is where physically you’re going to have
evidence that there’s a problem.
For example, the child might be growing too fast, might seem not to be growing at
all. This is the Throat Center, and in the first 2 years there is the expectation not
only of movement, of crawling, sitting, sitting erect with the spine erect, being able
to hold up one’s head, standing up, walking, all of that is part of this process and you
can see in this example, for this child, that here is the potential for dilemmas.
The Source is in the Design Crystal
Remember, this is where it
emerges. This is a diagnostic tool.
This is where it emerges. It isn’t
telling us where the source is.
That’s something for us to
recognize. In other words, in order
for us to track this, we’re going to
have to go back underneath the
line, we’re going to have to go back
to the original Design Crystal, we’re
going to have to go back to see the
way in which that worked.
Ultimately, if we have the complete
continuity, we’re going to be able to
look through the progression
through the earliest development,
the first 88 degrees, to see if there’s
any hint that there are going to be
real problems that are going to
impact here.
The other thing is the obvious. The
obvious is that this child is coming
into the world as an emotional
Manifestor. As an emotional
Manifesting child it’s going to be
enormously difficult in its first years; it’s going to be difficult for its mother. At the
same time, it’s going to be very, very clingy because of this powerfully open Spleen
with all of its possibilities. This is an amazing Splenic Center. You can see the seven
potentials are all there.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
What you’re dealing with is this open Sacral, open Root, lots of pressure,
undervalued—babies feel all this, they live all this. They live it as its fundamental, as
its very, very basis. But the fact is it is the same thing. Automatically, the moment
you come into the world the not-self strategies take over. The reason I’m saying
this is if the mother is unaware that she’s dealing with an emotional Manifestor who
is going to be very, very moody, going to deal with an emotional baby that will
refuse to eat, you have an emotional baby that may refuse to speak. There’s all
kinds of things that can go on in this that if the parent doesn’t understand the
configuration puts enormous pressure on this child to be “normal,” then what’s going
to happen is all of that pressure, the way in which it’s going to impact that child, it’s
all going to come back here into this place where Saturn is. This is where the
problem is going to emerge, and it’s going to display itself physically.
Nature and Nurture
So, we have two issues that we’re dealing with. This is the two basic issues that
everyone deals with. That is, nature and nurture. We have two kinds of things at
work here. When we go beneath the surface and we go into the isolated crystal
we’re going to go into the basic nature, the way that the infrastructure operates.
But the moment we come to the surface we have to deal with the fact that we are
designed to be open, and we have to deal with the fact that we are going to have to
deal with imprinting and imprint conditioning. That nurturing is going to transform a
human being. It’s going to transform a human being because it’s going to influence
the not-self. Obviously a baby is just fertile ground, in that sense, for not-self
conditioning.
So, we have two dilemmas. That is, what I want you to see about Saturnian
knowledge and Saturnian pinpointing, because that’s basically what it is, is that
you’re going to see where the problem will emerge. Now, let’s say that you have
access to this child; after all, it just came into the world. Let’s say you know the
parents of this child. It is going to be of enormous value to them to understand the
way in which they can treat this child. In doing so, in treating it correctly, in dealing
with the child itself with awareness, then you’re going to eliminate the nurturing
factor as something that’s going to condition a problem that’s going to emerge
through those Saturnian pinpoints.
Then if something is emerging there, then you know it’s built in. In other words, you
know that it’s something else, it’s something from deep inside, it has a deeper
source to it. It’s not necessarily something that is only being impacted by the
potential of the conditioning on the outside. We always, when we’re dealing with the
human as a whole being, as a holistic approach, we have to recognize that knowing
where the problem can emerge is the first step in our ability to be able to diagnose,
in fact, what the dilemma is.

123
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Most Problems are from Conditioning
Eight or nine times out of ten, the problems are going to be the conditioning. And
this is the thing that’s so sad. If it was simply something that we could ameliorate
by a technique or a therapy that we could see at a deeper level, that would be very
delightful. But we can’t. That is, what you’re looking at here in the first couple of
years, you’re looking at so many things that can be impacted so negatively for the
development of this being with its openness and its kind of Design, that without
parents that are aware, without that understanding, it’s going to be very, very
difficult for this child.
You can see it has some difficult, difficult aspects. There are things that are built
into it—the 28.6, it can get very, very unhappy with its fundamental relationship with
the other. This is a 12/22 definition. You are dealing with a child that has its Earth
in crisis, bonds made and broken. Again, for us to really understand that we cannot
just heal the child, if that’s what’s necessary. The healing of the child also involves
the healing of the parents, because if we don’t heal the parents then the results are
going to be there.
In this case, nine times out of ten what you get is hyperactivity. You’ve got this very
strong thyroid configuration; you’ve got an emotional Manifestor. The likelihood is
that with an open Root Center, because kids who have an open Root Center are the
most explosive. You have a child with an open root Center and they have a friend
come over that has a Root Center then all of a sudden you have atomic bombs going
off. Here you have a baby that is a rocket ship. What happens? All of a sudden
you’ve got a baby that is on the edge of being drugged by the various people that
want to calm it down. They think it’s a problem. Then they think there is this and
that. The dilemma is that if there is also an underlying weakness at the Color/Tone
level, then there is a potential for the wiring not to be correct. And that
hyperactivity can end up being a serious physical problem, not just simply a
response to conditioning.
Saturn Keys: Very Important Tools
So, these Saturn keys are very important tools. It’s interesting for me over all these
years, having the time that I have, I keep on remembering all the basics that I
taught people that over the years going through all the things of the expansion of
Human Design that some of it was left behind. I’ve been talking about Saturn in this
way for a very long time, not in this detail with its relationship to PHS, but just in the
sense that if you want to see where the problem is, if you want to see where your
difficulties are going to be, you’re going to find it in your Saturnian gates. It’s
wonderful to come back to this place now in the spiral of things and to be able to put
it into a much more powerful context. To give you this tool so that you can begin to
experiment. This is very important for you.
Many, many years ago, it’s part of my mystical journey, I worked for a couple of
years on the island in a country school. At some point I was just getting too bizarre
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

124
LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
to do that every day. And yet, at the same time there were a number of kids that
were having problems in school and I just created a kind of private school. I had 4
students. I took them into my life for three months and I taught them the history of
the universe. One of the things that I taught them was memory techniques. There
are a number of really extraordinary ones going back to Pythagorean techniques that
have to do with building objects inside your mind, something I taught them to do
and how to store things in those objects which is an incredible thing for kids.
But the other thing is the most obvious. When you hear something, it automatically
goes in—yes, that’s nice—but most of it ends up in the deep gray areas of the brain.
Most of it. Unless you recall it, unless you bring it back, it becomes harder and
harder to find it because the deep gray areas of your brain have millions and millions
and millions of filing cabinets. One of the most important techniques for
remembering, for getting comfortable with things, is immediately bringing it back
out, and bringing it back out means that you use it as a tool. You discuss is, if you
can, with somebody else. You create the wiring that allows you to work with that
consistently.
It’s something about any of these tools or these hints that I give you about objects
and values. The most important thing for you is not that you become obsessed with
that, but you do that for awhile so it’s in you, so you see the validity of it—that’s
very important—and to make sure that you’re clear what you’re seeing; in other
words, your own ability to be able to do what I can do. And I don’t mean anything
other than the basics of being able to look at the Saturn and to begin to think about
what’s it’s about.
Now, obviously what that takes is you need to understand the basic biology that
underlines any of the centers, those gates are going to have impact on whatever that
biology is going to be, you’re going to be able to see it in those terms, you’re going
to be able to see it in psychological terms. And remember, it’s the place where
everything shows up.
Is the Problem a Result of Conditioning?
Let’s take the second step here. When we take the second step we move away—by
the way, you’re going to have all of these charts. Obviously, there are many
different things that one could look at. Specifically, the profile is very important and
the Nodes are important. They, in and of themselves, give very special insights.
Again, when it’s the right time for all of that, when we’re ready to do analysis, which
we’re not ready for, not for awhile, that will really be one of the things that we will
add to the mix so that we can have the tools we need to be able to do the surface
analysis.
We have a job; think about the way in which that works. Somebody is going to
come to you as a PHS practitioner. They obviously have problems, whatever that
problem happens to be. The first thing that you have to deal with is not their Colors,
Tones and Bases. You have to deal with them, the nature of their Design, and you
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
125
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
have to understand in the nature of their Design and through those Saturns as a
key, as an example, and other things that we’re going to look at over the next
classes, to be able to see where the potential is for problems, to be able to see that
and then to be able to hear what their problem is. In other words, to be able to
understand when they’re telling you whether you’re looking at something that’s
mostly the by-product of their conditioning. And as the by-product of their
conditioning it’s something that certainly can be helped by them being correct. But
also, at the same time to be able to see clearly that whatever they’re going to share
with you is going to reflect the positioning of the Saturns.
Again, because this is a new science and because we need to have evidence, the
practical of these things is very important, in other words, to be able to see in
practical experience with people, to be able to see the validity of this tool as a
diagnostic tool. In being able to see the diagnostic heart, in other words, where it is
being expressed—that’s where you begin to look at, is this the result of conditioning,
is the conditioning such that it has become a physical problem. If it has become a
physical problem, where is the weakness at the Design Crystal level? In other
words, then we’re going to be able to go down into the Color, the Tone and the
Bases, and obviously, we’re going to be working with the birth data, and we’re going
to be able to look and see where that vulnerability is.
In other words, we have a key and we have a way to be able to discern so that we
don’t give the client/patient the wrong information at the wrong time. In other
words, we need to understand how much of the impact is conditioning impact and we
need to see that conditioning impact operating out of those Saturnian gates, and
then we’re going to be able to see clearly whether or not there’s a weakness that
leads to those places.
That’s why the Saturn is so important for us. We’re going to need a chain to be able
to follow. When we’re dealing with Tones, when we’re dealing at the biological level
and moving up to Color in that chain, we’re going to need to see the potential
weakness there as it relates to that particular aspect, and of course at the biological
level. So, for example, the thyroid relationship that we’re going to be looking at, is
there a weakness. And if we can’t see the weakness in the Tone/Color chain, then if
we have conception data we’re going to be able to see that the weakness was
something that was built into those first 10 stages.
In other words, we have all of this developmental data that will allow us to
legitimately investigate what is wrong with somebody and to come up with what will
work for them. And both what will work for them in terms of their social functioning
reality, in terms of operating correctly, but also what we can do for them
therapeutically. And particularly therapeutically through the Color level. In other
words, what we can offer their vehicle to try to bring balance back into the way in
which the vehicle was intended to operate. Again, these Saturn keys are something
that are of great importance to us.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
The First Saturn Sixteenth
We move now to the first Saturn Sixteenth. Basically, we’re two years into the
process. Now, as I said, this third year is something that’s very significant, because
in this third year this is when you have this narrowing of the potential of the brain.
This is also, in the first three years, the completion of the creation, if I can use that
language, of the immune system. All of that being run by the thymus gland, and of
course, the thymus
gland is associated with
the 26th gate. It’s the
thymus that is
responsible in the first
three years of life, and
actually from some time
just before that, it’s the
thymus gland that
organizes the way in
which the spleen and
the lymphatic system
are going to work.
This is a very important
period. So this final
year in this first process,
this third year is a year
that carries a great deal
of importance. When
we’re looking at this
here, we have the two
Saturns that we’re
looking at. Now,
thematically, what we’re
looking at is that these
are going to be the, in
the transit sense of the
word, these are going to
be the themes that are
going to impinge. In
other words, this is
where there could be
problems.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
It’s only pointing to it thematically. That means that it isn’t necessarily saying that
these particular activations are going to be able to change the dynamic that is there
in the birth chart. After all, this is a transit. It is not the actual imprinting. So, so
much of this transit has to do with where the child is going to be impacted by the
other. It also means the child’s impact on the other. So that is something else.
The Personality Saturn: 59.1/Potential for Intimacy
One of the things to see, for example, let’s take a look at the 59.1, which is a fertility
gate. Everything about this gate is about the potential for intimacy. So, the
difficulties are going to come in intimacy relationship. In other words, where there’s
going to be a problem, the problem is going to emerge in terms of the intimacy with
others. But it’s going to emerge with something else. There may be dysfunction in
the development, for example, of the genitalia. It can be all kinds of things. We’re
going to have to see how that works.
But what we do know, and remember
again, this is mostly the Personality,
but it can deeply impact the vehicle,
that here through this 59 what we’re
going to see is that the outside is
going to bring intimacy problems.
This, in and of itself, if you go back to
the birth chart, we go back to this
configuration of this emotional
Manifestor child that can be placed
under pressure, that is very clingy,
that doesn’t know when enough is
enough.
Have you ever heard a child cry hour
after hour after hour after hour? This
is a child, that without awareness, that
is very open to violence. I mean the
kind of violence that comes out of
exhaustion and desperation. Not
violence that comes out of meanness
or evil. There isn’t a mother in the
world with a colic baby that doesn’t
want, at some moment or another, to
throw it against the wall. It’s the most normal thing for any human being,
particularly somebody who is depleted of resources and exhausted psychologically.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
The Design Saturn: 4th Gate/The Pituitary Gland
So, think about what it is to have this child and then go into this next level here.
And if we go to the Design side, we see that we’re dealing with the 4th gate. When
we’re dealing with the 4th gate, we’re dealing with the pituitaries. We’re dealing with
the way in which the overall information, outside and inside, the way in which it’s
going to operate in its relationship to the thyroid. You can see that there is definition
here in that.
So, again you may have in this final year, you may have a thyroid-pituitary problem
that’s going to lead to weakening of the eyes, as an example. So maybe the child
doesn’t see very well. The child may have reversed vision. There are all kinds of
stuff that is built into this. What I do know, because this is what PHS is all about; it’s
the same story with Human Design, we know precisely what something is, but we
have to see how it manifests in the world. In other words, we’re going to be able to
pinpoint these thematics, this is a child that, for example, may end up being under a
great deal of mental pressure. The reality that it’s being placed under pressure from
above and below, what the impact of that pressure may be on the child on the way
in which its pineal operates and so forth and so on.
The Importance of Getting Proper Client History
We can know that these are the areas that are going to reveal themselves. That’s
why it’s so important that when you’re working with clients, every good practitioner
gets a proper client history. This is going to be one of the most important tools. It’s
very important to see that it is part of our professionalism. We need to see very
clearly, at least from their perspective, what their physical history is, so that we can
have a background in terms of applying the knowledge that we have, making sure
that what we’re discussing here theoretically is actually something that is truly valid.
And it’s something, obviously, that is so deeply important for us.
These diagnostic tools are a key. Saturn, for me is the missing link between what is
below the line in terms of what we can discern at the physical level and what is going
to emerge in the whole being. In other words, we need to find out where the link is
in order to find out where the problem is. And the link for us is where the problem
emerges, the themes of emergence.
Remember that even though we’re looking at the sixteenth, we’re looking at the
beginning of the second year here, even though we’re looking at this again,
remember that this is a transit. So what we’re talking about is thematic pressure,
but it’s still in the child, truly it’s going to be experienced out of its original Saturns.
In other words, regardless of where you are in the process you’re always going to
have those themes emerge out of those places where the natal Saturn happens to
be. This is really to give us a guideline, to the child’s development.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Conception Data Provides a Developmental Roadmap
For example, the knowledge is designed for us to have information from conception
onward. That’s really what the ultimate PHS as science is all about. If we have data
from conception onward, then we have an entire roadmap that we can follow. So,
let’s say that we meet a child when it’s 10 years old and we have conception data,
what we have is a developmental program. And because the child, perhaps, was not
raised correctly, perhaps that the child has had problems, that in being able to go
through these various stages we can really assess how that child was molded, how
its not-self was molded to the point that when you get that child it’s got all kinds of
problems.
The other thing, obviously, is that in being able to do any history workup on a child,
it is very, very important to have the Designs of the parents. And important to see
whether or not it is a Penta, and so forth and so on. All the information—because
again, when we’re looking at the surface we get to the end of this road, the three
years down the road for us, I want you to be as skilled in your ability to diagnose a
problem, to see it through the whole surface, as well as being able to go beneath the
surface and being able to understand infrastructure and where weakness may be,
and out of that weakness that we have therapies and techniques that we can offer.
This is what the complete education is all about.
So, I’m not simply introducing Saturn as a kind of—does this belong in PHS thing.
I’m introducing Saturn because Saturn’s position is going to be one of the most
important ones for us when it comes to being able to ground our dialogistic
technique. If we’re all working from the same technique, if we’re all doing quality
workups, we’re going to be able to have substantial verification of how important it
is. Not only that, it’s the doorway that opens up the possibility for everything that
we can know beneath the line to be applied to the surface. So, this is something
that is very exciting and it’s very important, for me, to get this out and to get it out
in this way.
The First Saturn Eighth
I’ve changed the illustration [next page]. You can see that the date is 8-29-2009, so
it’s approximately another two years later. This is the first Saturn Eighth. When
we’re looking at this, we’re looking at a phase that is going to take the child to
approximately 4 to 5 years of age. This is very significant. It is this stage that is the
real completion of childhood. One of the things that emerged during the Second
World War was the phenomena of feral children. That is, children who lost their
parents during bombings, or whatever. Statistically, the United Nations released
their investigation on this. Basically, what it came down to was that children under
the age of 7 barely had a chance to survive, they were very rare.
So, one of the things we know is that by the time we’re going to get to the first
Saturn Quarter, which is the next phase, this is the moment that the child becomes a
boy or a girl. In other words, the infant really disappears, the child disappears and

130
LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
there is this transformation that takes place. It is a very important phase in the life
when you get to that actual first quarter.
The First 7 Years of Life
But this eighth, this thematic, this is the completion of this child process. By the
time a child is 7 years old, they are really set. I mean, they’re set. It’s why my
deepest advice to anybody entering into Human Design and Human Design analysis
is that you need to have a very unique perspective on people. You need to see them
as babies; you need to see
them as children. If you
can see them as children,
you understand immediately
what has happened to
them. You can see what the
conditioning has done to
them. And you have to see
that in the first 7 years of
their life, because they are
helpless, they are at the
mercy of the awareness of
their parents, there is no
question in those first 7
years that they are going to
be conditioned, and may in
fact be conditioned to a
point that it is detrimental
to either their psychological
or physical health. So the
first 7 years are deeply
instrumental.
Whenever I look at
somebody, it is always so
clear to me that when I
looked at somebody’s
Design, the first 7 years
that’s who they are. And
I’ve seen that in my own
children. You just see it. It really sets the pattern for life. So what you do in those
first 7 years, the way in which children are related to in those first 7 years, this is of
monumental importance. Part of this knowledge is an opportunity to educate people
and educate parents about care for their children. It is fortunately one of those
weak spots. Most parents care deeply about the well-being of their children,
regardless of the fact that they may not understand how things work. But they
obviously care about their children.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
It is an opportunity, particularly when they’re just coming into the world, that there
is so much valuable information that you can give them that can make such a
difference. This emotional manifesting baby, you cannot put it on the clock, it’s
never going to work on the clock. It isn’t going to be like that. You can’t plan on
when you’re going to give it its formula, and all of these kinds of things. All these
things that we can give as insight to new parents that will make the difference,
beside the obvious of the type and the profile, all of these things that are related to
the baby. You can treat a baby according to its nature from the moment it comes
into the world. It has enormous impact, because those first 7 years mean so much.
My reason for introducing this information in this way, particularly, is for you to
grasp what I’m really telling you. What I’m really telling you is that when you have a
client coming to you, one of the things that you want to look at is the first 7 years of
their life. That’s what you want to look at. This is one of the keys to being able to
see that. And you can see that at each stage in this development towards the first
quarter, and of course this is the final stage before the quarter is reached, you can
see that there are themes of potential difficulty for the child, from the outside,
inherent within itself. And you’re going to be able to look back on anyone in terms of
their history, in terms of the workup of trying to see clearly what the dilemma is,
that looking at their first 7 years is very, very important because you’re getting to
see the set pattern for the life.
This Child Will be Difficult to Raise Unless There is Awareness
I want to take you back for a moment, take
you back to the Design itself. When you go
back to this Design and you look at it, you
have to see something. Think about this
baby. This baby comes into the world and it
is deeply insecure. This is just the reality.
And to understand this at a physical level—if
you look at the Design gates that are in the
Spleen, you’ve got the 18th gate and the 50th
gate and the 57th gate, what you’re dealing
with here at the physical level that the body,
the vehicle, is insecure. It’s deeply
concerned about tomorrow, it’s deeply
concerned about who will nourish it, and it’s
deeply concerned with who will bring it the
satisfaction that it longs for. And of course,
it’s an open Splenic Center, which means
that this is a child that is going to cling.
You end up with two dilemmas. Imagine a
mother, I doubt it’s possible because of all
these potential activations, but imagine a
mother and a child who have undefined
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
132
LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
Splenic Centers together. They cannot give security to each other. It’s the one
thing they can’t do for each other. That mother can’t make that child feel secure and
relaxed. The mother that comes with a defined splenic system, this mother for this
child is everything. This child is going to hold on for dear life. This mother isn’t
going to be able to breathe without that child wanting to hold on. And it doesn’t
know when enough is enough. It doesn’t.
No matter what you do you take the child off your arm and you put your child in its
crib, I’ve had enough, and oh, man, this child will not let you hear the end of it
because it feels deeply threatened. Now, don’t we know everything about this being
already? This is what its defense mechanism is going to be all about. This is what
its not-self mind is going to churn over. This is what’s going to be at the background
of its thinking. I’ve got to hold on; and all this power, all of this emotional power.
This is a child with an undefined Root. It’s always under pressure, and being always
under pressure means that it’s always under pressure to walk, to talk, to speak, and
all of these things, all of that pressure.
This is a child that is going to be difficult to raise unless you have awareness. And
worse, this is a child that has an ego under enormous pressure. But it’s undefined.
So you end up with a child that’s constantly getting its ego inflated more than likely
by its mother or its father or both. And of course, that ego inflation is adding to this
whole emotional—I’m the center of the world, everybody has to pay attention to me.
And enormous potential for crises in relationship, the crises in intimacy that we
already saw that is built into the fact that, without awareness this child is going to
have a lot of problems. So by the time it’s 7 years old—guess what?—you have a
very, very difficult insecure problem on your hands. And you may, in fact, have a
child that is hyperactive, may be disturbed, all of these things. And then you end up
with parents that give their children over to drug merchants, that these children are
sedated, that they try to calm them all down.
We’re All Conditioned by Ignorant Parents
So, when we’re looking at somebody’s Design, right away you have insights into
what that person is because this is what happened to them when they came into the
world. Here’s their innocence. It’s this innocence that is being conditioned; we’ve all
been through it. We just have our own unique configuration, but we were all
conditioned by ignorant parents, all of us, ignorant, unaware, it wasn’t their fault.
It’s a great blessing, by the way, to know that. It’s not their fault. It’s a great
blessing to know that as a parent. It’s not about blame and fault. The opportunities
didn’t exist for them then; they didn’t know what to do.
So, we all had to go through that process, and we’ve all have had to go through a
process of deconditioning in order to find some semblance of life. We don’t want
that for our children. We don’t want that for anybody else’s children. So, when
you’re looking at somebody’s Design, when a patient comes to see you, don’t just
look at them, the adult, and the condition that they’re in. Look at them as a child
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

133
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
and begin to understand immediately how they framed their persona, how it was
framed by all that potential of the conditioning that was taking place.
The Personality Saturn: 6th Gate
This first Saturn eighth, this phase is a very important phase. Again, we’re looking
at that theme of the Saturnian themes and the way they’re going to impact on the
child from the outside, where it’s going to bring problems, and of course,
immediately because we’ve been looking at this thematically that here we see the
Saturn in the 6th gate. Seeing this Saturn in the 6th gate is immediately a warning.
If you go back, you can see that in the child’s Design obviously you’ve got a 6th gate,
you’ve got the Sun in the 6.3. So, here again, are going to be these problems. It’s
a theme that you’re seeing
emerging. You have the
problem here in the sixteenth,
you have a problem with
intimacy and you have that
whole theme of the Saturn in
the 59.1, so this is definitely
going to be, in 9 times out of
10, these children, they’ve just
come in, they’re already
driving their mothers crazy.
And they’re still tiny things.
They’re only recently out in
the world—a month old, or so.
So, there is already this
theme. And when we go to
the next one, again that theme
is increased. This is
something that is very, very
significant. There is really
going to be a tremendous
amount of pressure on the
physical relationship. Think
about obvious things. It’s
something that has been
investigated many, many
times, the value of a hug;
what it means to hug
somebody. It’s physically
good for the health. It’s just one of those extraordinary things, it’s like chicken
soup. You’d think these things are old wives tales. But the fact is it’s actually true.
These are things that are good for your health. Being hugged, hugging somebody is
good for you.

134
LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
Think about the nurturing of a child. Think about the difference between a child that
is regularly hugged and a child that is regularly put away, put down, put into the
crib, put into the crawler, whatever the case may be. Of course, it doesn’t take a
rocket scientist to figure out that that is going to lead to different kinds of children.
One of the things you’re going to see here is that there is a lack of a potential
dilemma with sensitivity. Here is a child that can feel rejected. And of course,
there’s the presence of the 49th gate in this configuration. Here is a child that will
feel rejected, even though it’s the child that, in fact, is probably creating that kind of
rejection as a response. We don’t know, after all, I’ve taken this simply as a chart to
look at. On that day at that time, I don’t know how many were born, but there are
mothers of these babies. And this thematic is there for everyone to see. But these
mothers right now are already feeling a certain level of rejection for these children,
they just are. It’s all about awareness.
It was my standing joke about the birth of a Manifestor that the mother goes, “uh,
oh.” It’s just simply a fact. So, here you’re going to see that the real dilemma is
going to be on the intimacy and it’s going to impact one thing or another. It’s either
going to impact out of the Sacral or it’s going to impact out of the emotional system.
Given this child’s basic configuration it’s going to be an emotional problem. And of
course, you’re going to have the expression of that emotional problem.
The Design Saturn: The 64th Gate/Confusion
The more the child expresses emotionally its discomfort with its conditioning, the
worse the conditioning gets. It’s just an endless, endless, endless process. Here
you can see that what the Saturn is going to bring at the unconscious level, the 64,
it’s going to bring confusion. And right away you can see there’s going to be a lot of
confusion in the way in which the child is going to be dealt with by the outside world,
and that the child’s actions are going to be confusing to the outside world.
The Stages Show Where Things Went Wrong
These stages, this is a way to understand where things went wrong. And whether or
not, if they do display themselves through the original chart, through the original
Saturn pinpointing, so that there is a physical problem that emerges, then we have a
way of saying, if we can eliminate the nurturing dilemma, transform the way in
which the being operates, transform the way, if it’s a child, the way in which it’s
treated, that will to some degree or another be beneficial. But the fact is, once we
see it emerge through where symptomatically it’s supposed to, then we can begin to
see whether or not there is a true weakness and how that weakness at the below-
the-line level can be cured, how something can be done to balance that again.

135
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Always, we’re going to see that the therapy is going to be two-fold. If it’s a child,
the pressure is on us to properly inform the parents to make sure that they really
understand. So these early phases are very important. That is, the birth, the
sixteenth and the eighth. They’re going to take you to what is the final configuration
of this developmental process; this is the first Saturn quarter. The way in which I
work with this is that I then go from the quarter, to the opposition, to the return.
They’re much less important for me.
The fact is that ever since we entered into the Uranian age, the whole Saturn impact
in the larger sense is losing its power. It’s going back to what the Titans represent.
It’s going back to its basics. It’s going back to the early form principle. That puts us
in this first quarter of a human being’s life. No matter where we go in the Uranian
cycle, this is where Saturn is going to maintain its domain.
The End of the Saturnian Period
For me, this is something else. This is the end of the Saturnian period and the
return to the Cronus period. And I say that for a very specific reason. The
mythology of Cronus, many of you probably know this, is that Cronus ate his
children. His wife got a little annoyed. What she did was she gave him a stone
instead of what would have been Zeus, Jupiter, and he ate the stone and he
eventually regurgitated all the children that he had eaten.
One of the things that’s interesting about that is that we are entering into what will
be the end of abundant human fertility. That end of human fertility is best
expressed by Cronus rather than Saturn. For me, this is very much, in fact from my
own perspective, from 1781, we have been going through a process where the
Saturnian model has come to an end, because it’s been replaced by a Uranian model,
but the Saturnian system now has been confined to its Cronus phase, it’s returned to
this basic principle that will govern these first approximately 7 years of life. For us,
this is a very, very important tool. It’s remarkable.
I’ve been using it for many, many years in the world around me when I see people
that are not well. It’s always there. It’s remarkably accurate. So it’s something for
all of you to begin to investigate and to begin to look at. Frankly, don’t worry about
these phases, these stages in the sense that that’s part of later work of ours and we
will go through all of these things in detail because we’re going to go through these
two ways of approaching anyone, this initial introduction to the surface, and then of
course going underneath.
But I do want you to work with the Saturns of your individual charts, and the Saturns
of individual charts of people in your life, and to look at it with this perspective. It’s
very important. And also to see, particularly those in your life who are ill or who
have physical problems, to see the relationship between the physical problems and
what are, in fact, the Saturnian keys. This is very important. It’s important for your
grasp of this. But it’s also important for the validity of it. That you need to see that
it’s valid, that in fact this is an essential pointer and that it’s a tool for you to use.

LESSON SIX: Saturn and the Growth of the Vehicle
By the way, Sypraggelos, your question about Saturn in an open center, and again I
will go into those things in detail when the time comes. Obviously, it’s going to
make a difference. That kind of difference has to do with the fact that it’s going to
operate inconsistently. That is both a positive and a negative. For some people it
can be enormously beneficial. They’re the kind of people that can dodge a bullet.
For other people, it can really be a real problem. But again, we’ll save that for later
discussions.
Note: The First Saturn Quarter and First Saturn Opposition charts on the next page
were not discussed in class, but are included for your information and study.

Lesson Seven
The Vehicle’s Immune System
The Thymus Gland/26th Gate
What I’m going to begin with, because I have a lot of material to cover with you, is
with the thymus gland. You can see this protrusion here in this illustration [larger
image is on the next page and Appendix] of the thymus—where we’re talking about the
thymus in Design is the 26th gate. One of the things for us to look at is how
important this 44/26 connection really is. It is the immune system channel.
Remember that we have already been through a progression where we have seen in
the early stages, and again, we’re going to be referencing these early stages here,
we have seen that this is one of the most dynamic stages. This is the 6th stage that
takes place. And that this is the potential in the fetus to be able to develop its
immune system capacities.
So, we’re not only going to look at the 26/44 as we would see it on the surface—
remember, whatever appears on the surface isn’t necessarily what the source is all
about. But, we also have to see that there is this value that is always there in this
channel. When we’re dealing with beings who have open Heart Centers, or going to
have open Splenic Centers, this is going to accentuate the potential for the various
problems to emerge because of the inconsistent operation of the Spleen or the Heart
Center for that matter.
Stage V
Let’s begin here with the thymus. What
I’ve set up here is Stage V. This is 18
degrees of the movement of the Sun from
the moment of conception, so you’re
talking approximately 17 to 18 days. This
is the building of the Heart Center. And
you see here in the language we were
looking at, this motor of competition, the
theme of survival. Understanding that the
theme of survival simply isn’t what I think
most of you might have intuited from this,
that is, the Heart as the central life force,
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
139
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
that the beating heart is the survival. But it’s really important to understand that
this theme of survival is that here is where the immune system is going to be
designed. And it’s here that the process of the immune system is going to manifest.
So, it’s the theme of survival in the sense that is setting up the most important
defense mechanism of all. It’s setting up the potential for the bio-form to be able to
look after itself, and to look after itself at the microcosmic level, not just simply at
the macrocosmic level. Again, remember that we’re looking at a fetus that is only 17
or 18 days; we’re not looking at a human being at this point.
The Central Control Mechanism for the Immune System
Again, we are dealing with thymus gland. [Quotes that follow are from the illustrations that
follow through Lesson 8.] “The thymus gland is the central control organ for the immune
system.” So let’s think about the 26th gate in a new light, and let us understand it
within that light. In other words, this is the central control mechanism for the
immune system; it’s out of the 26th gate. “When it is functioning properly, the
thymus gland acts like a
thermostat…” So again,
understanding this regulation of
temperature “to provide the
right balance of immunity.” So,
my oversimplification in the
early years of talking about cold
and hot, it’s very much more
the thermostat quality. That is,
the ability to be able to control.
Think about the Heart Center.
The Heart Center is all about
control. It’s expressed
explicitly in the 21st gate; but
it’s all about control one way or
another. It’s like the name of
the 26th gate—The Taming
Power of the Great—taming, meaning what? Meaning the ability to be able to
control. And so much, by the way, of what the 26th gate controls is memory. That’s
why you have lines that speak of elimination of memory, erasing things. Again, I
want you to have a very deep grasp of when you look at the 26th gate to get away
from your surface approach to it and begin to see it at a deeper physical level in the
way in which it operates.
It turns up the temperature; it turns up its heat so that the body can fight infection
or tumor. Let’s think about that for a moment. Let’s say you’re somebody who has
the 44th gate. That’s basically a cool gate; whereas, the 26 is basically a hot gate.
But it’s like having two taps in those old fashioned sinks where one comes out cold
and one comes out hot. It’s often uncomfortable to wash your hands. It’s very

LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
difficult to control it. If you have both temperatures going through the same faucet,
obviously you can manipulate that. That’s what the channel represents. If you want
to really see the quantum of the channel, that quantum is that thermostatic quality,
that ability to be able to mix the temperatures and to mix them to have the right
temperature.
Let’s say you’re a 44 and you don’t have the 26. What that means is that to help
your body fight infection or a tumor that basically having the open 26, again I don’t
want to overstate this and make it dramatic because everybody will look and see,
“Oh, my God, I don’t have it and I’m in trouble,” so let’s just keep this within the
theoretical for a moment in the broadest sense. That means there is inconsistency in
the way in which that thermostat can be set. In other words, sometimes it is
possible to have a consistent setting. But then again, the setting itself is going to be
the by-product of conditioning; it’s going to be the by-product of somebody else
bringing their temperature to work that thermostat.
The temperature is turned down to prevent autoimmune disease. So, for example, if
you’re somebody like me who has the 26th gate and you don’t have the 44, then it’s
very difficult to turn the temperature down. In order to be able to deal with
autoimmune disease it will be necessary to turn that temperature down. So, “The
thymus gland may experience physiological damage, which makes it less effective,
such as stress or the process of aging. This is problematic, as studies reveal, that
the under active thymus gland is associated with increased incidences of cancer and
infections.”
This whole “Thymus is a mass glandular tissue located in the neck or chest of most
vertebrate animals. In humans, the thymus is a soft, flattened, pinkish-gray organ

located in the upper chest under the breast bone. It is relatively large in the
newborn infant.” This is very important. Remember, my discussions about
introducing Saturn and the Saturn’s Sixteenths and the Saturn’s Eighths, this is
particularly important in the terms of the development of the immune system. “It is
relatively large in the newborn infant (about the size of a baby’s fist) and continues
to grow throughout childhood up to the age of puberty when it weighs about 35
grams, or 1.2 ounces. Then it gradually decreases in size until it blends in with the
surrounding tissue.”
“The functions of the thymus were not well understood until the early 1960’s.”
That’s very interesting because we went into a 1st line phase in 1960, just leading
into 1961; I’m speaking of global cycles. When we entered into that 1st line phase,
where we are now—the 1st line phase will come to an end in 2027, we will go into a
6th line phase. It’s a retrograde motion of the precession of the equinox. But the
fact that we are living at the end of a great cycle of being organized, the Cross of
Planning, and the fact that we are in a 1st line era since the beginning of the 1960’s,
the 1st line representing introspection, investigation, it is since that period that so
many things have been revealed. It’s very much a part of the process of our time to
be able to grasp all of these basic pieces of information.
“Beginning during the fetal development, the thymus processes many of the body’s
lymphocytes which migrate through the body via the bloodstream, seeding lymph
nodes and other lymphatic tissue.” This is very important because the whole lymph
system is out of the Spleen. So, the information, and you can see it migrates, and
not only does it migrate in the concretized sense, it migrates through the blood
stream, but it has to migrate down this channel. It has to migrate to the 44th gate in
order to be able to have the necessary amount of seeding in order to build the lymph
nodes and other lymph tissue. The lymph nodes are very important because they
are basically sensors that are there throughout the body, sensors for the immune
system itself.
Here comes one of the essential ingredients of the thymus. “The main cells
undergoing this processing are T cells, a heterogeneous group of cells essential in
protecting the body against invasions by foreign organisms.” So here are our
soldiers. It’s one of the things that I discuss when I’m talking about the 26th gate
that I talk about the fact that this is the egoism and this is the potential soldiers, or
the salesmen, that are going to be the propaganda forces for the tribe. It’s
important to understand that that very kind of surface phenomena is directly rooted
in what its biology is. That is, the T cells are savage, as you will see.
“If the thymus fails to develop or is removed early in fetal life, the immune system
cannot develop completely. Normally, by the time an infant is a few month’s old, the
immune system has sufficiently formed so as to function throughout life.” Now, again
this goes back to our opening illustration of Stage V, how important it is going to be
for us, once we have the kind of conception data we need, to really track what goes
on during that phase. And also, clearly how important it’s going to be whether the
child, the fetus, is actually going to be in the aura of a mother that has aspects of
this channel, a father that is going to have relative auric contact. It’s going to be
very interesting to see what the impact is because so much of the way in which the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

142
LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
immune system is going to operate is going to be the by-product of what takes place
from Stage V to Stage VI.
“However, further growth and development of lymphoid tissues still depends on the
intervention of thymic cells. After the initial seeding process, the thymus releases a
hormonal substance that stimulates further growth of lymphoidal tissue, although
this substance has not been isolated.” So, the most important thing for us to grasp
out of this, and again, this is very superficial, I just want to give you a feeling for
what is really going on under the surface of the 26 in terms of its biology.
Everything about the 26th gate is about the thymus gland. And everything about the
26th gate is about the thymus gland and its T cells. And it’s about the thymus gland
and the lymphocytes, its ability to be able to send information and to transmit that
information to the Splenic Center in order for the lymphatic system to be developed.
T Cells
Before I move on, I’d like to give you an idea of the nature of the T cells. Here you
can see, by the way, this is a photon microscope photograph, so we’re looking at
very, very tiny things. The green blobs are T cells. “T cells are a subset of
lymphocytes that play a large role in immune response. The abbreviation “T” stands
for thymus, the organ in which their final stage of development occurs.” You can see
that there are going to be three different kinds of T cells.
“The Cytotoxic T cells destroy infected cells. These cells function as “killer” or
cytotoxic cells, because they are able to destroy target cells which express specific
antigens that they recognize.” When I talk about the soldier on the surface of the
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
143
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
26, the language here is “killer,” and it’s so important to grasp that, how powerful
are the forces that reside in the 26th gate. And think about all the stimulation that is
going on in humanity, has been going on for years with Pluto being in the 26th gate.
It’s no wonder we are facing the scariest potential pandemic ever. And all of this
directly related to this whole system. And for us to understand how important the
thymus is, how important these T cells are because it is exactly what they’re there
for. They are there to destroy target cells. What will be interesting later is how they
do that, or how they are able to do that their relationship to the 44th gate, the
Splenic Center and the lymph system in the spleen.
The second category: These are “Helper T cells are “middlemen” in the immune
response. When they get activated, they proliferate and secrete cytokines that
regulate the “help” effector lymphocyte function. They are known as one of the
targets of HIV infection, and the decrease of these cells results in AIDS. Some
helper T cells secrete cytokines that turn off the immune response once an antigen
has been eliminated from the body.”
So, you can see that these helper cells are very, very important. In other words, if
this T cell function is not operating, then obviously you’re opening up a human being
to very, very serious infection, and serious infection at the level that nobody
particularly would like to deal with.
Finally, we have the “Regulatory T cells (also known as suppressor T cells) and they
suppress activation of the immune system and maintain immune system
homeostasis. Failure of regulatory T cells to function properly may result in
autoimmune diseases,” and again that is when you cannot adjust for coolness with
the thermostat, “in which the immunocytes attack healthy cells in the body.”
So, these T cells can be loose cannons. In other words, they’re very, very
destructive. And obviously, the proper development of the thymus and the proper
relationship of the thymus to the spleen and the lymphatic system is something
that’s absolutely essential. “Every effective immune response involves T cell
activation.” The language is very clear; every effective immune response involves T
cell activation. “However, T cells are especially important in cell-mediated immunity,
which is the defense against tumor cells and pathogenic organisms inside body cells.
They are also involved in rejection reactions.”
The CD4, the helper T cells, and the CD8, the cytotoxic “refer to the characteristic
antigens on the surface of the different sub-types of the T-lymphocytes. These CD
molecules are convenient diagnostic markers for identifying and quantifying these
cells by flow cytometry using specific antibodies against them.” The complexity of
the defense mechanism that is there, and the thing that’s so interesting about the
relationship between the way the 26 works and the way the 44 works is the
difference between awareness and lack of awareness. It’s really rather fascinating,
in that sense.
When you’re dealing with a T cell, there are certain capacities for recognition, but the
real capacity is to be effective as some kind of counterforce, to be able to attack, to
be able to cleanse, to get rid of things. This is very different from the way in which
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

144
LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
the 44 operates, because the 44 is going to operate out of something else. It’s going
to operate out of intelligence. Of course, that intelligence is simply rooted in
memory. When I say intelligence, our computer world, as an example, there is a
level of intelligence, and that level of intelligence is based on memory. The larger
the memory, the more accessible the memory, the greater the ability for the
memory to integrate with information, the more intelligent we see the development
of artificial intelligence. This is very different from the work of the thymus and the
Ego. There is this force there. And it is a very, very powerful force.
T Cell Development
“Throughout life, the source of all lymphocytes is the bone marrow.” That’s
something Andrea and I have been discussing. “Progeny of multipotential lymphoid
stem cells that are destined to become T cells, move into the thymus where they are
called thymocytes.” So, throughout the life process, once all of this has been
constructed, that the way in which they’re replenished, the way the T cells are
replenished, is that they’re replenished out of the bone marrow. Bone marrow is
also something that is of enormous importance for us to look at in terms of what
we’re going to see when we get down into the deeper levels of analysis and what the
chains are going to be to lead in these various directions.
The Motor of Competition. Again, from this description you can begin to see what is
really meant by that. And again to see the power that is there in the Ego system.
And to understand that competition from the point of view that there is a hierarchy,
and there is a deep, deep, deep challenge to survival that takes place at the microbe
level long before we are conscious of it at a self-reflected consciousness level when
we emerge into this world and are inculcated in the maya.
It really is something to keep in mind in looking at these stages, at some point when
you go through and you review your material, it’s very important to go back, once
we’ve traveled through, for example, this general introduction in the first semester,
to really go back and bring a new insight to each of these things that we have been
discussing. One of the most important ones is to go back to Stage V and to Stage VI
and to see the essential importance in these stages in terms of the way in which our
immune system is going to operate.
The Spleen
Let’s move along now to the Spleen. When we’re looking at the Spleen you can see
Stage VI, 20 degrees. Think about how little that space is. I very much enjoyed
Andrea’s workshop and thinking about the complexity of what actually is taking place
and to realize how quickly it’s actually taking place. There is this extraordinary
bursting of energy; it’s quite an amazing thing. When we look at the relationship
between the establishment of the Ego, the Heart Center, and the establishment of
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
145
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
the Splenic Center, they’re taking place 2 degrees of the Sun apart. Two degrees—
we’re dealing with less than 48 hours. So, it’s an extraordinary thing.
But it also says that the closeness of that time relationship also has to do with how
intertwined these two processes are. How deeply connected they are to each other.
Remember something, in a general way, I don’t want to be too specific with this, but
it is important to think of it for a moment, when you’re looking at the grid that’s
created through the 10 stages, when you’re looking at the channels that form the
essential links in those grids, these are the primary channels of these connections.
They’re very, very important. This connection between the Ego and the Spleen is
one of the most important connections. By the way, that is coupled with the
connection of the 25 to the 51; they’re very much related to each other. And to
begin to see that when you’re looking at the 31/7, for example, you’re looking at the
primary linking between the Throat and the G. That isn’t to diminish the value of the
others, which is why I say to take this as a general perspective; but nonetheless, it’s
an important one.
So, we have the building of the Spleen, Stage VI, 20 degrees. This is the Theme of
Fire. That’s very interesting. It’s the theme of fire, but this is not the fire center;
the fire center is the Heart Center. But the immune system cannot be built without
it, which is why they follow each other right after each other in this movement.
Obviously, the Theme of Fear is something that we immediately interpret as fear on
the surface, fear the way we talk about the Splenic system, for example in Rave
Psychology where it is the language of the various fears of the awareness center.
But this is a theme of fear at a much deeper level.

146
LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
I don’t think there is any other gate that carries a deeper recognition of the historical
vulnerability of being bio-form than the 44. The 44 is an extraordinary thing. Many
people who have the 44 take offense with the manipulative descriptions of the 44.
But it’s only because of the way in which their not-self psychology operates. The
fact is that this 44 is an absolute essential instrument, this manipulation of the
temperature, what happens to that potential when it’s integrated with this 56, when
you have the quantum of these two factors, and how significant it is. The 44th gate
is fear of the past, but it carries the past. It carries the past because it is the heart
and soul of our memory; and not our memory as we experience it in self-reflected
consciousness, but the actual memory of the essence of what we are, our chemical
memory.
The Spleen
So, we come to the Spleen and here you can see this illustration. They say “shaped
much like a loose fist.” It doesn’t look like that to me; it looks liverish to me. But
anyway, “and tucked under the left side of the diaphragm, the spleen is the most
ignored—interesting—and misunderstood of all organs.” Isn’t that interesting; just
on the surface, what a statement that is. “After all, we read numerous times that
somebody in an automobile accident or a in a fight has a ruptured spleen, so the
spleen is removed (splenectomy) and life goes on. What we don’t read about is that
the splenectomized people later have problems with overwhelming bacterial
infections of the blood (sepsis). What does this suggest as the function of the
spleen?”
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
147
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Obviously, it’s a defense against bacterial infections. “The spleen receives blood
from an artery off of the aorta. After passing through an intricate meshwork of tiny
blood vessels, the blood continues to the liver.” The interesting thing about a liver is
that the liver is in the G Center in the 25th gate. That’s the liver. So again, these
two stages are very, very important in the way in which they work together.
“The blood vessels of the spleen are surrounded by nests of B lymphocytes.” This is
a very important distinction. That is, the T cells are coming from the 26 and are
coming from the Heart Center; the B cells are coming from the Splenic system and
are coming from the 44th gate. They are “mainly of the memory type.” And this is
one of the keys in understanding how profound the capacity is of the 44th gate.
“As the blood slowly moves through the spleen, it is monitored by T cells for any
non-self invaders. If some suspicious cell or molecule is detected, it is presented to
the resident B cells for a match to an appropriate memory B cell. Once the matching
B cell is activated, the cell divides rapidly and begins producing antibodies directed
against the invading antigen.”
Now, think about this relationship between the T cells out of the 26, and the B cells.
The T cell is the killer that’s always on guard. The moment it notices something that
it doesn’t recognize, it’s a B cell—memory—it’s the B cell that goes through the
process of identifying it, seeing if it can match it to a past history. If it can’t do so,
then it prepares for the elimination of whatever that happens to be. There is this
remarkable relationship that is there in this channel.
“The spleen blood vessels are also lined with macrophages which swallow and digest
debris in the blood such as worn out red blood cells and platelets. In a disease such
as mononucleosis, the macrophages in the spleen become overactive and trap a
higher number of white blood cells. In the process, the spleen becomes swollen or
may even rupture.”
Profiling the Fetal Process in Stage V and Stage VI
So again this is a vacuum cleaner aspect of it. I always talk about the Splenic
system as the body’s laundry, as its washing machine. And like any washing
machine there can be dysfunction. One of the things that we’re going to have to
look at very, very carefully is to look at the profiling of what happens in the fetal
process in Stage V and Stage VI because it’s going to tell us a great deal, and it’s
going to reveal a great deal about the stability, the health of the way in which the
immune system operates. What is interesting is that more than that, what it’s going
to tell us about whether or not the openness on the surface is an indication of a
problem, or the indication of a potential problem because of the nature of those
beings that are brought in as conditioning forces.
Somebody who doesn’t have the 44th gate, I’m convinced that their splenic system
can operate in a very healthy way as long as they interact with healthy conditioning.
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
148
LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
That conditioning is going to be relative; it’s going to be relative to the Design of the
beings that they have to deal with, the quality of that relationship whether it’s
correct or not. But it’s obvious to me that the triggers to many, many, many
diseases, where in fact they could lie dormant, or latent, or whatever, or that there
is this theoretical potential that so much of that is brought to the surface because of
contact with the other.
I think that one of the healthiest things we do for anyone is that we align them to
what is their correct strategy and authority in this life. It is part of the process of
aligning the system. Obviously, when we’re dealing with adults we’re dealing with
another problem. And of course, this is the age that we happen to be in now in
terms of Human Design’s development. The vast majority of human beings that are
connected to this knowledge are adults. The de-conditioning process and the
alignment to what is correct isn’t necessarily going to be able to eliminate what have
been serious problems that have been initiated before they entered into that
process. We do have to keep that in mind.
One of the things we will be able to do is that there are certain therapeutic things
that I think is clear that we’re going to be able to do to help adults who are going
through the de-conditioning process, who have physical problems that we can
provide them with certain therapies and approaches that can benefit them. But my
real direction and goal in laying out PHS is to go much deeper. In other words, to
lay the foundation of being able to provide proper health care from conception
onward, individual health care. No more of this homogenization. But we do have to
understand the process.
We do need to have enough samples of conception data—and again, every time I ask
for more I get a couple in in trickles, but I am interested in any conception data that
you can give me associated with the child once it’s born, its Design, the parents,
these are the kinds of things that are going to be very important for us. The
statistical examination of Stages V and VI relative to the development of children
and their immune system is something that is going to be enormously important.
It also means that if it is clear that there are certain kinds of dysfunction we can
discover in Stage V and Stage VI, that that dysfunction, there may be a way to
ameliorate that. It is a possibility that we can eliminate a lot of immune system
weakness simply by understanding how it actually operates particularly in Stage V
and Stage VI. It is going to tell us so much. It’s going to tell a lot more than we can
learn from the adult going backwards through their medical history. In other words,
this will really let us see whether or not these problems are problems that are
inherited problems, genetically speaking, or whether these are problems that are
created by conditioning. I think that there is a difference between certain kinds of
what become dysfunctions that are initiated by conditioning.
I don’t want to speculate on that publicly because I think that’s dangerous. I want to
be able to see what research can do for us. And obviously, when we’re dealing with
trying to understand the impact on stages of pre-natal development, until we have
enough data, it’s going to be very difficult to jump to conclusions unless it is so
clearly obvious.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
B cells: The Spleen’s Google
What I think is of real value in dealing with the material and seeing that these
associations that are there both in what we call the Splenic system and what we call
the Heart Center, that there is extraordinary correlation in terms of the way in which
these function in terms of biology. What I do think is enormously important is to
grasp what a B cell is really all about. I don’t just simply see them as identifiers.
They’re kind of the Spleen’s Google, they Google to see if they know that particular
is suspicious cell or molecule. And they go in and they search for it.
But there’s something extraordinary about that. I’m convinced that the way in which
a B cell goes about its business identifying the potentially suspicious cellular
molecule is an extension of the way in which our brain, the neo-cortex, searches for
and codifies information about what it has experienced. It’s clear to me that the
development, the building of this stage, the building of the Splenic system, one also
has to see that if this is not functioning correctly, it’s not simply going to have an
impact on the way in which the immune system’s intelligence is going to operate, but
it’s going to have an impact on the overall intelligence of how the being is going to
operate.
Levels of Intelligence
It’s obvious to all of us, isn’t it, that there are many levels of intelligence in the
world. Many levels of intelligence. Why? It’s a good question. Why are there
different levels of intelligence? I think there are different levels of intelligence and
it’s rooted here in the Spleen, and it’s rooted in the lymphatic system, and it’s rooted
in these B cells, it’s rooted in memory. It is this memory capacity that is so
important. For me, this stage, particularly the 6th stage where you make this bridge,
the 2 degrees, to make this jump, that basically what you’re establishing here is the
potential intelligence overall. Not simply the microbe identifying intelligence—and
remember, think about how complex that is for the B cell. We’re talking about a cell
now. That cell has to not only take in the information of what the suspicious cell or
molecule is, they then have to go back into some kind of stored filing cabinets, they
have to know where they stored that kind of cell or that kind of microbe or similar
kinds of cells or microbes and then they have to go there and check through all of
those. And all of that is being done incredibly quickly.
We marvel at our ability to be able to have intelligent conversation. When I look at a
B cell I go, “Wow, isn’t that really something.” Memory is one of the most
extraordinary things. It just is; it’s the thing that makes it all work. Imagine what it
would be like. It’s practically impossible for us to think in those terms. There would
be no civilization, it would be impossible to develop. It would be impossible to
develop culturally; it just wouldn’t happen. As a matter of fact it would be very
difficult to survive, practically impossible. Memory is an enormous key. And here,
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
150
LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
this is where it is. It’s what makes the Splenic awareness center so profound. It is
the source of that memory. It is the key, after all, to what it is not simply to stay
alive, but to stay alive and to be intelligent at the same time. And that the very
intelligence is your great defense system. That’s something else.
When you look at the world today and you look at the societies that are suffering the
most, these are the most uneducated societies. Education and the development and
honing of intelligence is something that is enormously productive. It makes us
healthier. We end up having doctors, we end up having scientists, and we end up
having all of these beings who explore all of these things to make it more
pleasurable, more survivable for humanity to be in these forms. It’s all rooted in this
incredible Splenic system.
When you look at the 44th gate, Coming to Meet—isn’t that a great name when you
think about what a B cell is? It always impresses me how absolutely incredible the
revelation of the I’Ching was. This is the great gift, this identification system, this
ability to be able to recognize, this ability to know what to do when recognition takes
place. And the incredible relationship that is there between the 44th gate and the
26th gate, this so-called channel of surrender, the channel of the transmitter.
So, when we look at the form principle and we look at the way in which we operate
within the context of the Rave, we’re going to see that there are three channels, the
other two we’ll talk about next week, that really are essential for us to grasp in a
way in which they operate because they represent the underlying truly health-related
channels that we need to grasp at a very deep level. And that we need to truly
understand these gates at a very deep level. Whenever you see the lack of 26, 44 or
both, and actually I don’t think the lack of one or the other is in fact something that
is ultimately a problem other than what I said that through incorrectness it’s always
possible to have things conditioned that become negative for one physically. But I
think the real dilemma is where there is no activation whatsoever. I think it’s much
more difficult for the whole system to operate effectively. I think that’s something
that obviously has to be explored. That’s simply an opinion of mine; that is not a
stated fact.
Primary Lymphoid Organs
You can see that there are two kinds of lymphatic or lymphoid organs, there’s the
primary and the secondary. “The thymus and the bone marrow are the primary
lymphatic organs. Lymphocytes are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow, and
then migrate to either the thymus or the bone marrow where they mature. T-
lymphocytes undergo maturation in the thymus (hence their name), and B-
lymphocytes undergo maturation in the bone marrow.” Remember that the B-
lymphocytes are eventually part of the spleen itself.”
“After maturation both the B- and T-lymphocytes circulate in the lymph and
accumulate in secondary lymphoid organs where they await recognition of antigens.”
Again, you have this whole vast protective system. You’ve got the memory Bs that

151
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
can identify and match. And you’ve got the Ts that can do the dirty work, get rid of
it and all of it is being circulated in the system and all of it is out there wandering
around trying to notice if there’s anything that’s amiss.
I used to describe the lymphatic system as a kind of little ears and noses and eyes
all over the vehicle, the quality control, the border guards, they’re all over the place
and they’re watching in that sense. This is the defense mechanism. When you think
about that it’s something to grasp about the complexity of what we have with the
26/44 is that it has an influence far beyond the channel in the sense that it actually
has representation throughout the vehicle itself. In other words, if we’re ever going
to find a single channel that is the heart and core of the physical life then this is it.
In other words, this whole construct of the combination of the thymus, the T cells,
the spleen, the lymphatic system, the B cells, that all of this together through this
channel represents the heart and the core of what the physical immune system is all
about. For us, this channel is going to take on deep significance.

LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
One of the things I’ve already been doing my own experimentation with is looking at
the chains as they impact various lines of either the 26 or the 44. I’m already
caught in thinking about keynotes, immune system keynotes that can be applied in
this sense so that we can have a way of running the chains through the correct
language. But it’s already obvious to me that by the time we get down to the Tone
level, the Tone/Color/Line chain, is where we’re going to see all the various nuances
that are there in terms of the function of either the thymus and the T cells or on the
other side, the whole lymphatic system.
Secondary Lymphoid Organs
“The secondary lymphoid organs are the spleen, lymph nodes and accessory
lymphoid tissue (including the tonsils and appendix.)” Interesting about the tonsils
and appendix is that for most of the central part of the 20th Century doctors were
very anxious to take these things out of people. An awful lot of children had their
tonsils removed. I, myself, had an appendectomy. I had a burst appendix so I had
my appendix removed. Again, probably something related to the fact that I’m a 26
and not a 44 and maybe something related to my conception stages, something of
interest. There are a lot of people—it would be interesting to just collect data from
people who have had an appendix operation or not. It would give us an interesting
insight because it’s going to be related to this 44/26 configuration.
“These organs contain a scaffolding that support circulating B- and T-lymphocytes
and other immune cells like macrophages and dendritic cells. Where microorganisms
invade the body or the body encounters other antigens (such as pollen), the antigens
are transported from the tissue to the lymph. The lymph is carried in the lymph
vessels to regional lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, macrophages and dendritic
cells phagocytose the antigens, process them, and then present the antigens to
lymphocytes which can then start producing antibodies to serve as memory cells to
recognize the antigens again in the future.”
I think that’s one of the most incredible things. It’s like, how can I put that on the
surface, you capture the enemy and you interrogate them and you find out
everything you can about them in order to be able to recognize them, or the strategy
that they’re going to have the next time. It’s absolutely fantastic when you think
about what is going on in this system and the relationship between the B cell and the
T cell, this relationship, how extraordinary that is.
26/44: A Survival Mechanism
Here, when we’re looking at the 26/44 we’re looking at one of the most profound
survival mechanisms that we have. I think it’s essential for us that when we look at
the bodygraph that this is the place where we begin. In other words, from the PHS
perspective here you’re looking at what is really the central system of what is basic
well-being. Again, this relationship between the basic well-being and the

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
development of the intelligence and how important those two are in relationship to
each other, the significance, in that sense, of memory.
In looking at the lymphatic system, this is not my métier; I’m simply trying to
provide you with what I think is good overview material to just give you a sense of
what is at work here. Obviously we are going to work with a different language and
in a different way. And yet we’re dealing with this. So, the fact that we’re going to
work with Colors and Tones and so forth and so on, we still need to understand what
these basic processes are. Otherwise we are not going to have the inspiration.
When I was preparing these illustrations over the weekend I had an extraordinary
good time. I actually went through about 50 or 60 potential illustrations looking for
what I felt would be the right material. But just reading it was inspiring for me
because I read these kinds of things with our understanding, our Design
understanding. I’m translating constantly into the language of Human Design and
the way the matrix in Human Design operates. For me, every one of these little
statements is a kind of, “Yes, isn’t that fascinating,” because it’s exactly what we
have built into the system, it is precisely the way in which the system operates. We
just see it concretized in the maya and we see it expressed that way in that
language. But we need to see its deep biological relationship. We need to have a
new respect for the 26 and the 44. By the way, as you’ll see this is a complexity and
it’s not just there. As I mentioned, you can’t do that without the 25 and the 51, you
cannot do that without the 32 and the 54. It is one thing built upon the other.
I guess that’s the whole magic of the juxtaposition of a basic binary moved in space.
That slowly but surely one thing gets built on the other. You can see that in the
distinct relationship between the building of the Heart Center and the building of the
Splenic Center. And that building one upon the other gives a new dimension, gives a
new interaction; again, the quantum that’s there. Because for me in the 26/44 what
is most fascinating is not the specific values that are in each gate, that’s interesting
enough. What’s fascinating for me is the quantum of what it represents; in other
words, this very, very tricky thing about the thermostat because I really want to go
back there for a moment.
Avian Flu
When you take in all of this, even from this surface glance, and you think about the
threat that is there for humanity right now. I’m speaking specifically of Avian Flu.
Here we have a situation in which the 26th gate has been activated for years, and
activated by the force that is running this whole cycle. Many of you know that in
1781 when the nine-centered process began, Pluto was in the 41st gate which is the
initiating codon, and in 2027 Pluto will return to the 41st gate. So we’re dealing with
a Plutonic cycle. Every aspect that it hits along the way is obviously significant,
these are ingredients as Pluto goes around the wheel in introducing this new cycle
that we’re coming to, this new mutative process; in other words, the mutation of
ultimately the Solar Plexus system.

154
LESSON SEVEN: The Vehicle’s Immune System
Part of this process also has to do with the fact that if one realistically looks at the
way in which the program has laid out, it is clear that humanity is going to become
more fragile. It’s going to become more fragile in a number of ways. It is going to
become less fertile. And in becoming less fertile obviously is the dilemma of not
being able to replenish the specie at an acceptable rate.
But I think much more a part of this deterioration, if you will, is a breakdown in the
immune system. I think that the impact of Pluto in the 26th gate is going to bring
long-term difficulties to the immune system. Where it emerges is not so much in the
26th gate, but where it really emerges is in the quantum of the defining of the 26 to
the 44. It’s in that place that the thermostat is being adjusted.
If Pluto is setting a temperature that when it meets the 44 is going to lead to
immune disease problems, is going to lead to whatever the various accumulation of
things are going to be, it is clear to me that not only has Pluto been instrumental in
infecting the avian population, and when I say infecting, diminishing their own
immune system capacity. My concerns are not simply what we are calling now bird
flu, avian flu, that is only one of the connections that is taking place. Among
amphibians, for example, which is part of this form, world-wide frogs are dying.
They’re dying from a fungus and a fungus that their immune system cannot combat.
We have the rise of, and I’m clear that it’s going to come about, the immune system
problems in the fish population. These are all things that are the work of Pluto.
Finding Ways to Strengthen the Immune System
The by-product of that is that there is a diminished quality to the human immune
system. I think that being able to understand how the 26/44 operates within our
world, within our language, within our matrix, I think that there are possibilities that
we can find ways to strengthen what is otherwise a deteriorating immune system.
For me, one of the most important aspects of this work is to really understand the
detrimental impact of what is taking place right now and not so much in terms of
what we’re going to see in those of us that are experiencing it as a transit, but what
it will mean to those who are going to experience it as fixed activations in their
Design and what the effect is going to be on their descendants on what they pass
through with their genetic memory onto the next generation, and the next
generation, and so forth and so on.
It is clear to me that we are entering into an age in which we are going to be very
much threatened at the microbe level and that there is a deep need to find ways to
make the immune system healthy. Rather than approaching it from what is intrusive
chemistry and all of the things that scientists are trying to do to adjust to this basic
deterioration, I think there are ways for us to do this holistically. But in order to do
anything holistically, you have to have an extraordinary insight and awareness of the
way in which something functions and you need to have proper and practical tools to
make a difference.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
So this today, I hope that wasn’t whatever—I’m sure it’s not necessarily what you
expected, but I really wanted to give you a deeper sense of the biology associated
with this channel so that there really is a grasp on your part of how significant it is
and this, for us, in terms of any generalized goal that we can have as practitioners of
this knowledge, is that at least there is something we can do about benefiting the
human immune system. I think a deep understanding of the Heart and the Splenic
system in relationship to the correct operation of one physically, and any kind of
therapy that we can do to align the vehicle to what is its correct Color, I think we can
have remarkable results in terms of being able to do something to truly strength the
immune system.
Being Careful with Liquids We Ingest
My real fear is that a great deal of the things that are being done by non-exoteric
doctors, there’s a lot of things that people are being recommended to do. And a
great many of them are either ingesting tablets of this or that or drinking liquid
concoctions of this and that, and one of the first thing that any surface
understanding of Design Color points to is that liquids are very specific and are of
value only to a specific kind and are not something that are to be generalized. I
have a real concern that so many of the proffered holistic naturalist healing things
are actually doing more harm than good. What I care about is that we have the
combination of understanding how something operates and having a legitimate
approach to how we can deal with dysfunction in it.
I hope that you’ve enjoyed this particular lecture. I think that for many of you it is
an introduction to this level of looking at aspects of Design. But as I said, it’s one
that’s necessary and I think you’ll find as we move along that it is a real value to
have this kind of understanding. The other thing that I would recommend is, this
may not be your favorite material to go through, but I think that in the context of
PHS it is essential reading at some level. Now that you see it in relationship to
Design and in relationship to many of the Design aspects of the way in which the
26/44 operates, I suggest you do what I did and have a good Google and take a look
at and read over information relative to what I’ve shown you today. And make sure
that you have your own grasp of that. Nobody is asking you to be a biologist or a
doctor. However, this is our business to understand the physical domain and it is
important material to cover.

Lesson Eight
The Health Channels
The Thyroid and Parathyroid
If you go back a long time, if you go back to Martin’s generation, which is going right
back to the beginning when I first started to teach in 1992, I used to talk about
different kinds of channels, the social channels, and one of those channels that I
talked about were the Health Channels, the Health Channels as they were described
to me. Today we’re going to have an interesting journey through the Health
Channels and the thyroid system.
I’m going to begin with a little background for you. As I mentioned, as we have
been going over in the last couple of weeks, I’ve been getting into the biology of
things and again this first semester is very much about giving you a good grounding
in an overview. Obviously, it’s no attempt of teaching you any of this biological
information in depth, but it’s really there to inspire you to think differently, think out
of the box, think within the context or the matrix of Design, but have a background
in understanding of the mechanisms that are there.
The first thing to understand is that when we’re talking about the thyroid gland and
we’re talking about the parathyroid gland, we’re actually not talking about the same
thing and it’s very important to understand. The parathyroid is a totally different
thing. It literally is hugging, if you will, the thyroid itself.
When we’re looking at the Throat Center, that we lump that under the category of
thyroid and parathyroid, I think most people assume that they’re the same thing,
and they’re really not. The parathyroid is not some kind of an extension, in that
sense, directly of the thyroid, but is its own glandular system itself. As a matter of
fact, there are four aspects, or four nodes to this parathyroid gland. So, when we’re
looking at the Throat Center I want you to understand that we have these two very
distinct functions that are there, both of which, as you’ll see, are very important.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Health Channels: 57/20 and 48/16
In terms of the Health Channels, these are the Health Channels: the 57/20 and the
48/16. We’re dealing with the two channels that are going to connect the lymphatic
system and the Spleen directly with the thyroid and the parathyroid. So we have a
fundamental relationship here; and under that very broad terminology, the Health
Channels.
One of the things that makes them so interesting as Health Channels, if we think
about our discussion of the immune system and the relationship between the Heart
Center and the Splenic Center, if you get to the end of the 10th Stage and you look at
the Spleen, you see that at the end of the 10th Stage, 88 degrees of the Sun since
conception, approximately, if it’s a normal pregnancy, one-third of the pregnancy,
there is no channel 48/16; there is no channel 57/20. Something that is very
important to grasp about these channels is that they are going to be very much
involved with surface health, the health of the quantum illusion.
It’s something interesting to think about. That is, we have two basic aspects. We
have a crystal that is going to manifest the bio-genetic nature of the vehicle, and we
have a crystal that’s going to manifest the way in which consciousness potentially
works within that vehicle. So, that we only have one aspect that’s directly connected
to the form principle of the vehicle itself. Yet, the moment that we bring them

158
LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
together in the quantum, the whole illusion becomes subject to well-being or lack of
well-being.
This is where, in the illusion, these two channels take on their importance because
they are, in fact, the way in which the illusion can be maintained in a healthy
manner. But, we have a long way to go before we can come back to that theme.
The Thyroid Gland
So, let’s take a short look here at the thyroid gland. “In anatomy, the thyroid is the
largest endocrine gland in the body. It is situated in the front side of the neck. Just
below the laryngeal prominence (Adam’s apple), near the thyroid cartilage over the
trachea, but covered by layers of skin and muscle. The thyroid is quite large for an
endocrine gland, 15–40 grams in adults, and butterfly shaped. The wings
correspond to the lobes and the body to the isthmus of the thyroid. Normally, it is
larger during menstruation and in pregnant women.”
The basic thing is where it is; this is very much a Throat operation. All of this is here
in the Throat Center. “The primary function of the thyroid is the production of
hormones: thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and calcitonin, which regulates
calcium-phosphorus metabolism.” We’ll get back to calcium because this is one of
the main stories here.
“The production of these hormones is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone
(TSH), released by the pituitary.” We’ll also talk about that. We’re going to see the
interrelationship between the Throat and all things. That’s something that’s very,
very interesting about the way in which the throat has to operate and the way in
which it has to move information.
“The gland is composed of spherical follicles that selectively absorb iodine, (more
correctly iodide ions) from the blood stream and concentrated for the production of
thyroid hormones. Twenty-five percent of all the body iodine is in the thyroid gland.”
So, this is one of the things that is so important about understanding the thyroid
system, is its relationship to iodine. As we’re going to see, we have here in the
48/16, we have the stream of salt. The archetype of that happens to be the 18th
gate. But the salt theme operates through this, what we understand as this logical
stream of judgmentation.
So here is just the basic. What I want you to keep in mind is that when we’re
dealing with the thyroid, the thyroid is sending out information. It’s sending out
information for a number of specific goals. But the most important goal is to
regulate and control the metabolism of the vehicle. So, the Throat is truly—I used to
describe it as the place where all roads met, the Rome of the bodygraph. This is
really a very, very important central mechanism in all of that.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Causes of Thyroid Problems
My next slide, an illustration here of the thyroid system itself. “The causes of thyroid
problems. In the areas of the world where iodine—essential for the production of
thyroxine—is lacking in the diet, the thyroid gland can be considerably enlarged
resulting in swollen necks, or endemic goiter.” If you go back into history a couple of
hundred years ago, goiter problems was something that was pretty much universal.
When you think about it, and it’s one of the things that is so fascinating to think
about, is that the most ancient general currency was salt. Salt has had enormous
importance to humanity. So, thyroxine, and in terms of thryoxine, you need the
right amount of iodine. “Thryoxine is critical to the regulation of metabolism and
growth.”
Again, you’re dealing with something very basic. Remember, we’re talking about the
illusion. I want you to keep that in mind. This is not underneath the line. We’re not
dealing with Color, Tone, Chain, Bases; we are on the surface in the illusion. Of
course, it’s the illusion that grows, if I can put it that way. It is the sum of the parts;
this whole illusion has to grow. This instrument of communication, thyroxine, is
critical for that regulation of the metabolism and growth.

LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
It’s so “throughout the animal kingdom. Among amphibians, for example,
administering a thyroid blocking agent, such as propylthiouracil can prevent tadpoles
from metamorphosing into frogs. Conversely, administering thyroxine will trigger
metamorphosis.” So, when we think about the Throat Center, we think about a
center of metamorphosis and transformation, particularly when we’re dealing with
the metamorphic gates, and they’re referred to specifically in Human Design as
metamorphic gates. That is, the 62nd gate, the 23rd gate, and the 56th gate, which
are absolutely essential for us.
So you can see that without a proper balance of thyroxine, then we’re going to have
difficulty in metamorphosis, which means that it may be difficult to understand
things, it may be difficult to express things, it may be difficult to grasp or make
sense out of things simply because there is not enough capacity for metamorphosis
as we understand it within the language of the Throat in Design.
“In humans, children born with thyroid hormone deficiency will not grow well, and
brain development can be severely impaired in the condition referred to as cretinism.
Newborn children in many developed countries are now routinely tested for thyroid
hormone deficiency and this is done by analysis of a small drop of blood from the
child. Children with thyroid hormone deficiency are easily treated by
supplementation with synthetic thyroxine which enables them to grow and develop
normally.”
“Because of the thyroid selective uptake and extreme concentration of what is
actually a quite rare element, it is extremely sensitive to the effects of various
radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission.” It’s one of those things,
one of the horror stories of Chernobyl-type events where you have an incredible
release of these radioactive isotopes, that it’s well-documented that the first place
they go is directly to the thyroid and you end up with thyroid-related cancers.
It’s always so fascinating, when you think about the iodine and the rarity of the
element, it’s something to consider that the element itself is only available on earth
because there has been a whole generation of stars that died and seeded the rest of
the cosmos with this kind of higher value element. It’s always fascinating to
understand how much time it takes so that all of the particular aspects of what can
provide the spark of consciousness, that in order for that to take place, this
enormous chain of events that has to take place at a macrocosmic level, let alone
within the constraints of the body.
The next thing we have come to here is to understand that metabolism in growth is
what this Throat Center is going to be all about. So, when we talk about
manifestation, it’s one of the things to understand as a general term, I’m not
speaking specifically of Manifestors. Everybody gets to manifest what is their
fundamental Design in that way, we all get to grow, and we all have metabolisms.
And most of this is not something that exists in the basic infrastructure when it’s
built. This is really my point to think about tonight.
In other words, the way in which this is going to operate on the surface, is going to
be very, very connected to the elements we’re most concerned with on the surface in

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Design. That is, conditioning and the control of one’s decision making by the not-self
because that’s going to lead to dysfunction in these Health Channels particularly.
Parathyroid and Calcium Regulation
We have the parathyroid and calcium regulation. This is something that is extremely
important. If you look over here in this illustration, because in this one it’s not
highlighted, you can see that there are four circles here. This represents the four
aspects of the parathyroid system. You can see that it’s basically wrapping itself
around where the actual thyroid is.
“Calcium is essential to life and is used primarily for three things:
1. To provide the electrical energy for our nervous system”—think about that in the
relationship between the Throat Center and the Solar Plexus system—“to provide the
electrical energy for our nervous system. The most important thing that calcium
does in a human body is to provide the means for electrical impulses to travel along
nerves. Calcium is what the nervous system of our body uses to conduct electricity.
This is why the most common systems of parathyroid disease and high calcium levels
are related to the nervous system: Depression, weakness, tiredness, etc.”
“2. To provide the electrical energy for our muscular system.” Think about the
Throat in a different way now, because what we’re really talking about is kind of like
an electrical junction and the necessary electricity. You can only have that necessary
electricity if you have a proper calcium regulation. “Just like the nerves in our bodies
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

162
LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
our muscles use changes in calcium levels inside the cells to provide the energy to
contract. When the calcium levels are not correct, people can feel weak and have
muscle cramps.”
“3. To provide strength to our skeletal system. Everyone knows that calcium is
used to make our bones strong. But this is really only half the story. The bones
themselves serve as a storage system that we use to make sure we always have a
good supply of calcium, just like a bank vault where we constantly make deposits
and withdrawals. We’re constantly putting calcium into our bones and constantly
taking calcium out of our bones, all in small amounts, with the SOLE PURPOSE of
keeping our calcium levels in the blood at the correct level. Remember, the MOST
IMPORTANT role of calcium is to provide for proper functioning of our nervous
system, not to provide strength to our bones; that is secondary.”
This electrical facility of the way in which the parathyroid functions, this is something
that is extremely important. And we’ll see that as we move along.
The Thyroid System, the Pituitary Glands and the Hypothalamus
That was my little biological preamble. I really want to look into another area of the
way in which all of this fits together because there is—the language that I’ve used
for many years in working with understanding lines, understanding how lines operate
in gates, is a term called genetic continuity. That is, there are underlying themes.
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
163
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
One of the things that you always discover the moment that you get into
professional analysis is that the moment you’re reading somebody’s chart, it seems
that all of the various parts belong to each other. You begin to read lines that have
obvious relationships to each other, themes begin to appear; certain things keep on
repeating, even if they’re not in the same lines or harmonies, there are certain
things in the genetic continuity of the whole that you can just see that. One of
things to understand about something as profound as the thyroid system is that it is
not limited to some kind of one-way street where it is the be-all and the end-all and
everything goes there. There are many relationships that are involved.
In the illustration here, is the relationship and the relationship between the thyroid
system and the pituitary glands and the hypothalamus. If you look here at the end
of the 10th Stage, and it’s something to keep in mind, that one of the things to
understand is that it is essential that these aspects are there at the end of the 10th
Stage in order to control at least the information, the need for the information, that
the thyroid needs in order to be able to produce thyroxine, the information it needs
from the pituitary. “The pituitary gland located in the base of the brain produces
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).” So, it is this connection to the pituitary, to the
thyroid system is very important.
Obviously, for us, this is a connection between the Ajna Center and the Throat
Center. The reason that I bring this up is that I want you to realize that, of course,
when we’re dealing with the thyroid-parathyroid system we’re dealing with all 11
gates. And that the very complexity of all those 11 gates is a reflection of how
profound and how important this whole system actually is. In other words, there are
many different chains that are involved in all of this.
“The hypothalamus, the small part of the brain above the pituitary, produces
thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH).” This is a whole process that is taking place
above the Throat. Now, we’re going to be looking at things that are going on below
the Throat, but I do want you to grasp how complex the interrelationship is and how
important it is that when you’re looking at this basic 10-stage matrix, you’re looking
at out of which everything else has to develop.
One of the earliest and most important connections is this connection between the
Ajna Center and the Throat because this is the early alignment of the pituitary and
the thyroid system which obviously, with the ability to stimulate thyroid hormone, is
the ability to stimulate the metabolism, the balanced metabolism and the growth
necessary for the fetus to grow, for the fetus ultimately to become human and to go
through that whole process.
The Lymphatic System and the Thyroid System
I love this picture. It’s one of those—I don’t know where I got that, I think I got that
from Gray’s Anatomy; they do have these wonderful illustrations. It’s a great form
of art, actually. What you’re looking at is all of the various lymphatic glands that are
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
164
LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
in the throat and face, connected to the tongue and the lips and the larynx, and all of
these various things that make up what we think of as throat.
Think about it this way. From the 17th gate to the 11th gate, this is where the eyes
are. This illustration is a graphic presentation. This is basically where it stops here.
And this is really all about the throat function. And yet, to understand that all of
these are lymphatic glands that are getting their information from this source down
here.
What I want to illustrate is the relationship between the lymphatic system and the
thyroid system, and to understand how important this relationship is. It’s interesting
to think about it in the sense of, you could not articulate, you could not use your
tongue properly without this relationship between the Splenic system and the Throat
Center.
When we look at the channel 16/48, what are we looking at? We’re looking at
supposedly the gate of depth, the 48th gate and the gate of skills, the 16th gate.
One of the things that is so interesting for me is that this channel, this so-called
channel of talent, that it’s obvious to me that this is the direct connection on the
surface between the function of the lymph system and its ability to function in a
coordinated manner with the thyroid; in other words, in order for us to operate in a
healthy way out of this Throat Center. This is a very important relationship between
the two.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The 57/20
I’ll move to the next illustration; I’ll come back to these as we go along, but I want
to introduce the basic information first. Now, here we have the other side of the
story. Here we have the Spleen. Again, the thyroid here and what we’re looking at
is the Stage VI that we were looking at in terms of the building of the Splenic
system.
What it says: “The thyroid is often blamed for systems actually brought about by
spleen deficiency.” So, the relationship between the Splenic system and the thyroid
is operating through the 57/20. “Even though in tests thyroid hormones appear to
be out of proportion. The thyroid functions using the energy that the Spleen
produces. Its purpose is very much like a capacitor in an electrical circuit—and think
about our calcium—it absorbs electricity and at a certain point, predetermined by the
capacity of the capacitor, releases it. This is normally done at very regular intervals
and establishes the metabolism of the body.”
“If there is too little energy to work with, the thyroid actually has to work much
harder to keep the metabolism constant.” So, energy is one of the most important
things, this electrical energy, if you will. “The over-working of the thyroid creates a
depletion of the thyroid, which appears by conventional wisdom as a thyroid
problem. If the available energy is increased to normal functioning levels, the

LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
thyroid can then relax again at its normal working pace and thyroid hormone levels
balance out.”
So we’re dealing with two very separate things here. But my first comment is about
the energy. This is one of the most interesting things about the Health Channels and
understanding that these are projected. In other words, there is no motor.
Obviously, if there is no motor then the concept of energy movement is something
that is questionable. Let’s think about it for a moment.
The key to what it is to be a Projector is recognition, recognition and being
recognized. My assumption is that, diagnostically speaking, that it is in these
channels, that on the surface we are designed to give off very clear warnings of lack
of well-being so that we can be helped. But it is clear to me that this key to
recognition, to recognize one’s well-being—for example, even though you don’t know
what you’re really testing, as an example, if these functions operate correctly most
functions will. In other words, they’re that important to the way in which we
operate.
But it’s clear to me that when you look at the 57/20, or you look at the 48/16, they
are not there in the infrastructure when the infrastructure is built. When the
infrastructure is built, the Spleen and the lymphatic system is powered by the
channel 44/26. It is powered by the Heart system.
By the way, I could draw an extraordinary triangle here and link up the Heart with
the Throat. If you have thyroid dysfunction, it immediately is going to impact on
your Heart. So, one of the things to see is that the energy source for the viability,
the consistent viability of Spleen and lymph is that the primary source of that is
here, because this is where it originated from. It’s something to think about.
Looking at the First 10 Stages
If we take a look here in this illustration, when we look at the basic structure, when
we’re looking at the first 10 stages in the upper left, think about what you’re really
looking at. If we think about the basic functions that exist in terms of the biological
associations that we affiliate with each of these centers, so for example when we are
talking about the Heart Center, one of the things to see is that there is no, for
example, 21st gate, there is no 40th gate. Now, the 21st gate is the heart muscle; the
40th gate is the stomach. Now, it isn’t to say that they’re not there. It’s one of the
things that is so interesting for me in the way in which I understand centers because
of course within our body there aren’t any channels, there are locks and keys, and
there are receptors. I imagine centers as having sort of like little nodules on them
that fire across or not.
If you look at the Spleen in that illustration and you see that there are only two
gates out of the Spleen, the 44 and the 32, all of those other gates are there, but
they’re there in a dormant kind of form. In other words, they’re developing. But,
they haven’t flowered, if I can put it that way. The way in which they’re being
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

167
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
organized is that they derive from the source gates, if I can use that kind of
language.
So, in other words, when we’re looking at any of the biologys of the centers, and
then we look at any of the channels, we also have to see that these channels have a
secondary function that is about how it’s going to operate on the surface. After all,
these 10 stages of development, the first 88 degrees, set the infrastructure platform.
Everything else is a growth out of that. And everything is a growth out of that in
order to be equipped in the life. In other words, to be equipped by the time one
emerges into the world.
So, here when we’re looking at, for example, the 48th gate or the 57th gate, we really
have to see something about them, in many ways they owe their viability, the
Spleen and the lymph owes a great deal to the 44/26 and the 32/54 because it’s out
of those two sources of energy that replenish the required energy demands of the
Spleen and the lymph. You can see that the Spleen and the lymphatic system are
not so much designed to take in energy as they are designed to move information.
The only way they can do their job is that they need to be energized. So that the
primary energy is coming from the way in which the immune system was developed
in the first place. And this is basically what my point is.

168
LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
In other words, that when we look at the 10 stages of development we’re going to
see that the way in which the 44/26 develops, directly related to that is the way in
which there is going to be function, or dysfunction in the way in which these two
Health Channels operate. In other words, the way in which the lymphatic system
and the thyroid work together, and the way in which the Spleen and the parathyroids
work together, is all going to be built on what takes place at this level.
So, it’s very important for us, again, to think about the significance of these 10
stages of development. Because when we look at these stages of development, we
need to see that we’re looking at foundation processes that are linking forces
together. The interesting thing about the emergence of the 48 and the 57 is that
they become a straight line to the Throat. These are the only direct connections
between the Throat and the Splenic Center.
In a way, it is the body being efficient in a sense. In other words, rather than having
to go through the spiral process of going around this way, this whole movement to
get from the Throat here down to the Spleen, that here suddenly we have the
completion of this process. And as I showed you, you can actually make a triangle
that by-passes the G Center once there’s development, this triangle out of the 45/21
down here to the 26/44 and then back up. In both cases, in fact, forming two
different triangles with the same points at either end; all of this is rooted in the
nature of the immune system when the immune system is first established. For me,
that’s something that is deeply fascinating.
Salt
So let’s look here for a
moment. Salt—everything
about our ability to be
able to judge a pattern
and to be able to judge
the future, all of that is
about salt. It is about the
proper balance of salt in
the body. Obviously,
we’ve seen the
importance of iodine. But
I want to look at that from
another level.
Remember that the
Spleen is an awareness
center. And as an
awareness center, particularly through the activity of the 50th gate, that out of the
50th gate starts the process of the potential of intelligence. Intelligence rooted in
survival strategies. So, we actually have three channels that are deeply involved in
survival strategies: the 26/44, as we have seen and these two channels that we’re
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

169
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
looking at today. This is all about being able to survive in a healthy manner on the
surface.
In order for us to have judgmental intelligence about the future—let’s put it this way.
So much about being healthy is about the pattern that you follow in your life. If you
follow a pattern that abuses your body, whatever the case may be, then ultimately
it’s going to lead to problems. Of course, when I speak in the language of pattern,
I’m speaking in the language of the whole logic system. And we know very well that
the 15/5 is a fundamental aspect of the 10 stages.
So, when we’re dealing with the 48 and the 16, what we’re looking at is our ability to
be able to have strategies that are healthy for us in the future. We’re not looking
now at the 57/20 which is all about the existential well-being, which is something
else. The 16/48—I’ve always had this feeling that the best quality of this is trying to
heal the collective immune system. The way we look after the collective immune
system—I watched that today. Today was really interesting for me.
Pluto Entering into the 11th Gate
On the first of February 2001, Pluto entered into the 26th gate and I started my
process of concerns. By the way, do think about something, that before Pluto was in
the 26th gate it was for three years in the 5th gate. When you think about that, and
you think about the fact that whatever the threats to the global immune system that
have arisen out of Pluto in the 26th, the foundation was set cellularly when Pluto was
in the 5. The foundation was set deeply when Pluto was in the 5 impacting on every
cell that every human being and every living thing has.
I can remember the discussions, the various things I did to talk about Pluto in the 5
in that era, and then the transformation of Pluto in the 26. Now, isn’t it interesting,
Pluto goes from the 26 to the 11—that just happened a couple of days ago.
Somebody sent me an email and said, “Is the threat over?” I thought that was very
cute (the threat of bird flu). My comment was, “No, the threat’s not over, now the
threat really begins.” That is, that the pattern has been set, whatever that pattern is
going to be. The pattern has been put in place by Pluto.
And then Pluto goes into the 11. This afternoon, as is my habit, I’m an information
junkie, I had CNN on and there was the President of the United States going before
the American public and preparing them for the bird flu pandemic and laying out all
of these steps, or strategies, about how to protect the global community, but
specifically how to protect Americans from the potential of the pandemic. Vast sums
of money have been promised, something like 7 billion dollars to prepare for this
pandemic. Isn’t it interesting that now that we have Pluto in the gate of ideas, and
Bush happens to be an 11/56, all of a sudden now it’s in the news 24 hours a day,
there are all these meetings that are being convened all over the place. There is a
tremendous amount of fear.

LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
I saw statistics today that said that the consumption of chicken in Europe has
dropped 30 percent in the last five weeks. That’s quite something. There is a level
of fear that is out there that is so interesting to watch, not that it isn’t justified to
some point; but, of course, like all fears of plague, there is nothing more dangerous
than rumors and ideas. One of the most interesting things about this whole
preparation today was in talking about Pluto and ideas, was that a great deal of this
money is going to be invested into a whole new technique to try to make vaccines.
Vaccines are basically a 1950’s technology. They want to be able to make almost
instant vaccines by using cell culture technology. So, there is all this emphasis, all of
a sudden all this money, all this direction, all this movement and it’s now with Pluto
in the 11. It’s so interesting to watch this whole program.
The 48/16: Where the Collective Health Pattern is Worked Out
So, when we talk about the 48 and the 16, what we’re really talking about is what
we understand as collective health measures. You could describe the 48/16 as the
World Health Organization. For the World Health Organization to operate correctly
there needs to be the right balance. That is, there needs to be enough energy, there
needs to be the electricity, and there needs to be a proper balance in terms of the
iodine that is there, that the salt balance in the vehicle is correct. And only when we
can establish that as a viable pattern are we going to be able to move forward into
the future safely.
When you look at the 16/48, one of the things to see about it is that that is one of its
deepest concerns. After all, the 48th gate is the fear of inadequacy. And this fear of
inadequacy, if one does not have a pattern for protection, a way to deal with things—
there was a comment today, somebody said, “What happens if it suddenly emerges
in our community, are we on our own, what do we do?” The person said, “Oh, no
you can’t be on your own that would be incredibly dangerous. It all has to be
controlled collectively.”
What a test, in that sense, in the fading era of the Cross of Planning, because what
you’re seeing now is this vast Cross of Planning—we’re going to protect humanity,
we’re going to stop this thing before it gets going, all of that stuff. We’re going to be
prepared, here is the plan, here is the pattern collectively that everyone has to follow
through with. The thing that’s so interesting is that the thing that it demands the
most from human beings is that they trust each other. What an odd time to have
this threat when we have the 33/13 and we have the narrowness that it happens to
be bringing because of this long-term activation of Neptune in the 13.2, this inherent
bigotry that’s there.
Right now there’s about 2½ million people in the northern part of Kashmir and
Pakistan who are basically being left to the wolves. It’s being called donor fatigue—
interesting concept. Only about 20 percent of the money that was promised in the
days and early weeks after the earthquake has actually arrived. This term “donor
fatigue” is in the air. It’s something to see that plague brings out the worst in
people. I mean, it brings out the worst in human beings.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
This whole collective protection, the great threat of all of this is that any nation that
has an outbreak is going to be shunned by the rest of the planet. There is very little
that anyone is going to be able to do about that, which means that there are a great
many countries that are at an enormous risk if any of this actually goes human-to-
human and you do have the emergence of the pandemic. The fact is the plan only
works if everybody is being open and honest about the process. That’s something
that’s very, very interesting.
So, this collective process and this collective pattern, in order to provide the
collective immunity, is very important because what you see in the 16/48—how can I
put this—it’s on the surface. One of the things that you can see diagnostically about
the 16/48 is how closely on the surface someone is aligned to the collective patterns
of well-being. Think about that, because it’s really interesting.
The Open 16/48
In other words, let’s say that you’re somebody that has an open 16/48; you’ve got
nothing in the channel. Always remembering that having something open is always
a potential for wisdom. So, for example, the 16/48 can analyze in the collective
domain all of those various patterns that people suggest, for example, how many
calories a day, what
balance of fruits and
vegetables, should you
eat meat or not,
lifestyle, should you be
walking every day,
should you be jogging,
do you need the
exercise, all of these
various things that are
part of these health
patterns that are there
in the 16/48.
What’s so interesting is
that by looking at that,
you can begin to see
the way in which the
program as a whole, that there is a specieal immune system, that is a human
immune system, humanity as a whole. This human immune system, if I can put it
that way, not the personal immune system, but the species’ immune system, and
I’m talking about just a large aura in that sense, that it is here in the 16/48 that
there is this great pressure to recognize what is required. So you end up with
international health organizations that try to lay out a minimum amount of calories,
exercise, all of these things, patterns of life for the general immune system to
operate correctly.

LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
One of the keys to that is this whole business of salt, and this whole business of
making sure that we are properly balanced so that we can have the right judgment
about all of these things, to have the right judgment about how to act in your life in
order to be healthy.
In the early years I used to say that beings with either defined immune systems that
are selectively defined, like one definition, no hanging gates, very special, or open
immune systems, that ultimately they have a tremendous gift for diagnosis. One of
the real keys for not understanding so much the person’s actual physical problem,
because remember we’re dealing with illusion here, but is to understand whether the
habits of that being, whether their judgment about what is healthy for them and
what isn’t healthy for them is disturbed. Of course, that is going to lead to all kinds
of problems.
If you’re thinking about this in the context of surface design where we speak
specifically of strategy and authority, then what you get to see is that by operating
correctly through your authority in terms of your strategy, then you’re always going
to be aligning yourself physically to the pattern that is healthy for you, regardless of
how that pattern may appear in terms of somebody else.
Island Flu
I just watch this here on the island. I have a very powerful immune system.
Everybody around me has island flu. Island flu is just a very basic thing. In the
daytime in Ibiza in the fall, if you stand in the sun it’s very hot. But, in fact, the air
has changed, it is at least 30 percent damper and the air itself is actually cool. So,
you have people who are dressing the same as they were weeks before and they
suddenly all get sick. This just gets simply passed around to everyone.
You can see what people will do when these things come. Everybody has some kind
of judgment about what is a healthy pattern in order to be well in the future. So
you’ve got people who fill themselves up with aspirins and you’ve got people who
drink tons of orange juice, and you have people who say, “It’s better if I just lie
down and give into it,” there are people who say “I can’t give into it, I have to fight
it,” there are all these various things. When you’re correct, it’s interesting. I
continue with the same bad habits I’ve always had, which happen to be healthy
habits for me. But, the reality is that for somebody else it would make things even
worse.
So, the strategy and authority is going to be very, very important in order to bring
correctness to the way in which the health pattern is established. What we’re seeing
in the 48/16, is that this is where the collective health pattern is worked out.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The 57/20
There are so many inspiring things for me that are just going on in this process.
Think about this binary of these two channels. You have this whole collective well-
being pattern. So, for example, if you live in a society where there is not proper
sewage, proper medical care, or whatever, then that particular pattern is simply
going to lead to deterioration. This is the collective environment. And it is about the
relationship of the individual to the collective pattern.
When we’re dealing with the 57 and 20, not only are we dealing with an individual
process, and that in and of itself is quite different, but you cannot look at the 57/20
without thinking about specifically, in this case, the 34 and the 10, integration being
what it is, and understanding something about the importance of integration as this
primary survival mechanism in a human being. So much of what we call that
primary, what I’ve described in lectures about integration, is rooted in this particular
function of the 20/57 that obviously, if the 10 is connected or the 34 is connected, is
going to feed into or impact.
For example, the classic Manifesting Generator, the 20/34, this is the only direct
connection that’s possible between the Throat and the Sacral Center, it is one of the
most common things that I have met in all of my years of doing analysis, how many
people with the 20/34 have had their thyroids removed. It’s amazing. At first it was
an enormous surprise to me. Then it was just obvious. It is so difficult for
Manifesting Generators to be Generators. It’s so difficult for them not to initiate.
It’s so difficult for them not to put enormous Sacral pressure on the way in which
their Throat system operates.

174
LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
It is clear to me that problems arise from the 34 into this system. But let’s go back
for a moment and think about what we’ve learned about the way in which the Spleen
operates. We know that our discussion last week was about the incredible capacity
of B cells. That is, the ability of B cells to be able to recognize an invading microbe,
to be able to have stored information so that, in fact, it has a library, a catalog of
information about what to be aware of. And that you can see that this very function,
this very Splenic function, when you bring it up to the Throat through the 57/20,
then you’re talking about the existential capacity to stay healthy, and the ability to
stay healthy in the now, but also the fundamental alert system that is there, or
warning system that is there, in the now, that is possible through this configuration,
through this 20/57.
A Doorway of Mutated Infection
It is clear to me that from a diagnostic point of view that there is a capacity here, an
individual capacity, to either have a very strong protection against taking things in
from the other, or a weakness from taking things in from the other, so that this is
where I see that through the 20/57, is a doorway of mutated infection. Through the
16/48 are general patterns that are designed to make the general health
environment more efficient and more effective.
So, it’s fascinating to have these two variations that are there. Remember, I’m
really talking about the surface. It seems very clear to me and something that I’ve
deeply been aware of, this 20/57, this channel can potentially open you up to being
destroyed, in a sense. In other words, for me it is clear that this channel more than
any other can be a gateway to major infection in the vehicle.
Think about it again from the projected point of view. That is, the point of
recognizing or not. Of course, the function of the B cell, the way it’s going to
operate in the now, isn’t going to recognize in the now or not. Of course, the thing
that’s so interesting about that is that built into integration is a behavioral
mechanism, the 10th gate, the ability to perfect one’s form, the ability to protect
one’s form for survival, to be able to have the right kind of shield.
It’s interesting that the parathyroids are, in the various googling that I did, that one
of the common descriptions of the parathyroid is that it is a shield around the thyroid
and acts as a shield. It was very interesting, this shielding. Some people go into a
room and everybody’s sick and nothing happens. Some people go into a room and
one person is sick and they get it immediately. This is something that is built into
this 20/57.
Now, if we go back—remember this is about being able to see certain things on the
surface. After nearly 18 years of talking about Health Channels, this is the first time
that I actually describe the way in which that function operates. But it still is on the
surface because the capacity of the 57/20 is all about what happens in that building
of the Spleen stage that takes place in the 6th stage. It is here that it happens.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
No 20 or 57: Inconsistent Ability to Fight Infections
The deeper that I go into my own preparations for teaching you, and the more I
have time to ponder these things, because I’m confronted with it, it becomes clearer
and clearer how these early stages of development, how important they are. Of
course, it doesn’t mean that—I don’t want to frighten people because that’s the
natural tendency—“Oh, my God I don’t have it. What does that mean if I don’t have
it?” If you’re somebody who doesn’t have the 20 or the 57, the fact of the matter is
that there can be a tendency in you to be inconsistently able to fight things off.
Period.
Again, that’s going to be based on a lot of other criteria on the surface—is the Spleen
defined or not, and so forth and so on. But the fact is, the fact that it would be
open, that is the most natural statement that one can make about it. The other
thing is if you have it defined doesn’t necessarily mean you’re never going to be
infected with something. What it does mean, though, is that you have a very, very
fixed defense mechanism. In and of itself, it may be limited. That will go back to this
developmental stage. Remember that fixing is a very narrow line. So, you may
have an immune system that is wonderful against some type of viruses and
absolutely useless with others. That’s another possibility of it.
Remember, we’re not looking at what causes the problems here. What we’re looking
at is where we can have an understanding of if they’re going to surface or not. In
other words, to be able to look at somebody who has a 16/48, I’m talking about the
not-self now, to realize that their idea of what a healthy lifestyle is, is something that
has been deeply conditioned and is inconsistent in them. With awareness, they can
learn to see what aspects of various lifestyle concepts work. Remember the
madness of vitamin pills. People were taking doses of vitamins that were enough for
seven lifetimes and they were ending up with problems, or radical vegetarianism
where you ended up with problems with a lack of vitamin B and all of these other
things. The not-self isn’t very bright. And it’s very easy for them to be drawn into
lifestyle patterns that aren’t healthy.
Openness in the 16/48
As a diagnostic tool, if you’re dealing with somebody who has an open 16/48, what
you do know is that they have looked at different kinds of lifestyle patterns. And in
looking at those various lifestyle patterns or lifestyle formulas, some of them have
been sort of this, and some of them have been sort of that. But the fact that they
are unhealthy means that they have not, as yet, come to grips with how to establish
a proper lifestyle pattern, and that’s going to be visible in the 16/48.

176
LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
Openness in the 57/20
If you’re dealing with the 57/20, you’re dealing with something else. Having that
open means that there is inconsistency in one’s ability to be able to deal with
infection. And of course, the point in all of that always comes back to the same
thing on the surface—are they going to be operating correctly as themselves,
because this is really the whole point.
It’s interesting that here in the 20/57, you are dealing with the whole mutative
principle. One of the things to understand about the coming cycle in 2027, because
most of the attention is always given to the 55-59 polarity, but the other polarity
involves all kinds of very, very individual power. It’s so important to see that we’re
stepping into a deeply mutative time. So, when we’re looking at the 20/57 it is
giving us an insight.
Health is Determined by Who is in Your Life and in Your Aura
Let’s say, for example you have the 57 and you do not have the 20. Then there is
an indication that you have the capacity to recognize what may or may not be
healthy for you, but you have no way of actualizing that. You’re only able to do so
inconsistently. Again, the very first lectures that I ever gave to health professionals
were about the other and not about the bodygraph. In other words, I remain
convinced, and it is so clear, that there are no true boundaries between us, that we
are all living in one organism. To understand health and well-being is to recognize
that it’s deeply, deeply, deeply determined by who is in your life and who is in your
aura. It is something that makes an enormous difference.
Obviously, in order to have the right forces in your life, you have to be able to enter
into those relationships correctly. If you don’t have the right people in your life then
you’re going to have dysfunction in the way in which your Health Channels
potentially are going to operate. After all, any openings that you have are constantly
going to be conditioned by others, going to be conditioned by the transiting field.
Avian Flu
I like to track things, I like to watch things, I have my hunches about things as a
Splenic being and then I watch them. I’m sure that notification of the person-to-
person transference of avian flu, which would be the beginning of a pandemic, that
certainly that there is going to be something very strong in these two channels.
There are going to be activations in these two channels. There are going to be
triggers that are going to be impacted. They have to be because this is the way in
which the surface is going to be affected.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
What you see right now is a desperate attempt by the collective to fix the 16/48
right now. They’re all coming up with their prescriptions and their formulas and their
planning about how they’re going to prevent a pandemic. And yet, we know that,
despite all that planning, it’s going to be a rural farmer in an unorganized
environment whose own personal immune system, their 20/57 facility, if it does not
recognize it, if it does not avoid it, then it is going to take it in and it’s going to
mutate anyway, and it’s going to go out there. It is this combination between the
16/48 as this lifestyle, health environment and then the personal immune
environment, the personal area where one is paying attention in the now, this whole
concept of the potential of peripheral vision that is there in the 20, this ability to be
able to take in the situation.
Remember, these things are going on at a deep intuitive level as well. If you’re
operating correctly, this is the whole thing about the surface. It’s amazing how
healthy you can be on the surface if you’re functioning correctly. It doesn’t mean
that you’re going to be impervious to things. That’s not the point. The point is that,
generally speaking, other than underlying problems that have been developing for
years, or things that were already there at the very beginning that emerge at a
certain time, the fact is that by operating correctly on the surface in terms of the
mechanics, in terms of the benefit to the form is extraordinary. I mean, it’s
extraordinary. Because it really does provide the potential for the balance that you
need, both through the functions of the 16/48 and the functions of the 20/57. Most
human beings aren’t going to have all of this defined. As a matter of fact, having all
that all defined isn’t necessary the solution either. The solution is that one is always
bringing into one’s aura those forces that are mutually beneficial. And of course, this
is the real key. The deepest key to well-being on the surface is the other.
Diagnostic Tools
So, these two Health Channels, I think that ultimately they deserve a great deal of
investigation. By the time we get around to year three, which is all about diagnostic
techniques and therapy, I hope, that this is something that’s going to be very
important because what I’m working on is building up diagnostic tools. In other
words, things that you can see on the surface that will allow you to ask the right
questions in order to be able to get to what’s really the source somewhere else.
Remember, in talking about these things here within the context of the bodygraph,
we’re not talking about source at all. Even though we’re talking about relative
functions of spleen, lymph, thyroid, parathyroid, what’s actually the cause of any
problem in any of those is something that is deeper than simply looking at these
channels and saying, “Aha, there’s this or not this or whatever.” The point of that is
simply to be able to look at these channels and to be able to see what kind of
questions need to be asked. What kind of direction you need to take in order to
really get to where the source is. Because these channels are a basic binary
between how one is healthy within the context of one’s environment, and how one is
healthy within oneself in protection against infection, that these two separate things

LESSON EIGHT: The Health Channels
allow us a diagnostic insight that says, here is where the weakness can be, so here is
where we go in and we can begin to look at what the real problem is underneath.
The longer I go on this, the more I am convinced that perhaps the most
extraordinary channel we have is this 44/26 within the context of our well-being, in
the way in which the well-being operates on the surface. Because it is clear to me
that, when you begin to look at the way in which this triangle operates, because
after all when you talk about the spleen you’re talking about blood flow, all of this is
related to each other, that when you’re talking about this triangle, this Throat, the
Heart Center, the Splenic Center, the triangle, you’re talking about the real core of
our whole well-being system and the way in which it can be diagnosed on the
surface.
I had already planned for this evening to add several other illustrations that I’ve
done. I will add them later because I just felt there’s too much material. As it is, I’ve
really flown over this because it is a lot of material. The diagnostic importance of the
45/21 and this relationship between the heart and the thyroid and parathyroids.
That will really be a completion of being able to see this whole framework here and
the way in which we’re going to be able to use that and to be able to use that as a
diagnostic tool. It’s great stuff.

Lesson Nine
The Substructure of a Line
A Story about Color and Twins
I want to begin tonight with a story. I think it was in 1993 and I was with my
associate at the time, the late Juergen Sauper who died a number of years ago.
Juergen was a very special ally of mine in the beginning of introducing Human
Design. I toured with him for many years. He was one of my first students. He
actually became a real master of the knowledge.
We were in Berlin, I think it was the second time that I had gone to introduce Design
in Berlin. He came back one afternoon from talking to some people and he was quite
perplexed. He had this very earnest question about a young couple he had met and
they had twins. He said to me, “What am I going to do? They have the same
Design, but they’re different.” I said, “Of course, they’re different. There are levels
beneath the line.” I guess I’ll always remember that look on his face. It was a mix
between astonishment and annoyance, I think. In many ways, it really frightened
him. One of the very first things he said to me was, “You’re actually going to tell
people this?” He was very concerned that it was just so much information that it
would simply overwhelm people. It was enough in those days—we had just begun—
just to try to get the basics across on the surface.
But anyway, I did a kind of very primitive calculation in order to calculate down. I
didn’t have to go very far, they were born I think 12½ to 13 minutes apart. In fact,
the first one came out on the cusp of a Color so it was really very easy. I gave him
the information and said, “This is what you say—this baby is like this, and this one is
like that, and see what they say.” The next day he went out to see them and that’s
what he said. They were, like most people when they are confronted with Design
information, they can be deeply surprised how accurate it was.
But his reaction really disturbed me. I had this feeling that it was all premature. I
was very concerned about the fact that it already appeared to be quite an ordeal just
to simply introduce the basic information. In the end, that’s where I would stay.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Need to Establish the Surface Knowledge
I have a book. With my years on the road—I spent a decade traveling—one of the
ways that I would occupy myself with all the dead time was that I would write in
journals. At some point it occurred to me that I should just simply write out the
description of every single chain in the wheel. One would think that I was really still
mad. I managed to start that process by limiting myself to just the Color and Tone
chains. I managed to write a couple of hundred descriptions. I still have this book.
When I realized after writing a couple hundred descriptions that I had barely moved
a fraction of arc, the idea that all of that was going to be in front of me, there was
just simply no way that I was ever going to write that all down.
It took all the years to establish the knowledge at the surface before there could
really be, not only the timing to be able to talk about the substructure of the line,
but more important than that, the potential students. It is a totally different level of
the knowledge, and yet at the same time it’s so deeply integrated with the rest of it.
There is this continuity of literally what it all is.
One of the things is the relationships that exist in the substructure. I love the
illusion. I can’t imagine anything that is more fulfilling and more fascinating than to
live in this illusion. It is extraordinary. I’m very lucky, in that sense, my North Node
is about aesthetics and only seeing beauty, so I tend to be able to ignore what I’m
aware of, which is the ugliness of ignorance in the world.
However, there is this extraordinary beauty. For me, the thing that touches me the
deepest when I look at the substructure is this incredible beauty of what order is,
and how extraordinary it is that we human beings are given such a limitation. We
are so limited. Not only are we limited in the classic sense that the Personality is
nothing more than a potential within the clutches of the form, the limitation of the
way in which our physical form operates, the frequencies that we can interpret, or
not, the fragility of the life force or not, all of these things about the limitation of
what it is to be human.
The Ring Pass Not of the Illusion
But more than that, at the deepest level,
for those whose fractal it is to care, it’s
their fractal to yearn for a deeper grasp of
understanding that there is a line that is
not crossed. And it is that line that we
call “line” that is here in the illustration
[larger view 2 pages forward], this is the Ring-
Pass-Not of the illusion. The moment you
stick your head beneath the line is the
moment you enter into the realm of the

182
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
Gods, is the moment that you enter into another dimension, it’s the moment you
leave behind this illusion that we live on the surface. How different a line is from a
Color, how different they are. Because the Color, in and of itself, Personality/Design
Color, the Color is only operating out of its singularity, out of the singularity of the
information that it filters through the crystal, the specific crystal.
The line is a construct created, in that sense, by the Magnetic Monopole. The deeper
we understand that, the deeper we have this—it’s my 1st lines, I am simply in awe of
the work of the Magnetic Monopole, because all of this on the surface is the
Monopole’s work. To recognize that the Monopole has a more profound connection
to the Design Crystal than it does to the Personality Crystal, that the limitation, that
the game, is really stacked against us. We’re deeply limited. Every once in awhile,
we grasp or hear of some inspiration that seems to penetrate beneath. And it’s in
those moments that we are struck with being impressed, being awed, being
fascinated, because it is out of a dimension that we normally cannot trespass. We
can’t. It’s how locked we are into the illusion.
When you tell somebody about their Color, they’re aware of it. In other words, the
moment that you can articulate it and bring it to the surface in the illusion, is the
moment they can relate to it, because after all this is the way the illusion works. It’s
simply the way it works. You give something a name and it is there. And in the
illusion one is going to meet it.
Color and Line Share a Frequency
Color is so different than the line, each Color. Whether it’s the Color of the
Personality or the Color of the Design, their relationship to the line is a relationship
that only operates through geometries. It doesn’t operate any other way. There is
no true kinship, in that sense, between the 1st Color and the 1st line. But there is a
shared frequency. It is that frequency through which the information moves from
one to the other.
They’re so different. Our job is that, here we are beginning our process of stepping
down underneath that illusion, that illusion that was full of glands and flesh and all
this kind of stuff on the surface, illustrations of bodies carved open so you could see
their organs. The illusion world, the line world; but it’s not the Color world. There
are no organs there; there is no illusion there, there is simply information, or data.
The frequency is what aligns the data to the illusion, this stream, what we call
chains. And they really are chains. It is a binding, if you will, because everything is
bound together in the continuity of what the whole is. It’s all bound together.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Understanding the Process from the Base Up
We have a dilemma. The dilemma comes from our very perspective in our
education. That is, everybody has been trained to look from the top down.
Everyone. We’re still here today going from the top down. But our work, in order to
be able to grasp the process, we must understand it deeply from the Base up, and
then see how it works from the line down. It is out of that duality comes a quantum
of understanding, the depth that is necessary.
These lines, everything that we see in line value on the surface is enormously
important to us because it is the end place. It is where the work of what goes on
beneath the line, where that work unfolds. So these themes that we see on the
surface become very important to us. Not because these themes are directly
translatable downward, but that everything that is coming upward ultimately leads to
these themes.
Obviously, when you’re looking at, let’s say the 1st line, and you’re looking at the
Investigator as we understand it in profile. When you’re looking at the Teacher in
terms of the way it moves or communicates its information, that something to
understand is that when you’re looking at those six Colors underneath, that each of
those six Colors underneath are bringing an ingredient that is molded into this line
value. It’s an ingredient; it’s not specifically “Teacher”, it’s not specifically
“Investigator”; it is what it becomes.

184
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
So we have to be careful in the way in which we look at the movement of keynotes.
In other words, we’re going to be able to easily string keynotes from the Base up,
but we’re going to have to be very careful when we’re stringing keynotes from the
line down. And hopefully, I’ll be able to show you that.
Limitation is Transcended through the 3rd Gate
I want to talk about these lines, the surface, in a way that prepares you to go
downward to Color. I want to offer you a kind of coding, in that sense, a way of
understanding how that limitation is transcended by going beneath the line. We
know how limitation is transcended within the context of the bodygraph. That is,
within the context of the bodygraph, limitation is transcended through the 3rd gate,
Difficulty at the Beginning.
Within the context of our work, within the context of PHS, I doubt very much, it
would have to be proven to me that any gate is more significant to the illusion than
the 3rd gate. I’m not talking about the infrastructure, the 88 degrees of the 10
stages from conception. I’m not talking about these hidden processes; I’m talking
about the full-blown illusion in the world that so much of it is coordinated through
the 3rd gate.
3.1: Synthesis
When you look at the 1st line of the 3rd gate, it is the line of Synthesis. It is
something to grasp about the investigative process. That it is a synthesizing
process. And the keys to synthesizing is a recognition of what is pertinent. Look at
Human Design. Here’s a revealed synthesis. Nobody in their right mind could have
worked that out, because the most incredible thing about the Human Design System
is not what’s in, is what’s out, this extraordinary discernment, what actually is
pertinent to the synthesis.
One of the things we’re going to see when we go beneath the line is that the filtering
that is coming through, and most of this is coming from the Tone level, is this way of
being able to determine what is pertinent or what is not pertinent.
3.3: Ability to Distinguish between Fertile and Sterile
Everything about the 3rd gate is so deeply, deeply, deeply expressed through its 3rd
line, the extraordinary ability to distinguish between fertile and sterile. Here we are
with a 3rd line theme of adaptation and we all know about the 3rd line picking
themselves up off the ground. Where does that come from? It comes from this
capacity deep within the line to move towards that recognition of being able to
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
185
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
distinguish this from that, sterile from fertile, and not intellectually, obviously, but
through experience.
3.2: Great Line of Talent
It’s like looking at the 2nd line in this way, the energy and the potential for individual
mutation; real magic, or not, because of conditioning. And then you begin to see
something about talent, about real talent, the deep creative talent that the 2nd line
brings. This is the great line of talent; the natural that is there. But where does it
come from? It comes from a specific kind of energy, a specific kind of discretion,
selection.
Beneath the Line is the Source of the “Why”
Every single one of the lines, when you look at them on the surface, they are the by-
product of something else. And it’s only in our illusion that we give it these terms.
But if you actually examine a 1st line by itself—I can remember giving the very first
profile trainings, and nobody had the nerve to say, “Well, why is the 1st line like
this,” not what is the explanation of it, which is what I was doing. Nobody said, “But
why is a 1st line like this,” because that’s beneath the surface.
We describe things on the surface. This is the nature of maya, measurement. We
describe them. But that’s not saying why they operate that way. That’s why we
need to go in this process, deep beneath the line to grasp what is really there, what
is the source, what is the cause. The magnificence of any logical system is that you
can get to the root of anything. If you’re dealing with an equation that is correct,
then you’re going to be able to get the solutions that you need. Our job is to verify
the equation. This is what we’re doing.
All the preamble that we’ve been through in the first eight classes, all that preamble
about the surface and the way things are operating on the surface and the way you
see things appear on the surface, what I’m really saying to you here, is if you look at
the sum total of that appearance on the surface, what you get to is a description
only. We’re describing what is happening. But that’s not about why it is happening,
or why it goes wrong, or why it is incorrect, because that’s not up there at the line
level in the illusion. What is there are all those descriptions. Our magic is to go
beneath the line.
3.4: Charisma, Psychic Attunement
In, the 3rd gate, the 4th line of Charisma is about guidance. By the way, so is the 2nd
line. Guidance is something that is really extraordinary. But this is a theme of, and
it’s the only place where you will see this language, 4th line of the 3rd gate: psychic
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
186
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
attunement. So, let’s think about the psychic. Let’s think about the terminology
associated with this, and let’s understand something. We can describe what that is,
but why it is? Why it is, is beneath the surface. What makes the 4th line carry that
quality? Why is it there in the genetic continuity? What is the source of that? When
you go down deep enough, if you can’t follow the geometry, it’s going to be difficult
to make the associations because what’s beneath the line does not carry the same
language. And we know that as we move downward we’re moving in a pyramid of
more and more options of nuances in varying directions.
It’s only from the bottom that you’ve got a straight line. Looking down is an illusion.
It’s necessary; it allows us to connect to the surface. But looking up, this is just
pure uni-directional mechanics. Only one way, only one path, here’s the path, what
does it mean? And remember that we’re looking at many, many paths in the body.
We’re not just looking at Profiles and Nodes. We have all of this information. We
have this specific imprinting of our potential differentiation. This is our ability to
understand not what the differentiation is but why it is the way it is. If it is not
operating correctly on the surface, why isn’t it operating correctly on the surface?
3.5: Victimization
The 3.5 is Victimization. This is about alienating others. This is about when actions
designed to overcome confusion alienate others; the unique energy of individuality to
withstand confusion. Here we have this ability to withstand confusion. We can
describe it. But we don’t know why it is that way.
What I’m interested in is understanding, at the deepest possible level, what makes
all these lines work. Why is it that this is the sum total; the sum total of what? And
that means that the understanding of each of the layers beneath, how each of these
layers are going to give us this possibility.
3.6: Surrender
The final line, the 6th line is the line of Surrender. It is a line of light and darkness.
As powerful a line of light and darkness as there can be. Where light can sustain and
where darkness can overwhelm. And both the light and the darkness of humanity,
and the balance between them, and whether one displays the light or one displays
the darkness.
We can describe it, but isn’t it going to be interesting to see where it comes from and
the way in which it works, because every single one of these descriptions on the
surface, they each have 1,080 variations, each one. There are 1080 of each of
these. And of course, these are the chains that are going to allow us to map out,
literally, the mechanics of being.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
The Six Dimensions of Color
Let me move along. You can see in this illustration that we have moved from simply
the line structure. On the borders on either side, we have entered our hexagon and
we bring in the six dimensions of Color. Color is an extraordinary term, in and of
itself, and at the same time it can be very confusing. But it’s confusing for all the
right reasons.
So many people have asked me, as an example, are there colors specifically related
to each of the Colors. My answer to that is no. But it’s not an incorrect question.
It’s about frequency. The more we understand this frequency concept, the better.
This is an energetic concept. The thing to be clear about the 1 through the 6 is that
these are frequencies, these Colors.
Obviously, when we are looking at various frequencies in physics, the difference for
us, whether something is color or sound, that these frequencies are just about
compressions or expansions of wave patterns. Color is just another wave pattern.
So here, in this context, understand yes, we are talking about frequency
differentiation and it is, because it was the name given to me, it is called Color. But
it’s not necessarily about the colors we see, as much as the colors will be, if you
pardon my little rhyme.

188
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
Colors are a Hexagon
So, we have these six different Colors. They are not a hexagram. They’re a
hexagon; but they are not a hexagram, which means that they do not operate in the
principle of the hexagram. That is, the principle of the hexagram is that the
hexagram is a number of things, but primarily it is two trigrams. Of course, it is out
of these trigrams that we have these terms: harmony and resonance—the
relationship between lower and upper trigram.
All of you are familiar with the fact that I use the language of harmony and
resonance in dealing with sub-levels of the lines. So that, for example, the 1st Color
frequency has a pure resonance to the 1st line. But that does not mean that Color is
operating in trigrams; it is not. It is operating in harmonics. That’s one of the real
keys in understanding Color, is that Color operates in harmonics.
Where this becomes evident at a larger level is actually in Penta, which is another
subject entirely. But in Penta harmonics as well are something that are enormously
important, much more important than individual activations.
Color Transference
So, when you’re looking at Color frequency keep in mind that this is not a
trigrammed infrastructure, but it is couplets, it is harmonics. If you understand the
nature of the relationship of the hexagram to our genetic code—that is, that the code
itself is built on the couplets—it’s interesting to understand that. So that, where the
trigram originates from, it originates at this level, from this couplet frequency.
Everything about Color is this harmonic relationship. We know that the harmonic
relationship in Color is deeply, deeply significant because what it reveals to us, in a
graphic sense, is what we call transference.
I’m so glad that I’ve had the opportunity, not simply this year, but in the last couple
of Ibiza events, to really go into substructure of the line because what I have learned
in that process, relative to Color, has demonstrated to me how important this
knowledge is for people who are operating within the Human Design community.
I’ve been doing these Color Transference readings and along with that, I’ve been
doing these transformational lectures on Sundays, which are all deeply related to
Color Transference and how important it is as a tool for the Personality to really
grasp things about the way in which they’re being moved in this life, whether
positively or negatively, in terms of what is correct for them. All of this is rooted in
transference.
Transference for this very reason alone is of enormous importance. Of course, in our
work, when we begin to see the consequences of transference at the vehicle level,
this is something that is so profound to understand what a dilemma that is. And
with the vehicle, it’s much easier to arrest this problem simply by operating correctly
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
189
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
according to your strategy. For the Personality it’s very different, because for the
Personality this requires the surrender or the intellectual acceptance of mind. But
transference is a key.
Harmonic Frequency: Root of all Illusion
So, let’s talk about transference. If you imagine that all Color is nothing but
frequency, it’s just frequency, and if you imagine that this frequency is a frequency
that is aligned to poles—that is, the 1 to the 4, let’s just refer to those two poles—
then you begin to see that the frequency, in and of itself, is always moving back and
forth across those poles; always. In other words, it is what we could call
electromagnetic, it’s not though, but it’s simply something to understand that these
two poles you always have this frequency moving between the poles. It never stops.
In other words, the line of energy between them is not really ever broken. It can be
confused, but not broken.
So, we’re dealing with frequency. And we’re dealing with an alignment, a very
profound alignment between one side and the other. They’re very similar, but
they’re not. It’s one of those jokes about what it means to go from being absolutely
alone—there is only “I am”—to the moment that there is somebody in your face. And
then there is, “Oh, my goodness, who are you?” There’s the other over there. It’s
always over there. So, here in this frequency, this harmonic frequency is actually
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

190
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
the root of all illusion; the root of it. It will come out expressed in certain ways when
it moves to the line level. But again, it’s here in these harmonies.
Why We Need Transference
Now, what’s transference all about? Ok, we can say it’s there—any of you that have
paid attention to, particularly the Personality level because you have access to it,
paid attention to the way in which Color operates in your life, it’s very clear to see
that it’s there. It’s very clear to see transference at work. But why do we need
that? What is that for? It’s something that is really fascinating.
Color is really tricky. It’s not like the moment you go beneath the line that you find
the positive god, you find the dark god, too. You see, transference is part of the way
in which the Monopole gets access to pull the whole thing together into the illusion.
And it feeds the illusion; it feeds conditioning. We are designed to be conditioned.
We all know that. It’s not like that’s a big surprise or a mystery. We can talk about
it on the surface and say, “Well, you know our genes are interested in what we’re
not. You’ve got an open this and I’ve got a fixed one so let’s get together.”
The reason that that is a driving force, is that it’s already being conditioned at a
deeper level. It is being conditioned in the way in which we’re motivated, in the way
in which we are so easily conditioned in our motivation. The moment you start
paying attention to your Color, you realize how many times a day there are forces
that are pulling you away from your correct frequency, they just are. So there is this
set-up for us, because it’s a set-up.
Think about timeframes. This is the closing, at least in the largest sense of the
word, of a Round. We have some cycles that are left. We’ve had a very long run.
We’re at the verge of a genetic mutation. But the fact is that, we were never
designed to easily transcend illusion. We weren’t at all. Imagine what it would be
like if I came with the Human Design System but there was no strategy or authority.
I remember that. I remember what it was like when I first started. Everybody said
it’s interesting, but then nothing happened; just nothing.
You cannot transform anyone without the surface mechanics. You can’t even begin
to hope to. This is a real gift of the gods, this strategy and authority, because the
deeper that you go, the more you realize how helpless we are. But, this is a 1st line
cycle. It’s a 61.1 era. It is the time for us to know all of these things. Not that this
knowledge brings power, it doesn’t. But that we can grasp the way it works. And to
see how lucky we are that, along with this perspective, comes the simple tools. And
we can learn to use those tools. When you’re given a key, if you investigate it deep
enough, there are many things that you can learn from it, so that ultimately we can
directly be of benefit to others. That we can awaken human beings from the
shadows and the ignorance of what it is to live in the illusion.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
But I also want you to see something. You can’t escape it. I never liked the
enlightenment trip; it was never to my taste. I always saw clearly that the world is
where we’re supposed to be, in the world, part of the world, it is what it is, and it’s
all there. But it is illusion. For us, the only way that we can be rewarded in this
process, is to physically obey what are the necessary rules of the game and to
intellectually embrace the highest levels of understanding. It’s what we’re here for;
it’s the key.
Transference Operates at Every Level
But at the same time, to understand something; we can’t change this. We can put
our head through the sky; we can look at the wheels turning. We can be in awe and
wonder of the way that it works. But, it’s not like you’re going to be able to pull your
head back through that hole in the sky and shout at the world and they’re all going
to be waiting to hear what you say; they won’t. They’re in transference.
Transference isn’t just something that’s taking place at the profile level. It’s not just
taking place at the nodal level. It’s taking place at every level of your differentiation,
every level of what makes you different. It’s very profound.
When you do not operate out of the correct motivation, you cannot fulfill your
purpose. Throughout history, through all the rites, the religions, you name it, this
incredible yearning for purpose. How excited people are to find out about their
Incarnation Cross; and how dark a joke that can be. That cross, wow, that’s better
than a gold watch. You manage to find a way to get on that cross and you’ve really
accomplished something, because purpose, in and of itself, is being correctly
motivated. Otherwise, you are not the being you were intended to be in terms of
your differentiation. You do not see the world you’re intended to see, and all of
those aspects being pulled away. And at our best, at our very, very, very best, when
we’re absolutely correct right to the letter, it doesn’t mean we are fixed in our
motivation. It’s an ongoing process, it never lets go. It never lets go.
Tone: The Reason for Transference
It is clear to me that if you go down a step to Tone, that there in the Tone, you find
the reason for the transference. You find the reason for it. Remember that from the
point of view of Color, the harmony is a unity, in a sense. Color has no problem with
transference because that is its natural state. But the only way that it feeds into the
illusion, the only way that Color and its purpose is fulfilled on the surface, is that it is
fulfilled through the maintenance of that transference because that’s what the
Magnetic Monopole hooks on to. Remember that the line is a by-product of the
Monopole gaining access to the crystals at their primary level. That is, in this sense,
their surface level. So, you reach the crystal and you get the frequency of its Color.
And the Magnetic Monopole taps into the frequency of the Design Color and the
frequency of the Personality Color and that’s what it pulls together that becomes the
illusion.

LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
It’s pulling together from transference. If we look at transference and we get rid of
the language, if we stop calling it transference for a moment, what we’re really
seeing is, Color is a frequency that is a foundation for illusion; period. The thing that
makes the Monopole so extraordinary is that it is a frequency mechanism.
Sometimes I think of it, because this pun on pole, as a kind of like a tuning fork, that
there is this quality to it. We know that it is the Monopole that will pull in a
Personality Crystal. We know it’s the Monopole that pulls together the two crystals
into the illusion.
There is this frequency—not only is it a frequency, but it’s a frequency that is
attractive, which is even more interesting. Remember that when it attracts itself to
the Design or the Personality Color, it attracts to the harmony, not to any specific
Color. It’s pulling that very nature of Color to be this binary pole frequency, and in
pulling the two of them together it creates this binary that becomes the quantum
illusion that is life. I rather like that; I think it’s really incredible.
The 1-4 Color Binary
Let’s just for a moment look at these Color dimensions and look at them within the
context of their frequency. Communalist/separatist, master/novice—forget about the
fear/need for a moment. One of the things that you see immediately when you’re
looking at Color is that you have this binary configuration and you have a binary
configuration that is a polarity. You can see all the polarities that are built into Color,
this mini-polarity between the generic polarity. So you have in this a multiple of
possibilities, and a multiple of possibilities that are going to impact on the surface
anything that is associated with this harmony.
In other words, the combination of the communalist/novice, or the separatist/master
or the communalist/master and the separatist/novice and so forth and so on, that
you’re going to have built into this frequency what is a potential motivation for either
the 1 or the 4, because it’s being pulled from this. These are binaries in and of
themselves.
So we have this multiple binary system that is actually underneath every line. It’s
not in terms of you go down and you look at your MMI and you click to see what the
Color is of your Personality Sun. Understand that when you’re looking at that Color,
before you can even think about the Tone and Base, understand that that Color, in
and of itself, is made up of a varying degree of these four components. And a
varying degree of the binary generic—fear/need. It’s already there. It’s why it’s so
easy for transference to operate. And why it’s so easy to be pulled towards
transference, because the components are already there. They may be dormant, but
it’s all rooted in conditioning. The whole mechanism, everything about how you
maintain life is conditioning.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Think about for a moment what we deal with in Human Design. What we deal with is
a graphic that illustrates for us where the specific differentiation imprinting is, we’re
not looking at the whole being. We’re not looking at all the things that are necessary
for the life process. We are not looking at all of the genetic material of the being.
What we are looking at are keys that are being highlighted. So, we have to see that
conditioning is absolutely essential in order for the life to flourish. And yet, at the
same time, that to be lost in the conditioning is to lose the opportunity for the
perfection of the fulfillment of one’s purpose. It’s quite a lock that we all find
ourselves in, in this evolutionary process.
Transference is Natural
So we’ve got all these binaries at work. And you need to see that transference on the
surface is something that is just going to be absolutely natural, just natural. We’re
going to have to deal with two things. If we talk about the Personality, the only way
the Personality can deal with transference is through intellectual awakening. In
other words, having the serendipity to be ready to accept knowledge at this level,
and to be able to see, within their own process, the validity of the way their
motivation system operates, and then consciously to be aware of those forces in
their life that bring out the incorrect motivation in their life.
When we’re dealing with the vehicle, we’re dealing with something entirely different.
In other words, we’re dealing with natural transference that’s taking place in the
vehicle and that the vehicle will correct most of it through operating correctly, but

LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
long-term conditioning leaves wounds. It is by understanding the Design
components of Color that we’re going to be able to find those approaches, whether
therapeutic, physical, whatever the case may be, those approaches that are going to
help bring balance and move people away from their transference, so that they can
operate with the correct motivation.
In the end, we’re going to see that this generation of Human Design intellectuals is
being equipped with the most profound information in Human Design, and it is the
knowledge of Color, because Color is our medium. It is the relationship between
Tone, Color and Line that is about everything. Oh, yes, I know that there is Base
there, and yes it has significance. But it’s quite different in terms of the way in
which it works. It does not work in what is this core relationship between these three
levels of the infrastructure.
We Need Transference
We need transference. So, that’s the first thing for us to grasp, that Colors are
operating as binaries, that they are polarities, and because they are polarities and
binaries that all the information that exists in the harmony is information that is
already there. You have both sides in you, in that sense, because otherwise the
illusion could not be built. It just couldn’t.
So, Color makes it possible for us to have our existence. If you want to blame
anyone, usually people blame God for that, well you’d better blame Color because
it’s Color that does that. It is this Color layer of the way in which the crystal
operates. Remember something, if you think about the crystal itself, and you think
about that we operate out of one facet of that crystal, whatever our Base happens to
be, what we’re describing is that the neutrino stream is going through your crystal.
It is being filtered through that Base. But it’s not simply a matter of being filtered.
It is a filtered frequency. As a matter of fact, it’s a step-down frequency, because
the potential in the neutrino information stream is the potential that could be
absorbed by all five facets of the crystal. But that’s not the way the crystals are
designed.
So, it is being stepped-down and streamed through a single crystal facet. Out of
that facet emerges a frequency, a frequency that goes through the Tone level first.
Tone is a frequency. Again, sound and Color, we’re just talking about frequencies.
And we’re talking about a frequency in Tone that will then be stepped-down to the
frequency of the Color. In other words, all of this is originating out of the Base, out
of the way in which the Base Crystal, the way in which the facet is going to filter the
energy frequency and the way in which that frequency is going to be impacted on
the way in which it moves through its chain. That’s the way to see the
programming.
Remember something about us. We are just frequency, all of us. In the pure
physics of things, we are nothing but frequency. This is how it’s all built. So, our
work when we go beneath the surface is that we’re dealing with frequency now. We

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
are not dealing with the concretized illusionary result in the maya. We’re dealing with
the frequency that ends up playing that way.
That’s what I like so much about understanding the nature of the vehicle. Is that
when you really grasp what the vehicle is, you get to see that the vehicle is just this
synthesis of all of these frequencies, and the uniqueness of the differentiated
frequencies, that when brought together in the synthesis in the illusion, you get us.
How sweet.
The Writing of the Rave I’Ching
It’s one of those things to understand about the Rave I’Ching—that was an
extraordinary experience for me. I was living in a tiny little village outside of
Frankfurt in Germany, a little place called Frankfurt Homburg. I had the inspiration
to write an I’Ching. I can’t imagine where that came from. But I was dealing with
the early examples of the Designs that I had and the basic knowledge that I had.
But the lines needed to be described. What surprised me the most was that they
came out as binaries. That is not part of its tradition. Each and every line has a
binary foundation; though, there are some singularities and triplicities which, as you
will see when we look at them at a deeper level, they’re fascinating why they’re like
that.
But the whole duality process is something that is right there in the Color
underneath; we’re motivated to a dualistic life. We are motivated through what we
call transference at an analytical level; we are motivated to move towards
conditioning. And of course, it is there in every level of our being, this binary-ism, if
I can call it that, that’s there at every single level that you look at. No more so when
you move from the hexagon and you move to the triangle. Of course, here we enter
into the realm of Tone.
If you’re following this progression, we start off with the line, we go to the hexagon,
we go to the triangle, and then we’re going to close with the square. So, we have
these archetypal forms, but they’re even more significant to understand them in
terms of these are archetypal frequencies, the way the frequencies build one on top
of the other.
Tone: The Relationship is Consecutive Dissonance
When we’re looking at Tone, here we’re seeing the clearest example of the built-in
binary nature in humanity, the clearest possible example. Because when you’re
looking at a triangle you are looking at a three-sided object and you can see very
clearly that Tones 1 and 2, Tones 3 and 4, Tones 5 and 6, that they’re all neatly
moved off into their own specific little corner. Here you can see how deep the binary
is. Here you have a shifting, if you will, of the binary because you can see now how
different, and it’s one of the things I try to get across in the sense that it’s only on

196
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
the surface that the six operates through what we call a hexagram through what we
refer to as trigrams.
When you go beneath the surface, and we’re dealing specifically just with the
frequency, that is very different. And when we were looking at the binary of Color,
we saw the binary of Color was made up of harmonies, this relationship between the
1-4, 2-5, and 3-6. But, when you get to Tone, the relationship is pure consecutive
dissonance: 1-2, 3-4, 5-6. In other words, what we’re seeing is the way in which the
frequency is manipulated from one level to the next. And that the relationship
between the 1 and the 2, the 3 and the 4, and the 5 and 6 has the same—sort of, as
you will see—because they’re deeply related to what builds the Spleen, Ajna, and
Solar Plexus and what aligns everything to the Spleen, Ajna and Solar Plexus.
Building the Differentiated Biological Preference
It’s one of the things to really grasp about Tone. Tone is really going to be one of
the deep keys for us because it’s going to be able to align us to the building of the
differentiated biological preference. Boy, is that a mouthful. Let’s think about again
what we’re looking at. I want to keep on reminding you of this because it’s so
important in order to grasp this knowledge. We are only looking at what makes us
different. That’s important to understand; we are looking at what makes us
different. It is very, very specific.
So, when we get down to the Tonal level, what we’re looking at is that we are
looking at where that specific-ness that differentiates us out of what aspect of what
will eventually be our biology, or physiology, what aspect is going to be highlighted
as a result of that. It is a specific highlighting. It is not about the building of Splenic
Centers or Solar Plexus Centers, the keynoting here where you see Splenic binary,
Ajna binary, and Solar Plexus binary. What it is really talking about is a
differentiated preference for the way in which the frequency is going to work its way
upward and where it’s going to impact.
Color is a Mediator between Tone and Line
Color is simply—let’s call it a mediator—Color is a mediator between Tone and Line.
So, what the Tone establishes is very much the way the Line is going to have to deal
with the world. The only difference is that it is the Color that is going to shift the
way in which that’s going to look. In other words, if you’re dealing with a Splenic
binary and you’re dealing with differentiation that is going to be keyed to the Spleen,
as an example, then it is going to come out on the surface. It will. How it comes
out is another story because how that frequency moves in its chain from the Tone to
the Color, that’s going to tell us a lot. It’s going to change the way in which that
frequency is going to operate.

197
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Remember, when we’re looking at the top and we’re looking at the line, when we’re
looking at whatever line it happens to be, it’s made up of all these possible chains;
all of them. And that you can see already that where Color establishes the couplets
and the way in which couplets and binary operate on the surface, that it is the Tones
that create the trigrams. And that is really something to think about.
In other words, the way in which it’s going to operate on the surface, the root of that
is in Tone. As a matter of fact, all biological-the whole area that we want to look at
in terms of PHS, that our Holy Grail, in that sense, our foundation is going to be
Tone. It is the Tone-Color-Line chains that are going to be the Personal Health
System that allows us to see specifically the way in which the frequency is operating
in specific areas.
Think about how significant it is when you begin to look at any configuration, any
activation, from its root source; in other words, what is really going on at these
Tonal levels. And of course, we’re going to go into the Tonal binaries in a very, very
deep way because they are, for us, so important in our understanding, specifically
about the way the vehicle operates.
Tone is a Key to Understanding the Body
It’s not so much an enormous value when you’re dealing with the Personality. The
Personality needs to understand Color Transference at the Personality passenger
level. But to heal the body, to help understand the body and the potential

LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
weaknesses or dilemmas in the body, that Tone is really a key for us because it gives
us immediate associations. It gives us a way to see how that whole process
operates.
This triangle, this is the bodygraph. It’s even set up like the bodygraph—lower left,
Spleen; lower right, Solar Plexus; up there, Ajna—this is the bodygraph. If you want
to know why we have a bodygraph here is the answer, it’s at the Tone level. When
the initializing frequency comes out of the single aspect of the Base Crystal, the first
thing is that everything is placed within this context. This is the first physical
building principle that it’s going to be in this form. This is the form and this is the
way the form is going to work.
Each level as we move up establishes what is there on the surface; it’s not a Design
down here, if you know what I mean. It’s not like we can analyze this triangle in
that way. But it’s what builds what we eventually get to analyze on the surface as a
bodygraph, which means something interesting. This is where all the gates and
channels are. This is where all the centers are. Everything that is the bodygraph is
here.
You have these geneticists who work with things like fruit flies and different kinds of
bugs. One of the things they do is they try to see what happens when they adjust
certain genes. So you’ll have this place where something will turn into a leg
somewhere down the road. It’s not a leg there; you can’t even imagine it as being a
leg, but it’s going to become one. What we have to see is that when we’re looking
here at the Tonal level, all the potential of the bodygraph is here and it’s why there’s
a bodygraph on the surface, because the bodygraph is the first framework for the
frequency coming out of the Base.
If I could show it to you as a kind of animation, how you could see the square or a
box, however you want to look at that, the square at the bottom with its center
being the fusion point and out of that coming a frequency and that frequency coming
out through this triangle that moves through the hexagon that reaches the line that
becomes the form, at least in the illusion, at least in the way our brains are designed
to see frequency as real, to feel the table as if it’s solid, to bang our knee against
something and have the illusion that not only have we banged our knee against
something but it hurts. Isn’t it incredible? It’s such a delight.
It’s all just a projection game. I can see standing there at the crystal and turning
the crank on the projector and out pours the light through this triangle that
ultimately is going to become the differentiated bodygraph. Not only that, but to
understand that every single element of activation, all has as its basic principle
integration into the bodygraph. It’s right here. Tone is really amazing.
Only when we begin working from the ground up, when we begin the second
semester, we will begin from the ground up so that we can see how the whole
projection is built. Not looking down into that process, but how different it is when
you’re building upwards into, or towards what the form principle will be and to see it
in that context. So, this triangle, it’s very special. Tone is very special and it’s just

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
another frequency; another “just”—funny words to use with something that is so
magical but in fact that’s what it is.
Adding the Bases: The Whole Program
Finally, in our progression we get to this very crowded keynote world, teaming
literally with information. What we have brought in is the square that is the four
Bases on the corners, and the Personality Base in the center as the integrated field.
Here you see the whole program, and how interesting it is to begin to understand
that out of every word, out of every keynote that is here, there are these
extraordinary chains that move in all of these directions that end up with billions of
us differentiated beings.
This is one of my favorite illustrations. This whole series of illustrations is built for a
personal program I have for building chains, which eventually will be a public
program somewhere down the road. To see how this keynoting language, how it
shifts and moves. I love keynotes; I love stringing keynotes. Then you begin to see
how this formula is coming out of this cornucopia, this magic central place, this Base.
Because it’s not the Base and it’s not the Tones and it’s not the Colors and it’s not
the Lines, it’s the neutrinos. The neutrino ocean is just an information sea, a data
bank, vast data bank.
What we’re dealing with is how that vast data bank gets filtered, streamlined,
limited, pushed through a very, very, very narrow spectrum. And then you can see

200
LESSON NINE: The Substructure of a Line
the magic of life. It’s like when I talk mystically about the crystals of consciousness
and I talk about the Center Crystal that if you could put a light through it, it would
show you exactly the same image that was there in the original crystal. This magic
out of each of these facets, the whole totality is expressed through the facets. And it
is these crystals that carry with it the basic structural program for existence, for life
in all forms, in all ways, for all beings, all creatures, and all living things, whatever it
may be.
If there ever was a Solomonic key, then you’re looking at it because there has never
been anything like it. This is, at the most stripped down level, this is the key to
existence, and this is the way the life force works. This is the way everything gets
programmed that is part of crystal consciousness, everything. And the joke is that,
well, it’s actually accessible.
Complexity is Mostly the Illusion
I’m deeply grateful to see this way, it’s incredible. And I’m always amazed that, yes,
it’s complex, but it’s still simple. It still follows basic rules. It still allows us to have
access to it. And that it says something about life itself, that complexity is mostly
the illusion. These are all just patterns, aspects set one over the other, building on
each other, moving through space, in that sense evolving. But, if you want to see
what life is, this is the mechanism, this is the way everything works. And for us,
that gives us the wonder of being able to deal with information at this level.
I even added a couple of special keynotes. Those are keynotes you can find—any of
you that have taken my Base programs and have illustrations from that. But here
the terms of Humanity, Earth, Civilization, Friction, what I’m just dropping in there is
just to give you an understanding that not only is the bodygraph built into what is
the Tone frequency, but the whole nature of our planet and the way in which our
planet operates is in the Base. It’s in the Base. So that we don’t simply emerge into
a life in a vacuum, that we don’t simply emerge into a world in a vacuum, we don’t.
We carry aspects of the whole world with us. After all, the illusion is simply made up
of the sum total of the synthesis of all the frequencies on the planet, nothing else.
Nothing else.
We are the Creative Process
So, each and every one of us are in microcosm the creative process, that’s us. We
are it, it is us, it is our perfection, it is the beauty of what it is to be, and it’s so
incredible to think that this illusion we live in, this reality that we take so seriously,
this life that costs us and pains us and all of that, that underneath there can only be
surrender and helplessness and wonder. It’s so incredibly beautiful to see the way
the whole thing is built.

Lesson Ten
The Vehicle is the Life
Everything is Dualistic
It’s our 11th week and it has been a fascinating process for me to try to go over the
surface ground. One of the things that it reinforced in me was a deep and abiding
respect for the absoluteness of the binary, the pureness of duality. Duality only
functions in the maya because everything is geared towards duality, because
everything is dualistic. It’s not just about the surface maya of dualism, we see the
dualism in our very genetics, and we see the dualism in just about everything that
we can possibly imagine because it is the basis of the construct. But dualism in the
maya is the by-product of inherent mechanical dualism in the principles themselves,
in the form itself.
One of the things about going through this first semester as an overview is to really
marvel at the mechanics of the illusion. That is, what happens when the Magnetic
Monopole does its function and holds together these two very diverse aspects and
brings them together in this illusion of being, and how extraordinary it is, this being
brought together in the illusion. Everything about being brought together in that
illusion, the work of the Monopole, that the Monopole itself cannot create that unless
there is a framework for it—the mystery of Color, why is Color in transference.
Color is a Link
Color in transference lays the foundation for expressing dualism on the surface. It is
through the Color that the Monopole is able to link the two aspects and bring the two
aspects together into a quantum. The Color is extraordinary; and yet, the dualism
goes beneath that. It’s not just simply in the Color itself, you can speak of no Color
without seeing that it has a fundamental duality, a basic duality, a this or that, that’s
always a part of any aspect.
We need to see that when we look at the basic construct, when we go down into the
crystal itself, that we’re looking at every aspect through a binary lens. It is the only
way to see. So, when we leave the bodygraph behind, we enter into the realm of
the crystal. And when we enter into the realm of the crystal, we have to leave
behind what happens in the illusion that the Monopole creates, and begin to see
simply a separate construct.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Here in this particular graph, the way in which the Color is laid out is that you have
its binary aspect. That is, you have the two different fundamental keynotes for what
is, in fact, the function of Color at the Personality level, and Color at the Design level.
But they are so different from each other. They are so different from each other.
When we think about Color in its relationship to the Personality, we are dealing with
what the passenger ultimately thinks about as themselves. When we look at the
nature of their being or their seeing, their Sun/Earth or their Nodes, we’re only
talking about the way in which the maya is perceived by the passenger. Nothing
else. It’s just about perception.
The Life of the Vehicle
But the moment that we move away from the Personality and we enter into the
domain of the Design, everything is form. In other words, it is something that is
going to be lived out, is going to be an aspect of a function of the physical vehicle; it
is not about perceiving. It is the life of the vehicle itself. So, it’s one thing to look at
an illustration this way, and to see the variables that are there, the relationships
keynote-wise between Personality Color and Design Color, but it’s essential to
understand that Design is something totally different in the way in which it operates.
It is totally different.

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
I began with the theme of duality. It’s very important to recognize that the majority
of our work is going to be focused on a basic duality-duality. That is, the Sun/Earth,
this duality; the North Node/South Node, that duality. And these are keys in the
way in which we are going to be able to understand the nature of the vehicle. Not
only understand the nature of the vehicle, but of being able to be of service to the
vehicle.
Difference between PHS and Rave Psychology
There’s something interesting to contemplate between the difference between PHS
and Rave Psychology, in a way. You cannot do anything for the vehicle unless the
vehicle is operating correctly. You can impact the passenger if the passenger and its
vehicle are not operating correctly. It doesn’t mean that you end up with a positive
result, but it’s a very different process.
It’s something to understand about being able to help someone physically, that for
us, it is going to be necessary for them to be participating in the active
experimentation of living out their Design. Because everything about strategy and
authority is rooted in operating correctly in the vehicle, and this is something that we
need as a kind of tuning fork to begin the process of being useful to dealing with the
deconditioning process at the vehicle level. In other words, how do we refresh the
vehicle, how do we allow the vehicle to be able to reach its potential?
It’s something to understand that when we are looking at this basic binary duality,
that we are looking at two very, very different aspects of analysis, and two very
different aspects of service. Now, I began to touch on that for the first time in April
at the Ibiza event when I was talking about extrapolating out of the various Design
Colors the potential for different kinds of therapies, different kinds of aids, holistic or
otherwise, that could benefit someone. And we talked about those various aspects.
All of that was specifically related to only one aspect of this binary. In other words,
when you are looking at this binary, you’re looking at two different things. And what
you’re really looking at is the difference between the inside and the outside.
Everything is a binary.
The Inside and the Outside
As a matter of fact, there are aspects of the body that are outsides that are inside.
Like the whole Throat system going all the way down into the stomach, all of this is
just folded in. Inside and outside are very important to understand in terms of the
way in which we can deal with the vehicle on two levels. One level is what is going
into the vehicle. In other words, when we talked about these therapies, when we
talked about these various processes, we were talking about what the vehicle was
intended to take in for the inside. But not about what is absolutely essential and
that is the outside.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
This is the basic binary. The Internal is the Sun/Earth, and I am speaking of the
Design. The External is the Nodes. Those are two very different things, and each of
them is very much conditioned by their Color. But there’s something to think about
here. And it’s something that makes it very interesting. It is interesting, but
nonetheless.
Design Level Transference is the Most Destabalizing
When you look at the graph, it’s actually divided into two parts. You can see the
appetite/taste/thirst, the 1/2/3. This is one side of this graph. On the other side of
this graph is the 4/5/6. That is, the touch/the sound/and the light. It really is two
very, very different parts. As a matter of fact, they are different enough that within
the context of
transference, the
transference at the
Design level is much
more destabilizing
than transference at
the Personality level.
Remember when you
have transference at
the Personality level,
all that’s happening is
that the way in which
you perceive the
motivation is
changing. It’s the way
in which you perceive.
It’s not the way in
which your vehicle
functions that’s
changing. That’s a
Design thing. And it makes an enormous difference. Color transference in the
vehicle, this is a physical phenomena. So there is a very strong polarization that
exists between the left side and the right side of the Design Color graph. And this
polarization is very important to keep in mind because there is a real difference
between both the Internal and the External when you see it relative to whether it’s
left-sided or right-sided.
And this is part of our discussion for today as I open up for you where we’re going in
terms of our work together. That is, it is the time for us to enter into the realm of
Design Color, and to begin this process of moving through the chains. The key is
understanding how to interpret this binary, the Sun/Earth binary, the Nodal binary,
in the context of the vehicle only. In other words, the way it operates as the way in
which the crystal filters the information before it is integrated into the illusion of the
whole, just simply being able to see it as programming information.

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
Here, for example, because I’m going to use this example throughout, that I’ve listed
here the Color configurations. Here we’re dealing with the 5th Color. Obviously, in
dealing with the 5th Color we’re dealing with the phenomena of sound. What we’re
going to see is that one of the tools that you have not received yet, is a tool that
allows you to frame these aspects on either side in a condition.
The Environment Means Everything
The most important is the environment. It’s the environment. The environment
means everything. It wasn’t until I got to this point in my own process that I began
to understand, not simply that all illness, all disease is trans-auric, but to go even
deeper in a sense than that. That the well-being of the body is not just simply within
the body, but the well-being of the body is directly affected by its relationship to its
physical environment. Its physical environment.
The Nodes/External
If you look at this illustration, obviously you’re dealing with the Nodes and we’re
dealing with the term ‘External.’ So we have the Internal and the External. I’ll go
back afterwards and we’ll look at the Internal, but we’ll see it in a new context.

207
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Let’s look here at the External. What we understand about the Nodes, what I teach
you about the Nodes, is that from the Personality point of view, the Nodes represent
our slice of the world we’re intended to see, our angle of perception, our line of
perception, our slice of the 32 different ways of being able to look at things.
The Vehicle Seeks the Correct Environment
But again, that’s about the perception. There is no such seeing that is taking place
here in the Design Nodes. There is no looking at the environment. There is either
being at rest in the environment, or meeting resistance in the environment. And the
law of the vehicle is that it seeks rest. That is, the law of the vehicle is that it is
looking for an environment that is not so much nurturing, that it is an environment
that doesn’t interfere with the difference; in other words, an environment that
embraces the vehicle. That’s what the Nodes are designed to seek.
Remember, we can never escape the fact that everything is going to work out as a
binary, and seeking is everything about life forms. Life forms must seek, they must
seek to feed themselves, they must seek to procreate, they have to seek, it’s always
about seeking. So here is the Design of the vehicle seeking an environment. The
physical environment is just as important as the Internal environment; there is no
separation. There isn’t any separation. The outside can make you as sick as the
inside. And if you’re not in the right environment, if your vehicle does not move to
the right environment, then you’re going to see that the impact is a physical impact,
because of the transference.
Hardscape and Landscape
Let’s look to something that changes the way in which we look at this construct.
Remember, we’re looking at something that has two sides: a left side, the 1/2/3; the
right side, the 4/5/6. You can see here they have specific keynotes. Now, these
keynotes are directly related to the Design Nodes. It represents a division into these
two, into hardscape and landscape. We’re talking about physical environments, now.
We’re not talking about perceiving, we’re not talking about imagination. What we
are talking about is that the vehicle seeks the potential in the duality. It seeks the
hardscape or the landscape and it seeks it according to its Color. So, Color becomes
something very significant to the physical well-being of the totality once we get to
that stage.
First of all, hardscape, that’s not a new word, by the way. It is a word that was
coined about 25 or 30 years ago and it describes what we would call urban. In other
words, the hardscape is what has been paved over, what has been constructed on,
what has been built on, usually built up, in that sense. You can see that the very
foundation of the hardscape is also a joke. And we must enjoy the jokes as long as
we can. Now, where is the joke here?

208
LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
If we think about the hardscape, one of the things that comes to mind immediately is
large built-up urban areas, what we call cities. And yet, if you look at the 1/2/3, and
you think about it in terms of its resonance to Line themes, you’re looking at a self-
absorbed, self-involved process, a self-involved being, as an example. In other
words, what we would call lower trigram turning in on itself, that that lower trigram
is driven at a physical level within its body, is driven towards the hardscape, is
driven towards the highly communalized socially integrated environment. But of
course, everybody knows how alone you can be in a flat in a city. But anyway, that’s
hardscape.
By the way, if it was as simple as urban/rural, those would have been the keynotes.
But it’s not, because, the hardscape can also be those areas where life or the ability
of life to form itself, is so difficult. It can be anything from an Antarctic ice flow to an
outcropping plateau. So, the hardscape is a place where the survival mechanisms
are much more tuned in. You can see the variations of the hardscape, the
appetite/taste & thirst. All of those, in one way or another, no matter how we
differentiate them are related to basic survival needs of the body. So, the hardscape
is also the place where there is going to be a struggle for this, otherwise there would
not be an accentuation on it, because everything is a binary.
Landscape
When you go over to landscape, there are obvious things that come to mind. The
seaside, the mountain view, the whatever the case may be, the countryside, the
rural, the less developed, all of that is true. But it’s also something else. It is deeply
related to height. So, for example, if you live on the 50th floor of a building in a huge
city, you’ve transformed your hardscape into a landscape from the perspective that
you have as a view. It’s just something to think about.
In other words, I don’t want you to be rigid in the way in which you interpret these
words. I want you to just simply carry them and understand that there is this
fundamental division that is there in terms of where the body needs to go, and think
about the transference, because transference now isn’t simply a matter of the
perception being not properly motivated; we’re not talking about motivation here.
Color at the Design level, yes, it is a driving force, we cannot call it motivation
because it isn’t a Personality thing. It’s just not the name for it. It is the
determinism, if you will, in the vehicle, and maybe that’s the only word that will
work. These Nodes are determined to find that hardscape that’s correct, that
hardscape of the 3rd variation. And that’s what that vehicle is looking for.
If the vehicle is operating correctly, there is no question that the vehicle is naturally
going to move towards the right environment. But that does not mean that the
damage that’s been done is suddenly removed, because these are very, very
different things.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Crossing Over is Transference Operating at the Design Level
The other thing is, it’s just one of those things that you have to think about, is how
much of illness is about landscape-determined vehicles being in hardscape
environments, and hardscaped-determined vehicles being in landscape
environments. And I have a suspicion that an enormous amount of the dysfunction
of the vehicle that we have is related to this crossing over. And this crossing over is
the transference operating at the Design level and a transference that can be so
profound. It just can be so profound; how different a world that can be.
The classic example here of the 3, this Color in this Nodal configuration, here you
have a 3rd Color, so just looking in the general terms, the vehicle is looking for a
place in the hardscape. It’s looking for a place where there are going to be a lot of
other life forces around. It’s looking for that kind of environment.
But we also know that that thirst is going to carry with it certain dynamics, certain
needs. In other words, this is a vehicle that is going to need access to the clean
water. It’s going to need access to the right kind of foods with the right kind of
water in them, all this kind of stuff, and all of that in a specific environment where it
has to be found in that environment. Think about what happens when you give
authority over to your vehicle. Your vehicle gets determined by the Sun/Earth and
its Nodes on the Design side. Everything else is the Personality giving the passenger
its line of sight on what it thinks it’s in control of and what it is in fact just watching.

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
The Exploration Next Semester
Our exploration of chains is going to be a binary. It’s basically what I want to
introduce today as something for you to contemplate as we go through our break.
The fact is that we’re going to go down these two tracks and we’re going to go down
them simultaneously. I’m going to teach this dualistically so that I’m going to have a
first half of anything that is going to be Sun/Earth related and then the second half
will be Nodal related so that we go down these two different tracks.
I think it’s very important to separate the difference between what are the Internal
phenomena and what are the External phenomena. I think that for the benefit of
being able to teach this, it’s very important not to lump them together so that they
are really understood separately because if we’re going to treat them, just like in
medicine you have internist and externalists, it is really the same thing. That is,
there is a huge difference between the way in which we can begin to look at Color
chains in relationship to the Internal, the intake of the vehicle where the vehicle
needs to take into it physically, and on the other side, the External.
I think, for example, that many of the subjects that were discussed in April, for
example certain therapies, I think that these therapies are deeply related to the
External much more than the Internal. And I think ultimately what we’re going to
find is that we need to find that balance between the two. In other words, to bring
balance between what is not necessarily easy to balance. That is, you have
dissonance here between the Sun/Earth and the Nodes. So you have dissonance in
the way in which the relationship between this vehicle and the environment that it
needs to sustain it, and the vehicle itself what it needs for its sustenance. These are
two very, very distinct areas.
What I’m hoping is that we will develop a separate language for these two aspects, a
separate language for the Internal and a separate language for the External. I’ve
been developing illustrations for the second semester and I’m working on keynote
variations so that we can have a way of really clearly distinguishing between Internal
and External because I’m convinced that the quantum of our knowledge of those two
is really the holistic healing of the vehicle. In other words, we need to see them in
relation.
So, for example, it’s often amusing to read about drug addicted stars out there who
suddenly go to some place in Arizona to get detoxed. They come out relatively rosy.
It’s just interesting to note something about the advantages of what positioning
means, what landscape means, what hardscape means, what it means that
environment is one of the most important things for our well-being. We have that in
a kind of a sort of banal way in which we have a so-called ecological movement
that’s been going on for maybe 50 or 60 years now, this sensitivity to the impact of
pollution and so forth, on the environment.
But that’s just an aspect of what is the real truth. It’s like my discussions about the
nature of being that the nature of being is about who is in your aura and where you
are. This is one of the magical things. If we were not designed to understand where
you are we would not have open G Centers. This is one of the most important
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

211
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
wisdoms that we are here to grasp is that the environment is as holy as the body
and that the integrity of the whole is dependent on a balance being achieved
between the two.
I think what’s so brilliant about PHS at the Design level is that there is this wonderful
obvious logical binary between these two realms; and a way for us to be able to
access them, and obviously a way for us to begin to interpret them. I haven’t
touched upon the fact that we’re dealing with the 21 and the 48 and so forth and so
on, and what that means relative to the whole interpretation. This is the next step in
our work as we move through.
Look at Your Own Design Color
What I really want you to see is that we have two realms to deal with and to begin to
look at your own Design Color with this perspective. And really the most important
step to begin with is to look at your own Design Color; and these two themes, to
begin to see that this is the basic binary for the vehicle.
The vehicle has basically only two kinds of concerns, and they’re both survival
concerns. Everything about being a bio-form is about survival. But you have these
two survival concerns. You have basic sustenance concerns. In other words, you
need to take things in. So, why live in a desert when you can live in a lush
landscape. In other words, one side of the equation is that we need to be able to be
in a zone where we can have access to the sustenance we need.
The other side says that where we get the sustenance is the most important thing
because it’s this environment where we can find our security. In other words, it’s
just the other side of the coin, but it’s so different. The reality is that it literally
means that the environment you’re in is an aspect of your health. Period. Now, that
may sound like, “Well, yeah,” but it’s more than “Well, yeah,” it’s really quite
incredible. It’s like suddenly the last 10 – 15 years popularity of feng shui, not that
I’m a great feng shui fan, but nonetheless, all of this again is part of this beginning
to intellectually grasp the whole nature of environment. How important environment
is.
Architecture Constructed by the Not-Self
It’s clear to me that architecture was created by seven-centered Manifestors and
they did a horrendous job for the rest of us. Our architecture is really a great
enemy, in that sense, the way environments operate in the way in which they’ve
been constructed, and they’ve been constructed by the not-self on patterns
established by the not-self. The holistic transformation of one’s physical being, if we
could talk about physical enlightenment, is this perfection between the Internal and
the External.

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
It’s why you go into many Eastern cultures, not just Eastern, any place where they
build a temple, you can see how beautiful it is all around, how magnificent they try
to create that environment, how important environment is to our sense of well-
being. If you walk into a place that’s falling apart and darkened and whatever, there
is a sense of discomfort. Environments have an enormous impact, but much more
than the obvious. They’re affecting the way in which the crystal informs the vehicle.
The Crystal, the Monopole, and Color
Let’s get down to basics here; we’re talking about the crystal. So, the crystal sends
its information out and the information goes out through all of those Design crystals
and all of those cells as it moves through the system, gets interpreted, gets
translated, gets shunted down to the chemical release zones, gets shunted down to
the organs and so forth and so on and all the way through. So if the signal at source
is disturbed, everything going down that process is disturbed. And what we’re
talking about here is the source.
In other words, we’re talking about what happens in the crystal where the crystal is
linked to the totality. That’s what makes Color so important. It’s the Magnetic
Monopole that is able to tap into the Color zone. There is no line, not for the
Monopole. It hooks into the Color of the filtering of the crystals and this is how it
pulls the whole together. So they have enormous power, in a sense; and again, the
Design so much more than the Personality.
So the moment you have transference at the Design level you have all the
information going out to every aspect of your physical body, all of it is being filtered
through that Color, being pulled from that Color in transference. How easy it is to be
in the wrong environment. I’m not talking about your country or your city or your
house; I’m talking about all of it, all the environments that you deal with. There are
so many, after all and so many possibilities.
The Environment and Programming
But it’s the lesson that the undefined G Center teaches us. The undefined G Center
says that if you’re in the wrong place you’re with the wrong people. If you’re in the
wrong place nothing works. If you’re in the wrong place in terms of the environment
that you’re in, then all the programming going into your vehicle is not correct. What
it is, is that you’re being conditioned to operate in an environment that is not healthy
for you. And this is why most people are sick, and not all the time. They’re
vulnerable because they’re not in the right environment and most human beings are
like this.
Most human beings are living in their transfer world. And they’re being conditioned
at this very, very deep level. They’re being conditioned to adapt to a different
environment and an environment that is not correct for them. It’s not just about
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
213
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
what we’ll look at, the nuance of what are the differences between the Colors
themselves, what are the values in that, what does that mean, we’ll get to all of
that; but, more important than that is understanding the basic simple surface of this.
You end up being conditioned to adapt to an environment that is not correct for you.
And that means you end up wanting in certain areas, lacking in certain areas.
If you’re designed to have a focus on the sustenance in your life, bringing the
sustenance easily into your life and you end up hunting for the environment instead,
your body does not get served in that. You end up being exhausted, impotent, and
unable to be able to perform at any level that would speak of your potential—wrong
environment.
PHS: Prescription for a Healing Environment
So the environment, PHS is not just about healing the person. It can’t be. It’s about
not so much healing the environment, but providing a prescription of a healing
environment. How different the environments for healing will be for those of
different Color. They will have to be, because the environment is part of the healing
process. I can’t imagine, for example, being healed in a hospital. I can’t, even
though as a child I went through that process because I had an appendix removed.
I walk into those environments and it’s an environment that screams of, well, I don’t
have to get into it, but anyway it’s not very pleasant.
Environments mean so much and much more than anybody has given them credit
for. It’s enormous. And each of us, not only are we specifically determined to be still
in the right environment, it’s one of 32 possible environments. It’s a spread. It’s
the Nodal theme, these specific environments.
We’re stepping into an area where we can begin slowly to grasp the needs of the
body on the outside. It’s not something well understood. What is really healthy for
the vehicle on the outside? And we’re going to see that there are these 32 variables
that are there. And each of them ultimately represents what are in fact healing tools
for us in the end. That is, an understanding of each of these very specific External
environments.
Too Many Caught in Hardscape
Hardscape and landscape, this duality is very, very important. It is clear to me that
if you look at the beginning of the cycle we’re in since 1610, in 1610 for every
person that was in a town or a village there were many more people that were still
on the land isolated, tribal or whatever. In this cycle, which is really the flowering
and death of the seven-centered being and the rebirth of the nine-centered being,
what we have seen is this enormous expansion of hardscape, to the point that we
have it today where there are so many human beings who are pulled to, attracted to,
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2006 Jovian Archive Corporation
214
LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
caught in vast hardscape landscapes. And obviously, all of that is out of proportion.
So much of it is the problem.
Aside from the fact, these are environments that create aura boxes that create these
environments where conditioning is so extraordinary. And for us to begin to see that
there are those that belong in those environments. Basically it’ll be half, and there’ll
be half that do not belong in those environments. It’s obvious we’re not going to
change the world, at least not tomorrow. Often our diagnoses are going to be quite
difficult for clients to deal with because environment is going to be so much of what
the cure is. And to be able to point them clearly at what is the correct environment
for them.
It’s not enough that their vehicle is going to operate correctly because on the surface
you have somebody who is experimenting with their Design. This is going to help to
align them more and more to what is their correct Color. But they’re carrying all of
the conditioning that has led to this change within the way in which their body
operates so their body doesn’t operate at a frequency that is correct. When you
meet them they’re still in the consequences of, the chain reaction of the steps that
they have taken in that process to adapt to whatever the conditioning happens to be.
So, when we’re talking about deconditioning these beings, we’re talking about two
things. It’s not just enough to give them a therapy, a medicine, a whatever if there
isn’t going to be a change in their environment because without the corresponding
change in the environment, there may be nothing wrong with them internally and
everything may be the fact of the External environment. And they, themselves in
the illusion above are showing symptoms that would point to what is an Internal
problem when, in fact, it is entirely External.
Seeing Others Holistically
The Nodes are incredible avenues of insight. For me, as a counterpoint to the
Sun/Earth you have this magnificent diagnostic duality. And we’re going to see the
relationships, obviously because we’re dealing with the same Colors, we’re going to
see the relationships between the Sun/Earth and the Nodes, the various relationships
of the combinations of their Colors. To begin to see the mapping of that and to
clearly be able to look at somebody’s vehicle not simply from probing on the inside,
but truly being able to see somebody holistically. You can see the whole dilemma,
you can see the necessity of the environment and the correctness of what the
environment should be for them, you know that they have come to you in
transference, that their body has been caught in adapting to the conditioning of the
environment that they’re in through the transference, and then the process begins.
The deepest part of that process is that as easy as it will be for us to do the Internal
work, and I’ll talk about that after, it will be very difficult for us to accomplish the
External except in the sense that we can do the rock star number. In other words,
we can have specialized environments for the needs of each of these Colors, and be
able to provide them with a place where they can go to in order to go through some
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

215
PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
kind of healing process. But it’s like the difficulty of experimenting with your Design
and you’re surrounded by people who don’t honor it.
It’s very difficult for somebody who is in the wrong environment and they have
adapted to that environment to leave that environment because it means leaving the
life they have within that environment and the people that are there. Again, this is
the great teaching of the open G, is to recognize that the right environment brings
the right beings. And the right beings means they’re not going to bring beings into
your aura that are going to influence you negatively in the way in which your vehicle
is going to operate.
Design Transference
So being able to understand how detrimental transference can be at the Design
level, and yet there’s always this extraordinary irony in understanding things, this is
the way the world works. I was reading the review of a book of a Spanish writer,
just something in the newspaper. He was talking about what the world would be like
if everybody was immortal. His take on that was how many people would stop
making money. All the insurance companies, all the morticians, all the doctors, all of
those people would suddenly be in a lot of trouble. And when you look at the world
around us, this world has adapted to Design Color transference. It’s deeply adapted
to it. The majority of human beings are in Design transference.
And again, it’s not just about the way the Personality perceives. Here we’re talking
about a vehicle that’s constantly operating through a frequency that though it may
be a harmonic, so it’s not totally devastating obviously, it is a harmonic, it still is not
correct. And of course, it leads to vulnerabilities in the system. Based on the Design
you end up seeing where the vulnerabilities are going to emerge. Again, we’re going
to be able to see that when we go down in the chains, particularly when we go to the
next level and we align the environment with the Tone that is related to it.
We have to have a truly unique approach to what is our own holistic practice. In
other words, we have to embrace the fact that whoever is coming to see us that they
are also bringing their environment with them and we cannot ignore that
environment. We can not just prescribe for their Internal and assume we have
accomplished what is necessary because it will fail. We have to see that separation
is an illusion. And we have to see how clearly we can in essence prove this.
The External dysfunction that is caused by Design transference, how that is going to
lead to what is clear, problems in the being at the illusion level in the maya where
they’re going to get sick and that sickness is not about anything other than long-
term environmental damage. Long-term environmental transference away from
where one is determined that one should be. And of course, it’s this literally being
determined, in that sense, to be exactly in the right environment. This is the
ultimate awakening for the vehicle. This is where transcendence for the vehicle
takes place. There is no promise of immortality, but there is a promise of a healthy

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
vehicle until it dies, which I think is for any of us as good a bargain as one can get
with the vehicle.
Our ability to truly be of service begins with grasping this deep, deep binary that is
here and beginning to see how important it is to understand the Nodes at the Design
level, how different they are from what you’ve learned about it in terms of the
Personality and to begin to experiment in terms of your research, your looking at
other people in your life, looking at this relationship between hardscape and
landscape and the impact of transference.
There’s also another aspect to this duality and of course it’s the difference between
the South Node and the North Node. It is another fascinating level and nuance of
being able to understand the needs for environment in developing one’s life, and the
need for environment in flowering one’s life. The developmental External
environment, let’s call it the progressive External environment are things that are
seen through the South and North Node. Wherever we’re going to look we’re going
to see this binary, this duality that is going to be a very important part of the tools
that we need in order to be able to look at the being in relationship to its
environment.
Design Sun/Earth: What the Physical Body Needs to Take In
When we’re dealing with the Internal, and this is what I touched upon this year in
April, this is about the relationship about these basic themes—appetite, taste, thirst,
touch, sound and light—and their relationship to the being. It’s so interesting about
the Sun/Earth. That is, what the Design Sun/Earth represents is what we need to
take in, what the physical body needs to take in. It’s very interesting to understand
it and to also recognize that it doesn’t represent 100 percent of what the body takes
in; it represents 70 percent of what the body takes in. And you can see that where
the Nodes are taking in
other aspects that the
body is here to absorb.
But what’s so interesting
about the Design Color
is that it isn’t about what
the body does, but it’s
about what the body
takes in. Its concern is
about what it takes in.
The doing is done in the
illusion. That’s the joke
in the end. The doing is
part of the illusion; there
is no doing down here at
the crystal level when
you’re dealing with the

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Color. Here is the concern for what the vehicle is going to take in into its vehicle.
That means everything that we are open to, how we are going to take that in. And
obviously, when you look at the six different variations that we have in terms of
Design Color themes you can see this sort of generic of ingesting, of taking in from
the outside, and how different they are in the way in which they operate.
However, it’s something to think about. The Sun/Earth represents our Design for
nutrition. It may be a limited term in that sense because it is nutrition that goes
beyond just sustenance—food and drink. But the Sun/Earth is about what we are
programmed to need to optimize the function of the vehicle. I think that’s the
easiest way I can describe it.
In other words, it’s almost like it’s a menu that it represents a fine tuning of what
sources will bring the right fuel to fulfill the potential of that differentiation. In other
words, the Color really represents something very specific. In other words, it’s
saying, “Look, for this kind of engine you need to have this exact mix. And if you
have this exact mix, then the engine is perfect, it’s going to have exactly what it
needs to run on. But if you alter that mix, then you’re going to end up with certain
problems.” Basically you end up—again, because all of this is frequency—with a
frequency that is not quite correct.
So, here when we’re looking at the Sun/Earth we’re looking at something else.
We’re looking at what we need to take in. And when you think about it as being the
Profile, and that is something to think about, is to understand this very, very basic
difference when you’re looking at a Profile, when you’re looking at Incarnation
Crosses, to really understand how different these two things are. The Personality
Sun/Earth, all this is about stamping a potentially unique perception. But, here it’s
how can we take in what we need to stay alive. How can we take in what we need in
order to be able to function perfectly—the vehicle’s concerns. It is a consciousness
crystal, after all.
Design Sun/Earth: Magic Key to the Inner World
When you’re dealing with the Design Sun/Earth here we have our magic key to the
inner world, because it’s a key to what is necessary on the inside. The thing is that
you can’t tell at the Color level, because it’s just a generic. The interesting thing
about what the body needs to take in—it goes very deep in order to see it. What the
Nodes need as an environment is not deep at all, it’s all surface. And here it’s very
deep. So, what one needs isn’t simply a matter that there is a determination in a
specific Color. But there is going to be a chain that is there down to the Tone, down
to the Base that is going to make that need very, very specific.

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
Healing the Differentiation
Think about what we’re really talking about. What we’re really talking about is
healing the differentiation. Do you understand? The differentiation is our
uniqueness. It is our potential perfection. Everything that we’re looking at is going
to be rooted in finding the exact recipe for that differentiation. It may be surrounded
by other things, but that basic component that needs to be taken in must be taken
in. And there is a track for all of that. The track is what has to be followed
downward.
But here in the Color, here is the real mystery of the vehicle because what the Color
is pointing to is that the differentiation, every human being’s differentiation is fueled
by a unique chemistry. It only makes sense. It is personal medicine, very specific to
the differentiation. It’s why it’s necessary to have somebody experimenting with
their Design. So you have the advantage on the surface that there is stability in the
way in which the vehicle is operating.
But then to really see something about what we need to take in, how easy
transference is. This is the dilemma and we live in a world in which transference is
normal. It’s not like the knowledge given to me shows me how to stop it, so it’s
normal. There’s supposed to be transference. Awareness can maintain alignment
but transference is normal. It’s what the not-self is. It’s what the not-self lives on.
Everyone Has a Unique Internal Formula
Nobody has ever done this; that is, nobody has ever realigned the vehicle to the
differentiated correction for the Internal /External. We get paint buckets thrown at
us and we’ve got this little spot that we’re dealing with. But the way in which the
outside world operates in terms of well-being is that all of it is seeing in its
homogenized perspective. Even when you have ten people who seem to have the
same symptoms, there is a very specific nuance for each of them.
It is that special ingredient—it doesn’t matter if it’s covered up with jam—there’s that
special ingredient that needs to be there to maintain the integrity of the
differentiation. And that’s what the Sun/Earth is about, because if you maintain the
integrity of the differentiation, the Personality has a chance to recognize the
fulfillment of purpose. It’s not like the Design Sun/Earth give a shit about purpose, it
can’t. It’s not its domain to ponder such things. That’s not its job. The job is to
maintain the vehicle as well as possible. And that maintenance means that there is a
certain fuel. It’s like people who try to tell you that everybody has a unique mantra
and if you know your mantra—poof—there’s this unique formula for everyone. It’s
true; it’s there, this unique Internal formula.

PHS YEAR 1, SEMESTER 1: The Mechanics of the Vehicle
Again, it’s not enough for us to be able to look at that and say, “Ok.” What does
that mean, anyway, your unique Internal formula? The formula itself is a binary.
You have the Sun and you have the Earth and they’re very different in terms of the
way in which the Internal operates.
Design Earth Most Powerful Force on the Design Side
The Sun is about making sure that there is enough essential material, whatever you
want to call it, the intake, the internalizing, that will maintain the functions of brain;
brain, not mind, brain. And when you’re looking at the Earth, the Earth is looking to
stabilize the whole general program of the vehicle.
In the same way that when you look at an Incarnation Cross the focus is on the
Personality Sun, the most powerful force on the Design side is the Design Earth. It’s
not to diminish the importance of the Design Sun. Remember that if you don’t get
the right kind of formula intake then the Design Sun isn’t going to be able to do a
proper job in providing the physical well-being of the brain plant. There may not be
enough of this or that, whatever the case may be. And of course, that will ultimately
limit the potential of the Personality.
The Internal and External Duality
So when we’re looking at the Sun/Earth we’re not just simply looking at, in terms of
this internalization, what we need to take in for two very specific things on top of
that, how different they are. And how that will lead to us understanding a lot of
things between the way in which the basic vehicular infrastructure, the skeletons,
organs, muscles, bones, tissues, cells, and the way they’re instructed—the Sun. The
Sun/Earth combination here on the Design side is really extraordinary, because the
Sun basically represents the way in which all of the information is moved through the
vehicle mechanically. And the Earth is what it’s being moved through. In order for
them to work correctly—remember they’re a binary and an opposition—in order for
them to work correctly the right input has to be in place.
So, we have two very distinct things that we are looking at. We are looking at the
need for Internal balance, what we can discover therapeutically, holistically, how
ever, through the relationships in the Colors. How we can begin to see what the
right Internal mix is going down to the various levels that are there in the Sun/Earth
configuration in the chains, and on the other side, the balancing of that. Not simply
bringing what is necessary for the inside, but without the right environment the
vehicle’s potential goes unfulfilled because it’s designed to operate perfectly in the
right place.
In the same way that the Internal information for the maintenance and the integrity
of differentiation, that this allows for the vehicle and its instruction system to operate
correctly, in the same way that the Nodal environment is again an affirmation of the

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
integrity of the differentiation. That specific environment nurtures the continuation
of the differentiation.
So, this combination of the Internal and the External, this very, very basic duality
and this duality is the essence of everything. This work that we do, this is a dualistic
work, this life we have, this is a dualistic life. It is this and that in all things. And
here at the Design level in many ways we’re going to see and experience the
mystery of this ‘this’ and ‘that.’ And to see it just within the context of the physical
dynamic, the context of how incredible it is the way this crystal filters the neutrino
stream, filters it into a fundamental, basic binary. Everything comes out as a binary.
You’ll see no matter where you go you end up with this binary which is the life
formula and the human life formula is the balance between the Internal and the
External.
This is what our vehicles need, it is what our bodies crave, and it is the perfection
that is possible for them. I realize that because dysfunction at this level, Design
transference, is the norm that in all likelihood it probably means that humans are by
nature extremely healthy beings, given the way the not-self functions and the fact
that we manage to survive in an organism dense environment and survive and
conquer, and so on and so forth.
Balance between the Internal and the External
It is clear to me that what we are looking at, not so much from the Internal but the
combination of the Internal and the External is akin in a mechanical way to the ideal
of yoga, which to hear myself say is rather odd. But it’s true. That is, the
enlightenment of the body, or the awakening, which I prefer, of the vehicle, this
balance between the Internal and the External is not normal because normal is
dysfunction. And it means, and I put it that way to state the obvious that I think we
can be of benefit in both areas, I think we may be of benefit synthetically.
But it’s clear to me that anyone who is going to be awakened in the form that the
balance has to come from both areas, that it’s both Internal and External. And when
there is a balance in those two, then you have the perfection of the vehicle. I look at
it and I see because I watch my own movie it’s so clear to me how much stillness
there is in that, and how well your system operates.
This combination is one that is very profound, and I think it’s going to be very
exciting for us to go down these two separate tracks and see how they reinforce
each other. But also see how detrimental it is to be caught in the transference.
What that means to be moved from one side to the other. What happens to you
when you’re in the wrong environment? What does the conditioning lead to in that
wrong environment? What problems arise out of that, and how quickly can it be
changed? That I don’t know. Will it take seven years? I don’t know.
My own assumption, by the way, is that to align somebody who is already aligned
internally, to align somebody correctly externally is probably almost immediately

recognizable as transforming with the exception of the emotional half of the
population who would have to process it a little longer. But I don’t think it would
take a very long time for the impact of environment to have its effect.
The Environment Impacts All of Us
We all know that and yet we’ve never really put two and two together. We’re all
deeply impacted by environments. We’re all so much aware of that—rooms we go
into, atmospheres that impact us. And to begin to see that there is no longer just
this sense of something involved in all of this, but there is biological conditioning
that’s taking place because of the room that you’re in, the environment is impacting
on you. And it’s impacting on you in a way that we have never imagined before.
In my fantasy I can imagine that there are probably 32 different kinds of architecture
that are perfect environments for these variations that exist that we haven’t even
imagined yet. We’re still stuck in the seven-centered Pythagorean world where
everything is about right angles, and environments all have rigid corners. There is
more than just knowledge in terms of the vehicle here; there is an underlying
philosophy that emerges out of all of this about the need to understand our
relationship to the world around us, and to begin to see that it’s a personal
relationship at the deepest possible levels. And how easy it is for us to be negatively
transformed by environment into embracing what is not correct for us, and losing in
that sense the power to maintain the differentiation.
The Vehicle Wants to Honor the Differentiation
Of course, this is what everything is about. That’s the magic that I see when I look
at Design, I see that everything about the vehicle is that the vehicle is designed to
honor the differentiation. It is the genetic continuity of the whole being. The vehicle
wants to honor the differentiation; the vehicle actually is determined to be awake
and efficient in that sense. For me, that is what’s so magical about it, what makes
the vehicle so extraordinary.
But, now I begin to see that the deeper that you go in the knowledge the more you
have to accept that there is no separation and that you can no longer holistically look
at healing without seeing the vehicle in its relationship to its environment. Then
slowly you begin to see the whole. You get closer and closer. You begin to see that
in order for you to be correct as you, you have to be in a world that is correct for
you. That is the magic. This is what this knowledge is pointing us towards, a map of
those 32 different environments where you can be correct and have the nurturing
that you need to fulfill the purpose of your vehicle, to be able to function at
optimum, to be able to provide ultimately what turns out to be mind as rich and
resourceful a medium as possible.

LESSON TEN: The Vehicle is the Life
So, this is an introduction to our next step. I’d like to tell you all at the end here
that it’s been a real pleasure to go through this first semester, this whole
introduction. I look forward to continuing our process. It will be nice to have a
break. At the Rave New Year we will back at it again and I think we have some
interesting places to go.
Note: There are 10 Lessons this semester. One was canceled due to technical
problems.
