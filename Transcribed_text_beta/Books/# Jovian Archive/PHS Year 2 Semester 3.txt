The IHDS PHS Certification Year 2: PHS Practicioner
The Primary Health System (PHS) is a revolutionary approach to well being. PHS
was first introduced by Ra Uru Hu in April 2003. As empowering as Human Design is
for the Personality Passenger, PHS is the awakening key for the Design Vehicle.
PHS is the result of years of ground laying work in the sub-structure of the Line. The
PHS Practitioner Program Year Two focuses on the 216 Chains that define our possi-
ble paths of differentiation and well-being. Semester 3 focuses on the value and
characteristics of Design Nodal Color and the four Design Internal and External
Left/Right combinations.
The PHS Primary Health System Analyst program is open to any student who has
completed PHS Analyst Year One program.
The IHDS is the official Human Design and Global Incarnation Index certifying and
licensing authority. The IHDS offers programs leading to official certification in both
teaching and practice.
The PHS Primary Health System Practitioner is such a credit program. To complete
this program for certification, students are required to complete the entire program
of three years.
This book is a transcript of the second year, third semester originally taught in
Spring of 2007.

Lecture One
Introduction to External Analysis
Effectiveness and Longevity
Hello, welcome to all of you; welcome back. I had a lot of time in the break after the
Ibiza Event to think not simply about where to go in this semester, but I was really
concerned about where I wanted to go next year in being able to really complete this
process and to be able to tie off this second year in a way in which the—there is a
real wholeness to the knowledge that you have.
External Analysis: The Nodes
So, we‟re going to spend this semester really completing our look at the design side
because I‟m going to take you through a very detailed journey through understand-
ing external and understanding external analysis. Obviously, when I‟m talking about
external analysis I‟m talking about moving away from where we have been now for
five semesters with our focus on the Sun/Earth and the internal, and obviously its
deep, deep importance in our physical lives, as well as the development of the po-
tential of our brains.
But there is something that is equally in its own way of really profound importance to
the life that is found in the nodes. If I go back to my earliest teachings, if I go back
to the very beginning of my teachings in Human Design, I taught the Cross of Life,
and how important it was, that it was the bedrock of the knowledge. There were li-
mitations as to what I could share in those early beginnings. But this theme of the
sun above and the earth below, and the south node and the north node as the sign-
post of a movement, that this really is the frame upon which the life is built.
Yes, the other things are interesting, obviously. On the surface they bring about the
phenomena of type and authority and all of these things. And yet, to grasp that in a
sense of the way in which we are programmed, the way in which the programming
operates that these two, the Sun/Earth and the nodes, are the key.
We see that in Sun/Earth because we see it immediately in profile. We talk about
this “70%,” and basically the percentage of neutrinos as a whole that reaches us on
the planet that originates from the sun. But the nodes are so much more, in a
sense, mysterious, after all. They‟re so different than everything else; that is, an
activator of genetic potential. After all, they‟re not a thing at all. They‟re not like

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
the Sun/Earth. They‟re a position. They‟re nothing more than a window on space, a
window through which a great deal of neutrinos fly from the star fields beyond that.
If you think of the solar system as a cell it‟s essential to understand that the
Sun/Earth is the key to this life. But it is the nodes that connect us to the greater
life, to the totality as a whole. It‟s what connects us to all things. So, the nodes are
very extraordinary. They‟re different from the Sun/Earth in the sense that the
Sun/Earth is always moving direct. And the nodes themselves follow much more the
precession of the equinox. That is, they travel, generally speaking, that is, their
mean direction is retrograde. Though, they go back and forth in a kind of dance
where they go one step forward and two steps back all the time. It takes them
about 18½ years to go around the wheel.
I think one of the most profound teachings that you can get in Human Design is to
learn about the nodal polarities, just the polarities in the wheel to begin with. But to
begin to understand them, begin to appreciate them for what they mean. It‟s some-
thing that‟s been explored on the personality side, to a point, but only to a point. I
re-released this awhile ago, before the event, the nodal polarities in my investigation
of them in reference to the personality.
But I have never truly taught what the nodes really mean at the design side. I‟ve
given you impressions and hints, but I haven‟t really shown you. It‟s one of those
things that is so interesting, at least from my perspective, and the consequences of
it, where that will go, will be very interesting to see and we will share that journey
together.
The PHS Internal and the PHS External
Here in this illustration [next page], because I‟m going to do a sort of rough over-
view tonight and set the parameters for you and then we will explore all of this in
detail. Here are our two factors: the PHS internal and the PHS external. I want you
to grasp something that‟s very, very important. They do not have anything to do
with each other. So let‟s get that straight. They don‟t have anything to do with each
other. It doesn‟t mean that themes in one may or may not align with themes in
another. But they don‟t have anything to do with each other because they‟re about
totally different things.
We understand what internal is about. That is, internal is specifically about the di-
gestive system and the impact of correct digestion on the inner workings of the ve-
hicle and particularly the brain system. That‟s internal, very specific. But external is
something else. It is about being able to create more efficiency and to be able to
enhance longevity by being in the right place for the right things at the right time.
Now, that‟s something else. It‟s something else entirely.
In other words, it‟s something to understand about our vehicles. It‟s like—I always
loved the expression of mudder, I don‟t know if you‟ve ever heard that. It‟s a refer-
ence to a horse that can run on a rainy track. Some horses can do that. They don‟t
lose their balance, break a leg and die. They can do that; they can run in the mud.

Lecture One
Introduction to External Analysis
It‟s something about understanding these vehicles. These vehicles have distinct ad-
vantages that they can draw from specific environments.
Everything is in Movement
Through Human Design I express an understanding of the nodes that only was truly
begun to be understood by the Hindu Brahmins. To really grasp nodes you first have
to have a sense of what they‟re really doing. I talk a lot about the proper alignment
of the vehicle. One of the things that I mention over and over again in my teaching,
particularly when I‟m waxing philosophical, is that everything is moving. Human be-
ings forget that; it‟s understandable, but nonetheless, everything is moving, it‟s al-
ways moving and it‟s something you need to take deep into your consciousness. It‟s
only when you take that deep into your consciousness that you can begin to grasp
the beauty of the dance of this movie, because it‟s all movement.
And what coordinates this movement? We know that the magnetic monopole which
holds us together in the illusion of our separateness that it guides us along our line
of geometry. So we know that the form as a whole, that its guidance system is
through the monopole. What we also know is that the monopole and the design
crystal have a unique relationship. When you look at the nodes of the personality
you‟re literally only looking at seeing. That is, context seeing; in other words, how
things, or within what perspective things are actually viewed or taken in by the mind.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
That is something very different from what the nodes are at the design side. This is
the physical environment that you align to that the magnetic monopole keeps you
aligned to when you have connection to your cognition. In other words, when the
vehicle is operating correctly, and again it goes back to the mantra of Strategy and
Authority, the cognition is guiding the vehicle which means that the vehicle is being
aligned to what is its correct movement in space.
Now, in that correct movement in space, and not all the time, it will depend, as you
will see, on color, is that in that space there are particular environments that are
beneficial. And what you‟ll see is that, again, they are grouped in a familiar way for
you and you will see that there is a similarity between the lower colors and the up-
pers colors, what we have come to understand as conditions and circumstance. We
will see that environment is divided in a different way, but a similar way. In other
words, well, rather than explain it, let me show it to you, because it‟s always fun to
show people something they‟ve never seen before.
The Design Nodal Environment Chart
Let‟s begin here. You‟re familiar to a certain level with this kind of graphing now I‟ve
been using now, this division between the lower and the upper, the division between
the Left and Right, obviously based on the tonal fixings. But in essence, that‟s where
it ends. In other words, that‟s where the similarity, other than the fact that you
have seen these keynotes, but basically that‟s where the similarity to the internal—
and here you can see this is the design external—ends.

Lecture One
Introduction to External Analysis
The Observed
What we‟re looking at first of all is two very, very different ways of thinking about
environment. I‟m going to use nodal environment as a general expression in order
to give it some kind of overall generic. If we‟re talking about nodal environment we
can see that the Left vehicle and the Right vehicle are going to take advantage of
specific environments differently. That‟s the first thing to grasp. So to see that
those on the Left are going to be occupied in their environments; in other words,
that theme “observed” simply means that they‟re not staring at the roses; they‟re
picking them, or whatever the case may be, but they are involved in those specific
environments.
Efficiency and Longevity
Remember, all of this is about increased efficiency and longevity. Think about those
two things: efficiency and longevity. These are specific environments that are deeply
beneficial, not simply to the body, but to the life of that body because those envi-
ronments carry special potential. As we go along we‟re going to be in this process
for many weeks, so you‟ll get the detail of it. I don‟t want to get sidetracked.
The Observer
All right, let‟s go to the other side, to the right side. If we go to the right side we
have the “observer,” and obviously the observer in a nodal environment is going to
be very, very different than the observed in a nodal environment. In other words,
the advantage of that environment is going to be taken differently. So you can
think, for example, that the nodal environment for the Right body is the ideal effi-
cient place to take in information and that taking in of information is going to en-
hance the longevity of the vehicle.
Whereas, if you‟re dealing with the observed, they take advantage of the environ-
ment by being active in the environment, rather than the passive of the observer,
they are active in the environment and that is how they gain both the efficiency and
longevity advantages.
So already we are dealing with a fascinating subject. Again, remember in a sense all
of this is a natural alignment. In other words, if you take a child from the moment it
comes into the world and you raise it correctly and all that stuff, PHS, the whole sto-
ry, that as they mature the environment that is natural for them is one that they will
move towards and nothing will get in the way of that, because it will be simply natu-
ral for their vehicle to move in that direction.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
Money and the Environment
Now, it‟s obviously deeply different for human beings, all the layers of conditioning
that we have. And of course, the deepest layer of conditioning when we come to the
nodes is money. Oh, what money does for environment. The only thing that wealth
can provide you that carries grace is space. Money creates dilemmas for beings, be-
ings that are locked to specific environments because they are where material possi-
bilities exist. The mega cities of Shanghai and Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur, these
places where tens of millions of millions of human beings are caught in these envi-
ronments, polluted and whatever, because to not be there is to not survive.
So, one of the things you have to grasp clearly about the nodal differentiation is that
the most profound factor in the way for most human beings is that to move from this
to that, it can be a threat. And you‟ll see that‟s particularly true for the upper colors.
Landscape Colors and Hardscape Colors
Let me just sort of briefly now give you a sense of what these colors are nodally.
You can see that to begin with we have a difference here between the upper colors
that are called “landscape colors,” and the lower colors that are called “hardscape
colors.” Now, if we were looking at this in terms of the internal, we would see this
lower one as being conditions and the upper one as being circumstance.
In other words, the hardscape is about very specific environments, very specific en-
vironments; whereas, the landscape is generalized environments. So you can see
this movement: caves, markets, kitchens—and you‟re allowed to smile—mountains,
valleys and shores. In other words, you have a very, very different way of looking at
the determination of the vehicle to be in the right place.
Again, it‟s something to grasp about what this brings. It‟s not like if you have a 1st
color node that you have to be in a cave all the time, and I‟ll open that up a bit so
you can get a sense of that, but nonetheless. It doesn‟t mean that. What it does
mean is that the cave is going to be the place where you can take certain advantag-
es. You can take advantage of the environment. It is an environment where you‟re
going to be more efficient. It is an environment that taxes your physical body less.
It‟s an environment where the sensory potential for you enhances what is the lon-
gevity potential of your vehicle.
Longevity: Quality of Life
When I speak of longevity, one of the things to understand about the PHS regimen is
that I‟m convinced that this is something that if you follow this regimen—and par-
ticularly, because I don‟t know with adults, because I don‟t know how deep condi-
tioning and how early certain problems are created, but for the example of Alzhei-
mer‟s, I think PHS is something that is anti-Alzheimer. It‟s the exact opposite, ra-

ther than the continued deterioration of the neural system, the enhancement of
neural potential.
And one of the things to understand about longevity in this context is that it‟s not
longevity at the expense of cognition. In other words, it is about the longevity, for
example, of the potential of the brain. It‟s something really to grasp. It‟s just not
about additional years; it‟s about quality of life, quality of age. After all, it is a phe-
nomenon of the 1781 transition to the nine-centered being that humanity lives long-
er. It‟s clear.
And I know from a personal perspective, my mother who is 94 years old, who does
not suffer from any mental disability, that for her longevity is something that has
very little joy in it and has a great deal of loneliness in it. You watch all your friends
die; you watch your partner die, your family die, everybody that you know. For my
mother any friend that she can befriend who is old enough to be her friend, chances
are that one morning they simply will not be there, or they will lose their mind to de-
terioration.
So, one of the things to grasp about the theme of longevity is that this is not about
offering something that isn‟t there. The longevity is part of the new cycle. It is the
quality of the life. And particularly the quality of the brain that is so important in
longevity. And after all, there is no point in being endlessly old if you are seriously
incapacitated or if you are mentally damaged. So, it‟s very important to understand
this theme of efficiency and longevity, and particularly the longevity, to understand it
in the context of quality of longevity, quality of old age, in that sense. And of
course, this is deeply related to taking advantage of these specific nodal environ-
ments.
Again, it should be a natural process. In other words, to be naturally aligned to what
is one‟s theme. I give you the example of myself. I have a 6th color design nodes.
As you can see it says shores. I was born on an island in the middle of the St. Law-
rence River, Montreal is an island. I‟ve lived on islands all of my life, and have been
living on an island on and off now for 25 years. The shore seems to be there.
And I don‟t want to just simplify it on that level because as you‟ll see it goes very
deep into what that means, or what that can mean. And all of these themes need to
be deconstructed, which is what we are going to do. But I want you to grasp the
surface of this. I want you to also understand that you will be able to experiment
with these environments. That‟s what is so interesting. One of the things that you
notice with your PHS is that when you begin to experiment with your PHS you don‟t
have to wait very long to see the benefits of that process, or to see that process at
work.
And the same thing is true environmentally. Of course, one of the things is that this
is—everything that I learn becomes a technique because this is what is being re-
vealed, that‟s what mechanics is all about. You learn how something works and then
you facilitate its functioning. Here is the possibility to be able to facilitate this
movement to environments that are going to be important and correct.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
The Hardscape
So, let‟s take a look and let‟s begin with the hardscape. Hardscape, by the way, was
a term that was coined to describe urban landscapes, these kinds of places like Man-
hattan where there are all of these endless towers and buildings, the concrete world,
the concrete, steel and glass. Anyway, this term, hardscape. I like the term, and I
like it specifically in the sense that it really is not about outside, it‟s about inside.
You can see that if you‟re upper color nodally that the outside is very important for
you. It doesn‟t mean you have to be out there; but the outside around—again, it‟s
like circumstance and diet—the outside is very, very important. A lot of it has to do
with things like air pressure—there are so many things that are involved in all of
this; but anyway, the difference between the conditions of the hardscape, which is
very much specific environments on the inside.
The 1st Color Node: Caves
So, the first thing is, let‟s begin with the 1, we always start with the most primitive.
Whenever we are dealing with this movement of 1 to 6, we‟ve already seen that
when we‟re dealing with the 1st color internal and we‟re dealing with a PHS of the
caveman and the cavewoman and we grasp that this eating one thing at a time, the
whole basis of the very simplest digestive system.
Now, here when we move to the nodal variation, the first thing to grasp is that the
cave itself was the place to return to. Think about it for a moment, because I really
want you to have a sense of what these environments bring. These environments
are about your connection to the other. This is what the nodes are about. The
Sun/Earth is about you, you, you. And the nodes are about pointing you towards
them, them, them, because that‟s what it is. And of course, we are nothing without
them. The program doesn‟t exist, the movie doesn‟t exist, our species doesn‟t exist;
them is important.
So the place to meet them, if you‟re a 1st color node, is in your cave. And this is
where you‟re going to gain your advantage. And whether that advantage, and we
will get to this in the weeks ahead, is going to be a selective one, or whether it‟s
going to be a blending one, In other words, whether you‟re alone in your cave with
one person, or you‟re alone in your cave with several beings, that‟s the place for you
to be your most efficient. In other words, when I say “efficient,” understand least
resistance. And in least resistance understand least conditioning. This is a place
where the caveman and cavewoman are safe. Not only safe, but here is the envi-
ronment where they gain their advantage.
If you see it in the primitive analogy you can really see the importance of that cave.
You do not want to be caught out in the savanna when the sun goes down, no mat-
ter how many nuts you have in your pouch, because there are creatures out there
that are faster than you, see better than you and will rip your flesh off. Cave is a
good place; nice, safe, cozy. Have a little campfire out front, eat your nuts, and en-
joy the conversation.

Introduction to External Analysis
The 2nd Color Node: Markets
Now, I particularly like the 2nd nodal color, it‟s interesting, this “markets.” And you
have internal and external markets on top of that. We‟re all familiar in this day and
age with internal markets. But think about what that really means. This is some-
body, if I can put it in the most banal language; this is somebody who in the mer-
cantile environment—shops, malls, markets, business places, all those kinds of
things—this is where they are the most efficient. This is where they have the best
quality relationships in terms of least resistance. This is where they, in essence, be-
come healthier in terms of their long-term life process.
And of course, everything about the 2 is about their ability to be able to discern. You
know, these people that like to hang out in shopping districts, not necessarily inside
ones, outside ones where there are lots of people, where there is hustle and bustle,
where there are things going on. This is the gatherer‟s favorite place where there
are all these possibilities and all these options and all these different things that can
be seen, touched, eaten, whatever the case may be.
The 3rd Color Node: Kitchens
And then we come to the 3, and I guess I know these people. Don‟t you know these
people? I really know these people. These are the kind of people that practically
live their lives in kitchens, have their most important conversations in kitchens, fall
in love in kitchens. It‟s the place they love to be.
And of course, if you‟re a nodal 3, the kitchen is your place of least resistance. It‟s
your place of enhanced quality longevity. It‟s your place to meet the other, it‟s your
place. Now, the interesting thing about the 3 is that we know that the 3s and 4s are
related to each other. And there is an external environmental issue that arises with
the 3 that we will discuss because it‟s interesting. The by-product of the wet/dry bi-
nary that is there that is the humid and the not-humid kitchen. The environment
around is going to be significant.
However, it is this place that is so important. And remember, if you understand that
the nodes are there to bring you to those that are correct for you, that you also have
to see that these environments have to be understood as your social environment, or
the most important part of what are the environments that you will be in socially.
It‟s not like you have to live your life in the kitchen, but it‟s only in the kitchen where
you‟re going to gain certain advantages. That‟s the thing that‟s interesting. It‟s not
like it‟s going to hurt you. It is not going to protect you from the normal resistance
that anybody meets in the world. It isn‟t going to enhance your longevity, but it isn‟t
going to make things worse. Then if you‟re operating according to your Strategy and
Authority anyway, you‟re going to be all Right. It‟s not about that; please under-
stand.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
Perfecting the Unique Being
This knowledge is about perfecting the unique being, because the unique being is the
potential of perfection. We have environments that are deeply to our advantage.
When you begin to experiment with it, you‟ll begin to understand it because it‟s quite
amazing. It‟s so interesting for me, my connection to the ancient Chinese, the
I‟Ching, and the five bases in reference to the five elements. And then this whole
feng shui, this whole history of understanding the way environments can be of bene-
fit or not; and yet, without seeing the underlying mechanics and knowing precisely
what it‟s about. It isn‟t about whether you hang a mirror in this part of the room or
that part of the room because if it isn‟t the right place it doesn‟t make a damn bit of
difference. It‟s always that way with knowledge that is out there, but not part of a
synthesis so it can be truly grasped. Oh, yes, place is really significant. And yes, it
can benefit your life; there is no question about it.
But we all have a specific, unique environment that we resonate to that is correct for
us. And again, as I have done with the internal, we are not taking this to the sur-
face. That‟s next year when we take all this information and we begin to actually do
analysis of a being in which we can integrate all of this information so that you can
understand it within the context of that particular gate on that particular cross with
that particular design.
But it‟s so important to understand. And it‟s always the design that sets the founda-
tion for the personality; always, always always. You think about the personality
nodes, the personality nodes are for seeing, ok. They get a slice of perspective, ok.
But, what if they‟re not looking at the right thing? That‟s the whole point. If you‟re
not pointed in the right direction, if you‟re not in the right environment, then what
you see isn‟t of value. It isn‟t. It just adds to homogenization; nothing more. It re-
veals no truth, and brings no grace. We all have places. We all have a nodal envi-
ronment that is ours that‟s special for us. And again, to really grasp that if it‟s cor-
rect, if you‟re correct, then this is where you‟re drawn. This is what is there for you.
The 4th Color Node: Mountains
Ok, so let‟s move from the hardscape and take a brief look at the landscape. You
can see that the landscape has this very, very clear movement. Basically, this clear
movement is moving from, in a sense, high ground to sea level. That‟s really what
it‟s all about, as a movement. And obviously when you‟re dealing with the 4s you‟re
dealing with those that it is most natural for them to be on the high ground.
Again, it needs to be deconstructed. In other words, let‟s say that you‟re living in
central London. Now central London isn‟t exactly the mountains, but then again, if
you‟re on the 37th floor of a high-rise apartment complex, you‟re actually in the
mountains. So, again, be very careful about taking any of these terminologies liter-
ally until we go through this process of seeing each one separately and deconstruct-
ing them and seeing them through the Left and the Right so you understand them
within the full parameters.

Introduction to External Analysis
But nonetheless, there is also, this natural element to it. Somebody who is 4th color
nodally is going to feel very, very good on the high ground, because the high ground
is going to be a place where they always have their advantage. The high ground is
the place that is going to increase their well-being over the long term. These are the
kinds of beings that taking their vacations in the mountains every year, living on the
high floor, working in the office on the high floor, all of that is going to be a benefit
for them.
It‟s a general environment. It‟s like circumstance to the internal. It‟s not that spe-
cific kitchen, you know. It‟s not that specific condition that is there in the hardscape,
the difference between the lower colors and the upper colors. But it is this genera-
lized theme. And it says something interesting about the difference between upper
and lower color in terms of the benefits for the vehicle. Lower color only needs to
take advantage of these environments when it wants to, when its authority leads it
to it. Whereas, with the upper colors the environment is really something that con-
sistently needs to be there. In other words, the more consistent the high ground the
better that is going to benefit the 4th color nodally. It‟s very different from the 3rd
color being who is the kitchen being where in fact they don‟t have to spend their life
in the kitchen. They don‟t have to spend any more time in the kitchen than, enough
time to take advantage of it, take advantage of the conversations they can have
there for the interaction that is there.
The Place to Meet the Correct People for You
Remember again, this is about the other. Now, think about something, because it‟s
really interesting to think about. If you‟re operating correctly, you‟re going to meet
the people that are correct for you. And amongst those beings that you‟re going to
meet that are correct for you is that you‟re going to meet someone that‟s going to
become your partner, your lover, your whatever.
Now think about it in this context. If you‟re a 1st color nodally, that‟s where you‟re
going to meet that person. You‟re going to meet him in your cave, or you‟ll meet
him in the market, or you meet them in the kitchen, or you meet them on the moun-
tains, or in the valleys or by the shore. It is one of the oddest things for me to re-
flect on the fact that I have been married a number of times. I quite literally met all
of them by the shore, a lake shore, a river shore, and seashore; anyway, I don‟t
want to go on, it‟s a long list, but nonetheless, but by a shore.
It‟s something to grasp that what we‟re looking at is one of these fantastic things. It
is a gateway to the other. And it‟s the most profound gateway to the other that has
ever, ever been revealed because this is where they are. And it‟s not just about
yeah, the other in that sense, it‟s about understanding your allies in this life, these
beings that are going to be important for you and you for them, that the fulfillment
of life that needs to be fulfilled through our relationship with the other, that these
are the environments that are going to nurture the best of that. And that these are
the environments that are good for us, we‟re rewarded for paying attention to our
environment; we‟re rewarded with well-being, extended well-being. But most of all,

Introduction to Systems Analysis
the reward of the right people, and this is where you will know. This is where you
find out. This is your place.
The 5th Color: Valleys
Valleys are interesting. They‟re really interesting because of course a valley is both
up and down; it‟s many different things. It‟s very unusual in the way it works. And
it is one of the most difficult aspects to be able to properly explain. It will be inter-
esting to go through that.
The 6th Color: Shores
Shores seem rather obvious. But of course, there are different kinds of boundaries
that become shores. And that‟s something else that needs to be grasped.
Begin to Look at Nodal Color
What I want you to take in from today is just the surface here, nothing more, just
the surface, to give you something to think about. I want you to take out your chart
collection, those people that you really know well, the kind of thing I suggest when-
ever I introduce new knowledge. I want you to take a look at their nodal color. And
obviously, to take a look at your own and to see what that is and to begin to take
that inside in your own perspective, to begin to look at that, to begin to measure it,
to begin to see it.
This is something that‟s of enormous importance particularly to young people to be-
gin to open up for them the possibility of providing them with a signpost that leads
them to environments that are always going to bring them benefits, and environ-
ments where they can really tell. Think about that kitchen person. Just think about
it. They‟re out at a party, they go into—well, let me do it another way. They‟re just
out in the street one day, they‟re sitting in a park and somebody sits down beside
them and they end up looking at each other and they start talking to each other and
it seems like this is the real possibility for a relationship.
One of them, whoever the 3 is, invites the other one up to their flat to have a tea, a
coffee, whatever the case may be. The moment they go into the kitchen they realize
this isn‟t going to work. But they didn‟t know in the park, because they were more
open to conditioning, they had more resistance that they were dealing with. They
were not in their advantaged environment, and in their advantaged environment
they can tell.
It‟s like I started to give you the party story. You‟re at the party and you‟re sitting
beside somebody and you look at them and they look at you and that‟s all, nothing
happens, absolutely nothing. It‟s like both of you realize in that moment that noth-
ing is going to happen so you just let it go. An hour later you end up in the kitchen

Introduction to External Analysis
together and one of you is a kitchen person, and you get it. You see them, you get
connected to them.
The Environment is Everything for Us
These environments are everything for us. Where it is so specific for the lower color,
where that environment is a condition they have to establish in their lives, and a
condition that is something that is there when they require it because it‟s good for
them, it‟s like people who go to the spa. If you‟re a kitchen person, go into the
kitchen. It‟s automatically going to feel better for you. If you‟re the market person,
go out there, you‟re going to feel much better in those environments, you‟re going to
feel much healthier and you‟re going to meet those forces that are going to be good
for you.
The external is really very special. What‟s so interesting about it is that in the end
the only thing that it provides is an opportunity to really have a full, long life. That‟s
what it really is all about. All the nuances and all the things that we‟re going to look
at, because we deconstruct that into physical and psychological terms are secondary
to what the mechanism is, the mechanism is moving you towards these environ-
ments because this is the vehicle wanting to extend its viability and its longevity,
and its efficiency as a vehicle.
All the other things are secondary—the way we interpret it, the way we look at it is
all secondary to that. The most important thing for us psychologically is to grasp
that these environments are keys to love and career and all kinds of things because
they‟re precisely the right environments for the necessary connection with the other
that is a connection that is going to work and be positive for that being.
This is the whole struggle. The Sun/Earth struggles with the individual—will you be
unique; can you follow the determination to differentiate as a being. But it‟s not
enough, it‟s never enough, it can‟t be enough; this is not the way things work. And
of course, the other side of this binary is what the nodes are all about, bringing us to
that place of encounter with the other, filling up our lives with activity, filling our
lives with life, that‟s what this movement is about.
If we can honor what our vehicle is at the deepest level, then we are going to see
that we have this natural tendency to be fulfilled and to be healthy in specific envi-
ronments. One of the dilemmas about so much of the knowledge that is being re-
vealed mechanically now is how distorting it can be in a sense of it doesn‟t fit into
homogenized patterns that are accepted. Eating according to your PHS is certainly
something that requires a great deal of social adaptability. It does change the way
of one of the basic patterns in life. If you‟re a child you may be more advantaged as
a child to be a lower color than upper color. At least a child that‟s a lower color,
that‟s a 3, will get a chance to be in a kitchen, or a 2 be out in the market, or the 1
to be able to stay in its room. But, if you‟re a child that is a 6 and you have a family
that lives in the mountains, you have a problem and a difficult one because it means
all those years that you‟re growing up you‟re never really going to be able to meet
the forces that are right for you.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
These are things to really grasp about the uniqueness of this knowledge. It‟s there
to empower the uniqueness which means that one has to be fully prepared to follow
one‟s own authority regardless of the circumstances. And obviously that‟s not some-
thing that is easy. It‟s clear to me that so many couples, as an example, that this
would be a very difficult thing. There are many configurations here that obviously
don‟t work; they just simply wouldn‟t work together.
I think as we go through the deconstruction we will see that there are some ways to
compensate. Again, remembering that the upper colors are related to technological
advancements and things we can do as substitutes.
Written comment: Shore of a high alpine river?
Exactly, you could have the shore on a high alpine river, yes, you could.
So, we need to be able to look into that. Again, like all of these processes that I
have taken you through, it‟s only when we get through the long term deconstruction
to understand the relationship on the Left side and on the Right side and to see that
through the various themes that are in each of these colors.
There is Perfection in Our Geometry
But the most important thing is just to grasp this surface of understanding that it‟s
only natural to assume that there is perfection in our geometry. It‟s only natural to
assume. And again, that‟s perfection as an expression of uniqueness. No two ob-
jects can occupy the same place at the same time. We all have a right to our unique
trajectory, movement in this life. And to see clearly that in what it is to perfect be-
ing a human being, all the things we see, the strategy and the authority and the
PHS, the psychology, whether Left or Right and the trajectory and the movement
and all of these things that if you take all of that and you take it to its level of com-
pletion and correctness, you have that unique perfection. You do.
And each of us deserves the gift that comes with place, because this is what it‟s all
about. It is your vehicle taking you precisely to what is the environment that best
suits you, that best suits the vehicle. And out of that comes an enhanced quality of
life because it‟s the vehicle‟s life. This is the thing about a life force, it‟s a life force,
and it doesn‟t want to die. The vehicle doesn‟t want to die. The vehicle wants to
keep on going. The internal has no control over how long the efficiency of the ve-
hicle can last, because the internal, in and of itself, is not the final say on the line,
the geometry, the connection to the other. Without the benefit of the environment,
there is no guarantee that the vehicle has a chance for a long, healthy process, be-
cause it‟s the environment that it‟s all about.
And of course, it‟s one of those things that we‟re going to see that this is going to be
a great healing tool. And please, do not be premature and jump on this until I‟m
done; but it‟s a great healing tool. You have somebody that really does not feel well,
take them to their environment and they will immediately begin to feel better. These

Introduction to External Analysis
environments have enormous importance in the long-term process of maintaining
the well-being of the vehicle.
Digest this Information Slowly
And of course, the well-being of the life is dependent on the quality of the beings
that are in the life, it‟s all together. And it‟s all here. One last thing, as I introduce
each of these things to you over the years now, it‟s very easy to jump on it and look
at it outside of the synthesis. Again, this is always the risk. Digest this slowly. It‟s
the beauty of our process together. This is our 56th lecture together in this PHS pro-
gram; it‟s quite a journey. It is the advantage of the depth of this journey that
enriches this process. We have a ways to go.
Ponder your nodal color. I think you‟ll find it very exciting. By the way, don‟t start
telling all kinds of people. Be careful with that. Be careful in wanting to immediately
put it into your readings. I know how all that works. Don‟t do that. Wait until you
digest this. I think it‟s very, very important that you take this in properly. And we
see all of it together and you have a chance to ponder it. I‟m not saying that there
aren‟t those people in your life that you don‟t want to tell that to, you certainly can,
it‟s not the point. I just don‟t want it to be the kind of thing where I‟m getting ques-
tions from first year students asking me, that they‟re kitchen—these kinds of ques-
tions right now. I don‟t want to deal with any of those kinds of questions right now.
I just want us to be able to go through this process. So, loose lips sink ships.
Anyway, it‟s my pleasure. I have a deep joy in this knowledge at this level. And
we‟re in one of the most fascinating places now, so I look forward to next week; until
then, bye for now.

Lecture Two
PHS Nodal Color 1: Caves
Let us begin our nodal journey. I know that the information is exciting and interest-
ing. Again, I caution you. I‟ve had a lot of wonderful emails over the last week with
all kinds of questions that are way ahead of the gun. I just want you to settle back
and enjoy the journey and let‟s see where we get to when we get to the end.
The 1st Color: Caves
Let‟s begin with caves. Obviously, we‟re talking about 1st color. We know already
that in dealing with 1st color PHS, when we‟re looking at the internal we‟re looking at
something very specific. That is, we are looking at what we call a rigid digestive sys-
tem and we are looking at something that we describe as being primitive. That is,
the 1st color as a caveman/cavewoman, consecutive/alternating, one thing at a time,
very, very fundamental system.
It‟s important that when we‟re looking at environment in this way, that is, when
we‟re looking at the external to also keep in mind that as with all number progres-
sions from 1 to 6 in the work that we do, that we are looking specifically at an evolu-
tionary progression. I could have used other words, I suppose, but nothing suits this
more perfectly than cave.
A Need for an Environment that is Protected and Secure
Let‟s think about cave for a moment. When we think about it, the things that I think
about are two very basic things. One is there is only one entrance. It‟s something
very interesting to think about. That is, my assumption would be that if you‟re a
PHS nodal 1, a room that has two doors, as an example, and I don‟t mean going into
a closet, I mean two exit doors to other environments that that is a more “danger-
ous” environment than being in an environment where there‟s one door.
One of the things about the cave itself when we think about it is that first of all that
one door was very important because it enabled a focus on a basic issue, which is
security. Whenever we‟re dealing with 1 themes, anyway, we are dealing with basic
fears, basic insecurity, we are dealing with concerns about survival. And the cave is
a survival enhancement tool, if I can say it that way, because it wasn‟t just simply a
matter of shelter, when you think about it. You could have a bamboo or branch
shelter or you could start making tents and things like that, but that‟s not where we
are.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
We‟re at something very, very basic. That is, the need for an environment that is
protective. A need for an environment that is secure. A need for an environment
that is defensible. In other words, if there is only one entrance then there is always
the ability to defend that entrance, to not allow somebody in, to refuse to open the
door, and so forth and so on. So, when you think about cave in this context, and
we‟re looking at this as an external, then you really have to see that these are
people that need shelter.
The External is About the Other
Let‟s think about something for a moment. Let‟s sort of try to take another perspec-
tive on all of this. Your vehicle, we know that the design crystal consciousness is
what is intended to be the intelligence that guides the vehicle. Ok. And we know
that when we‟re dealing with the internal we know that if we have correct digestion
and we‟re operating according to Strategy and Authority that we‟re going to be able
to determine our differentiation in terms of our brain system.
However, in order for us to be able to enjoy the benefits of that brain system, in or-
der for us to be able to grow, one of the most important things for us is where we
are, because where we are establishes what the potential is of our life. And where
we are is always in relationship to the other. And it is something that you really
need to grasp about these fields that run here.
Selective/Blending
I want you to understand this as a direction towards dealing with the other. I don‟t
want you to see this in the way in which we have looked at this within the context of
the internal. Remember that we‟re dealing with the external. And these are keys in
being able to understand what kind of relationship is possible that is going to be pos-
itive in the external and in what environment. In other words, this is about being
selective about the other; this is about blending with the other.
This is about going inward with the other and this is about going outward with the
other. This is about going for a swim with the other and this is about taking a tan
with the other; I don‟t mean to be cute. But I just want you to have a sense be-
cause I will go through all of these and deconstruct them. But I want you to begin to
see this is about having an active connection to the other, this is the passive connec-
tion to the other, and it goes on and on.
The External Establishes Your Potential in Relationship to the Other
I don‟t want you to see this in the way in which we have used it in the internal be-
cause obviously this is all different. The external is about the other. It‟s one of the
most important things to grasp about the two sides of the coin that we are examin-
ing. The internal establishes your potential within yourself. The external establishes

your potential in relationship to the other. And your relationship is enhanced in re-
gards to the other when you can take advantage of what are the correct environ-
ments; that you can take advantage of what is the specific way, Left or Right, that
you are to deal with the other. And again, this is not about telling you to be this. It
is about understanding that if you‟re operating correctly, this is what becomes natu-
ral for you.
Caves: Shelter and Control
So, let‟s go to our caves. Let‟s think about our caves. First of all, what do they
mean? There‟s the obvious. That is, a room, a room with one door out, a room that
you can call your own, whether that room is your bedroom, your studio, your office,
whether that‟s your car. Now obviously cars have more than one door out, but when
you sit in a modern car you can lock all the doors, so in that sense you have this—
it‟s similar. There are people, for example, who are 1st nodal color who spend a
great deal of their lives in a car, doing business from the car, having social time in
the car, the kind of people who love their 4 ½ hours a day commuting, whatever the
case may be.
But again, you need to be able to deconstruct these environments to see them in the
complexity of our society now, but still to see the fundamental theme. The funda-
mental theme is shelter and control. The last place that the homeless will live before
they go to the street is their car. It‟s the last cave that‟s available before they are

Introduction to Systems Analysis
thrown out into the vulnerability of the savanna, and no cave to get back into for
protection because caves are protected.
These are about secure environments. They can also be jail cells, by the way. They
can be all kinds of things. But I want you to understand the value of this for this
particular being. The value of the cave is not that this is where they live their life. It
isn‟t. They will not live their whole life in a cave; there is no need for that. Life will
be what it is. But what they will see if they‟re operating correctly is that it takes up
a large chunk of their life because it is the most comforting and successful environ-
ment, whatever that may be—that room, that studio, that office, that car, that jail
cell, whatever it may be. This is their cave.
Efficiency
Now, remember that when we‟re looking at the external, what we‟re really interested
in is that this cave is all about the other. This is the place where you can meet the
other and you can benefit. Here is a place where you can meet the other and you
are protected from negative conditioning. Here is a place that allows you to be more
efficient. Here is a place that will promote you living longer. That‟s quite a place.
Think about the efficiency part. The moment that you are in your nodal environ-
ment, there is no resistance in the environment. There is no need for you to be on
the alert to handle the consequences of what happens in that environment. As a
matter of fact, you‟re at your advantage in that environment, which means you can
be much more efficient in whatever it is you‟re doing.
And of course, again, this is about primarily one‟s relationship with the outside world
and with the other. You can tell what happens to these people. What happens to
these people when they are not correct, when they spend so much of their time
away from what are the caves that are correct for them, that they end up being vul-
nerable in situations and in those situations where they are vulnerable, those situa-
tions take away their efficiency and begin to impact the potential of their longevity.
Reducing Resistance in Relationships
Your environment is a very special place, because it‟s perfect for you. It doesn‟t, by
the way, mean that it is perfect for the other. It doesn‟t. It‟s one of the dilemmas.
And one of the things to understand about the cave is that door is meant to be
opened. In other words, one of the things to be clear about is because of the exter-
nal and its relationship to the other, that the environment is also there as the place
in which one can be, in this particular case, secure in order to be able to deal with
the other. “Come into my cave, I‟m secure here.”
So, the business person who is only comfortable doing a deal in their office, behind
their desk, in their chair, with the other person on the other side and the door behind
them. There is power in this situation. The power is the security of the environment
and the efficiency. One doesn‟t have to deal with an unusual environment or a diffi-

PHS Nodal Color 1—Caves
cult situation. One doesn‟t have to be in a restaurant trying to make a pitch and a
waiter pours coffee on you.
In other words, this is all about recognizing that when you‟re correct your natural
alignment is to an environment that isn‟t simply good for you, your internal takes
care of that, it is good for you in a different way. It reduces the resistance in your
relationships with the others and that‟s what allows you to live longer.
You know these comedians who do jokes about their wives, or their husbands for
that matter, they always have that sort of half punch line that says they‟re killing
me. Now, if you‟re in an environment that is not correct for you, the fact is that your
potential of full longevity is being diminished, and in essence, they‟re killing you.
Resistance is an incredible thing.
I don‟t think that most people in design think about it enough. I go on and on and
on about we‟re objects moving in space and everybody goes, yeah, yeah, nice phys-
ics, Ra. But I mean you really have to get that. Any object moving in space has to
deal with resistance. When you think about the nature of us moving in space and
you think about the nature of our auras and the way in which our auras meet other
auras, you have to begin to understand something about the whole nature of being,
is that we cannot escape dealing with the other and the other represents the deepest
conditioning force that we meet in our lives. We are only attracted to people who
condition us; we‟re not attracted to people who don‟t condition us—boring. This is
the set-up. We‟re attracted to all these forces that do condition us.
And obviously, in dealing with that you‟re dealing with huge resistance when you‟re
trying to be you. It‟s why the environment is so important. The environment gives
you an advantage. Not only does it give you an advantage, but if you‟re somebody
operating correctly and you‟re in your cave, you‟re not going to let in anybody who is
going to impact your longevity. And they‟re not going to be able to condition you,
not in that environment.
And what I mean, again I have to be so careful that you don‟t misconstrue that kind
of statement. No aura is bullet proof, it‟s not about being bulletproof. It‟s not about
not taking in the frequency of the other in those areas where you have receptors.
But the moment that you‟re operating in your correct environment, there is no latch-
ing on to it. There‟s no hook. That‟s the whole thing. And of course, that efficiency
that is ultimately promoted in that is the ability to be yourself.
The Need to Control the Door/Privacy
So, let‟s think about our caves. Different people who have a 1st nodal tone, they‟ve
experienced it in different ways. As kids it may have been their room if they had
their own room. It may have been the bathroom if they didn‟t have their own room.
There are all these places where the door could be closed, even locked if they were
lucky, because again, the security is so important.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
That ability to be able to close the door and lock it and nobody can get in is some-
thing that is so important to the cave person. The bedroom that you enter into that
you sleep in alone is an extraordinary thing for the cave person. It‟s essential for
them. And at the same time recognizing that they‟re controlling the door. This is
what it‟s all about, and they need to control the door. That‟s what it‟s for.
The moment you‟re given something by the gods, you‟d better believe you‟re going
to deal with it, because you will. You‟re given a PHS nodal 1, you‟re going to have to
deal with it; you just are. And it means that if you do not know how to discriminate,
if you do not know who goes in the door and who doesn‟t go in the door, boy are you
ever going to be in trouble. It‟s also about privacy. These are beings that need that
privacy; they need it. This is what helps them live longer, it makes them healthier,
and they‟re happier; they need it.
A Controlled Single Room Environment
So when you‟re dealing with somebody that has a nodal 1, one of the things you
have to stress for them is the importance of the basic or the primary rooms in their
life. Remember, it‟s not about the house. It isn‟t. It‟s not controllable. Everybody
who has a house knows that you can lock the front door and the back door and the
side door and then there are
the ten windows. It goes on
and on and on; this is not a se-
cure environment. It isn‟t. For
the 1 it is a controlled space, a
space where they can control
entry and exit. A space that is
within their authority, so your
room, as an example, your
workplace, whatever it is, those
particular environments are
very important.
Now, there are extensions to
this. But I still want you to
keep in mind that because this
is primitive, it‟s like the 1st color internal people who ask about what kinds of foods,
not a question about their consecutive or alternating, not a question about one thing
at a time, but the question about what kinds of foods, obviously, anything can be
eaten one thing at a time in that sense. But because it is caveman and cavewoman
and it is primitive, my tendency is to look towards more basic things, fruits and nuts
and vegetables, very basic things, very, very simple food in that sense.
It‟s the same thing in understanding the 1st nodal color in understanding cave. The
cave can really be extended. That is, as I said, the automobile is the classic exam-
ple. Not just the automobile—truck drivers who spend 15 hours a day on the road
and these kinds of things. If I was running a truck business and I had this know-
ledge I would know precisely who would be the best drivers, the ones who really en-

PHS Nodal Color 1—Caves
joy being in that space, love it and not find it exhausting, but find it exhilarating. As
a matter of fact, it gives them a long, healthy life and they can work for me for 40
years. This is the rolling cave. And it‟s the rolling cave that has its control mechan-
isms. So you can move this outward, in that sense.
It‟s like that favorite section of that favorite restaurant of yours where you basically
have a line of sight that controls that kind of entry into it, that kind of thing, sort of.
But primarily, like with the food, I think it‟s more important to take it back to its ba-
sic roots. This is about security and well-being. It means that these environments,
the single opening environment, is an environment that is absolutely essential to
these beings for their well-being. This has to be something that‟s important. For
example, this is not somebody who can work in a communal office space, a factory
floor, all of these places where there are all these entries and exits and all of these
people, they can‟t do it. It‟s not for them.
And of course, the fact that people are conditioned and so forth and so on, they‟re in
transference and you don‟t get the cognition, you don‟t see correctly and you don‟t
end up being in the right place. Obviously, Strategy and Authority is a key in this
sense. Without it, you‟re not going to find yourself aligning to the environment that
is really correct for you.
Ok, so this is where we begin, in that sense. In other words, we begin with a basic
look at what is the environment itself and the specifics of it. After all, we are in the
hardscape and as such we are in what we could look at as enclosed environments in
a sense. That‟s very different from the upper nodal colors where we‟re dealing with
a much broader peripheral spectrum.
Here, dealing in the hardscape, like dealing in conditions in PHS internal we are deal-
ing with important specifics, so the cave for these beings, the room with one door, as
an example, this is the essential ingredient. If I‟m going to make a comment to
somebody about their external without turning that into a reading, as a by-product
of doing a larger PHS overview that includes external and internal, then that single
room environment is something that would be recommended to them. In other
words, this is something to pay attention to. These are places where you are going
to be at your best and you‟re most protected, and they‟re very important for you to
develop in your life so that you have these places.
Active and Passive in the Utilization of the Environment
Now, let‟s get to something that‟s the next level up in dealing with this. We have the
Left and the Right, obviously. And we have to deal with the way in which they oper-
ate so differently from each other. Obviously, when we‟re dealing within the context
of PHS we look at the Left and we think of it as active, and we look at the Right and
think of it as passive.
Now, in terms of internal, that active and passive has nothing to do with the physical
body, in a sense. It has to do with brain activity. It has to do with a high level of
activity and lower level of activity. It doesn‟t have to do with the outer body‟s activi-

23

Introduction to Systems Analysis
ty. However, when you‟re looking at the PHS in terms of the external and you‟re
looking at the difference between Left and Right you are very much looking at active
and passive in terms of the utilization of the environment.
The Selective: Active
Ok so let‟s see how that works. Let‟s begin with the theme selective. Remember
we‟re dealing about the other. We‟re dealing with the other. And it‟s very interest-
ing because we have in the PHS internal we have the consecutive and alternating.
And selective is an awful lot like consecutive. In other words, selective is that you
are selective about the other and only a certain other—you‟ll notice it‟s singular—is
allowed into your cave, invited, asked, informed, whatever the case may be, to your
cave; selective.
In other words, here is somebody that has—let‟s say you have a special room in your
house, that is, your place where you work, as an example, that people don‟t normal-
ly come into. This is your cave
where you spend a great deal
of your time. Not everybody is
allowed to walk into that room.
The only people that can walk
into that room are those that
have been selected to come in.
And it‟s very, very specific; one
at a time, in a sense.
So, it‟s something to grasp
about these people in their cave
in their social environment that
they are at their best in their
particular place dealing with
people one-on-one. And you‟ll
notice that it‟s selective which means there is a decision process that has to be
made. In other words, it‟s going to be the inner authority that is going to decide
whether or not that particular being, or whoever that is, that that being is going to
be allowed into the cave.
The moment that being is in the cave, that‟s the moment that the potential for the
relationship is enhanced. And this is the moment where, obviously, the person car-
rying the 1st nodal color is in an environment where they are secure, which means
they are more able to be aware of and connect to the other. They‟re also much
more efficient in the way in which they operate as a vehicle.
So, you see the cave has a number of levels of value. The environment is important
personally because they take advantage of the environment. When one is alone it‟s
still a great advantage. In other words, this is a healthy environment. It is a good
place to be. And at the same time it is a guideline for the way in which relationships
can be really seen for being positive or not. In other words, the wrong person will

PHS Nodal Color 1—Caves
never get into the right environment, which is quite something to think about. The
cognitive potential of this being in being selective will not select somebody who is not
correct for that environment. Outside of the environment it can make a terrible mis-
take, and does, regularly. So, outside of the environment it sees somebody as not-
self and by the time they bring them to their cave they discover how disappointed
they are and all they want to do is throw them out and lock the door and be alone.
So, they‟re selective.
So, these are beings that are at their best in important relationships. Remember,
important relationships can be so many things in life; conversations that are impor-
tant between friends and lovers and family and colleagues and on and on and on,
times when intimacy and all kinds of things. We‟re getting into an area in which
we‟re beginning to really see how we each have these unique places where we are
secure, where we can flower without looking over our shoulders. We all have these
places, and they„re so beneficial to us that literally they add to our basic creative
strength in life.
It also means that for these cave people more than one person at a time is not
good—one person at a time. Just like one food at a time; one person at a time. It
isn‟t to say they can‟t be with other people, but not in their cave. And when they‟re
not in their cave they have to be on guard, because the moment that you‟re not in
your environment is the moment you have to pay attention. You have to pay atten-
tion to the conditioning forces, you have to pay attention that your mind isn‟t run-
ning off and deciding to do something and you‟re blindly running along with it and
giving up the potential of your life.
Your Environment: A Place Where the Pressure is Off
It‟s the same old stuff. The moment that you‟re away from your environment is the
moment you have to be on alert. It‟s why the environment is so beneficial. When
you‟re on alert you‟re dealing with resistance all the time, you‟re dealing with the
conditioning field around you. It takes energy and consciousness to be able to deal
with that successfully. Yet, the moment that you step into your environment is the
moment that the pressure is off.
It‟s like going into this cave—oh, boy how nice. You light the fire in front of the cave
door and you don‟t have to worry about any beast coming through. You can sit in
there in your security, be content. You can dream, you can speak, you can create,
whatever; the magic of it for these people. We‟re all different, after all. We all have
the environment that is intended to either nurture us, or given that we do not live it
that it will take from us.
It‟s very damaging not to live in the environment that is correct for you. It‟s a long-
term process. But in the end it is something that has cut huge swaths of potential
out of your life, because so much has to be given to dealing with the world. In your
nodal environment, the pressure is off. It‟s just off. It‟s why often these beings
have trouble getting out of their bubble, because it‟s so protective and it can be so
soothing. And they go on and on and on because that‟s the potential of it.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
But yet in the end there‟s nothing one can do. The nodes are here because there are
always going to be others. And we must deal with them. And if the vehicle is going
to fulfill its perfection, it is going to be a master of the environment. It‟s going to
know what position to take where in order to benefit from this life; that‟s the whole
point.
So, here we have the active. Remember, we‟re on the Left and we‟re dealing with
active and this selectivity, this is active. This is action, actually selecting. See, the
passive is very different. Let‟s go back and have a primitive movie. We have the
cave and sitting at the entrance of the cave is our 1st nodal being and they‟re selec-
tive. They‟re sitting there at the entrance and some character comes by and says,
“Can I come in?” And let‟s say it‟s a Generator, it goes, “Uh-uh, not you,” again, un-
derstanding the selectivity of that.
The Blending: Passive
But the moment you go over to the Right you have a totally different phenomenon.
The whole potential of the Right is determined by the presence of the other. Re-
member, the Right has no
agenda. When the Left finds
out that it has to be selective in
its cave, it works on it, it‟s an
agenda—this is where I can be
successful, this is where I can
be safe—this is what it is.
When you‟re dealing with the
Right it isn‟t about this at all.
After all, they don‟t have an
agenda, it‟s passive. This is
the being that sits at the cave
door and people show up and
just go in. But it‟s their cave,
but they just show up and go
in. They‟re very different. And they are not like the Left in that they‟re afraid of
who they‟re letting in, because if you‟re the Left you‟re afraid—should I let them in,
should I really let them in; and if I do let them in, is it going to cost me something,
all that stuff, always. The Left is already strategically working on it, this selective.
And the power that comes with that, the 1 theme of authority—not you, not you, not
you; ah, you, you can come into my cave.
But on the Right side, oh no; the Right side looks at them as they‟re entering into
the cave and says, huh, you think you should be here, they just watch them come in
because it‟s what they‟re here for. The Right cannot control who comes in because
they don‟t know what to select for, no agenda. They don‟t. The value of the envi-
ronment only reveals itself through those who come into the environment. And they
passively allow them in. They have an open door policy, but it‟s their door. Don‟t

PHS Nodal Color 1—Caves
ever think that they can‟t throw those people out, they can. It‟s their door. But
they‟re not selective. They let them come in.
Now when I say that they let them come in, this is a matter of Strategy and Authori-
ty; it‟s just not a selection in which they are selecting one out of a number. It is
simply, ok, this one, all right. There may be those that are refused. They‟re not
going to let everyone in. But it‟s so important for them. You see, the richness of the
potential of this environment is that when they are passively receiving others in their
cave, it‟s the other that stimulates them and brings out their potential, whatever that
happens to be, and that those beings being in the cave with them, they are secure.
They‟re secure in that situation. And at the same time they benefit from the possi-
bility of different kinds of stimulation, all of which benefits them.
Very Specific Social Dynamics
It‟s like thinking about cave people as university students. On the left side you have
people that maybe can roommate with somebody, very selective, maybe. And on
the other side, you have that person that will live in the communal house with nine
or ten crazy people, or whatever. It‟s very different, but they need their cave. It‟s
the same cave; the blending one that controls the door to a place that a lot of people
use. And the selective one controlling the door to a place that maybe one person at
a time can gain access to.
So what we begin to see is that there is a very specific social dynamic that is inhe-
rent in the way in which our design nodes operate. It‟s obvious. It‟s beginning to
show you something also about the nature, holistically speaking, when you look at
the BodyGraph as a whole, the kind of connective being you are. And you have to
see that we‟re privileged to a lot of knowledge on many layers. When you think of
somebody as a cave person, you also have to think about the variations. If you
think about profile you would think, well, 2/4, 6/2 that would sort of work, wouldn‟t
it? You have to see that in terms of type how different the nuance will be between
the cave Manifestor and the cave Projector, as an example, the way they‟ll be differ-
ent in being selective and blending; one informing and one having to be invited, and
so forth and so on.
Correct Environments: Health and Power
In order for you to see how all of this moves to the surface and by the time it gets
integrated in the surface, what you‟re dealing with is your social framework. And
what its saying is, this is the social framework that is healthy for you. It‟s just that
simple. This is the social framework that is healthy for you; period. It doesn‟t mean
you have to be obsessed with it, because after all this is not about deciding to be ob-
sessed with it, if you know what I mean. It‟s about seeing that this is the natural
direction if you‟re correct.
By being aware of it—after all, you‟re the first generation of students that have
access to this—you can begin to see that value in the way in which it has been a part

Introduction to Systems Analysis
of your own process. It‟s there within, after all. And to begin to understand that this
is a way, as a benchmark, as a signpost, to begin to recognize whether or not in the
way in which you‟re relating to others that you‟re doing so in a way that is healthy
for you, efficient for you and non-taxing.
This goes directly to your nodal color. So, for these cave beings, the cave is really
something. It is a mainstay of their life, and they may have many of them, those
different rooms, those environments that they control that they can be selective,
that they can be blending, whatever the case may be. And when they‟re operating
correctly this is what is going to be natural for them. And the more comfortable they
become with their nodal environment, the healthier they become. In essence the
more powerful they become because of the amount of energy resources they save by
not being in resistance-oriented environments.
The Relationship between Tone and Color
When we look to tone, the relationship between tone and color on the design side is
really profound. There are a number of great wonders in the knowledge. For me,
the difference between color and tone on the design and personality side is simply an
indication that the design crystal and the personality crystal, though generically simi-
lar, are different to each other. That to see this bond between color and tone on the
design side is to really understand the essence of what I mean when I say that the
body is the life.
There is this pure fixing; it‟s fixed. There‟s no question about what kind of cave for
you. If you‟re a 1 then it‟s fixed and it‟s fixed by your tone. And obviously in being
fixed by the tone there are other things to consider in all of that, and we know. The
fact is that if we are looking at the Left and we are looking at the selective then we
see obviously that the environment has to smell right, the beings have to smell right.
If you‟re looking at the 2, this is usually the need to be able to share taste with the
other in one way or another, and there are many ways to go with that, and I won‟t
get into it right now, but I will at some point.
The outer vision, the 3—you have to see that not simply is the environment a key in
terms of positioning, but again recognizing the significance that the positioning car-
ries with it a sensory cognitive capacity and that there are certain things that need to
be paid attention to. And again, this has to do with both the way in which the envi-
ronment operates in terms of various qualities, the conditions or circumstances of
the environment, the nature of one‟s sensory perception of the other; all of this is at
work.
There are a lot of different kinds of cave people. And not just simply the going
downwards, the color to the various tones; that there are obviously the six possibili-
ties of the cave beings. Obviously, there‟s much more than that because if you go
into the other direction you get into all of the variations of line and gate. There are
so many of these beings. And it‟s something to see that this is the underlying prin-
ciple. This is a common ground.

Lecture Two
PHS Nodal Color 1—Caves
I‟m very excited about the global survey, and not what you see right now in the Jam
Player, but what we‟re working on. We‟re working on very complex PHS and Rave
Psychology software programming. Along with that the ability to use that survey da-
tabase, which is getting close to a quarter of a million samples, to begin to see per-
centages and breakdowns at a much deeper level.
Relationships are Conditioned by the Environment
For example, to begin to understand the relationship between what it is to be a cave
person. Think about the cave person. We know that the cave person has a 1st color
design. That is, 1st color design node. This is something that we‟re going to see
crossing a spectrum of different kinds of profiles, crosses, all kinds of things. In oth-
er words, one of the great underlying factors ultimately in our ability—by the time we
get through this entire process, to really begin to understand the dynamics of the
maia in the way in which the maia conditions or shapes relationships.
In other words, to begin to see we all have a very, very specific frame in which the
ideal relationships, and ideal not being a fantasy, but ideal being simply correct, that
correct relationships are something that are available to all of us and that the rela-
tionships themselves are conditioned by the environment.
It‟s like my earliest teachings to the open G center people, that if you‟re in the right
place you‟re with the right people, and if you‟re in the wrong place you‟re with the
wrong people; it could be the same people. The person you meet in the wrong place
is going to be wrong for you. But that very same person can meet you in the right
place and they can be right for you. I mean, it‟s simply something to understand
about being a cave person. If it isn‟t happening in the cave, it isn‟t happening. Be-
cause if it‟s not happening in the cave, then it‟s chaos, because it no longer just is
correct for you; period.
PHS is a remarkable thing. It‟s not simply the fantastic of what the internal has
demonstrated, what we can see in that, the advantages of a proper dietary regimen
and all of that. But to also understand that when I say that the vehicle is the life,
you have to see the life and it is here. When I say the vehicle is going to give you
your life, it‟s here. How you are going to appreciate that, how you are going to deal
with that in terms of your brain system, we know all that‟s another story. But this is
where your life unfolds. It unfolds in the physical world. It unfolds in these envi-
ronments and these environments are essential allies for us if we are going to be
correct in this life.
We All Have an Environment Where We’re Safe
These different places, how profound they are for us, how deeply important they are
for us, because they give us the same potential of authority within our cells to have
that same potential of authority in our relationship to the other. And there is some-
thing else, something really important. We all have an environment where we‟re
safe. Human beings are always concerned. They‟re always concerned about their

Introduction to Systems Analysis
survival in one way or another. And so many human beings dream of that ability to
be able to stand back and just find a place where truly they can just be at one with
just being. This is what this offers.
It‟s like those treasure maps that haunt all that old fiction, the search for the Grail,
the search for paradise, the search for the place. We each have one. This is our
magic. And of course, when you begin to see this within the context of the social
dynamic you begin to understand something that if you are a cave person you‟re
going to need a cave person in your life. There‟s really no other way to say that.
We‟re not of the time yet—I‟ve tried in relationship courses to explain to people the
ideal of a relationship is sameness. And yet, it is so difficult for us to accept same-
ness because of the genetic imperative. At this level sameness is something that is
just so damn obvious, isn‟t it? It just is.
Basically, what happens within this context is that those that enter into your envi-
ronment, whether it is active or passive, that ultimately those are the only ones that
really have a chance with you. They may not be correct in the sense that it may not
be their way. But at least you can recognize that they have a right to come in. It
just means that they don‟t have a right to just stay, because they don‟t, because un-
less you‟re a cave person you do not control the door. Cave people always control
the door.
Well, as I said, deconstruction of all of this is a fascinating exercise. Again, I caution
you to use this information sparingly, until at least we get to the end of the six colors
themselves so that you have a full sense of the way this works, particularly the shift
when we go from hardscape to landscape. I do enjoy, by the way, your emails and
your thoughts. They‟re really very intriguing and some excellent insights in all of
this. After all, it‟s a shared process for us, all the knowledge that we work with in
PHS.
But yes, if you‟re a 1st nodal color you have something to think about tonight. Any-
way, to all of you it‟s been a pleasure, as always, and do take care. And until next
time, bye for now.

Lecture Three
PHS Nodal Color 2: Markets
Ok, let‟s continue our journey into PHS nodal color. We have a nice juicy one today
that I‟m sure has led to all kinds of interesting speculations and postulations and
thoughts. Let‟s see what we can do about getting into the subject itself. I‟m going
to go right to the point here.
The 2nd Color
Let‟s begin for a moment with a sense of the 2nd color. What we know from the de-
sign side about the 2nd color is that it is obviously the most deeply discriminating,
and discrimination is a word that suits it so well. It is deeply discriminating. It is the
most discriminating digestive system. If you are 1st color, yes, it is one thing at a
time, but then again it can be a vast variety of things that are possible. The fact of
the matter is, if you are a 2nd color there is a tremendous limitation on what is ac-
tually good for you. Now, that‟s really a theme to keep in mind.
Nodal Color 2
So, when we‟re looking at the 2nd color as it applies to the nodes, and again we‟re
dealing with this very special understanding of the PHS nodes, that is, that what
we‟re talking about is environment and we‟re talking about environments that are
places in which resistance is diminished which is beneficial in terms of interaction and
it is a key, because after all the nodes are all about, in that sense, the demands of
having to deal with the other in the life. And at the same time, that environmental
enhancement is something that leads to the potential increase in the longevity of the
vehicle itself.
In other words, the moment that you can find yourself, because that is the right
terminology, in what is your natural nodal environment, it‟s not something that you
point yourself at. Again, this is a mind thing. We‟re not dealing with mind here;
we‟re not dealing with the personality. What we‟re dealing with is the more and
more correct you become the more natural it is for you to gravitate towards those
environments that are correct for you. The advantage of the knowledge is that like
all logical things, and this is the bedrock of Human Design, it sinks in at a deep level
into the consciousness and becomes an aid in recognition.
When we talk about the 2nd color we have to keep in mind this discrimination. Look
at the 2s. The 2s are very, very specific. And perhaps the strongest chain relation-

31
PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
ship is the relationship that runs in the resonance through the 2s. If you look at the
2nd tone, the 2nd tone is all about this ability to be able to stand on a pattern and
see if there is anything different that is going to emerge, this ability to be prepared
for changes in the maia.
When we look at the 2nd color it is deeply discriminatory. It‟s really saying only cer-
tain things can nourish me. Now, that‟s very important. That‟s the only color that
says that. No other color has that level of discrimination that says there are foods
that are not for me. Now, you can say that ice cream can never be for hot people,
but you can make it hot. It‟s really something to grasp about the 2nd color, how dis-
criminatory that is, which means how conditioned these people are in the not-self,
and how sensitive their digestive system is. And their digestive system needs that
consistent menu, that pattern. Go back to the resonance and the tone underneath.
In the tone underneath having a very secure pattern is the only way to be able to
focus one‟s attention outward. The pattern must be secure.
It is the same thing here in the context of the 2nd color. This dietary regimen of the
repetition of the menu is in order to establish that fixed, reliable pattern so that the
gift of the color can emerge. It‟s gift; because again it has this ability to be able to
sense what nobody else can sense, sense it first, sense these minute changes and
ripples in the fabric of the maia.
It‟s very interesting when you see people that have the 2-2, the power of this partic-
ular resonance nodally, because nodally it is really remarkable. And of course, when
you take that to the 2nd line, to complete that view of the chain, the 2nd line are her-

PHS Nodal Color 2—Markets
mits. And what are hermits? Hermits lock themselves into the fixed pattern and re-
liability of whatever their hermit‟s place is so that they can recognize the call when it
comes, the thing that will change the maia. And in recognizing the call in the classic
2/4 configuration, the missionary that rises up and goes out and externalizes and
influences everybody with the information.
So there is something different in the 2nd color. It is much more rigid, it is much
more demanding, and it is much more sensitive because there is so much that it
doesn‟t want to bother with so it can have its fixed, reliable pattern. Now, let‟s think
about it in terms of our nodal environments. We saw last week “caves,” and we saw
that fundamentally this is a protective, sheltering environment. But of course, what
is that quaint expression? The world is a business. The world has always been a
business.
Markets: The First Step Out into the Social Domain
Of course, this is, in essence, what markets refer to. You need to understand that
these keynotes always have to be deconstructed. In a sense, the market is an evo-
lution in the development of human social contact. Because remember as we‟re
moving through the 1st to the 6th color in this nodal perspective, we‟re looking at the
evolution of social interaction. We know that the cave was very limited. We know,
for example, that the cave was immediate family, close, closed tribe.
But the market, in the market is where one clan meets another, where one tribe
meets another, where one representative of one clan, one tribe, whatever—I have
mastodon tusks, and you have whatever. But the thing to recognize is that markets
represent this first step out into the social domain and it is a social domain that is
rooted in enterprise, business, the commercial, the material, any way you want to
describe that.
The Healthiest Environment is the Business Environment
In other words, these are beings whose natural environment, their healthiest envi-
ronment is their business environment. So, it‟s these people, for example, who feel
wonderful when they finally get out of their house and go to work. Or these people
who feel fantastic when they can finally run their business from their home where
suddenly things are so much easier. These markets—what they really represent is a
social methodology. In the cave, you don‟t get to meet new people unless they‟re
born. I mean, the cave is very isolated and closed off socially. It tells you a lot about
cave people. Cave people aren‟t going to have these vast numbers of different kinds
of people walking through their caves, they won‟t. It‟ll be the modern variation of
what kith and kin is, the clan or the tribe or whatever, but it is going to be limited.
But market people are very different because these are the people that their social
dimension emerges within the business frame. It‟s the waiter or waitress whose en-
tire social life is in their work, as an example. In other words, what we had in the
development of our societies, our cultures, is that it all began, basically, with the be-

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
ginning of two very important phenomena. That is, the control and husbandry of
creatures, of cows and sheep and goats and pigs and whatever, and of course agri-
culture. And when you put those two things together, there was no need, to begin
with, all of the males to be going out on hunting binges, because there were these
docile sheep that were in the pen.
The whole nature of how you get your share of the food became literally what you
were going to do in this life. And one of the things you get to see in the duality of
the 1st and 2nd, because it‟s a fascinating duality to look at, is that here in the cave
you have the family life and the family environment is the healthiest, and here in the
market the business environment, or the business social environment is the heal-
thiest.
In other words, you can see again this basic binary between the 1 and the 2. Again,
something that is so interesting is that it‟s the 2 that carries with it this resonance to
the potential that‟s in all 2s that not only are they equipped to be in the market, but
because it is an advantage to their aura in the sense that it diminishes the resistance
that is there and because of the
underlying theme of the 2, this
is the possibility of quite literal-
ly being able to take advantage
in those markets and take ad-
vantage in a positive way.
Because a little bit of know-
ledge is always a dangerous
thing, there is obviously a very,
very deep material meaning
here. I guess you can smell
that by now. It obviously says
very clearly that in terms of the
nodal design configuration,
which is one element of many, after all, that this is somebody that has an underlying
potential for the material plane as long as they‟re operating correctly, and they‟re
going to have a greater potential on the material plane than others, which is also in-
teresting.
But again, everybody has their thing. In the same way that the cave people are
going to have deeper relationships with their family, the market people are going to
have deeper relationships with their customers, or their clients or their patients, or
their “this and that,” whatever the case may be.
So when you‟re looking at this market, basically what you‟re looking at—again, re-
member the real key here in understanding the nodes from the design side is always
to see it within the context of its social value, it‟s about the other. We know that the
internal is about you, only you, about your brain system, your potential for percep-
tion, your potential for cognition, it‟s only about you, and it is only about eating the
way that is bringing out your uniqueness and all of that. But at the same time that
the Sun/Earth is bringing you the potential of your uniqueness, your nodes are say-

34
Lecture Three
PHS Nodal Color 2—Markets
ing, excuse me, but, Mr/Ms Unique, you have to live in the world with the idiots, the
not-selves, the freaks, the relatives, the employees, the colleagues, the this and
that.
And this is the thing to keep in mind about the nodes. If you‟re going to live totally
isolated, separate from the rest of the world, you don‟t have to pay attention to it,
because the nodes are about your relationship with the other and how to minimize in
this not-self world the dysfunction in the maia that the other brings into your life.
And whether you‟re correct or not, there is the weight and the pressure of the incor-
rectness around you.
Material Environment: Best Relationships with the Other
So, it‟s always within the social frame. So, within this social frame you need to see
that these beings who are 2nd color nodally that it is this material environment where
they can best have their relationships with the other. It means something. It says
they‟re going to struggle in their relationships with their family, because here is a
binary, here is a polarity. They‟re going to be much more comfortable in relation-
ships with those people that they work with, that they sell to, that they buy from,
anything having to do with the material interaction.
So their environments can be many things. And we see quite clearly here that we
have a distinction, an obvious distinction that maps the language of PHS itself. That
is, we see internal on one side, speaking Left, and external on the other side speak-
ing Right. You would think that should be reversed. You would think that the pas-
sive would be internal, that the active would be external. But they‟re not.
Fixed Left: Internal
Let‟s take a look at it. So, we know that market is where the social dynamic of this
individual is going to operate at its best. It means it‟s going to meet the least resis-
tance because it is an environment that is associated with materialism it means that
it can bring advantages to it materially. Not only that, but all of that is enhancing for
the longevity of that being, and let‟s say that they are fixed Left. If they are fixed
Left, they are fixed to the internal.
One of the things to see about this internal/external is that the internal is deeply re-
lated to the cave, deeply. In other words, when you‟re looking at the internal here,
this is the attempt, in a sense, to deal with the dilemma of not having the family re-
lationship, of bringing the business into the home. Now, in most cases you don‟t see
it as the business being brought into the home, you see the little family store where
the family lives upstairs and the business is downstairs or in the back room or whe-
rever the case may be. And in fact, the whole thing is, in a sense the home. This is
the internal.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
Fixed Right: External
And the external is literally external, out; out of the home, totally away from the
cave, the real extension of that. By the way, that external doesn‟t mean that it is
best for these beings to do business in outside markets, because in fact, if you keep
in mind what we‟re looking at here when we‟re dealing with the lower is that we‟re
dealing with the hardscape. We‟re dealing with a world of boxes.
Here in the context the internal box is simply bringing the business into the home
environment. Here the external is leaving the home environment and going out into
the world. By the way, being the business being in the internal environment leads to
it being observed and the being in the external environment goes out into the world
as the observer.
Markets—if you look at the 2, one of the things that you‟ll see is that if we‟re looking
at this as a social evolution that the first thing that came after survival was business.
It was the first thing that came. It is natural in human beings to trade. It is natural
in them. And it‟s important because I had that earlier in today‟s class with the first
year class when I was talking about the 2nd tone, Left fixings of the 2nd tone. And
talking about its remarkable gift in terms of, as a cognition, how it is the bedrock
upon which humanity as a species is able to handle changes in the maia.
Markets: Change What is Marketable in the Maia
One of the things to understand
about this nodal environment
of market people is that these
are the ones that change what
is marketable in the maia. We
all notice that, don‟t we—
trends, fads, things that
emerge, things that nobody
heard about and a year later
everybody has one—things like
that. It‟s also part of the ca-
pacity of this because it inherits
this quality of the 2. And of
course, it is this whole special-
ness of human competitiveness
that its material source is here. The world as a business is born here. The world
that we live in, the world in which each and every one of us has to find a way to re-
ceive energy for our efforts, otherwise, we cannot survive.
All of this is bred here; all of this is created here. It‟s quite something to see. When
you think about the daily program, think about the nodes in the daily program.
Think about them as they move very slowly, day by day. Understand as well that

they have a shifting color underneath, that we are imprinted and conditioned with
tonal cognition all the time. It‟s there in the natural world around us. It is the crys-
tals of consciousness processing the neutrino ocean. And it means built into the very
essence of our existence is the importance of this environment.
Of course, we see that we‟ve actually created these environments out of this imprint,
what somebody might call a mall, or what used to be the downtown, or what used to
be before that the market square, and on and on and on. In other words, these
places, these geometrical places where there is this collection of things that is avail-
able, literally creating these environments as an expression literally out of the mar-
ket.
In the 1 and the 2 you see the imperative in human beings to build shelters. If you
look at the deepest impact of the 1st color, the way in which it acts in humanity is
that human beings all demand shelter; all of them. This is what they want. This is
the only thing that‟s important for them, we have to have shelter, we have to have
houses, and everybody has to have a cave. And then you get to the 2nd tone people
and the 2nd tone people say, yes, yes, but we have to create market places and
businesses and jobs and all of those things so all of those houses can be maintained
and everybody inside of those houses can be fed, this is an incredible binary that
we‟re looking at.
Two Primary Healthy Environments
It‟s the basic establishment. Again, we‟re looking at evolutionary processes when
we‟re looking from the 1 to the 6. We‟re looking at the evolution of the two primary
healthy environments. Think about that. The primary healthy environment, it‟s
healthy for you to have your own home. We know that. But we know how dis-
tressed human beings are when they don‟t. We know how sad it is and how helpless
we feel for those that are homeless. It‟s a curse on their lives that they cannot have
a home, that they cannot provide, all that stuff.
It‟s ingrained in all of us. It‟s from here, because homes are safe. All cave people
know this. You can defend a door. It‟s safe. It‟s private. It‟s one of the basic
things that human beings demand in their environment. It‟s the first ingredient of
the hardscape. It created those architects sons of bitches that cut us off from the
sky—I‟m only kidding but nonetheless. That‟s why there are all these dwellings,
houses, flats.
And then you see the other place that‟s a good place to be, a healthy place to be—in
the market. When you consider that human beings have to spend most of their wak-
ing hours trying to get enough energy to survive, the market environment needs to
be a place that provides its own kind of security. It is a place where you work with
others and you work with strangers and you develop a relationship and a bond that
ultimately becomes the globalized world that we live in today in which you really
don‟t want to be outside of the global material matrix, and has brought more relative
peace than anything in our history.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
Here are two basic ingredients of the social dynamic. We each carry these things.
And we‟re each carrying receptors to them, and we have our transference to what-
ever is there. We‟re in touch with all of this. But like everything else in Design, like
the internal and the digestive system where you need to go back to the pattern or
the regimen of what it was in its evolutionary point, it‟s the same thing here.
Somebody who is carrying this 2nd color, this is not about the obvious that out of this
color has come all of these environments of business—shops and this and that and
factories and think tanks and office buildings, it goes on and on and on and on. They
are all part of the market world. Yet, for market beings it‟s very specific. We don‟t
know what‟s going to happen when it gets to the personality. So don‟t ever jump to
conclusions.
Shift in Family Relationships
Not only does this being have to operate correctly according to their Strategy and
Authority, but they‟re going to have to have a disengaged personality that is going to
be capable of sitting back and watching the movie. It‟s not such an easy thing. But
there is magic in this one. When one can be aligned to the environment that‟s cor-
rect, obviously these beings, though they have a certain disadvantage in the way in
which they operate relative to family—this is a big shift here in the sociology.
When we‟re looking at that 1st color and we‟re looking at the cave, this is just blood.
And in order for us to develop socially we had to go beyond that, waiting for the call.
And of course, in going beyond that you bring in strange elements, new elements.
You begin to change the way in which human beings look at each other. And the
bonds that are established in the market place are bonds that are powerful. They
create what appear to be almost friendships.
You know the local store that you‟ve been going to for a couple of years, when you
think about your relationship with the people there—I‟ve had this for many, many
years here in Ibiza. There are families that I have been a customer of for nearly 25
years. This is how the whole ability of humanity to ultimately become a collective
grows.
I don‟t want you to just under-
stand these environments as per-
sonal things that you need to focus
on. I really want you to see the
larger context of this so that you
understand literally the world we
live in. We‟re looking at the basic
construct now. We do until we get
to the landscape, when we get to
the landscape we begin to change.
But in this lower color, as we saw
in the internal, we are dealing with
very, very specific things. And to

PHS Nodal Color 2—Markets
see them not as handicaps, but to understand this is the bedrock of the environment
on this planet that nurtures the ability of human beings to come together. It‟s what
the market place is for.
We see the market place where the person, the individual, has an advantage in ei-
ther of being able to buy well or sell well. But in fact, in terms of the program, the
market place is a place to create extended social connection which enhances the po-
tential of the gene pool, because there you meet the tall dark stranger who comes
from the other valley, those kinds of stories.
Oh, it‟s wonderful to be able to see the evolution of the framework of how we con-
nect to each other, where it‟s beneficial to connect to each other. And to recognize
that these two basic places, the home and the office, the home and the business,
whatever that may be, to really grasp that this is the foundation of environment on
the planet. This is it. It‟s really something to see. This is it. You‟ll see that the rest
of it, there are different things that emerge in that. It‟s not the foundation anymore.
It‟s like understanding that the 1-2, in that sense, like all 1-2s relate to the founda-
tion, relate to the basic that is there.
The Internal
Let‟s think about the internal for a moment. You can really see that this is a spiral-
ing progression. There is a great deal of uncertainty that is part of the resonance of
the 2nd color to the 2nd tone, as an example. This going out to do business, there is
a reticence here—again, the resonance to the hermit—there is a reticence here to go
out. It‟s better to put up a sign and have them come to you.
This is the thing that‟s so interesting about the internal. In other words, the internal,
in a sense, turns the cave into a business by putting a sign up. What it does in
putting that sign up is that like all of these small ma and pa businesses that we‟re
familiar with in the West, that eventually they end up in a situation where their tee-
nage son or daughter is not exactly the ideal employee and eventually is seen to be
a bit of a handicap so they end up hiring some part time person who happens to be
from another tribe. It begins that same process.
And of course, the customers that come, in most of these situations there‟s a real
barrier between what is the home and what is the business. In most cases the home
is in the back or the home is above, and the business has what appears to be a busi-
ness front. Now, obviously in more primitive times it looked differently. But you
know what I‟m saying.
In other words, this is the potter, just to take an example, that works at home and
puts the pots outside of their house so that passersby in the village can see them,
and the passerby comes in and says, are you trading these pots. And they say, yes,
we‟re trading for this or that, or whatever the case may be. In other words, this is
about drawing people to what is a basically safe environment, yet, at the same time
being daring enough to be open to whoever comes. Again, this theme that goes
back to the 2nd tone of being ready for changes in the maia—that person who comes

and says I love your pot so much I want to take them to the next valley, make me
50. This kind of thing, what happens in those situations.
But here special bonds are also created. Remember there is less resistance for the
2nd tone being in their environment. If they‟re Left fixed, this business out of the
home is a natural thing. But again, remember my warning. The mind, the perso-
nality, the personality has to be able to act on what the vehicle provides. It has to
be able to see it. It has to be able to stand back and not interfere. It‟s not about
you tell somebody this, and please don‟t, and they decide, well, I‟m going to move
my business to my house. Oh, my god. It‟s not about that. It really isn‟t.
It‟s about seeing that everything in this process of aligning the holistic being is in so
many ways connected to what is the majority truth on the planet, Solar Plexus truth,
which is no truth in the now. It all takes time. And you need to have the courage
and the spirit to watch yourself align to what is correct for you, not to lead yourself
to it.
We all have an inner authority, that is, the vast majority of us, we all have the ability
to align to what is correct for us, and we will. But it can never be a decision of the
mind. And here it becomes very risky in the way in which you share information.
Again, I do get feedback and sometimes I get really concerned because there are a
lot of people who are getting information from these high-level classes who do not
deserve to be getting that information at this point in their education. And it‟s lead-
ing to problems in terms of interpretation.
I‟d like to encourage all of you to really be very careful about the way in which you
share this knowledge and particularly in this area now. Again, we‟re not even
through the main bulk of this, so it‟s very important to keep that in mind. A little
knowledge really is something that can be very distorting for people. Someone who
thinks that because they have a 2nd color and they‟re Left fixed that they can decide
to do something about that; this is not-self at work and boy is that going to be a dis-
aster for them. Even though, ultimately, that is an environment that should be
healthy for them. But under that kind of imperative, with that kind of not-self moti-
vation it is only going to create problems and they‟re going to meet a lot of resis-
tance.
Remember something about the nature of disease and dysfunction in a human being.
Most people think it‟s where you‟re open. It‟s not. It‟s where you‟re defined. I can‟t
even count anymore on my hands the number of people I know with defined Throats,
particularly 20/34‟s, who have had their thyroids removed in their life. The great
dysfunction ends up being precisely where you are because it‟s entirely operating
incorrectly. So recognize something about this information about environments.
This is what you will naturally move towards, because it‟s correct for you. And you
simply need to watch that process, be aware of it, see it, see it as it happens, recog-
nize it if it‟s there. But it‟s not about doing anything about it.

The External
The external, as you can see, is something that fundamentally is really the way in
which our whole material world has been built. And there is a real dilemma that
comes with this kind of envi-
ronment, the dilemma is that
the being has a much closer
connection socially to the
people that they work with than
to their own families, whether it
is their biological families, or
whether it‟s the families they
create with a partner.
It‟s something that we see over
and over and over again in rela-
tionships in every part of the
world, particularly amongst
males because it so happens to
be the prevailing archetype,
this in essence having their whole social life geared to wherever it is they do busi-
ness and having problems in their home life and having a lot of jealously and compe-
titiveness, and so forth and so on.
These are people that end up with falling in love with bosses or employees or col-
leagues. They say the level of affairs that takes place in the corporate world in the
standard office building with thousands and thousands of people is enormous and a
lot of that is rooted here. And it is rooted in that external because there is a dilem-
ma with the depth of the connection to the family.
You can see this moving out the cave is a movement that is sort of gradual. First
it‟s, well, the cave in the back and the business in the front. But it‟s still connected
to the family. There is this opening up; and of course, the meeting of the others that
are coming to the cave.
But the moment you move into the external you really move into this shift; it‟s a real
shift. So you end up with people who have a dominance of relationships that are
rooted in the business life. Now, obviously this can be very helpful for somebody
who is young, because in essence it points to the right direction for them—marry
somebody who they‟re going to have as a business partner. Somebody who is going
to work with them, whatever the case may be.
This is somebody that needs to see that their outside work life is where they‟re going
to have their profoundest relationships. So, one way of dealing with that is to have a
partner that is part of that world. Of course, in most cases we‟re not going to be
able to dispense that information, we‟re dealing with adults who are deeply condi-

Introduction to Systems Analysis
tioned and not necessarily involved in truly living out their strategy. And of course,
there are all kinds of problems that come with that.
A Social Consequence
So we have two very different things here, but they bring with it a social conse-
quence. It‟s the same thing with the cave people. There is a social consequence of
not wanting to mingle with the outsiders, this is social consequence. Social conse-
quence is that it can be much more difficult for these beings to make a living. It just
can.
Again, and I‟m speaking of that within the context of the way the not-self operates,
to begin to see these things in the social dynamic. It‟s the most important thing that
we‟re looking at here. No one in the history of sociology has ever been able to see
the evolution of the environmental patterns that transform the way in which human
beings relate to others. It‟s very, very special. I want you to just have a sense of
that.
So, your view here has to be as much sociological in perspective as it is in terms of
the personal. In terms of the personal it‟s not very complex. It‟s always that case
with Design that you have simple surfaces. In terms of the personal you look at this
and you see somebody who has markets and they have internal and you know what
you can say to them. You know that environments in which it is going to be healthy
for them, environments where they‟re going to meet the least resistance are envi-
ronments where they combine their living space and their working life; a combina-
tion of working space and business life in which their material life brings interaction.
That‟s it.
We have a lot of that now. In many ways the 2nd tone internal is becoming a very
powerful force. I live an example of it, in the sense that I live and work at home.
This is something that‟s there in the program. I happen to be upper color nodally,
I‟m a 6th color shore, so it isn‟t significant for me and it‟s not a conditioning factor in
the general sense of the word. But it‟s just interesting to note, again, that the 1st
and 2nd colors bring these very basic constructs to the way in which we operate and
particularly the way in which we operate or not on the material plane.
Again, with the external it‟s the same basic presentation. In other words, you have
an advantage. Here you can say you have to see that your family, in a sense, is al-
ways going to be secondary in terms of the quality of your relationships to your
business associations. And not to be guilty about that, because the fact of the mat-
ter is by developing those deep relationships in the outside world, you‟re enhancing
not only your material potential, but you‟re enhancing your own longevity.
Obviously, it says something about the relationship that they‟re going to have with
family. But remember, again we‟re only seeing an aspect of a holistic view. We‟re
seeing, in essence, one quarter of what the picture is. We‟re not looking at the de-
sign internal, we‟re not looking at the personality internal, and we‟re not looking at

PHS Nodal Color 2—Markets
the personality external. We have four fundamental elements that ultimately syn-
thesize as a holistic being.
The Body’s Relationship to the Maia
So obviously this is a significant element that is there. And again, it‟s something to
think about in terms of the body and the body‟s relationship to the maia. In other
words, for the cave people this enclosed environment is something that is so healthy
for their physical body. These
are the kind of people that
should never go outside if they
don‟t feel right. Stay inside,
stay within the shelter, stay
within the closed environment
because this is where there is
the least resistance, this is
where you can be the heal-
thiest.
You know that when you‟re
dealing with market beings, the
external beings particularly,
you know that for their bodies
they need to go out, they need those other specific hardscape environments. And by
the way, they end up going into cave like things, but they go in and they come out,
just like the internal that has a cave that has a door that is open to the outside and
allows them to come in.
The vehicle is comfortable in these environments. It‟s interesting to note, by the
way, because obviously we‟re going to look at that next week, is that when you get
to the 3rd color you really get to something that is, in a sense, very, very limited.
These are highly specialized social interactions. The same thing is true for the 4, by
the way.
The 1 and 2: The Most Important Environments in the World
I want you to see that there is a real difference here, this foundation, this 1-2, is our
world. It‟s the two most important environments in the world. It is the very basis of
the quality of life. It is the very basis of our social interactions and it is all here in
these first two nodal colors. You all know that I hadn‟t even planned originally that I
was going to begin to teach that this semester. I was going to start first semester
next year. I made the decision to do this because I think it‟s very important for you
for what I‟ve planned for next year to have all the tools that you‟re going to need.
But in approaching it—this is so huge, because I see it in another dimension. For
me, the nodal PHS is as revolutionary to the understanding of social humanity and
the social evolution of humanity as the internal is to understanding differentiated

Introduction to Systems Analysis
brain function. In other words, it is in a sense its own really extraordinary revolution
in understanding the way in which we are designed as beings, as a species, the way
we were designed to interact and to understand that we are designed to interact
within environments, specific environments. In other words, the way in which true
relationships, deep relationships are intended to function, the way in which we
evolve to deal with the other goes step-by-step through these very, very basic envi-
ronments.
Your home, you can see how important it is, home. And think about the way in
which this flows in the genetic continuity of all things. You‟re going to have 1st colors
in your design, they‟re going to be in different places, and you may have it nodally.
But it‟s something to understand that for all of us there is a special connection to this
concept. And it is a special connection because it is a physical thing for us, an es-
sential physical ingredient. There are very few human beings who can truly live
without one.
And then you get to understand that we were designed to develop strong relation-
ships with our blood, our kin. That‟s the beginning. And then the next step was to
develop strong relationships with those that you could work with. This is the story.
And the methodology for both: to develop a relationship with your family, lock them
all into a house, and to develop a relationship with the other, create a material cir-
cumstance that forces them to work with and ultimately respect and appreciate each
other. Ah, it‟s beautiful. It‟s just beautiful.
Then you see all those basic relationships that all human beings have. We all have
this love/hate, close or not relationships with our families. We all have that. They‟re
the ones that know us the best in a sense. We‟re the ones that know them so well.
We all have these things we can say about our children, our parents, whatever, this
knowing that comes from the cave. Then there are these relationships that we have
developed outside of the cave, and relationships that have arisen out of our pathway
through the material world beginning with school. These are our bonds.
As we move upwards we‟re going to see that these basic bonds, the foundation of
society in civilization, that there is a progression that takes place, that there is a
transition and an evolution in this process until we finally get to the 6 and we see
what it looks like at the end of this particular cycle of evolution.
The 1-2 Environments are Very Rigid
So whenever you‟re looking at the 1-2 environments remember that you‟re looking
at something that is very rigid, in the same way that you look at the internal 1-2, the
rigid 1-2, the caveman/cavewoman diet and the very, very rigid repetitive menu of
the 2, you have to see that this is just as rigid and primitive in its own way.
So it‟s going to be very, very important for people in that sense to align themselves
through their process to these environments that are healthy for them. And for us to
be able to prepare them for what that brings to them, because there are conse-
quences obviously. It‟s not like they‟re children and they‟re naturally going to be

raised in a way in which they‟re going to be aligned correctly to what is the right
nodal perspective for them.
Naturally Moving to the Environment that is Correct
The not-self is such a mess. It‟s why we always need to go back to the basics and
make sure that people are really following that strategy so they can get the advan-
tage of the cognition and begin to align on the nodal plane. Because in the end it‟s a
beautiful thing, just as it is to know what it is to live by your authority, it is a beauti-
ful thing to see that your vehicle, because it‟s a signpost that you all need to watch,
that your vehicle, when it‟s correct, will naturally move to the environment that is
correct for it. You just will.
That‟s the magic. And then it‟s
what the personality will do.
Will the personality be able to
take advantage of it? Will the
personality be able to take ad-
vantage of the potential of the
relationships with the other, all
of those things, because, of
course, the great dilemma is
the personality. And remember
that the moment that the not-
self steps into this game we
lose the cognition, it‟s all gone,
you can forget about it. We just do. And these people are off in the wrong place,
they just are. And they get exactly what they deserve because this becomes the ob-
verse. You go into the wrong place; the not-self leads you to the wrong place so
that you can have that perfect wrong place not-self slap. That‟s what you get.
Speculate on What is Kitchens
Anyway, markets, it‟s quite something to think about. Please begin to speculate
yourselves, because you‟ll have more fun next week, what the hell is kitchens. Re-
member that one of the guides for you is to understand what happens when you
move from the 1st binary to the 2nd binary in the internal. But it‟s interesting to spe-
culate on this one; you‟ll see.
But keep in mind what we‟re looking at is this transition that takes place in the way
in which we socialize, the way in which we interact with the other. And that the 3 is
going to have a very interesting dynamic. Ok, folks, a pleasure, as always. You take
care and until next week, if you‟re a 2, enjoy your market; bye for now.

PHS Nodal Color 3: Kitchens
The Development of the PHS Imaging Program
Before we get into our wonderful story for tonight, our kitchen story, and of course I
have set you up so I‟m sure you‟re curious about what kitchens is all about. I do
have something I want to show you first. What you‟re looking at is the beginning of
sketching out what Asi Farran and I are working on in terms of developing holistic
imaging that will provide a kind of complete guideline to somebody‟s design right
there on the surface so that you can see very easily all of the dimensions that are
there in terms of the personality, the design, everything down to the base level.
So, it‟s something that is very interesting to begin to put together because I appre-
ciate very much the dedication—we were talking about numbers before, this is the
59th lecture in this program. I want you to see what you‟re moving towards. What
we‟re moving towards is a very deep holistic approach to seeing the being, and being
able to see the being in levels of keynoting that are obviously very significant. In
other words, once you‟ve had the training and you really understand the terminolo-
gies as it were, there is a great deal of information that is available.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
And there are many things that we are going to explore. And it‟s going to be part of
the exploration that particularly is going to take place in year three. For example,
the simple fact that I am a strategic active, or an active strategic, what does this
mean? There are four different varieties. And in these four different variations what
we‟ve already seen particularly in the numerical layout that Andrea Wolf provided
me, you immediately get to see that there are very specific chain combinations that
only exist with certain variations. You can be strategic active, you can be strategic
passive, you can be active receptive, you can be passive receptive. You have all of
these four different basic variations that are there just on the surface that have yet
to be integrated in that sense, what is the difference?
For example, I am somebody who in terms of the tonal infrastructure is Left/Left.
And I am Left/Left in relationship to what is in fact the Sun/Earth configuration. You
can see here in the nodal configuration I am Right/Left. But you can also see that I
am double Left on the body side. Again, I‟m only pointing things out in this way to
understand that there are levels and levels and levels of analytical potential that are
here in just the basic configurations as they emerge. Let alone the understanding of
what does it mean that these two bases happen to be the same on the design side
and all the various things that come with that.
So, the work that we‟re involved with and not just you, obviously, the students that
are involved in Rave Psychology that as we go along these two tracks there is a ho-
listic future, in that sense, that is going to emerge. And one of the things that we‟re
working on is that basically we‟re going to have three levels of this programming so
that there is a specific related level, and obviously within the context of the PHS for
example automatically the chains of the PHS will be available in edited form. In oth-
er words, you can open up a window and read a description of the chain. There will
be all kinds of additional information that will be there, so when you‟re looking at a
client in the context of the PHS you‟re going to have all the basic information, it just
simply will there in front of you. It will make it a lot easier.
I‟m also working on something that I want to be able to create a display chart that is
different from the computer-generated view [image below]. In other words, a spe-
cialized display chart, something like this but more complex, that actually carries all
the information you need so that you have it on one piece of paper, and you have
the ability to really be able to case file—that‟s the other thing that‟s going to be one
of the more interesting things about the PHS imaging program is that there is going
to be a place where there is a kind of form and basically it‟s a form that you can fill
in digitally. It‟s a case file form that carries no name. It just carries birth data and it
carries circumstantial information.
For example, whether it is a male or a female, whether they have blue eyes or brown
eyes, whether they are fair or dark, large boned or small boned, things like that. So
that we can actually build up a reference library relative to individual‟s PHS and be-
gin to see correlations and anomalies and all the things you get when you build a
proper database.

So the PHS programming that we are working on is very exciting. I‟m hoping that
we‟re going to be able to have a platform level program that will be there perhaps at
the beginning of the third year. My goal, obviously, is that at the end of the third
year we will have a fully functional PHS program. But I think that we will be able to
have some working versions beforehand so that we can get your feedback.
It was very interesting, for example, when we developed the BG5 program, the busi-
ness programming, that students were given the beta to experiment with and to of-
fer suggestions and this is a very productive thing. I think it‟s very important that all
of you recognize that your contribution to the development of the programming is
something that will be very much appreciated. You‟re the ones that are going to
have to use it. I try my best to be able to see what I would like as an information
panel so that I don‟t have to go switching around or clicking on to things to find
something else, that I have a synthesis in front of me that gives me all the keys that
I need to be able to go into any kind of analysis.
By the way, those are sketches. It is not in any way a guarantee that that‟s the way
ultimately it‟s going to look. But it‟s to give you an idea of the levels of information
and I thought you have a chance to take a look at my holistic design.
The Transition from the Seven to the Nine-Centered Being: Heat
Anyway, let‟s get to today‟s story. Let‟s move right along so we can get right down
to the meat of all this. Oh, I‟m sure that if you ponder it you thought about a lot of
things and most of the time in a sense you ended up in the kitchen somewhere. This
is one of those places that is really very, very interesting for me. It‟s very special.
It‟s something that I‟ve tried to explain about the transition. I mentioned it earlier
today, funny enough, the transition between the seven-centered being and the nine-
centered being.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
The transition between the seven-centered and the nine-centered being, if we were
to look at something at the mundane level that would be a major contributing factor
to that is that it would be heat. I‟ve said it many, many times through all the years
that I have been teaching that if you measured somebody who was a seven-centered
being in terms of their body temperature and a nine-centered being that the nine-
centered being is going to be a warmer being. They‟re just warmer.
And the heat is something that is absolutely essential. It is the domesticating of fire
and the ability to break down flesh with fire, the easy energy that that was able to
provide. It is something to really understand that when we‟re standing here on this
cusp, because it really is a cusp, we are standing on a cusp between what is the old,
what is truly seven centered, and what is the new, what is really nine centered.
Now, again it‟s a way to grasp this. It‟s not something to take absolutely literally,
but again you see the same thing in the development of tone. In other words, we
see that 1, 2 and 3, which are the tones of the infrastructure of what it is to be hu-
man is the bedrock of what a seven-centered being was. It was the seven-centered
being. And we know that what‟s coming, this complexity at this tonal level, we know
very clearly that this is going to be the rave and this is where the rave is going to
emerge.
So, we have a dividing line that is here. We have the transition from that outer to
that inner vision. We have this shifting between the 3 and the 4. It‟s one of those
magical places, whether you see it in the line in the hexagram, or you see it within
the construct of color, or you see it within tone, this is a schism that is there. It is
an unstable frequency that we best understand through color and through the con-
cept of transference.
The 3: Change Conditions by Heat
Still, it is something to really understand this is a transition point. So, when we‟re
looking at the 3—it was the same discussion that I had with you when we were look-
ing at the internal. If we go back to the internal and we think about the 3, the 3 in-
troduced something that was very interesting. And remember that the 3 and 4 were
bundled together in what are the manipulative ones, the ones that have to change
things. Either have to change the circumstance or change the condition.
And of course we see very clearly that the 3 changes the condition by heating things
up. This is its primary. With technology, because this is a cusp place, then comes
the possibilities of the other side; that is, preservation that is possible through freez-
ing and the development of different kinds of temperature modulations for different
kinds of systems. But fundamentally, this was all about heating up. That‟s why on
the Left you get the hot, the heating up. And this heating up was absolutely essen-
tial if there was going to be any transformation biologically in humanity, if there was
going to be the openness to the mutative jump.

Industrial Revolution/Global Warming
Think about the Industrial Revolution, because it‟s really a classic example. This was
the first time that humanity organized vast efforts enclosed in giant buildings devel-
oping and making, manufacturing all kinds of things and using, to begin with particu-
larly steam, using the release of and the creation of heat. And everything started to
heat up. What we call global warming today is a by-product of the Industrial Revolu-
tion. In terms of the life of the earth where a human life, an 84-year human life, is
the equivalent to a half breath of the earth, the industrial age was just a little wincey
little breath ago or so.
Suddenly there is this emergence of warming up. And it‟s not just the outside warm-
ing up. I know some people find it amusing that I am somebody who publicly is in
favor of global warming. As a matter of fact, I get a kick out of it. I infuriate the
parents of the friends of my children, because this is a big cause for people. It‟s the
latest version of Save the Earth, or one of those things. So there are all these
people desperately concerned about global warming. And I‟m not desperately con-
cerned about global warming. As a matter of fact, I finally found a reason to finally
and completely break with George Bush because as long as he was against global
warming I had to give him his due. Now finally I can really detest the man, because
he has given his sop to Cerberus for that one.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
Mutative Environments
Anyway, heat, it‟s all about heat. It‟s all about warming up. And of course, this is
one of the most important environments to think about when one thinks about the
potential for mutation. These are mutative environments. It‟s also interesting that
as mutative environments they are very likely environments that can carry conta-
gions. Contagions, for example, that thrive in the wet or thrive in the dry or don‟t,
vice versa. And it‟s always something to keep in mind about these particular heated
up environments.
But it‟s something really to grasp about these kitchens and to understand what they
are. They‟re places in which the temperature is changed. Now, of course, in terms
of the evolutionary process, the temperature gauge was always being turned up. I
will never forget the first time that I went to the American desert. I entered into a
world where everything was air-conditioned.
And it‟s fascinating to think about it within this context. In other words, we have
gotten to the point where the technology itself is not just interested in the heating up
of the environment, but the fact is you can‟t stop it now. You know all these politi-
cians running around with their Kyoto Treaties and their “this and that,” their five-
year plans, and ten-year plans, and their carbon trades and their “this” and their
“that.” You cannot stop the momentum of what‟s been started hundreds and hun-
dreds of years ago. No matter what they give you in figures, this thing is going to
run its course. If it runs its course it brings about a vast climatic change in about
1,000 years or so. But nothing is going to stop it.
And one of the more interesting things about it is in a sense the technology of being
able to alter the environments to being cold, is also a technology that makes it poss-
ible to survive in climates that are going to be made inhabitable by the changes that
are going to take place in the climate. But all of this is too late.
2027 is around the corner. And all of this has been nothing more than a build up to
that event. And that event is going to unleash its own forces. And there is nothing
that is going to stop this progression. It‟s not that I do not empathize with those
that are going to be displaced, or the dilemmas that are going to arise out of this
climate change. But then again, our species has gone through climate change many,
many, many times. This is not something that is unfamiliar to us in our genetics.
And we are going through it again. The point is to get through it correctly, as your-
self.
Kitchens
Ok, so let‟s get to kitchens. Kitchens are something different. For example, you go
to an air-conditioned mall on a hot day, that‟s a kitchen. Any environment in which
the temperature—remember how we talked about the temperature in relationship to
the internal when we‟re talking about the 3rd, we‟re talking about this hot/cold. And
of course, the dilemma arises, what is hot, what is cold. Body temperature is the
mean; below body temperature, above body temperature.

In other words, the kitchen
in that sense is an artifi-
cially changed environ-
ment. Remember, it is
hardscape. This is not
about going from different
outdoor environments into
different mini-climates if
you know what I mean. In
other words, this is about
environments in which the
temperature is changed.
Now, the most important
one is the heat environ-
ment, the hot environment
because the keys here are
not about hot and cold,
this is one of the things that is so interesting about it. That is, the keys are obvious
here, the keys are wet and dry, so we have to look at that in a moment and decon-
struct that for a moment.
Hot/Cold
But I want you to think about the hot and cold environment because they are part of
the kitchen. In other words, they serve different purposes. And the way in which I
can explain this to you is the only way to see the difference is to see the difference in
terms of the larger role of what kitchens were there for in the first place. They were
never there for the cold, because the cold is anti-mutative to the point that we think
about the potential of suspended animation and we think about that in terms of
freezing cold temperatures where everything is slowed down to just before disap-
pearing, in a sense.
What we have is a binary between mutative and non-mutative. Think about that as
a being. Think about somebody calling you up and you‟re going to have an impor-
tant meeting to make an important decision about whatever, if you go into a hot en-
vironment, let‟s say that it‟s a fairly warm day, if you go into a place that doesn‟t
have any air conditioning, maybe they just have fans and it‟s particularly warm,
that‟s going to be more mutative than going into an icy cold air conditioned restau-
rant. It‟s different; different impact, different affect.
And of course, it‟s not about a matter of choosing it—isn‟t it delicious what the mind
wants to do the moment it finds something out—oh, I know what I can do with that.
It can‟t do anything with it. It can do something to you. If you‟re not aware, you‟re
always going to end up in the wrong environments at the wrong temperature, so to
speak. And of course, if you‟re at the wrong temperature then you‟re not going to
be able to take advantage, if I can put it that way, of the potential for you in that
particular environment.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
So this hot/cold is very interesting. It is a way of slowing things down, it‟s a way of
speeding things up. So your understanding of kitchen, you have to see this as a
mutative environment, internal mutative environment. And the warmer it is, the
more mutative it is. And the cooler it is, the more it shuts things down.
The Left: Wet
Let‟s look at the Left for a moment, this wet. Now, obviously we have two things
here. We have humidity and obviously and we have aridness, or we have the dry-
ness that‟s on the other side. But let‟s think about it in another way. Let‟s think
about the kinds of environments that that leads one to. One of the interesting things
about the nature of the 3rd
in any configuration is that
it shares this border with
something that is so differ-
ent. In other words, there
is an aspect of landscape
that emerges here. And it
has to do with the condi-
tions of the landscape as
they affect the inner envi-
ronment.
In other words, it‟s not
about whether or not—the
natural humidity, for ex-
ample, is not humidity that
is in fact in one of those
kitchens. It is the humidity generally speaking that is there in the environment or
there in the neighborhood, the zone, whatever the case may be. So there is a condi-
tioning factor about the environment.
One of the things that shows up with these people is that there is a tendency con-
stantly to try to adjust the inner complexity of their personal environment or their
home. Those people, for example, that invest in dehumidifiers, and those people
that invest in humidifiers. In other words, this ongoing battle of trying to find that
right level of humidity or not that‟s necessary for you.
And whenever you think about this binary, this polarity between the dry and the hu-
mid, understand that this becomes one of those things that‟s just there in human
beings. It is something that we are very aware of. It is very, very basic. And one of
the things that is interesting about it is that the wet sets mutation into motion, but
the dry preserves it. So, again we have this relationship of the wet with the muta-
tion. And again, this is the whole thing about understanding the Left side, its seven-
centered inheritance.

The Nodes: Relationships That are Mutative or Not
When we look at the nodes, everything is about our relationship to the other. And
what it means within the context of the 3rd color is whether our relationships with the
other are going to be mutative or not. And remember when I say whether they are
going to be mutative or not, it does not mean that mutative is good. Mutative is
change, but it doesn‟t mean it‟s good. It doesn‟t mean it is better. It doesn‟t mean
it‟s preferred. It‟s just the other.
That other person, maybe being with them in that space that it‟s better that there is
no mutation. Maybe you are somebody that does not want to be mutated. When
you think about it from this perspective, the Left is always looking for mutation and
the Right is always avoiding it. And the Left by its very nature looks for things, and
the Right does not. Have you ever noticed how incredible the outside looks after a
rain? How clear every-
thing is? How suddenly
you can see colors that
you never saw before.
There is this magic for the
Left. The Left is ultimate-
ly so visual. And the wet
environment is the envi-
ronment in which there
are all these different
ways that light works.
If you‟re correct and
you‟re Left and you‟re 3rd
color PHS, then your envi-
ronment is naturally hu-
mid. It doesn‟t mean that
it has to be soaking wet,
you don‟t have to be in the tropics. And if you‟re not in that environment, it means
that you have something to watch. I don‟t think there is anything more important in
Human Design than signposts. This is a deeply personal process that we all go
through. It‟s nobody else‟s, it‟s ours. And verification along the way, encourage-
ment along the way is deeply valuable.
You don‟t have to feel uncomfortable. If you‟re designed to be the kind of person
that is going to thrive in terms of its relationship with others because of the level of
humidity and you happen to be in a dry place, well, wait and see what happens. You
can only move according to your nature. You can only move according to your inner
authority. It‟s only your inner authority that will take you anywhere.
After all, none of these things are essentials for a healthy life and a life in which you
are basically aware, basically with a good surface intelligence, what it means for
somebody that just takes type for what it is as a key for making decisions and they
just practice that. It does not necessarily mean that they will ever recognize the

Introduction to Systems Analysis
places where they belong, because they will not see with eyes that can see. This is
the great dilemma of the mind. It doesn‟t matter how perfect the body can be in its
response to care, how magnificent the vehicle is the moment it is given its due and
its respect, that the moment that it is honored that it takes over its authority and it
just knows precisely what to do, where to go, how to get there, but it doesn‟t mean
that the mind sees that, recognizes it, knows where it is.
Most passengers are struggling saying, where are we, why are we here, I want to be
this and I want to be that. I want to do this and I want to do that. It‟s a long way
from that level of consciousness to get down to a place where you know, your nodes
are in synch; but, then again, how important it is. What are we going to do without
those forces that mutate? We need these forces of mutation. And more than that,
we need that when mutation takes hold that it is preserved.
The Right: Dry
With this shift to the Right, we‟ve had a long mutative history. And with this shift
over to the Right what we get is the end of this mutative crash course that takes us
through this heat generated phenomena until we finally have the emergence of the
Solar Plexus. And in the moment that we do that, we turn off mutation. And we
preserve what has been gained, what is new. We preserve it so we can set its foun-
dation for the future. That it can be stable as a mutation in the world for what is not
now.
This kitchen is an absolutely fantastic place. And of course, you can see the outcome
of that. You can see what has happened to us. Everybody, just about everybody
works in the kitchens. Within this deconstructed understanding of it, the office build-
ings that are air-conditioned and heated and this and that, there are all kinds of
these kitchen environments that are part of the success story of seven-centered mu-
tation. Funny enough they all have their little wet sprinkler systems inside.
The Kitchen
It‟s not what you thought. It doesn‟t mean, by the way, that the kitchen in kitchen
isn‟t valid. Oh, it is. A kitchen is a deeply mutative place, potentially, food is quite a
thing. We well understand that within the context of PHS. And you can see in the
resonance of the 3rd nodal color with the internal, you can see the importance of how
the 3 needs to have a relationship to the kitchen and its food that it needs to be the
controller of that environment that it needs to manipulate that environment. It can
turn things up, it can turn things down.
It‟s particularly impressive when you see it within the context of the dry, these arid
environments, these dry places. You get a lot of that, as an example, in modern ci-
ties, in flats, in apartment buildings in northern countries where you have this very,
very dry heating. You have a vast market in companies that sell all kinds of varia-
tions of grease for people‟s lips to keep them functional. Dry is something that has

PHS Nodal Color 3—Kitchens
gone beyond just the natural, has gone into a by-product of the way in which we
have developed our social connection to each other.
Of course, the dry also has its significance in the deepest sense in this sense of this
is what preservation is all about. And it‟s so important to see that though the 5, 6 as
we look at it from the 1,2 perspective, if you take a tonal perspective of the devel-
opment of cognition and you take this journey all the way around from this deep,
deep concern about survival and yet the need to transcend survival in order to be-
come more than just survival, that by the time you get all the way around to this
loop on the other side that everything that has driven us, that has become what‟s
important to us, we‟ve taken all the
mutation so seriously, all of those
mutations were never, in essence for
our benefit. They were all there to
get to this place so that the mutation
can come to an end.
And you can see where it begins to
actually do its work, because it be-
gins to do its work in resonance to
the 3, and of course, where else to
look, these relationships, the reson-
ance in the 3 in this bridge that is
broken, this world that is divided,
this cognitive potential that is separated in this moment in this frequency space be-
tween that 3 and the 4, in a sense, a magical place, a jumping place, a mutative
place; but, all the pressure to mutate stops at the line.
That is why everything is so strict down here, all the conditions of the internal, all
these very specific environments, it‟s all controlled pressure pushing to be able to
jump across this line. But in fact, this imaginary line is the end of this process and
something new emerges. And this is the end of a process, truly the end of human
mutation and the development of humanity through its mutative potential and the
beginning of something new. And something new that is going to be preserved. It‟s
being stored from the very moment of its emergence. This capacity of the 4, this
capacity to deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply take in, take it all in and preserve it and
hold on to it, but do not let it change. No more change.
So the kitchen is a strange place, it really is. It is the engine of the program‟s evolu-
tionary surface. This is where it all happens, in these environments, with these be-
ings who trigger mutation or not. That‟s an environment where the other can be
cooled down, or the other can be heated up, because it‟s always that potential to
mutate or not.
Providing People a Schema
One of the things that you have to keep in mind when you get to the point when you
begin to use this information to guide other people, one of the things to recognize is
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

57
PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
that they need to see it from the point of view of what you are providing them, in
essence, is a schema. If you take a course to learn how to write, write a story, they
will teach you, not necessarily that‟s the right thing to do, but nonetheless, to write a
schema. Basically, that is a kind of step-by-step little notes of where the story is
going to go, to write out this story.
That‟s what you have when you show somebody what is their holistic design. You‟re
showing them a schema. But it is their life that has to fill it in. you‟re not writing the
story for them. They cannot decide when and how and if they will take advantage or
not of this environment, whether they will follow their strategy or not.
I always loved Lao Tzu. It is so obvious to me that what happens happens. It does.
And no matter how deeply I understand the mechanics, the mechanics reveal what
happens, not what happens changes the mechanics, you know. It‟s just the me-
chanics revealing what happens. So, this is there in the being as a schema for the
story of its true self. Not the story of its not-self, but the story of its true self. And
the story of its true self is made up of many, many components.
Eliminating Resistance
This is not something to grab for, but it is something to deeply understand. Because
the moment you become aware of what is environmentally correct for you, in other
words, what is correct for you in your relationship to the other because again, after
all, you have to see it in that context. Those are environments that are healthy for
you in terms of your relationship with the other because it allows you to eliminate for
yourself resistance, and at the same time it allows you to protect yourself from con-
ditioning. It is also beneficial to you in the long term in terms of your well-being, in
terms of your longevity. The more resistance you eliminate in your life, the greater
the potential for the longevity.
And the major place you can eliminate resistance, because almost all resistance
comes from the other, is that in dealing with others in which you have common and
regular contact, to be in environments that are healthy for you are only going to
benefit you in the long run. But this is something that has to emerge as a by-
product of the correctness of your life.
This is not about the reason; this is about having a program in which you can see
that naturally you will fill out all of its details. This is the parameter, because even in
this sense as we look at it here you have to see that this is a generic. It‟s a genera-
lization. We‟re not seeing it within the context of the whole picture of that being,
that holistic image that I started you off with today. We‟re not seeing it that way.
We‟re down here in a learning place, deconstructing things and looking at what their
values are.
But I want you to see the practical of this. The practical is that the realization, the
recognition, the understanding, the sensing, the knowing, whatever you want to call
it of what is environmentally correct for you is something that sinks into your sys-
tem. It will be more natural for you to move towards that. And the thing that will

Lecture Four
PHS Nodal Color 3—Kitchens
guide you is always the same thing that guides you. The only thing that can guide
you is your inner authority.
When you present this knowledge, which by the way you won‟t be allowed to do until
you graduate, it really is about giving people a promise that is kind of like a golden
carrot. What I understand about the nodal color is that the elimination of resistance
has an enormous impact on the life. Not just the holy grail of living long and
healthy. The elimination of resistance allows for the retention of an enormous
amount of neural capacity far beyond what is natural at later points in one‟s life.
Long Term Well-Being
Most people haven‟t really thought out clearly all the emphasis that Human Design
has placed on the Uranian cycle, the Kiron return, the Uranian opposition being the
half-life of a human, this 84-year cycle is really quite something, and to understand
that the infrastructure has to be able to adapt to that. There‟s no point in living to
old age if one is fundamentally a vegetable and one is part of the vast plague of
people who have deteriorating neural capacity, senility, Alzheimer‟s, all of these
things.
One of the keys in understanding the nodal environment is that it is this environment
that you have to find the nurturing environment that is going to allow you to benefit
from living longer. Otherwise, there‟s no point. The benefit of living longer if you
remain relatively physically healthy, if you remain sharp mentally, this is what mat-
ters and this is where it‟s so important.
It‟s not so much about any kind of strategic concept about how one can take advan-
tage of these environments. I use those kinds of illustrations just to show you what
it means, but it‟s to really see that these environments are very important for one‟s
long term well-being. You‟re not going to see any great short-term advantages to it.
It‟s about long-term well-being. It‟s about what happens when you‟re aligned to
your correct geometry for a long time in your life, you really begin to benefit. You
begin to benefit in so many ways that are far beyond the obvious.
Kitchens: Can be Any Hardscape
The nodes are something that we need to see with eyes that are truly respectful of
how deep their value is. I‟m only scratching the surface of this now, because in fact
it‟s where we have to be to begin with, to understand what this term means, to un-
derstand what it comes from. And again, it‟s a matter of scale. We had seven-
centered beings for about 85,000 years. All of this is taking place very quickly now.
The last 300, 400 years, bang, whoosh—this is a real radical change that‟s taking
place. And throughout the history of humanity, throughout the history of the seven-
centered being going right up to 1781, the kitchen was just basically that place that
created the heat that created the mutation, the fireplace, the cooking pot, all of
these various states, the change in the way in which the food acted as chemistry in
the body.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
Now, obviously, it has taken on a totally different context. We have this rapid, rapid,
rapid expansion in which the early programs have reached their level of incompe-
tence. It‟s awkward to use the original term—kitchen—because in the deconstructed
context you can see it can be any kind of environment. It just has to do with the
basic factors of temperature and humidity. But it could be any hardscape, any
hardscape that can be manipulated, that can be controlled.
It is a fascinating thing to be able to see that the program is so precise. Every single
one of us has this incredible unique way. For example, you can have a very different
cognition for what is your nodal environment that susses that out. You don‟t have
access to that in any conscious sense, you don‟t. But if you understand it then may-
be if your passenger isn‟t absorbed in mind things, that your passenger can observe
you taking advantage of that very cognition, because it‟s there.
This is the magic that lies underneath. And most human beings, let‟s face it, most
human beings cannot get past the not-self and never will. It‟s quite something. And
being in your experiment is good for you, but it is only part of the battle because you
have to deal with the mind in the end.
For us from the point of view of PHS we can build a perfect machine. Oh, boy can
we give you a good machine, real clean and sweet and mean, the kind of brain that
will just do perfect service for you. We can give you a vehicle that is ready to align
itself to exactly what is correct for it environmentally in its relationship with the other
and give you all of it. Will you use it? All these not-selves, they don‟t use that.
They don‟t take any advantage of that. And then of course, everything gets dis-
torted.
So, we have a dilemma on our side. It‟s why in the end that everything is holistic,
because we can help perfect the body, there is no question of that. But you have to
have a willing passenger to get anywhere near this level of awareness. And yet, in
order to have a willing passenger it has to understand these things. It has to know
that they exist. It has to be educated.
Giving Others the Opportunity to Enter into the Experiment of PHS
Our work is to give those who are ready an opportunity to enter into the experiment
of PHS. I don‟t think you‟re ready just because you know Design. I don‟t think
you‟re ready just because you follow your Strategy and Authority. I think you can
only be ready when you‟re ready. And only you know that. I don‟t think there‟s any
timing; I don‟t think there‟s any pressure. As a matter of fact, this is the classic ex-
ample of what I‟ve said all along about this knowledge that it was intended for child-
ren. I think this is a very difficult thing to be committed to as an adult. I think it‟s
quite an accomplishment to actually get to that state.
But it‟s something to grasp that our basic work is being able to open up the possibili-
ty for people that they can begin to change their attention and begin to see their
body not as their problem, but really as their solution. And I don‟t think that most
human beings grasp that, and that we‟re really here to show them those solutions
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

PHS Nodal Color 3—Kitchens
that if they do treat the body according to their specific differentiation, what that
means for them, what it means for them to become an authority.
It Takes Time
And also to understand something, I was never shy in the beginning of this process
in telling people that it took time. Everything takes time. From the beginning that I
started to do readings with people I would tell them seven years, seven years to de-
condition. And that‟s not seven idle years; it‟s seven years in the process. And
those seven years is a long time, and yet it isn‟t. It passes like nothing. And as
you‟re moving through it you get to the midpoint and you get to the critical shift in
cellular information. The knowledge that you‟ve been learning begins to integrate
into the way in which you live. You begin to speak what you tried to understand.
You begin to live a process.
And yet, at the end of those seven years there is no reward, not in the obvious
sense. Everybody has their own recognition that they have been through. Every-
body has their own way of telling that story of what it‟s like at the end of that
process. But that is, in fact, the beginning and only the beginning. I‟m coming to
the end of my third seven-year cycle. Every cycle is another adventure at another
level. And when you finish the first seven-year cycle you begin to go deeply into the
beginnings of you. It can be very difficult that 8th, 9th, 10th year. It‟s a process.
And somewhere along the line slowly but surely the passenger begins to recede in
importance and opportunities arise to complete the holistic process. The moment
that you enter into PHS you put tremendous pressure on the mind, because you
change the way in which it‟s being stimulated, you change the way in which it‟s
physically working, you change the way in what neuron paths are being used. It‟s
very challenging.
And of course, it is necessary to be in a stage where you have the tools to give your
mind something to watch for, to look at, and to see. We have the answers for the
body. It‟s a wonderful thing. But to fulfill this process you have to get to the pas-
senger. You do not get to the passenger without PHS. And I don‟t think that anyone
who is Right sided has a real chance to develop the sensory capacities of the Right,
that is, PHS Right sided unless they follow their PHS regimen, I don‟t think it‟s possi-
ble.
But you have to be ready. And ultimately you‟re the ones who are going to be certi-
fied as professionals, and you‟re the ones that have to carry the integrity of this
knowledge. And you have to make sure that everyone understands there is a time
for things. In all my career I have held things back until the right time, because
there is a right time to release information, there is a right time to change the level
of the consciousness in those you are trying to be of assistance to.
Anyway, so it goes. To all of you, you take care, enjoy yourself. Until next time,
bye for now.

PHS Nodal Color 4: Mountains
I‟ve been looking forward to this one because this one is—well; they‟re all interest-
ing, but anyway. Ok, PHS Nodal Color 4 and we have this wonderful mountain. Let‟s
get right into it.
Nodal PHS for me is one of those highly specialized areas of knowledge that have in
their own way really vast ramifications about what kind of quality of life we can have.
Again, it‟s something to see that as we look at each of these things and we decon-
struct them and we see them as mechanical aspects, that within the holistic picture,
if one is operating correctly, ultimately these are the environmental zones that are
going to be beneficial.
However, there is a fundamental truth about logic and about taking information in
that is logical and correct. It allows us to be in so many ways more sensitive, and to
be more sensitive of the maia. I described the other day that the most extraordinary
thing to understand about the maia is that it gets denser every day. And it has been
getting denser and denser particularly over the last 100 years. There is this incredi-
ble thickness to the illusion.
The Movement to Landscape
It is not an easy thing for any human being to be able to operate correctly without
guidance. And in order to deal with the maia, to be able to have the tuning fork that
allows you to focus in a way that is going to be productive for you or take in expe-
rience in way that is going to be productive for you. it is particularly fascinating for
me in this transition here between the lower hardscape, or what we understood in
the internal as very specific conditions, and moving in this evolutionary pattern to
the landscape.
And of course, in this movement to the landscape there‟s something that has to be
grasped in terms of this evolutionary movement. It is what we are looking at. And
it is always something to keep in mind. And it means the moment that we cross the
barrier here, this barrier between the lower and the upper is the moment that the
environment itself or the tools that we have to manipulate environment, affect the
environment, whatever the case may be, the tools we have to affect ourselves are all
things that are going to be part of whatever the particular nodal PHS happens to be.
Let me give you a basic example of that in the deconstruction of this wonderful
name: mountains. I love it. And what does it bring to mind? You know these

Introduction to Systems Analysis
kitschy paintings of snow covered mountain peaks, the Alps, the Rockies, the Andes,
you name it—Kilimanjaro before global warming, or whatever. But nonetheless, it
brings to mind that kind of concept, that concept of highly elevated zones.
Obviously, there is an essence of literal truth in this. In other words, that elevation
is a key in the environmental perfection for these beings. But, elevation has many
different values. So let me deconstruct mountains for you, and let me tell you what
mountains are really about, because in a sense it‟s rather amusing, at least from my
perspective.
Mountains are About Oxygen
Mountains are about oxygen. If you go up high enough, there are a number of
things that happen. You have less oxygen that is available to your body, to your
brain. It is more fatiguing if you‟re not used to it because of the fact that there is
less oxygen that is available. It can be debilitating if you get high enough up. There
are people who die of oxygen starvation, mountain climbers at enormous peaks, or
whatever.
But the key ingredient in this is the level of oxygen. Now, it‟s just something rather
interesting to think about. Mountain people are people who are not intended to have
dense levels of oxygen in their environment. And of course, in that you could de-
duce dense levels of oxygen in themselves. Now, that‟s interesting in certain conno-
tations. For example, alcohol is an oxygenator. That is, the by-product of taking

PHS Nodal Color 4—Mountains
alcohol into your body is that it increases the amount of oxygen in your brain. On
the other hand, if you were going to take mescaline, a mind altering hallucinogenic,
the net result is that you are going to strip oxygen from the brain.
And it‟s interesting to just think about those two variants, if you will. That is, the
manipulation of oxygen in the body is what generally we refer to as the impact of
drugs, of all kinds, by the way. From tea and coffee and all the various varieties
we‟re talking about. However, because I don‟t mean to digress because it‟s rather
interesting just to see the associations that arise out of just the oxygen itself. There
are ways of reducing oxygen in your body without climbing to a mountain top.
It‟s one of my standing jokes, I‟m a lifelong smoker. I can remember when I began
my journey in being this messenger that, particularly when I first landed in the Unit-
ed States and the New Age was just taking hold and everybody was trying to grow
angel wings and there I was dressed in black, chain smoking cigarettes. I would al-
ways get the same thing. I wouldn‟t get: why do you smoke? I would get this accu-
satory: you smoke. And I always had a very cute retort, which did not please these
people one bit. I would describe the journey for wisdom that one takes when one
wanders in the Himalayas. And I would give them a kind of New-Agey setting, the
search for truth and whatever. And there you are climbing way up above Katmandu
and you sit down on the side of the hill and suddenly you have an epiphany. That
epiphany was brought to you by reduced oxygen in your brain.
One of the impacts of the tars that are associated with things that we smoke is that
the tar affects the cilia of the lungs. These are sort of like little cleansing fingers. It
sort of coats them and dirties them up. Of course, what that actually produces is
that it lowers the level of oxygen that is available to the body. I just simply told
these people that I liked to be at high levels in the Himalayas, and it‟s not always
possible so I smoke instead. Which I thought was very cute, which on occasion I
think they found rather infuriating.
But nonetheless, it‟s true, which is something else. It is a reducer of oxygen in the
brain. And I am a fan of the reduction of oxygen in the brain. I think that that is
marvelous for the potential of awakening in any kind of human being. And it‟s the
first thing you have to crack.
So mountains are actually very interesting. They‟re interesting in terms of elevation
and elevation in its relationship to oxygen. Now, on the plain old-fashioned mun-
dane level, there is a difference in the level of oxygen between being on the ground
floor and the 20th floor of some building, whatever the case may be. Obviously,
there are differences. There are differences between the valley and the mountain-
side, and all of these things.
But it‟s relative. It is not about just the specific elevation. For example, to be in a
low-lying area in which you have the high ground. Again, there is a value in that.
But if you dig really deep underneath here, and it‟s the place that‟s so interesting is
that it really is about the brain and the ability to be able to provide an environment
that nurtures the brain.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
For example, Alzheimer‟s, one of those dreaded things of old age, any of the prob-
lems of old age are problems that can be found here and ameliorated here, because
this is so deeply tied to the longevity program that we‟re going to be able to live out
according to how we live our lives. It seems to me that those that have the highest
levels of brain oxygen are the ones most likely to have brain deterioration. And I
say that relative to those that are going to be, in that sense, 4th color beings, who
are going to be in transference and they are not going to be at elevations that are
correct for them, and in fact are going to be increasing the oxygen level in their brain
which in essence dumbs them down.
Of course, if you‟re in an environment in which you are dumbed down, it means that
you don‟t gain any benefits from that environment. After all, the nodes are setting
us up for a trajectory that is correct for us. If the whole system is dumbed down, it‟s
not going to do a very good job. As a matter of fact, it‟s not going to do the job at
all. There is this interesting correlation between the intellectual potential here. This
is about not just simply a healthy brain, but a specifically long lasting brain. In other
words, this may be somebody whose other parts of their body may deteriorate nor-
mally in the aging process, but will retain a certain vitality in terms of their mental
processing late into life.
Correct Elevations: Less Wear and Tear of Oxygen
This is something that is certainly a sign of the potential that is there in this nodal 4th
color. That is, if you are oriented to the Right elevations then what you‟re going to
do is you‟re going to take away
the wear and tear of the oxy-
gen. Most people don‟t really
get it about oxygen. I don‟t
remember this guy‟s name. He
was wonderful. He was Ameri-
can. I think he was an anthro-
pologist, a poet. He died about
10 years ago or so. He had
some television programs that
he ran.
Anyway, one of those pro-
grams, I think he wrote a book
about it, I think he was quite
famous, was a book about hu-
mans are fire. And it was very appealing to me as an Aries. It was a fabulous per-
ception. That is, looking at human life from the point of view of oxygen and what
oxygen really is. Nobody likes rust on the side of their car. But that‟s oxygen. Oxy-
gen is a corrosive and it is a powerful, powerful corrosive. You would not want to
breathe pure oxygen. That‟s quite something. It is a corrosive.

PHS Nodal Color 4—Mountains
The enormous amount of oxygen in the brain literally kills brain cells. It is a corro-
sive agent. So when you think about alcoholism or any of the dilemmas associated
with the abuse of alcohol, specifically, is to understand the damage that that does in
the sense in terms of the function and the function ability of the brain itself. Ob-
viously, 4th tonal PHS beings are intended to maintain their intellectual interest
throughout life. It is clear to me—it‟s one of the things that I find so interesting
about it because it‟s really oriented towards a mind that is not ready to get old. A
mind that‟s not ready to just tirelessly repeat the mental patterns. That there is still
curiosity, that there is still interest, all of these things.
For example, my own mother who is 95 reads a minimum of two or three books a
week. She‟s very active on the mental plane. She obviously at 95 has a body that is
relatively deteriorated. It is only natural. My assumption would be that—we don‟t
have time for her—she‟s probably 4th color. And what is interesting about that is
that as long as I have known her she‟s always lived on the high ground, which is in-
teresting. And she does not use any alcohol.
So, these are indications for me of a color resonance here to what this theme is.
And it‟s interesting to watch this, because you get to see that the showcase of the
gray set are these octogenarians and further, who have these crisp, interested, de-
lighted, almost childlike minds, the ones that are going back to University at 85 and
all this kind of stuff. It‟s one of the things to see that this is one of the aspects that
is built in here.
Correct Environments Extend Vitality
Remember, we‟re looking at longevity themes. This is one of those magic places.
There were always those people that would say, do you know how long we live, and
all this kind of stuff. But it‟s something really to understand in our relationship to
these environments is that these environments are the environments that so dimi-
nish resistance that there is this extended vitality that is there. And thematically
when we‟re dealing with this 4—let‟s look at the dilemmas of the 4. For example,
the vulnerability of the 4 body, the vulnerability to exhaustion, to fatigue, the vulne-
rability to infection, all that vulnerability; and on the other side of it this incredible
ability to be able to influence, to be able to externalize, to be able to network, to be
able to do all of those things on the other side of it.
What we‟re really looking at in that sense is that you can see the roots of the need
for the intelligence. In other words, one of the things that I always talk about 4th
line beings is their dilemma with discernment. In other words, they need to invest in
the potential of others, so they have to be very careful about whom they invest in,
otherwise they‟re going to waste their resources. This is a matter of discernment.
Discernment is rooted in the capacity to be intelligent and it means that you need to
take in the right kinds of information.
The other thing is that this is the 4 environment, at least from the color perspective
and in understanding that this is about taking the high ground. Of course, in English
that has a number of values as an expression. It means taking the morally right

Introduction to Systems Analysis
ground, or in our case the correct ground. It‟s one of the things to see, if you‟re
somebody who is a nodal 4—by the way, before I go any further anybody in the
classroom with a PHS nodal 4?
Anyway, this is something to see about it‟s not enough just to be correct. Correct-
ness operates in movement. To be correct is so within yourself. This is the whole
problem with the internal; the internal is really simple to get at. We know that. Ba-
sic PHS internal is a very straightforward thing, here‟s your regimen, and here is
your sensory focus.
But the moment that we come over here we come into something different. That is,
the correctness has to lead to a line of connection with the other. And it is in this
place of needing to connect with the other, which is the life itself, is that in connect-
ing with the other that there is a natural environment. The fact is that most human
beings, because they have been conditioned all of their lives, just because they enter
into this experience and this experiment of what it is to operate according to their
own decisions, that based on that road of going through the seven year decondition-
ing, going through the first seven years as oneself in order to lay the foundation and
then enter into the full process of it, maybe by then there is an alignment to that
specific environment. But at the same time it has cost years and years and years of
deterioration.
Nodal PHS Important for Healing
I think that the nodal PHS is as important for healing as anything else. I think some
of you participated in an early Ibiza event when I first began to introduce PHS color.
One of the things that I talked about was creating the clinic of the future, that clinic
where you had six different environments. And in those six different environments
you would do your healing work with people. So you have somebody that is the 4th
color, you bring them into the clinic and obviously you‟re going to go up into a higher
floor. Not only a higher floor but you‟re going to have an air system that actually
reduces the level of oxygen, only slightly, it doesn‟t have to be a lot, no threat to an-
ybody, so that you have an absolutely beneficial environment for that person to be-
gin to understand who they are, what they are, all of this.
I see the potential of this kind of healing environment clinic. You can see it‟s already
in the consciousness of people, sort of, these kinds of retreats, these healing re-
treats, trying to create pleasant environments for people and those kinds of things.
But of course, this is absolutely precise in terms of what would be beneficial. You
can put them in humid spaces and dry spaces and this and that and on and on. In
other words, you can accommodate them in an environment in which they have ab-
solutely no problem in terms of their relationship to the other. It is the perfect envi-
ronment for them to be able to learn about themselves, enter into their process cor-
rectly and begin to understand the benefits of it.
Not only that, you can show them their transference. Take them from the oxygen
poor upper floor and drag them down into the cave and they‟re going to start com-

plaining right away. These are environments. And they are environments that can
be constructed. And these are ideal environments for those beings.
After all, you want to help somebody but you don‟t want to condition them. You just
want to help them. You want to help them and you don‟t want to be another agent
of difficulty for them in their lives. And you want them at their very best. In this
environment, this being is going to have as sharp a mind as they can have. Who
knows what it‟s going to be. After all, we‟re only talking about infrastructure here
anyway. You have the brain system; you have the whole thing set. What the mind
does with it, well, that‟s what the mind does with it. But the environment is healthy.
It‟s like you get a mountain person and they‟re not well. You bring them into your
clinic that‟s in the basement of your house. You‟re not going to help them, no mat-
ter who you are and what you think you can do for them. You can‟t. It‟s not a
healthy environment for them. It‟s an environment in which they‟re immediately
open not simply to conditioning, but they‟re really open to being damaged by the
conditioning because not only are they in the wrong place, but in being in such a
wrong place they‟re more vulnerable than normal to the conditioning in that envi-
ronment.
I don‟t want you to in any way minimize how important this is in the holistic under-
standing of the person. At the same time, you can‟t exactly get fanatical about it
either, it has to be correct. But in understanding it, and beginning to understand
what is the environment for you, you are making an investment in the quality of
your life. Here is where we can really do something that is very special. Again, be-
ing a witness of my mother‟s experience, all these people that are there in the envi-
ronment that she lives in, how most of them are mentally damaged in their old age
that the quality of life is not there. It‟s not about how long you live; it‟s the quality
of that life. And this is what we‟re dealing with here. We‟re dealing with the quality
of it, that enriches the life process no matter what age you are.
I‟m very lucky. I‟m very lucky in that regardless of my ignorance I have always lived
in my nodal environment. It‟s the serendipity, I guess, of the gods for me. I think
of my dad. I can remember my father when he turned 60. And I‟m 59; I have a
strong memory, not one of those vague things. He was an old man. At least it
seemed to me that he was an old man. He talked like an old man. He was ready for
the end of whatever. There was this kind of an end of a cycle quality to him. He had
already settled into his old age; very Saturnian in that sense, despite the fact that he
would live until he was in his late 80‟s and didn‟t die naturally. He was hit by a car.
I‟m sure he would have lived endlessly.
I look at myself in the mirror and I don‟t get it. I have a different quality of life, a
very different quality of life. As a matter of fact, my life didn‟t start until I was 39. I
had a very, very late start in life. All of it, it‟s interesting to see that this quality of
life is different. When I talk to people now about Kiron as a flowering period, it really
is. That‟s the thing that is so astonishing, is that we do have this new Uranian cycle
and in this new Uranian cycle it is the quality of life that matters. It is not the inten-
sity of life that matters.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
The Saturnian cycle was all about intensity; live hard, fast and died that way. This
was the world generation after generation for tens of thousands of years. And we
have a very different cycle now. It is not about the intensity, it is about the quality
of life. We are no longer slaves. We have our legalized free time and all of these
things that never existed, all of these potentials of being able to bring some depth to
the experience of the process.
Of course, all of us have a fear of age, and have a fear of what age can do to us,
what it can do to the mind, what it can do to the body. We‟re in a very, very special
place here, because we are talking about something that nurtures the quality of a
long and healthy life, and nurtures it at every level, both physical and mental.
Maintaining Mental Acuity is Most Important
Obviously, here when we‟re looking at this particular 4, the emphasis is on the men-
tal. These are beings that the social environment is the place that is the most stimu-
lating for them intellectually. It is the place that refreshes them. And at the same
time, given that the elevation
is right, given that the oxygen
level is right that they are in an
environment that is an advan-
tage for them. To have a
healthy brain at 80, 90, it
makes it worthwhile. My
mother likes to say that her
body is very old, but her spirit
isn‟t. And it‟s true, because I
can tell, I can tell by the nature
of our conversations and I can
lecture her at this point and
she actually gets things. I
don‟t mean that in a bad way,
but there are old patterns that
old people have in the way they see things, the way they think. She has a mind that
is still capable of grasping these things, working them through. It gives her life
some meaning. It gives purpose to the days that keep moving by, because basically
it‟s very much a lonely life at that point.
There is this magic of the mind, the beauty of it. She said the one thing that she ac-
tually has is memories. And of course, when you lose that healthy mind, you lose
those memories. You lose the continuity of your life, you lose the stories, and you
lose the beauty of it. It‟s a treasure to be able to maintain one‟s acuteness, one‟s
mental acuteness.
So what does it say to us when we see somebody that has the 4th nodal tone? It
says that they, for them, that the quality of life is rooted in their maintaining their
mental acuity. It‟s more important than anything else. It‟s important for them nev-

er to stop learning and teaching, never to stop being involved, because it is a key for
them. And at the same time, for them to understand what environment works for
them. And the elevation can be explained in many ways, better to be on the top
floor than the bottom floor; better to be on the hillside than in the valley. Again,
they‟re relative things, but they‟re very, very important. It‟s better to be in the
mountains than in the hills. It‟s all relative.
These nodal environments are transforming environments and ultimately the path
that I see for anyone is that in a sense most of your life needs to be spent in these
environments. When I say, most of it, it does not mean that one has to be shuttered
in or out, or whatever it is, or whatever the condition, or whatever the quality hap-
pens to be, the point of it is that these are the environments that bring the best out
of our connection to the other. And they do that by not allowing the other to distort
what we are.
Nothing creates greater resistance than another human being. There‟s a wonderful
word in English, I like it very much: aggravation. It sounds like what it is: Rrrrrrrrr
(sound), to be aggravated. And you get aggravated because of the other. It‟s al-
ways because of the other, because life and its complexity is rooted in: it‟s always
because of the other, because that‟s what it‟s about. We cannot separate ourselves.
What we can do to avoid that deteriorating aggravation, because it‟s the conditioning
of the other that destroys you. It does.
I used to say that these not-self people around you are the enemy. They are;
they‟re the enemy. Hopefully they can be co-opted, but they‟re the enemy because
they are the forces of the deepest conditioning. They live the not-self, they‟ve em-
brace the not-self. Their suffering, if they have suffering, is part of their not-self
personality and their not-self purpose. And all they want to do is bring you along
with them. They don‟t want you to escape from it. And not consciously, not on pur-
pose, not on this or that, not because it‟s malicious, but because it‟s the way it is.
You cannot escape their conditioning, you cannot escape it, you are open. Like eve-
rybody else you take things in.
The fact that you‟re operating through your Strategy and Authority is benefiting you
in the sense that you‟re going to operate correctly and make the right decisions, but
it doesn‟t mean that you eliminate the impact of having to deal with negative condi-
tioning. It is natural for me as a single definition Manifestor to be solitary. It is clear
to me how offensive, not what people say or do particularly, but just the auras of the
not-self, what focus it takes and attention it takes to protect yourself from the dis-
comfort of the incorrect aura and the incorrect aura all around you.
To be in the right environment is a way in which dealing with the other finally can be
something that can be positive, at least positive from your own perspective. In other
words, an environment in which you are not on guard, but an environment in which
there is a possibility of some kind of communion, because you‟re not at risk. Not on-
ly are you not at risk, but as you can see, each of these tonal environments bring a
certain potential to the quality of life.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
And of course, here in this 4 we see very much this focus on the intellectual, the
mental in life that these mountain environments are the places to have those great
discussions. Well, isn‟t it true, in a sense, those—I can remember them in my North
American experiences, my Canadian experiences growing up, going hiking and set-
ting up a camp and sitting out there and having these kinds of conversations, those
ponderings whatever the case may be. It‟s in the cliché of what elevation is all
about.
Left Active/Right Passive
Let‟s take a look at the two sides of the story here. It‟s interesting because it shows
you how significant the 4 is in so many ways. And of course, we know 4 and the
transference and all of these themes, that here it carries the keynotes of the PHS
internal, the general PHS internal; in other words, the active side and the passive;
the Left active and the Right passive. Here you can see that keynote mirrored here
precisely.
It is an archetype. If you are Left mountain the active social intellectual environ-
ment is something that‟s very important for you; it is a key. It is simply a key. And
obviously, if you‟re going to be on the Right side, the moment we go over to the
Right side we go into the resource area, we go into the fundamental passive. And
the fundamental passive simply in the sense that one is available for communion in
those environments. As a matter of fact, for somebody who is Right, those are the
only environments that are actually going to bring them advantages.
Everything about the Right is understanding that when it comes to PHS and it comes
to anything having to do with the design side, the Right needs to take advantage as
quickly as possible of any of the tools that are available to it, the Strategy and Au-
thority, the PHS internal regimen, and aligning themselves as soon as it‟s viable,
aligning themselves to a nodal environment that is correct for them because it will
make a huge difference in the development of their Right potential and the lessening
of the impact of conditioning.
Anybody who is Right sided obviously is subject to deep conditioning. And of course,
not having the environment to protect them means that conditioning is as deep as
it‟s going to get. Going into and being in the right environments right away is some-
thing that is really essential. Again, if I were a billionaire I‟d build this clinic. I‟d get
a nice piece of land here in Ibiza and build this fantastic place where you have these
six different environments for healing because it is a foundation.
The Importance of Nodal Environments for Undefined G Centers
It‟s also a way of getting people to recognize the difference that these environments
bring, and to recognize that they are attuned to one and one only. And that needs
to be translated into the nature of their life. This is what it‟s all about. To be able to
be in your nodal environment—I have people in my life very dear to me who have
undefined G centers. When I think of the nodal PHS I think wow this can be such a
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

valuable tool to the undefined G. Not so much the specific of place in terms of is it in
this country or that country, but in terms of the basic infrastructure necessary in any
place in order for them to really be comfortable, because the nodal environment is
going to protect them. And even if they‟re in a place that is “temporary” to be in the
right nodal environment is going to protect them in that environment.
I see the PHS nodes as armor, body armor. It‟s the kind of thing that shields you,
protects you, the kind of environment where everything is to your advantage. It is
to your advantage. There is no downside to the right environment. And of course, if
you take this to the extreme,
and you can‟t because it will
never happen, if everybody
lived in that way, we would
see that we have basically six
different tribes, six different
environmental tribes that
basically have a deep affinity
for each other.
It‟s something to think about
in terms of relationships.
Again, my caution with all of
this is that I‟m giving you
knowledge that is as deep as
it can be in Human Design in
the sense that it reveals something that is enormously important and yet at the
same time will create all kinds of dilemmas if it is realized or in order for it to be rea-
lized. It is not always to everyone‟s advantage. That is, in a relationship one part-
ner having this and the other partner having that. There are dilemmas that can
arise out of such things, obviously.
My concern in my work is that I provide the necessary foundation for the acceptance
of this knowledge as a science, which means everything has to be seen and it all has
to be laid out and obviously it is clear to me that your life environment determines
the quality of that life. It just does. And life without quality, well, who really needs
that. That‟s the whole dilemma of the not-self world; and to be able to find a place
where the general resistance is eliminated. It‟s sort of like the first shelter that was
built that could protect a human from the elements. What an amazing thing it was
to be able to go behind that shelter.
And here is another shelter. It is a shelter for the spirit of the being; it is a shelter
for the vehicle. It‟s the vehicle‟s garage. It‟s its parking spot. It is the best place
for it to sit, to sleep, to dream, to live, to work, to play. And as I said it‟s not some-
thing that has to be 100% of the time. It‟s not possible; it‟s not going to be that
way. It‟s not about that. It‟s about understanding that we have a natural inclination
to live out our lives in perfection. It‟s there for us. You cannot do that without the
right environment. It‟s not possible.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
Serotonin
So you can end up following your experiment, you can end up making those deci-
sions that are correct for you and not end up with a quality of life and a length of life
that is programmed in you. One of the first things that I was told in my mystical
process was about serotonin. It still fascinates me. According to what I was told we
have in a sense a projected serotonin production limit for a life; everyone, we‟re
born with a serotonin counter. It is why—I don‟t do it much anymore—warn people
about not taking serotonin-reduction things or serotonin adding things.
Don‟t mess with serotonin. Please. Serotonin is a neural transmitter. According to
the Voice we are all given a serotonin production number. Basically, if there is no
outside reason for death, disease, accident, if you‟re going to live a perfectly healthy
life as true self, you‟ll live out your full serotonin count. So, all of us have a kind of,
not so much a guarantee, but a certificate of longevity.
And of course, the whole thing is that for all of us in this Uranian age we have a gen-
erally long certificate of longevity. It is simply a matter of how we live that life. And
of course, that quality of life is based on two things: PHS internal which says that
you put into your body what is correct for you in the way in which it is correct, and
the PHS external that says you need to be in environments where you are properly
sheltered in order to protect your vehicle and in order to benefit your trajectory.
These are the keys—long life, healthy life, the basic salutation that every human in
friendliness has ever offered another. What did Spock say: live long and prosper?
It‟s the way it is.
Check Your Birth Time if You Do Not Resonate to the PHS Nodal
When you look at your PHS nodal, one thing I will suggest to you is that if you do not
resonate to it, check your time, because that‟s something that I think should be
very, very clear. It doesn‟t mean that you‟re tuned to it so deeply, if you know what
I mean. It‟s just obvious to you that it‟s there. It‟s very important to recognize it.
It‟s one of those signposts, by the way, that tells you that you probably have very
good time, because it is a very important key.
My concern are always the people that are on the 3/4 cusp because these things are
so different and it‟s so dangerous when working at substructure levels to be able to
offer wisdom, advice, whatever, when there is any level of uncertainty in terms of
the timing. And one of the things that‟s clear about the nodal tone is that‟s some-
thing that you should be able to resonate to. And if you don‟t, again I would be sus-
picious about the time. You may be off a couple of minutes here or there, whatever
the case may be, but it‟s something that would certainly be an indicator.
It is also something that you can look at yourself. I have often thought about—years
ago people used to ask me about rectification of charts and I would just send them
to astrologers because I didn‟t want to get into this, because it meant I would have

to teach all the stuff that I‟ve already taught to get here and I wasn‟t about to do
that. Certainly this is a place where you can hone in on the correct design in some-
body.
The moment you ask somebody whether they resonate to something or not, if
they‟re not answering according to their Strategy and Authority it could be suscepti-
ble to all kinds of conditioning anyway. It‟s a tricky business. But nonetheless, for
those of you working with your design and many of you for many years, this is
something where you should really have a sense of it. And as I said, if not, then be-
ware. And it is perhaps of all the things in terms of finishing touches that you can
bring to your physical process, this is probably the most beneficial thing that you can
put as the icing on the cake, is simply being very clear that you are in the environ-
ment that is correct for you.
Design Nodes: Setting You Up for Your Purpose
One of the things to be clear about is that the Left/Right will take advantage of the
right environment in their specific way. It doesn‟t change anything within the con-
text of environment itself; it‟s simply the approach that‟s there in the environment
itself. But the environment is everything. Remember, what do your design nodes
actually set you up for? They‟re setting you up for your purpose. And your purpose
cannot be fulfilled without your relationship to the other. And your relationship to
the other cannot work the way it can for you unless you‟re in the right environment.
And the moment that you are in that environment correctly, is the moment that you
offer to your personality and to the potential of your mind to be able to take advan-
tage of that environment, to be able to take advantage of it in terms of the quality of
the intercourse and the way in which that can work to one‟s advantage—a place for
outer authority, a place to make decisions, a place in which the life can unfold in an
environment that is sheltered; obviously, deeply important.
Be Careful in Sharing this Information
Every time that I introduce knowledge my concern is always that there is this—I un-
derstand getting excited about learning things and wanting to share them with oth-
ers, but my introduction of nodal knowledge, both in PHS and Rave Psychology is in
order to be able to establish for the third year a holistic program so that all of this
can be properly integrated and laid out as an analytical program. Be very careful
about what you do with what you learn here. If there are students of yours that are
very involved and you want to share it with them, that‟s the kind of thing that‟s cer-
tainly all right. But again, I would be very careful about letting this information out
before you really have digested all of it and really seen it all in perspective.
It‟s like what I showed last week when I showed you the sketch for the holistic ad-
vanced imaging, there are so many things to integrate together; just integrating the
external and the internal together, because you can see that I have not done this yet
for you. In other words, I have not taken you through that process of integrating

Introduction to Systems Analysis
the two together. This is for the third year when we start integrating everything to-
gether. We‟re still seeing these things in isolation. We‟re not seeing whether there
is an external Left to a nodal Right, or a nodal Right to an external Right, all the var-
iations that could be there. It‟s not being integrated.
So, it is not for you to jump to conclusions about the way in which you can use this
as a tool in terms of benefiting others. What you can do is to see it within the con-
text of yourself, so far, as we‟ve gone through the first four, to see it in your own
life, to begin to measure the difference for you in experimenting with entering into, if
you‟re not already, what is the right kind of nodal environment for you, to begin to
get the sense of the difference in order to prepare you for the requirement which is
to adjust whatever your environment is so that it does work to your benefit.
And the benefit is huge. In terms of the life process, the benefit is really remarka-
ble. So, the nodal view. I have returned to my love affair with the nodes. They
have always intrigued me. The deeper I understand what they are the more I realize
how extraordinary it is. The whole thing about the environment is conditioned by the
universe. These are nodes we‟re talking about. We‟re not talking about planetary
objects that imprint. We‟re talking about nodes that are windows to stellar neutrino
streams.
It‟s the gift of the totality to guide us to our unique environment. I find that really
beautiful. The solar system is concerned with your internal. It‟s concerned with your
brain system. It is concerned with the way in which you‟re going to function in the
solar system program. But this is something else. This is coming from far, far away.
This is a whole different kind of imprint. The nodes in a sense are the aliens in the
wheel. They really are. They‟re not this familiar family of gods and goddesses that
float around the elliptic and imprint us with their particular this and that. There is a
mystery to what is behind the nodal window. We don‟t know these things well, these
objects firing out with their fiery breath, this endless ocean of neutrino information.
We barely know their names.
And this is what‟s guiding your potential for longevity, giving you shelter. It says
something about what the purpose is in that. How the correctness of the environ-
ment is beyond the ability of Sun/Earth; it‟s beyond their grasp, it‟s beyond their ken
that in fact the sun and earth are controlled by being in the environment of the solar
system. But anyway, I don‟t want to get too obscure.

PHS Nodal Color 5: Valleys
Ok, we come to valleys, the 5th nodal color. Something to think about—if you were
to think about all of the major cities of Europe, as an example, one of the most
common things you will find about all of them is that they are built in valleys on riv-
ers, or on river plains. The valley is a place of maia density.
One of the things to keep in mind is that whenever we‟re talking about color we‟re
always talking about an evolutionary pattern. That is, we are talking about a move-
ment in this direction, always moving from the foundation from the caves at the very
beginning to the shores, neutrino shores. This is a movement. And one of the
things that we noticed about the internal when it came to the 5-6, actually some-
thing in a sense began with the 3-4 is that slowly there is this ability to be able to
manipulate things and ultimately to be able to take advantage of technology as an
example. In other words, these are evolutionary patterns that are part and parcel of
these particular kinds of environments.
Valley Environment: The Bedrock of Civilization
And one of the things to grasp about the valley environment is that the valley envi-
ronment is the bedrock of what we call civilization. The first cities, the city of Ur,
Gilgamesh‟s world built on the flood valley of the Tigris-Euphrates river. Most of the
great cities of the world have the same kind of story.
So, the valley was a place where you had resources. That is, this is where the arable
land was, this was where you had the kind of fecundity in the vegetation that you
could support the domestication and husbandry of animals. It was all of those
things. It was the valleys where you had access to water. After all, you cannot build
a civilization; you cannot build the community without easy access to water. These
were the prime real estate locations in the development of civilization. Today what
we have is a vast number of human beings, a vast slice of the population of humani-
ty that live in these places, that live in these valleys. This is all part of this expan-
sion of this particular environment.
Rooted in a Sound Foundation
But before I talk about the obvious of high and low, because it‟s what valleys and
mountains as a relationship to each other certainly bring to mind. There‟s something
to grasp about the valley, and how different it is from the mountain. As a matter of
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

77
PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
fact, how different it is from the shore. The difference is sound. This is about envi-
ronment rooted in a sound foundation. In other words, there is an acoustic density
to the valley that you do not have either at the mountain or the shore. There is this
acoustic density.
And the acoustic density has a lot to do with architecture. That is, the combination
of architecture and high population—if you‟re not used to it—I‟m somebody for ex-
ample that lives in the countryside. So there is no jarring acoustic quality to all of
this. But the moment I step into even one of the smaller communities on the island
that by most standards are just sort of tiny little villages, it is obvious to me how
acoustically different they are immediately.
And the moment that I go into the main city on the island, Ibiza Town, the acoustic
level is incredible by comparison. Most people forget, because what you do is you
get used to acoustic environments. You turn them into some kind of background
field. As a matter of fact, if it suddenly became silent you would be really uncom-
fortable. It would be a very odd moment because you‟re so used to the density that
is there in the valley maia. And this is an acoustic density. It is a combination of
being in the valley having population density and all of it being under pressure, be-
cause the valley is a pressure point. That is, as you go up into the mountains it‟s all
very different. It‟s the difference between boiling an egg at Death Valley and boiling
an egg at Kathmandu.

PHS Nodal Color 5—Valleys
An Acoustic Drum Held Under Pressure
It‟s going to take you a hell of a long time in Kathmandu to get that damn egg to
boil. And it‟s the same egg in the same pot on the same fire, but of course we‟re
dealing with different pressure and we‟re dealing with different altitudes. When
we‟re dealing with the valleys we‟re dealing with pressure. And basically the way
you can think of it is that the valley environment is an acoustic drum held under
pressure. In other words, it‟s like an acoustic ceiling that holds the density of the
acoustic environment.
This is what the valley is. The valley is a sound environment. In other words, if you
think about it in the context of the word itself, because right now you think valley
basically you think of countryside and some lovely little prosaic valley somewhere,
where in fact the vast majority of the best valleys have already been occupied by
mega cities where there is this incredible acoustic density. I mean, incredible.
And everything, by the way, about the presence of this particular nodal direction is a
driving force for what ultimately we think of in terms of the 5th line as a universaliza-
tion principle. In other words, ultimately the valleys being populated, the acoustic
density and population expanding, ultimately this was a way in which the world is
both conquered and unified. We all live in cities, and so forth and so on. We all
have to follow the same rules of supply and demand and the various things that
come with this force.
But it‟s sound. Now, of course, within the context of looking at the external, the
great mystery of the nodes, in terms of their design, is that they do these two things
that are rather unexpected in a way. That is, they point you towards an environ-
ment that is beneficial and at the same time, the by-product of the beneficial envi-
ronment is an enhancement of quality of life in terms of quality of the longevity
process.
To understand mutation, since 1781 after all we are this nine-centered mutation, we
have an Uranian lifecycle, which is built into the nine-centered vehicle. We are in-
tended to have this basic 84-year cycle as a fundamental median point of the life
force, or the life program, as it were. Within the Saturnian framework anyone over
50 was old. And their biology reflected that. And their level of deterioration, the
quality of their longevity, was something that you could easily see that it was quite
limited. It is only in the last 50 years or so and it began a couple a hundred years
ago when we began to get uniform hygiene plumbing and things like that for cities.
Everything about what it is that the nodes do for us is that they really ensure you‟re
going to be in a place where you‟re going to meet the least possible resistance. This
is the magical thing. And it takes you back to one of the basics of the knowledge, is
the understanding that we are objects and we are objects that are moving in space.
Anything that‟s moving has to deal with resistance, anything that‟s moving.
Of course, what we see within the dynamics of the physics that we work with is that
if you streamline something then you reduce the resistance. So we had this abrupt
change, for example, in the way in which automobiles were designed. The way
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

79
PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
trains were designed and all of these things that have to force their way through the
atmosphere, force their way through the resistance, that there is this streamlining.
But we‟re the same thing. We suffer from wear and tear. And of course, we all
know that as not-self that the world that you confront is a tremendous resistance
field. And of course, you‟re constantly barging and pushing and trying to get your
way through that, and every single one of them is taking a piece of flesh. We have
very specific vehicles that are designed for very specific environments. It‟s just like
that. In the same way that we design vehicles to fly and to sail and to ride across
the land.
We have vehicles that are designed for certain terrain, designed for certain zones.
The more you begin to understand differentiation, the more you understand that we
all have a place; we all have a platform for the fulfillment of our purpose. And your
nodes are going to get you there. They get you there on automatic pilot. They get
you there on the cognition that you derive from being correct in terms of your de-
sign, in terms of your Strategy and Authority. And that slowly but surely your physi-
cal vehicle is going to align itself to the environment that is correct for you.
Take in the Information and Watch
Remember that you cannot just simply say, all right, this is my environment; this is
where I‟m going. That‟s a mental decision. And isn‟t about that, and it can‟t be
about that. It is about taking information in and watching what happens; watch,
don‟t act. That‟s not what we‟re here to do, we‟re not here to act on it, we‟re here to
see it. I teach you to see it. Yes, all of this ultimately is going to be of benefit to the
other and it‟ll all be reduced into a kind of programmable technique of delivering in-
formation. But this is the threshold of being able to transform the quality of life.
How many people at 51 really think about it as this is the time for flowering? You go
out into the population, for the vast majority of human beings this isn‟t about flower-
ing, this is about I figured out how to make it this far, I‟m going to hold on to the
end. That‟s what it‟s about. And there cannot be flowering without vitality. And
there is no vitality if the vehicle is burdened with resistance.
We all have this armor; it‟s a kind of armor. It is a gift. But you have to get there,
you have to be there. And the nodes in the end are never for us, we only gain these
advantages indirectly. We‟re never gaining them directly, because that‟s not what
the nodes are about. The nodes are about diminishing resistance in relationship to
one thing and one thing only, the other. We cannot live our lives without the other,
we cannot, it‟s not possible. This is what it is.
And of course, the concern of the nodes—it‟s so interesting when you think about the
cross of life on the design side, the Sun/Earth is only concerned about the brain—
brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain. And the nodes—place; the place where you
can deal with the other and you‟re not going to be overwhelmed by conditioning.
And it‟s conditioning that puts the nails in the coffin, that‟s what conditioning does.

I used to love it when all these people would bitch at me because I‟m a smoker. And
they would tell me that I‟m taking years off my life. I tell you, being not-self takes
years off your life; that really takes years off your life. That‟s what it‟s about. It
beats you down. And so much of it is very straightforward.
Think about the way in which we live, in terms of where we live. For most people it‟s
where they were born. There are certain societies—Americans, for example move a
lot. I think a third of Americans move every two years; they move a lot. Not so
much out of state, but they move around.
When you think about it, when you think about the trends of where people go, where
they live, and that the populations expand, it‟s not like human beings are nurtured to
find their true place, they‟re not. They‟re homogenized into whatever environment
they happen to be. The places that are considered safe for them are not necessarily
safe. I love that comment of yours earlier, Kumud, about the memory of childhood
and the three doors and being a cave person. We‟re raised in environments where
these things can be very, very, very uncomfortable for us and we honestly do not
know why.
The Difference Between the Upper and the Lower
Not all of us are so sensitive that it gets to a point that it becomes a problem large
enough to create any dislocation in the life, but nonetheless it is there and it impacts
the psyche and obviously it impacts the way in which conditioning is taken in. This is
a deep conditioning process, when you‟re not in the right place. And of course, it‟s
very different because as you can see it‟s always the case, this difference between
the upper and the lower. It‟s this dividing line and it‟s always so different.
The lower is much more specific, even
though we can sort of generalize it as
we deconstruct it. The fact is that it is
much more limiting, in a way, what is
really available than the upper when
there is this sort of large overview that
is around them. There are all these
different approaches.
For me, it‟s clear that the holistic
process is a matter of everything being
correct. I‟m a mechanic. The pleasure
I get is being a good mechanic. I look
at all of this—one of the things that‟s been going on for thousands of years has been
the attempt to transform the consciousness of human beings, to awaken them, en-
lighten them, whatever the case may be. All of that took place within the context of
the not-self. Therefore, there could never be such results.
Mechanically it‟s clear to me that we can all be correct. That is, we can differentiate.
And differentiation in and of itself is nothing other than awakening. Obviously, in

order for that holistic process to be fulfilled, that there are going to be requirements
in many places, for all the pieces in the puzzle to fit together.
Ra’s Experience in Sedona, Arizona
I can remember my experience of being in Sedona, Arizona, and I have a lot to be
grateful for in that part of my life. It was both a difficult time, and at the same time
it was the foundation and the start of Jovian. But I was incredibly uncomfortable
there. There was no other reason why than that I am a shore person and I have
spent all of my life near water. I was born on an island; I‟ve lived on four different
islands. And it was incredibly difficult. It was difficult on my body. I can remember
getting extremely ill. It was a tough thing. And it was just the environment. And I
could feel myself struggling with the whole process of being in that environment. It
was just not correct for me.
And it wasn‟t like it distorted everything, it doesn‟t. It just means that there are a
lot of forces that have to be dealt with that wouldn‟t have had to have been dealt
with. Nothing one can do about such things. It was a joy for me to return to the
shores. It was immediately different. It‟s not like I live with my feet in the water. It
is about a frequency. It‟s the same thing with valley beings. It is this frequency,
this density, this acoustic environment. And how important this acoustic environ-
ment is, and it says a great deal about, that it is in the valley where the most pro-
found acoustic encounters take place. That is, verbal encounters, sound encounters,
however one wants to describe that.
This is the milieu for a valley being. Obviously, there are going to be variations; the
variations of the Left and the Right in the sense that the Left, as always, is focused
so it is looking for a very specific kind of acoustic frequency. It‟s the kind of person
that doesn‟t like to live right above a bar that‟s open until three in the morning, but
can get by with living a few blocks away—there are variations, obviously.
Where You Can Change the World
But again, it says something so interesting about the nature of these beings, is that
their outer authority, what ultimately can be their outer authority is something that
carries enormous potential in these kinds of environments. And that in the end this
kind of environment is the only way in which you change the world. And that is real-
ly something to grasp. We understand the universalizing principle that lies in the 5s
as a continuity, and the fact that the valley is the place in which the great communi-
ties of the world are established. And it means that if you can transform those that
live in the valley, in essence you change the world.
This is where it‟s all taking place. And of course, we only get to see that within the
not-self. So all of these great centers are centers of media and whatever and they‟re
all producing their own kind of construct out of that not-self and all of that is deeply
influencing everybody else. It‟s like the kind of thing where the major cities of the
world set the tone for how the whole world is going to live, the stock markets, the

PHS Nodal Color 5—Valleys
major political centers, all these kinds of things. All of this is valley business, and it‟s
all very, very acoustic.
Acoustic Conditioning
In other words, this is the place where the word is what you have to be protected
from. Think about it. Let‟s say you‟re a 5th nodal color and you‟re taking a ski lift up
to the top of the mountain on a vacation. The person that you‟re sitting with sud-
denly tells you something very odd, whatever it may be. Boy, are you open to con-
ditioning in that moment, are you ever in the wrong place. That‟s the moment in
which the acoustic conditioning of the other can be devastating.
Now I don‟t mean to be dramatic, you know what I‟m like. It‟s fun to dramatize
these things and give it some verve. Again, it‟s not also to be taken lightly either.
What it‟s really saying is that if you‟re designed for this, if you‟re a 5th color being
you have to be very wary of the kinds of information you take in when you‟re not in
that environment, because that‟s when you are subject to verbal or acoustic condi-
tioning. And it‟s just interesting to think about it from a social context, because the
nodes are always pointing us towards the other. Here is an environment in which
you‟re not going to be conditioned by what the other person says.
And of course, being conditioned by what somebody says is a problem, that‟s a big
problem. Of course, it‟s just one of the things you see that arises out of this, par-
ticularly in the fact that it‟s going to be not-self in the way we see it in the world, so
we see its dysfunction. The other thing is that the vast population explosion that has
taken place in the last 85 to 100 years, the focus of that has been urban. The fact
that that focus has been urban means that for the first time in our history we have
more human beings living in cities than are living in the countryside. That means
that you have an enormous amount of beings that are living in the wrong place, in a
sense.
Again, there are nuances, because there are combinations of lower environments
that fit into valley environments. In the same way you can see how certain internals
can work together you can see how certain externals can work together in terms of
basic environments. But I‟m talking specifically about that person who is carrying
that 5th color, how interesting it is to think about that these are the ones that are so
susceptible to the word, so susceptible to verbal conditioning, deeply susceptible to
it.
Nuances of Valleys
Let‟s deconstruct valley for a moment and talk about nuances of it. It‟s better to be
on the ground floor than to be anywhere else. In other words, this is not about the
mountain where you can be on the top floor. You can have your artificial mountain.
But the same thing is true for valley beings. In other words, the ground floor is real-
ly what it‟s all about for them. To really understand that they need this to really be
connected, they need the pressure to protect them, because it‟s pressure after all.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
They‟re down there on the ground floor and there is all this pressure above them and
there is all the noise, the kids dropping their toys above their head, or whatever else
they have to hear, and they love it. It‟s perfect.
It‟s like if you‟re 5th color and you‟re going to have a business, you put the business
on the ground floor somewhere. If you open up an office you open it up on the
ground floor, whatever the case may be you make sure that you take advantage of
the pressure. The other thing
is that this is one of those
places that you can see that
until you can see the holistic
design, you really don‟t get
the story; you can‟t really get
the story. How does it all
work? After all, it‟s an incred-
ible thing to contemplate.
The knowledge teaches that
the body is the life, and that
the personality is a passenger
that is there to consciously
experience the process. If the
body is the life, the life is
guided by the design cognition, that is, the decision making process which is the
brain system and the way in which it‟s going to take advantage of certain senses.
And at the same time that decision making is going to align the vehicle, is going to
put it in place to be in the right environment. That‟s the construct; to put it all in
place, get it there, put it in the right environment.
This is where we end up with this enormous problem with what‟s there in the design.
Here is somebody that is there to take advantage of the acoustic environment. Here
is somebody that can be at their very best in terms of their relationship with others
when they are using language; in other words, when they are speaking, when they
are using the word, when they are being acoustic. Now mind you, they could be
acoustic musically, as an example. That is one of the possibilities. But the nodes
are about social context, not specifically about creativity unless the design speaks it.
But think about somebody who has this PHS and they have that 5 and they have an
undefined Throat, and they have a personality that doesn‟t see it. You have to un-
derstand that there are all these complexities that come into play. It‟s why the
struggle is always going to be the struggle of the personality to let go. To just let
go. Otherwise, you cannot get to that place.
Making Decisions Out of an Inner Authority Changes Your Life
I understand something very profound for all of you. It‟s not an easy thing. Every
time I take you to another level of the knowledge, what is being imposed on you is
another restriction, in a sense, is another lock that will change your life, because
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

PHS Nodal Color 5—Valleys
that‟s what it does. Making decisions out of an inner authority changes your life.
Eating according to your PHS changes your life. Living in what is the correct envi-
ronment changes your life, because the chances are that you‟re not necessarily
there.
And in the holistic process, not to be there is a deep limitation, because it means
you‟re using up resources that aren‟t necessarily resources that you can replenish.
That you‟re dealing with the resistance, that you‟re losing that advantage in your so-
cial interaction with the other. The advantage is that you remain healthy in that en-
vironment. And as such can be of value to the other.
It‟s quite a thing. I have from the very day that I started on this track, long ago now
for me, I have always said the same thing, over and over again, this knowledge is
for children. It‟s for children who the establishment of ultimately what will be their
environment is something that they will have the correctness and the training to be
able to do. Not that it is imposed on them, not that this is what you have to live or
be, that there is a place for you. And I don‟t mean a specific place as much as I
mean a generic environment, that environment that is for you, that environment
where you will flourish.
Of course, human beings that are going to be raised correctly, this is going to be a
natural thing. I think as we move into 2027 and we have the changing of the cycle,
which is very individual, that we will have children who will leave home much earlier
than has been the case over the last many years, to find the right environment, to
be in the right environment to set the platform for their life. Your purpose unfolds in
these environments. It really does.
After all, everything about the passenger, you can‟t lure the passenger and ask the
passenger to help you fulfill your purpose. You can ask the passenger to just stand
back so you can actually get a glimpse of where you‟re supposed to be and where
you‟re going, because that is what the vehicle is going to give you. This is the thing
to grasp.
And it‟s not intended to be, oh I feel shitty today I‟d better go up into the mountains.
It is about what is natural in differentiation as if you are correct it is all going to be
correct. You are naturally going to be attracted to the environment that is correct
for you, naturally. I don‟t know the depth of anybody‟s sensitivity. I know that
when I first grasped the meaning of this it was all very clear to me. This is the
whole thing about our minds, our personalities, is that they can learn, they do rec-
ognize. It is something to understand about this temple, this incredible thing that is
the vehicle. I mean, wow, it is beyond words for me to describe, because it is every-
thing.
We don‟t experience that way, we experience everything self-reflectively, we expe-
rience it the way we think we experience it. But it‟s the vehicle that makes all that
possible. It‟s the vehicle that really does everything. And for millennia and millennia
and millennia and millennia we have not known what to do. Not at all.

The Connection between the Design and the Monopole
So, we naturally do not go, have not gone, do not end up in those environments; we
don‟t. It‟s like all those strange graveyards you see where thousands of young boys
died in some battle. Boy, in the wrong place. When you look at the holistic being
you go right to the center of them, you go to the G center. It‟s the G that makes all
this possible; the monopole makes it all possible. And this deep, deep value in the
monopole, being a binary holds us together in the illusion of our separateness and
guides us along our line of geometry. And is this theme of this movement, the con-
nection between the design and the monopole is the one connection that has to be
perfected before anything else is possible in this life.
They are responsible for the life. This is the vehicle and the driver. And the only
way in which the vehicle and the driver are one, is when that vehicle is driven to ex-
actly, along exactly, the environmental trail that was intended for it. This is what the
story is.
It‟s nice to know that if you‟re a 5th color that obviously the density of an environ-
ment is something that is very important for you. After all, the valley is the place
where the maia is the densest. This is where you have all of these human forces and
all of their constructs. There is nothing denser. There is the vast array of possibility
potential experience all within the not-self context, all of these human beings, all in
auric contact with each other, millions and millions and millions of them. To walk a
street in any large city, the sound of it, and yet this is the ideal environment for such
beings because this is where they‟re at their best.
Our Relationship with the Other
And this is where they‟re at their best in terms of the other. It‟s like these classic
Hollywood romantic comedies where you have the city couple that yearns to live in
the countryside and go out there and nearly kill each other. It‟s the other side of
being this kind of being. And it‟s not the prosaic valley anymore. It‟s something to
understand. It never was. Yes, if you‟re going to live in the countryside, it‟s better
to live in the valley if you‟re a 5, obviously, to live in the lower terrain where the
pressure is high. But if you‟re living in a house by itself on a little farm down there,
that is not to your advantage. And it is not to your advantage in terms of fulfilling
your destiny, fulfilling the potential of whatever your purpose happens to be.
We cannot fulfill our purpose without the other. It must go through the other. Not
only that, but what we need in terms of what we have to collect experientially in or-
der to fill out the requirements of our purpose, we gain from the other. Our open-
ness is not an accident. These are receptors; we are here to take in all kinds of po-
tential input that ultimately can be a base of wisdom for us. We are here with recep-
tors to tune into the physical vehicles of others, to bond with them, to reproduce
with them, to socialize with them. Our whole life is nothing but the other. And the
only thing that governs the success of our relationship with the other are our design
nodes.

Think about what that means for relationships, if you‟re different in a way that is
constrictive. For example, it‟s very difficult for valley and mountain people, for ex-
ample, to live in the same house unless one of them lives on the bottom floor and
one lives on the top floor, if you know what I mean. There are real differences.
Ideal Relationship is Commonality
This is one of the things—I did it for years. I did all kinds of partnership courses and
I got sick to death of them, because in fact all I was ever doing was explaining how
to survive dysfunction, because the truth is that the ideal of any relationship is
commonality, not difference. Difference is what leads to homogenization and always
has. Of course, it is impractical to try to teach that to humans who are governed by
genes that have a genetic imperative that is rooted in attractiveness. We are not
built that way.
When you hand over your life to your inner authority what you see is that your inner
authority is more and more comfortable with commonality. If you‟re an emotional
being to hang with emotional beings is a lot easier than to be with non-emotional
beings. If you‟re an ego person, it‟s much easier to be with other ego beings than to
be with somebody with an undefined ego. It‟s the same thing with any center in the
way in which it operates.
The fact is this commonality that gives us a way of grasping the potential of each
other in a very deep way. And obviously, if you have two beings that are, let‟s say,
valley beings and you have these two beings that meet and live and work and are
together in that valley, they‟re going to have a positive relationship in terms of both
of them being able to derive what is possible from the other.
I‟m not saying that it‟s a marriage made in heaven, or anything like that, or it even
turns out to be anything remotely like that. I‟m just saying in terms of their rela-
tionship with each other that this is a win-win and that they‟re both in the right envi-
ronment in terms of being able to deal with resistance and not have to be condi-
tioned in their communication with the other human being.
And valley people will naturally want to be part of that communicating world. My
assumption is that if they‟re open Throated and correct I guess you could get it from
the acoustic cultural environment, the clubs, the movies, the crowed places, all of
those things where the acoustic environment is dense, because it‟s really about den-
sity.
An interesting point is that when we see the sensory relationship that lies under-
neath, that one of the things that we don‟t look at very often because it‟s simply the
underlying frequency matrix is that whether you‟re Left or your Right, in the center
of that is the acoustic. There is the sound. So, particularly this is an area in which
everyone, that is, tonally speaking, that every tone has in that sense a possibility for
a kind of flourishing in that dynamic. In other words, the acoustic potential of it is

Introduction to Systems Analysis
heightened so that you have—again, remember that it is about being able to take in
that environment as much as it is about being in it.
In other words, it is about being very sensitive to the acoustic environment—to the
words, to the language, to the “this,” to the “that.” This carries with it a lot of com-
plex social dynamics. Again, one of the most fascinating things for me in these
mega cities that we have in the world like Shanghai or Mexico City, places where you
have 25 or 30 million people living together, it‟s amazing that there is some kind of
civility that can be maintained in that process. And it‟s one of the things about the
valley is that the valley is soaked with distraction, acoustic propaganda, advertising,
sloganeering, all of these kinds of things. It‟s very interesting to think about it in the
broader context of what that environment is all about.
Life is about Joy When You’re Correct
For me it goes back to just the beauty of understanding how wonderful it is to be an
individual and to be lucky enough as an individual to know something about the na-
ture of being. What a horror it is to think of returning to the blindness and the suf-
fering of what my own not-self process was. It is such a pleasure to understand that
as much as the program is not interested in us, there is still a place for us within the
larger program to really be able to live out the perfection of what it is to be us, it is
perfection, to get the pleasure of it, the joy of it, to be able to celebrate it. Other-
wise, it‟s no fun.
Human beings are just serious. They take their lives seriously, they take it all se-
riously. I don‟t mean to be flip when I say that. Life is about joy when you‟re cor-
rect because the pressure is off, the burden is gone, you‟re not responsible any
more, and the moment that you‟re not responsible, life is totally different.
Finding the Gateway to Your Purpose
The moment you take authority away from the mind you change your life, you
change everything. This is the whole point. None of these things that I describe are
things that you need to get to; they are there, they are yours, they belong to you.
It‟s just about allowing them to exist. They belong to you. This was what was in-
tended. This is where you‟re supposed to be. This is where you are going to be able
to find in your relationship with the other the gateway to your purpose. There is no
other way.
Here I am a clarion, sitting alone in my studio by the shore. I get to do my clarion‟s
job. I‟m in the right place and I feel good. It‟s what it‟s about. And there‟s nothing
to do. There isn‟t. It happens. That‟s the beauty of correctness; the beauty of cor-
rectness is that when you‟re following your inner authority what you begin to under-
stand is that it is all there to happen. Just don‟t interfere. Don‟t let your mind inter-
fere, because it‟s a sickness. It is.

I don‟t know how quick the process is if you‟re just following Strategy and Authority,
what it takes to get somebody in their Strategy and Authority to get to that point
where they‟re in the correct environment if they‟re not already. There are circums-
tances in people‟s lives—wives, husbands, children, all kinds of reasons not to leave
a certain place or change one‟s environment or whatever the case may be. There
are all of these things. Life is life.
Being Uncomfortable in the Incorrect Environment
I do know that if you‟re following your PHS that you‟re going to become very uncom-
fortable in your environment if it‟s not correct for you, because it will immediately
bring out the sensitivity, because in fact everything about the enhancement of the
potential of you from the sensory cognitive brain point of view is that it‟s all designed
so that it can be utilized with you in a certain place. They‟re not separate from each
other, they‟re all connected. And if the environment isn‟t supporting what is the po-
tential of the brain system it means that you‟re being conditioning, which means
you‟re already back to the not-self story and forget about what the uniqueness or the
potential of the uniqueness might have been in terms of your particular unique cog-
nition.
It‟s the same thing every time I teach. I always come back to the surface and to the
simple and to the beautiful. Strategy and Authority is so incredible because it takes
away the need to truly grasp all this. You‟re learning to be professionals, it‟s a dif-
ferent thing. That human being that wants their PHS analysis from you—this is not
what you‟re offering them. This is to enrich your own awareness to deepen the re-
source that you have as a teacher, as a guide, as a professional.
Change Your Environment Only through Your Strategy and Authority
It‟s quite a journey to get to this place. And again, there‟s nothing to do. If you look
at your design and you see that you are not in the right environment it is not like
this is a time for you to panic and change it. It will only change when it happens. It
isn‟t going to change any other way. It can‟t be allowed to change any other way. It
has to happen through your Strategy and Authority.
It‟s one of the dilemmas of taking in information, you take in information and your
mind has a natural tendency to want to act on it. Ah, that‟s interesting; we‟re going
to do that. No, no, no. Awareness is: that‟s interesting let‟s see what happens.
That‟s all. Let‟s see what happens. Once it‟s in, it‟s in. It‟s in your system now.
The information is there. You‟re not to do anything. And oh, so much better that
you don‟t so that you can watch and you can see.
The only way in which you‟re going to enrich at the deepest level of your process is
when you can stand back and be a witness of your design, to really see it at work.
You‟re beginning to get the whole picture now. We‟ve looked at the internal; we‟re
nearly done for the basics of the external. We have a whole view here. And each
and every one of us has our deeply unique configuration. It‟s something to watch.

The moment that they‟re aligned together, this establishes the foundation for the po-
tential of the personality. It opens up the possibility for awakeness; it opens up the
possibility of the real differentiation, the final holistic differentiation on the surface.
It all comes back to cognition. It comes back to your good fortune on the fractal
line, because that‟s what it really is.
But anyway, if you happen to be a valley person go enjoy that ground floor, noisy,
wonderful conversation and good for you. And if you‟re not a valley person and
there is a problem, it‟s just so interesting, we all have our place. And all we have to
do is allow ourselves to get there. And we will. We will get there. That‟s the whole
point. That in the end is everything. You complete the holistic process.
I love this way of being able to see that these are all sort of like bodies in a way for
me. It‟s like the nodal color for me; each color is a different kind of body. It‟s anoth-
er kind of aura in a sense. It isn‟t, I‟m just trying to find a metaphor, and I‟m not
doing very well with it, but anyway. It really is sort of like the overcoat. And
whether that overcoat fits for you or not, whether it‟s the right thing for your body,
it‟s so perfect, each of these environments for what we are physically, the difference
that it makes when you are in the right environment.
Again, that‟s the whole story because in the end what it does is that it means by the
time you get to your Kiron you have your vitality, you have what you need to be able
to fulfill what is the intended Uranian process. And you have the quality of life that
goes with it, the maintenance of the well-being of the form. And all of that, as a re-
sult of being able to deal with the other in an environment that is nurturing and
beneficial to you; great stuff.

PHS Nodal Color 6: Shores
The Difference between the Observer and the Observed
Ok, welcome to our final stage in looking at the basis of these nodal colors, and ob-
viously we‟re going to be looking at shores today. I didn‟t answer you in the ques-
tion period, Martin, because it‟s something that is better served being here in the
classroom, these two terms (observer/observed). We‟re dealing with two different
things. We‟re just dealing with a fundamental keynote of the Left and the Right.
And a fundamental keynote of the Left and the Right in the sense of the way in which
they need to integrate in the social dynamic that‟s there in the external. In other
words, everything we understand about the nodes is that the nodes are establishing
the way in which we are going to interact with the other.
So, in understanding this and understanding the benefits of these environments as
we have been looking at them, if you are the observed, what basically that means is
that this is the active principle. In other words, that here is somebody that is totally
absorbed in their process. They are not looking at anybody else‟s process. This is
really absorption. In a sense, it‟s focus and lack of focus. If you‟re looking at the
Right and you‟re looking at the observer, basically what you‟re looking at is simply
what we‟ve seen all along with the Right is that it is this openness and waiting for
the other. It is the resource of taking things in. Here is this resource, in that sense,
of taking things in.
The advantage in the social environment if you are Right is that you keep your eyes
open and in that sense unfocused, this is the way in which you take in the necessary
information. But at the same time if you are Left that is not the way that you‟re
there to work. In other words, though it may be the environment for you socially,
you‟re there for your own agenda, and only for your own agenda. And it is others
that see you and watch you. This is the difference between the observed and the
observer.
It really has to do with the way in which one approaches the social environment.
The Left approaches the social environment with their own particular process, their
agenda, and the Right is intended to enter into the social environment without any
agenda, simply that that environment is “interesting.” For the Left there always
seems to be a need for something to do in the environment, something to do within
the social context. The Left doesn‟t just like to sit around. They would prefer to
have a social interaction while they are doing something; whereas, the Right is very
happy to sit around.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
So, within that context it‟s very much connected to what are the active and passive
principles that we‟ve already seen in terms of the design internal. And here you see
the active and passive principle as it is expressed within the social dynamic. In other
words, being seen—observed—is an advantage for the Left. In that sense, this is the
way in which they make an impression within the social dynamic. Being the observ-
er is the way for the Right. This is the way they assess the other within the context
of the social dynamic. And of course, as we well know with the Right that it is the
social context that makes such a huge difference in their life process. That is, it is
the other ultimately that allows them to fulfill their potential by tapping into them as
a resource.
Shores: Transition
But let‟s take a look now at our journey here and we get to this very strange place,
we get to shores. I say very strange place—it‟s been a wonderful serendipity, by the
way, over the last six weeks because I have been doing the lines as role models in
Rave Cosmology and I have been doing the colors here in terms of this whole pro-
gression of going upwards from the 1 to the 6. It is fascinating to see the continuity
in these themes. All the 1s that I‟ve been looking at during the week, all the 2s that
I look at during the week, now the 6s.
It‟s all about transition. It‟s always like that. This is what 6s are about. If there is
any that encapsulates the concept of the 6 it is this fundamental keynote that we get
with the 6th line that this is a line of transition. Within this context what is this par-
ticular environment? It is something to grasp that though it says shores and our

Nodal Color 6—Shores
immediate connotation to that is lakeside, riverside, seaside, oceanside, whatever
you want to say. And obviously, there is certainly a quality to that, there is no ques-
tion.
But this is its oldest manifestation. That is, a manifestation in that sense that was
going to be the healthy environment for those beings. What‟s very important to un-
derstand about shores is that you have to think about it in the context of transition.
In other words, the seashore, as an example, is this transition between this boun-
dary between what is the landscape and what is the seascape. It is a transition
point. It is a place of change.
Everything about the 6 is that it‟s looking for the next place to go. It needs to have
the perspective of the next place to go, that next place that is somehow different
from where it is. In other words, it has to see the potential of transition, and being
in environments that provide the potential of transition this is something that is so
incredibly healthy for a 6th color nodal being.
But think about all the shores. The plain that leads into a forest—there is a line be-
tween the plain and the forest. That line between the plane and the forest is a tran-
sition place. In other words, the shore, if you‟re living on the tree side you‟re living
by the shore of the plain. If you‟re on the plain side you‟re living by the shore of the
forest.
It‟s the same thing with suburbia and the distinction of being not in the city, but on
the edge of the city, or on the shore of the city, just outside of the city limits; this
kind of thing. It can be between mountains and valleys, it could be between certain
neighborhoods, particularly if there is a big difference between them.
In other words, it is a very specific place of transition, a very, very specific place of
transition. It says something about what it is to be a 6. It‟s one of the things that is
so fascinating about it. I went through quite a process in my first ten years in really
trying to grasp the personality in these lines, the quality that is in there, the hook
that‟s in them. They all have their hooks, they all have their thing.
For me the 6th line has always been embodied in the 19.6, that is, the fool on the
hill. I know that the traditional seven-centered 6th line theme is inherent in the 10.6
where you see the binary between the first part of the life and the second part of the
life and the potential of the hypocrisy in all of that. But for me the fool on the hill
really captures the essence of the 6. And it is the fool on the hill, the village is down
below, there is this transition place, and of course, this image of being on the hill,
the top of the roof and all this stuff. It‟s a nice image. But it is a transition place. It
is a very different kind of environment.
And herein lies the key for 6th line beings, is that they need to have in their life the
tension of a different environment that is close to them. And that is a key for them.
This different environment is fascinating, because let‟s say you have somebody who
is a forest person. They love the forest, they live in the forest and they live near
where the forest meets the plains and meets farmland country, as an example. And
somebody comes up to them in the forest and says to them, what‟s over there,

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
what‟s it like over there. They are the ones who live on the shore that are always
asked about what‟s on the other side. It‟s their role in life. And they‟re the ones
that have a sense of it. It‟s part of being a 6. They have a sense of this transition.
Though they live in the forest they have walked on the plain. It‟s transition, it‟s
nearby.
I live on the land but I walk into, on occasion, the sea. It‟s there, it‟s the transition
place and you get a sense of it. It‟s not like you‟re living on the sea and you really
understand the sea and do the other way around, have your little steps onto the
land. But it is the hook in the 6 that everyone assumes that they can be trusted in
terms of their perspective. This is the inherent trust that comes with being a 6. It‟s
why when 6s lose trust with the other it can be devastating and it can be devastating
for both of them, because this is what we look for in the 6.
When we see this particular environment, this transition environment this is the
place where all the great questions are asked. It‟s just interesting. What comes af-
ter this life? What is death? And on and on and on, all kinds of questions where you
stand on one shore, the beauty of the River Styx, you stand on one shore and you
look across. What‟s there? What is it? What do I have to do? What is the afterlife?
What is hell? What is heaven? What is this, what is that, blah, blah, blah—shores.
What‟s the city like if you‟re a country person. How are you going to keep them
down on the farm after they‟ve seen Paris? The shore carries such great temptation.
Of course, it speaks about the kinds of beings that you meet. If you‟re living out the
correctness of your trajectory, what you meet on the shore are people looking for
transition. That‟s what they‟re looking for. And they‟re looking to you for an answer
because you are the role model. One of the most interesting things about the social
dynamic of the 6th node is that there is no social dynamic. There isn‟t. They are not,
in that sense, at the shore to meet the other. They aren‟t. They are at the shore to
fulfill themselves, literally, nothing else.
Natural/Artificial Shores
You can see, of course, that we have this quality, that is, when we look at the Left
and we look at the Right we have the natural and artificial and I don‟t think it takes a
brain surgeon to figure this one out. Obviously, natural shores are really natural di-
viding lines between environments; so, the forest and farm, as an example.
Artificial shores would be the suburbia outside of the city limits, as an example. In
other words, shores, transition points that have been created by human effort, by
human whatever. It‟s the kind of thing, for example, it can very, very nuanced. You
can be on the edge of what is fundamentally a business section and you‟re at the be-
ginning of what becomes a domestic section, houses or whatever. In other words,
there are all kinds of artificial dividing lines between very different kinds of environ-
ments. You just have to pay attention to see these lines. They are all over the
place.

Again, the natural ones are obvious ones; they are transitions in natural environ-
ments. And one of the things about the natural environment is that one of the com-
pensations is to live in places where there are radical shifts in season. That‟s also
interesting in that it‟s
very satisfying for the 6th
node to be on the edge of
environmental change.
My kids always make fun
of me, I‟m a 6 design
node, because I‟m forever
talking about when the
first day of summer is or
when the first day of
spring is, not that it
means anything within
that context of Ibiza, it
doesn‟t, and they sort of
look at me as this odd
person. But it‟s some-
where in the psyche to
have this. Shores bring
that out. It is just one of those things.
The End of the Cycle
So, it is something that is very, very interesting to think about what this environ-
ment is all about. I‟ve taught it for years and years now that the cycle that we are in
is coming to an end. What is going to emerge in 2027 is the end of heresy. That is,
it is the end of the 5th line system. And the 5th line system, of course, is the hereti-
cal call and it is a seduction. It is a seduction of conditioner and conditioned.
This is the way in which humanity has been guided for several thousand years, in
this very profound conditioning mode. I see myself as the end of that. In so many
ways I am an apostate. I certainly see the horror of seduction and at the same time
use it. I cannot escape being what I am, I am a heretic. In order to introduce
knowledge in the world I have had to use all the powers of a heretic to be able to do
so. Regardless of the fact that what I teach is to break away from the heretical path.
In other words, not to need to be called, but to be able to operate according to your
own authority which denies the need for any kind of universal call, that each of us
has a right to a unique call.
We are pointed towards a new age, truly a new age, without that being a cliché.
We‟re moving towards what is a 6th line opening of a cycle. One of the major themes
of my work since I introduced Human Design was to try to get across the vulnerabili-
ty of the 6th line in the profile, to understand that it is deeply mutative, that it is the
bedrock of the transition that is taking place, that it has opened up the new Uranian
lifestyle, that it is transforming the process of human maturity, it‟s changing so many

Introduction to Systems Analysis
things about what we are. This is all part of the deep transitional quality that is
there in the 6.
The Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix Era
And we‟re entering into an era, the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix era, which will
open with the 6th line phase. So, when we‟re looking at the 6th line, when we‟re
looking at the archetypal theme of the 6th line, which is the role model, the role
model has a process. The process is to be engaged in two different ways. You see
them here, in essence—the observer/observed. That is, it is the process of the 6 to
be engaged. Either to be engaged in the sense that they operate with their own
agenda but they are constantly impacted and conditioned by the other, the 3rd line
phase. And then they operate as an aloof observer. And as operating as that aloof
observer, they‟re engaged in the process of assessing the other.
But there is a third phase, the so-called off-the-roof phase, and it is this phase that
this is really all about, because the 6, if it is anything—the 19.6 expresses a beautiful
image, but the 55.6 tells the truth. And the truth is that this is about divine selfish-
ness, and I mean divine selfishness. That is, the complete focus on one‟s own au-
thority, nothing else, which means that one is not engaged.
Social Connections
After all, Human Design and the revelation of Human Design is all about getting hu-
man beings to the point that they can operate according to the role model of the 6;
in other words, that all human beings are able to live by their own authority. Now,
obviously we know that is not going to be the universal case. But nonetheless, this
is what it‟s all about and this is the model. Something to grasp about these beings
that are nodal 6 beings, is that there is for them a social environment in which the
social connection isn‟t what is of value to them, but it is absolutely necessary for
them in order to fulfill whatever their purpose happens to be. In other words, within
that dynamic there is absolutely no social need for the other. This is not a social
mechanism at all. There is an imperative to be available. This is the imperative.
I am deeply impressed, if I can put it that way, with nodal knowledge, what it really
means, what it really brings to the general understanding. How incredible it has
been for me to be able to understand myself socially and to be able to do so not by
the way in which I generally present that, because it seems in its own way obvious
on the surface, that is, I‟m integration and an ego Manifestor and a tight aura, and
blah, blah, blah. But at the same time I have very, very specific social and tribal ac-
tivations, like having the 12 or having the 40 or having the 49, whatever the case
may be, or collective activations like the 33, which are all about social interaction
and the sharing of information with the other.
If I look at the potential that is there in the BodyGraph there is always this part that
says, well, but there is that social potential that‟s there. But not when I look at my
design nodes. When I look at my design nodes it‟s very obvious to me how that

works. It‟s not about whether I like people or not, because that is not the point. I
enjoy the people that are in my life, I enjoy my students, and I enjoy seeing them
when I get a chance to see them. It isn‟t anything about not caring or liking them.
It‟s just so obvious to me that I am there with them for something that has nothing
to do with being social. It is, if anything, secondary or tertiary.
It is simply that this is what the 6th node does. It puts you in a place where that is
the consequence. And the consequence of that is that somebody is coming up to
you and saying, by the way, do you know what it‟s like over there where the fields
are. This is what happens to the role model, this is how they become a trusted lead-
er force when in fact they‟re not about leading at all, they are about pointing.
They‟re about pointing the way. They‟re about guiding the other. And guiding the
other obviously out of their unique outer authority, whatever that outer authority
happens to be.
For example, for somebody who is going to have a 6th node, it is not going to be
easy for them to be able to find a viable partner. It‟s not an easy thing at all, be-
cause the fact is that the moment that they are correct is the moment that they
don‟t have the same kind of attachment to the people around them, whether that
attachment is physical, emotional, sexual, whatever you want to call it, it is very dif-
ferent.
In other words, that difference is something that supports the selfishness that is in-
herent in this, and it‟s really selfish. It really is. That‟s the future. The most impor-
tant thing about Strategy and Authority is that it belongs to our grandchildren as the
armor that‟s going to carry them through their world. I know from my own expe-
rience in having told people things, I can remember what it was like in the early
years telling people about the seven year experience when very few people had had
a couple of months, how hard it was to grasp what that can be. I want to tell you.
And hopefully you‟ll all survive to see it, 2027, when the cycle changes.
The Cross of Planning: Support
We‟ve had a background frequency that has been consistent for over 400 years, well
not quite 400 years, since the beginning of the 1600‟s. We don‟t know any other
background frequency. We‟re used to it, generation after generation. All nine-
centered beings that have ever lived have lived during the Cross of Planning. Our
entire nine-centered history has all taken place during the Cross of Planning. Every-
thing that embodies the modern way of life, all has taken place during this Cross of
Planning.
And the Cross of Planning binds us in an extraordinary way through the 37 and the
40, this bond of support. Circuit keynotes are some of the most profound keynotes
in design. Support—all nine-centered beings have been raised in a frequency of
support. The strength of communities, the city-state, the nation state, the united
nations, the this and that, all of this in the Cross of Planning.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
2027, Ides of February, the wheel turns and it brings the Sleeping Phoenix. It brings
three gates of deep individuality—the 55, the 20/34, and the 59. Everything is going
to change. The background frequency—for those of us who have grown up in, been
raised in, are descendents of only Cross of Planning beings, boy are we ever going to
notice it. And you‟re going to notice it in the world. And you‟ll notice the shift in the
frequency first. It‟s not like everything takes place when we cross a line, we all know
that. We‟re talking about evolution.
The Future is about the Individual
But I want you to grasp something; there will be no support mechanism for heretics.
The future is about the individual. This is the counterpoint. I hope you see this be-
cause you have these two strains that are running through the nine-centered being.
You have the human strain and you have the rave strain. And they‟re running paral-
lel with each other now. And when you get to 2027, they‟re going to go like this. In
other words, they‟re going to break out of their parallelism and they‟re going to
move towards extremes. The human extreme is the identity and authority of self,
the fulfillment of unique individual authority; because it is the only way they‟ll sur-
vive. And of course, for the rave it will be the exact opposite. It will be complete
surrender to a non-identity involvement.
This is the divide that emerges slowly, but it does. And the clock, the wheel turns on
that point. And you have to see that it is here by the shore, in that sense, that it‟s
all laid out. That each human being has to be ready to be prepared for transition
and the transition away from the Cross of Planning, the transition to the Cross of the
Sleeping Phoenix. And it will be a major transition.
Obviously, for us it will simply be the end of our process and we will notice those
changes. But for our children, our grandchildren and beyond, it will be a different
world. They will never know the Cross of Planning. They will never quite understand
how we managed to hold cities, states, world-wide organizations, all of these things
together. You have to see that this is something that is going to bring a radical
change.
Human Design is not just a thing for the moment. It wasn‟t given just for the mo-
ment, because the moment itself meant nothing. It has taken 20 years just to build
a basic foundation of the knowledge. It will take as long as I live to fulfill at least the
fundamentals of the nuances of where this knowledge goes. But it‟s for the future.
It‟s for children. That these children are educated, and they are educated with the
basics that they have a right to have, that every single child has a right to be treated
with respect, to be fed correctly. And to be given the opportunity to understand who
they are. It‟s as important as reading and writing and anything else. It is the fun-
damental thing that needs to be trained into any child. And these are children that
have to be raised this way.
I see it now, I see it happening now. There are lots of Human Design babies around,
bless their little hearts. They‟re being raised and fed correctly. And this is going to
make an enormous difference in their lives. But what we teach in our work is the

basic truth and the basic equipment necessary for human life to survive in a chang-
ing future.
We can‟t see it now. We‟re still held by the Cross of Planning. No matter how close
we seem to be coming to the edge, we‟re still in it. We can see the decay, we can
see the problems, but we‟re still in it. And as a background frequency it deeply con-
trols our way of life. It‟s all going to change.
The Transitional Environment
So, here when we‟re looking at this 6th tone, it is expressing this environment, this
transitional environment. There in that transitional environment where the 6th tone
being can fulfill its potential. And its potential is fulfilled that it is in that environ-
ment that fractally they‟re going to have those beings in their life that will need their
guidance. It is how they fulfill themselves. And that they are only going to be suc-
cessful in that role if what
they express is their outer
authority, what they know
about the transition from this
to that. It‟s everything I
teach. Wherever you look in
my teaching you will see
transition, how to go from
this to that, how to go from
the not-self to the true self,
and on and on and on.
It is about crossing that line;
it is about being able to see
what‟s on the other side, the
beauty of the 6th line as the
roof of the house with this tremendous perspective that you can‟t have on the 1st
floor. It‟s wonderful. I have that at my home. On the 1st floor there is a huge orc-
hard around me, I can‟t see anything except the trees. And then I go upstairs and I
look right over them, and it‟s a different world. This transition is something that is
so different.
Of course, one of the things that we can see is that it creates cool bodies socially and
often misunderstood. In other words, often not really grasped for what it is. This is
not about being open to conditioning in any way. This is not about being open to the
other, receptive of the other. It is simply being a point of transition for the other.
Comment: Like learning how to swim.
Yeah, like learning how to swim.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
Resistance is Eliminated in Your Correct Environment
It‟s always nice to be able to talk about what it is and what it can be, but we know
what it‟s not. The not-self is everything. The not-self vehicle is a damaged vehicle.
If you‟re not following the Strategy and Authority of your design cognition of your
internal, there is no way you‟re going to be aligned in your external to the environ-
ment that is correct for you. And the fact is that anyone simply entering into the
process, that it may take them a full seven years if they do not know this, to natural-
ly align to an environment that is correct for them.
Remember what these environments bring. This is the environment in which your
relationship with the other allows you to maintain your integrity. It does. It reduces
the resistance, the resistance is so beneficial. That‟s what the environment is for.
And you eliminate resistance and you add to the quality of life, you add to the health
in that life. If you have a 6th node body, you‟re not intended to have those kinds of
social relationships. It goes against what it is to be a 6th color body. It just does.
It‟s for something else.
Of course, to be aligned to that, because that is the environment, also means that
that very environment, that the moment that you have this 6th color being aligned to
what is their environment that you put them by the shore whether natural or artifi-
cial, that‟s the moment that their social life begins to fall apart. It just would, be-
cause that‟s not healthy for them environmentally.
We are all very different. As we move through this process, next week I‟m going to
begin showing you how to synthesize the combination of the internal and the exter-
nal so that we can begin to put these two factors together so that we have a holistic
view of the design process. Obviously, there is this deep difference that lies in each
of us, that just the nuances of what it is to be a nodal 6, what does it mean, in that
sense, the themes that are there underneath, the tonal themes, what impact is the
cognition in those particular states.
The other thing is that nodes are different. They‟re just plain different. These are
not objects. These are not filtering planets. This is stellar input. It is a totally dif-
ferent kind of information. And nodal information is the only information that we get
that is tied specifically to the precession of the equinox. What I mean by that is the
nodal movement is mostly retrograde. It does a dance, one step forward, two steps
back, so it‟s always retrograde, in that sense.
Through Nodes One Adapts to the Change in Environment
The precession of the equinox runs retrograde. In other words, it is the nodes that
tie us to a larger process and in essence it is our nodal information that is very much
tied to the epoch or the time that we are living in. It is through your nodes that you
adapt to the change in environment, is basically my point. In other words, the adap-
tation to the transformation that will take place when the cycle changes in 2027, this
is something that can be handled by the environment, nodally. The nodes are much

better prepared for the larger turning of the wheel than the Sun/Earth is, which is
locked into its solar perspective, the solar system perspective, the planetary pers-
pective. It‟s very different.
So, if we‟re not aligned correctly environmentally, then it means that this coming era
is an era that can be very, very uncomfortable. It‟s why this information will be so
important. Survival is going to be a major theme, obviously. The moment you
move away from the Cross of Planning you move away from cooperative survival.
And remember I showed you that that parallelism is really going to go extreme. It is
going to be more and more difficult to be able to organize groups to be able to pro-
vide for survival. You‟re going to have a total change from the way in which that
whole process was developed communally in the seven-centered being. You know,
the village, the farming village and all of these things.
The Key to Survival is to be in the Right Place
We‟re moving far away from that. We are moving into an era in which the only way
that survival can be guaranteed is that you know what to do to survive. And the key
to survival is to be in the right place. You can be the best hunter in the world, but if
you‟re in the wrong place, you‟re not going to catch anything and you‟re going to go
hungry. It doesn‟t matter who the hell you are and what your gifts are, if you‟re not
in the right place you don‟t get your life and you don‟t get the bonuses. It‟s all about
where you are.
This fantastic thing of understanding that we are objects moving in space, if we are
objects moving in space, our line of movement is so special to us. Where we are at
any given time dictates the quality of our lives, dictates who is there, dictates
whether or not we are going to be able to operate in that environment in a way that
is beneficial to us.
Yes, it‟s wonderful what we have learned about the internal, isn‟t it. It‟s wonderful to
be able to see that the homogenization of the brain system is something that can be
alleviated that we can eat properly, that we can have a proper digestive system, that
we can nurture what is our differentiation, but you have to be in the right place. You
have to be on the right line. Now, there is no separation really. This is deconstruc-
tion. You can‟t have one without the other. It is all part of the calculation of the de-
sign, the nodes are there and the Sun/Earth is there. But it is this awareness of the
correctness of your form, and the nurturing of your form by insisting that it operates
in environments that are healthy for it. It makes all the difference. It does.
I can really tell the difference. Physically one of the most difficult periods for me was
when I was living in Arizona. It was the first time in forever that I had lived in a
place that had no water. There was no real water—no seashore, no lakes, no noth-
ing. There was a river once in awhile, but it was a very, very different environment,
and there was no real transition for me in that environment. It was very unhealthy
for me. That is, I could feel its unhealthiness. I went through a period where it was
very, very taxing on me physically.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
I was born on an island; I‟ve lived on many islands, and have lived on an island now
for decades. Not only do I live on an island, the shore to the sea, not only do I have
that transition, but I live in the countryside just outside of the village, another area
of transition. There are all of these shores that are there. And the by-product of
that is the well-being of my form. That‟s the by-product. My standing joke with my
mother is that I‟m going to see if I can do her better. She turns 96 next month and
I assume if you live in the right environment it will really work. By the way, she‟s
mountain and she lives on the top floor of a high-rise, which I thought was really
cute.
Strategy and Authority Will Get You Where You Have to Be
But anyway, this is something to see about this whole nodal environment, how sig-
nificant it is for us. Now again, I have this same dilemma with PHS in the way in
which I try to present that. That is, the fact that you see what your nodal environ-
ment happens to be and you look at your own environment and you see there are
problems in all of that, that there is a conflict or that it‟s not correct or whatever the
case may be.
It‟s not like you can just jump; it isn‟t about that. It has to come out of your author-
ity. And it has to be something that you‟re ready to trust, because after all, this is
the whole thing about the dilemma of the mind. The mind has to be able to trust the
authority of the vehicle. You have to be ready for that. Most minds aren‟t ready for
that until they have had years and years and years of seeing that the vehicle does
know what it‟s doing and that everything is ok.
But it‟s something to understand that this is something to enter into with real deep
correctness. Because of course, it‟s going to change many things in your life. All of
the deeper levels of this knowledge provide radical refinements to lifestyle. In Hu-
man Design it began with sleeping in your own bedroom. And then you get PHS and
it says basically most of us should eat alone, because in the end it‟s the easiest way
to comply with your dietary requirements. And of course that creates its social di-
lemmas.
And there is the nodal environment in which those people who are going to be con-
nected to you are unique to the environment that you belong to. In other words,
you may have dislocation in terms of your relationships with others and your pre-
vious environment and so forth and so on, you may have to go through the process
of a whole new alignment to different people in your life. There are all kinds of
things that come with entering into that correct environment that have social conse-
quences based on the way in which the homogenized world lives.
You can see that step-by-step everything that I teach you is about fulfilling all of the
possibilities of your uniqueness. That‟s the magic here. We are so different from
each other. And that means that we have very, very different needs, special needs
to enhance our potential in this life, to protect us, to make us healthy, to increase
our sensory power, to put us in the environment where we have the proper kinds of
connections with the other; all those things.

Nodal Color 6—Shores
It‟s all about establishing your uniqueness. Every aspect carries that. The magic on
the design side is that Strategy and Authority ultimately will take you there. This is
the great blessing of it. Sooner or later it will eventually get you where you have to
be because you‟re making the right decisions. In the end, the problem is always the
same. The problem is the mind and what the mind thinks. And it is the mind that
can be disturbed by the development of the uniqueness, because it has its precon-
ceived homogenized notions about the nature of who they are and what the other is
and who the other should be and all of these things.
It‟s why it‟s so perfect when it‟s for children. For us, even when we‟re dealing with
those beings in our lives that we know are not-self it is still not something that is
easy for us to just simply dismiss them. It‟s not their fault. We have connections to
other beings that result out of conditioning, bloodlines, communities, and jobs,
whatever. And out of that comes all kinds of dependencies and needs of those rela-
tionships and the rules of them and the morality of them, our relationship with fami-
ly, with friends, with colleagues, with all of it.
And all of those connections to the other, they are deeply rooted in homogenized
patterns. And in those homogenized patterns you cannot express your uniqueness.
You cannot say I want to sleep in my own bed without upsetting somebody. Not
everybody, but most. It can seem to the homogenized mind that this is rejection,
that this is a lack of love, caring, warmth, this, that, and on and on and on and on.
When you say to somebody no, I don‟t want to go out to restaurants anymore be-
cause it‟s really not good for me, there are social consequences to being yourself.
As much as people claim that they like uniqueness, because they do, they claim it,
you like the famous people that stand out of the crowd, what you don‟t get to see
are all those famous people who stand out of the crowd are a homogenized group.
Human beings are uncomfortable with uniqueness; they don‟t know what to do.
They lose their footing. They can get very upset. They can be very angry inside.
Not necessarily knowing why.
It‟s like how dare you not be like the rest of us. And you‟re not. One thing is ob-
vious to me is that to stand alone takes courage. To live by your own authority
takes courage. It‟s just a word. After all, this is all choiceless. But it is a strength
that is necessary, this strength to be able to see that the other, despite everything
that the other cannot really help you in your process, that you have to do it. And if
they cannot accept you, if they cannot fit into what is correct for you, then you have
to look very carefully at what matters in your life.
For me nothing would ever stand between me and awareness, nothing. This is what
it‟s all about. It doesn‟t matter what this or that is as relationships, or this or that,
or whatever. If those relationships are of any value, that value will be seen in
awareness. That ultimately those that do not grasp what has become of you may in
time see that this is something that they would like to have happen to them.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
Each of these steps, from the beginning of Strategy and Authority to entering into
PHS to aligning yourself to the environment nodally that is correct for you, each of
these are a step in the fulfillment of the potential of establishing the platform of con-
sciousness, because that‟s what it is. It‟s the platform of consciousness. It‟s out of
this that everything happens. Your mind arises out of this as a by-product. Your
way of looking at the world arises out of this as a by-product, the essence of your
life. To set the design foundation to finally fully, completely honor the form is to lay
the foundation for mind transformation, the awakening, the potential awakening of
the mind.
I‟ve been at this a long time and like Alok says up there, I‟ve been telling people that
they have never been themselves for a very long time. And now, after all of these
years there are an awful lot of people who are working very hard at being them-
selves, and it is a beautiful counterpoint. That‟s the magic. I don‟t mind playing a
heretic for you as long as you get to the point that your authority is more important
than mine. That your authority in guiding your life, your truth, this is the only thing
that matters. This is the end of the line, folks. It‟s the last shot at the prize, so en-
joy it.
Anyway, so much for shores; I‟m going to enjoy mine. I hope you enjoy yours, and
nice to meet you along the way. Do take care. I hope it‟s entertaining. Until next
week; we‟re going to have some fun next week. Until then, bye for now.

PHS Synthesis: Left / Left
All right, let‟s get down to some interesting things, and this is what‟s going to take
us to the close of this year, is taking a look at PHS synthesis. And what I mean by
PHS synthesis is that we are going to be looking at the combination on the design
side of the Sun/Earth internal and the nodal external. This is the Left/Left that is be-
ing referred to here in that sense. We‟re going to obviously have four variations that
we are going to look at in terms of this process. Let‟s open it up.
The Graph
We have one of these—graphs are fun. I hope you enjoy this one. But anyway, this
is a fairly direct graphic way of being able to link the two of them together, so here
we are looking at the design internal, so we‟re looking at the Sun/Earth so obviously
we have running through here we have our basic color structure of the internal. We
have the Left value that is attached to it, so that Left value going down on the Left

Introduction to Systems Analysis
side here. Then we move over and we have the design external, that is, the nodes.
So we have the colors and their keynotes. We have the Left keynote in terms of the
orientation to the tone and on top of that, because we are dealing with PHS and
we‟re dealing with the form, we‟re also dealing with the groups themselves—the ri-
gid, the energetic, the sensitive—in terms of the binary.
All in all, it is a deeply, deeply complex graphing. There is an enormous amount of
information that is in here. And of course, there are other things, that is, the coun-
terpoint between circumstance, and landscape conditions and hardscape. In other
words, there are all these variations that are there that we have been looking at in-
dependently in the deconstruction. But here we are beginning to look at the founda-
tion of what we‟re working on in terms of programming in Maia Mechanics, that is,
Advanced Imaging where we‟re going to be able to look at the primary four aspects.
That is, the internal/external, both design and personality in order to have the foun-
dation for what is a holistic perspective on the being.
So, here we‟re going to look at it strictly in the context of the PHS and we‟re going to
look at it in terms of the vehicle itself. What does it mean, to begin with, that we are
dealing with Left/Left? Obviously, this is significant. It‟s significant in the sense that
it is an extreme. In other words, we‟re going to see that the Left/Right, Right/Left
are more balanced in a sense; whereas, the Left/Left and the Right/Right are ex-
treme. And I don‟t mean that to be a negative. I just mean that there is an imbal-
ance, let‟s put it that way. If you‟re Left/Left you are imbalanced to one side. If
you‟re Right/Right you‟re imbalanced to the other side. The Left/Right, Right/Left‟s
there is a balance in that. And that balance, by the way, is an interesting thing be-
cause it brings certainly from the nodal perspective much more social ease. But I‟ll
get to that.
The Left Brain
Let‟s start with the surface, and the surface within the context of Human Design this
is always the best place to be, it‟s always the easiest place to grasp. You have a Left
brain, to begin with. What we‟ve learned about the Left brain is that the Left brain is
active. That is, this is an active brain system. And because it is an active brain sys-
tem we know that if you have poor nutrition it is going to have an impact on the way
in which your brain is going to operate because an active brain demands a great deal
of energy. It is going to demand more energy than the passive brain, that is, the
Right brain that we have looked at.
So the first thing is that this is an active system which means it‟s a very, very busy
system. Now, this busyness is oriented towards the capacity to be able to survive.
Everything about Left brain orientation is its fixation on survival. When we look at
the makeup of the tonal infrastructure of the left, the majority of that, two-thirds of
the input, is strictly concerned through the splenic binary with survival mechanisms.
And in fact, even the third, because in fact what it‟s developing is a visual cortex that
will enhance the capacity far beyond smell and taste to be able to provide this intrin-
sic survivability.

PHS Synthesis Left / Left
So what we know about the Left is that it‟s deeply oriented towards survival. What
does that actually mean? If you take Darwin‟s principle, and I am a Darwinian fan, if
you take Darwin‟s principle it is clear that everything related to the Left ultimately
involves competition; in other words, survival of the fittest. There is an ongoing
competition. What‟s interesting about this competition is that it leads to what‟s
possible beyond survival. All mammals, as an example, have the basic tools for sur-
vival. And they are satisfied with what they have. And they will not try to take more
than they need, and so forth and so on. There is a restraint inherent in them that is
not visible in us. And it is this deeply, deeply competitive brain, because that‟s what
it is, it is a deeply competitive brain that is trying to ensure that it can survive, but
ensure that it doesn‟t even have to concern itself with survival. That, in and of itself,
is an evolutionary revolution.
The Internal 3rd Color
What we know about the Left is that if we see it within the—we can only see it in the
sense of the internal color in terms of what is, for example, the individual‟s particular
activation. Let‟s take the case of somebody that is an internal 3rd color and they are
Left, as we have here in this particular configuration. In other words, what we know
about this active system is that the brain is taking away the potential power of the
stomach to create the kind of heat that it needs to digest properly. In other words,
one of the things to recognize about dietary orientation is that it‟s always orientation
that leads to a benefit in the way in which the brain system works. In other words,
the energy necessary to be able to run this active Left brain is energy that is tapped
away and is still inefficient in being able to provide the heat necessary for the diges-
tive process.
So, the moment that this being is following their condition and their condition ob-
viously is that everything that they eat has to be above room temperature is the
moment that they are no longer losing energy from their brain system, which main-
tains a higher level of activity which means that other possibilities of information can
be accessed. There is less mental fatigue. Mental fatigue is something that is inter-
esting. If you are under nourishing your brain, mental fatigue is something that
eventually leads to just simply not engaging oneself mentally, something you see in
the homogenized world all the time.
The Internal: Establishes Our Best Potential
Of course, the moment that you move away from just looking at the internal, what
we know is that the internal establishes our best potential. That‟s what it‟s for. It
establishes our best potential so that when we go out into the world we can be com-
petent in the world and competent in the way in which we handle ourselves relative
to the other. You cannot handle yourself correctly relative to the other in terms of
the external if you haven‟t dealt with the internal first.
Let‟s maintain our priorities here. The first thing is the life itself. One has to main-
tain the vehicle and operate the vehicle correctly. Only when the vehicle is operating

correctly is it going to be able to handle the resistance field, the outside world that it
must meet. It has to be equipped. And one of the things that comes with this
alignment to the correctness of the vehicle comes the possibility of this movement
towards an environment that is correct for them.
It‟s interesting, by the way, in this graphing to enjoy just reading across the lines. It
leads you to all kinds of wonderful things to think about in terms of line continuity
and the deeper values that are there. Obviously, we don‟t normally have people that
are going to match up in that way. In other words, I‟m Left/Left. I‟m a 4th color in-
ternal and I‟m a 6th color external. We don‟t necessarily, obviously, line up in these
resonances. But lining up in a resonance is very powerful. It‟s very powerful. In
other words, it‟s the kind of thing that astrologers would describe in a trine. They
would describe it as there is built in ease. It is much easier for the vehicle to be able
to really align itself to its environment when there is a resonance.
Of course, resonance isn‟t going to be the most common thing. But it‟s just some-
thing to note that when you see resonances, and normally, of course, you‟re seeing
it in somebody who is not-self so the fact that there is a built in ease, for example,
this person, let‟s say that they were 3 internal, 3 external, the likelihood is that they
have more physical problems than somebody like me who‟s like this. It‟s one of the
ways that the gods punish you. If they set something up for you and you‟re not
ready for it, you‟re really going to get whacked. And if they don‟t set something up
for you, well they‟re not looking for you, if you know what I mean. It‟s like, they‟re
not expecting anything. It‟s curious for me, but the program expects something
from these resonances. Again, it is something that ultimately holistically is an inter-
esting ingredient into the overview of a holistic chart. Anyway, I don‟t want to get
too far adrift here.
The Left Node
The Left node, what do they tell us? They tell us that here is a strategic planning, a
strategic process in one‟s relationship to the other. In other words, there is in the
purest sense of the word, no innocence here. I‟m Left/Left, there is no innocence.
There really isn‟t, other than my not-self before my encounter because I had trans-
ferred my 3 personality to the 6. Other than that, there is none because the Left is
always calculating.
Now, obviously, we‟re dealing with infrastructure here, so we‟re dealing with the in-
frastructure for calculation; in other words, the development of the strategic brain,
the brain that is capable of organizing information strategically. And that means
specifically information that is rooted to smell, taste and sight. And it means that
smell, taste and vision are aspects, that is the potential for them, the olfactory sys-
tem, the whole tasting system, the visual cortex, that all of these things are there to
be used for strategic advantage. It‟s all calculating. It is all deeply, deeply judg-
mental.
Nothing is more judgmental than the Left. And of course, we‟re not talking about
personality judgment now. We are talking about physical judgment. That is, the

deeper discernment that is there. The moment that your system is oriented towards
checking out the other, that the competitiveness that is there, the potential for prob-
lems in one‟s relationships because one doesn‟t see the other innocently, one is al-
ways taking in the other as a risk. The Left/Left carries with it a deep suspicious un-
derpinning, if I can put it that way.
When we‟re looking at the nodal environment, the nodal environment is a strategic
environment. It is the environment where one‟s strategic capacity can be fulfilled.
In other words, this is the strategic spider that can bring you into the strategic spider
web and have lunch, so to speak. It is PHS after all; we can‟t leave out—never mind
my sense of humor.
I‟m amusing myself because I am Left/Left and it is so very obvious to me, some-
body who is not attached mentally, how my physical vehicle is such a calculating
creature. It‟s not me. That‟s the joke, always, in the process. Otherwise, you can
never enjoy the movie. You can only enjoy the movie when you see that you‟re giv-
en a character to experience. It‟s a creature. And this vehicle is a creature and I
can see this calculating creature—come into my environment, this is where I am
going to be able to strategically control things. This is the Left. It‟s what the Left
has always been about.
Biological Inheritance
When we are looking at biological inheritance—it‟s interesting, the nine-centered be-
ing as a transitional being carries with it its connection to the past, to the seven cen-
tered. And obviously, its potential movement towards the 11, that is the potential of
the rave. And if we are looking at any configuration where we see Left/Left or we
see Right/Right, in a sense, the Left/Left is a leftover of the seven-centered pheno-
mena, the seven-centered being. It‟s the closest in the nine-centered form, in a
sense, that you get to the seven centered. Because after all the seven centered was
exclusively Left. So, somebody who has a Left/Left form has a strong connection to
the seven-centered being. That is, at least in the context of the way in which the
seven-centered being operated.
In other words, a being that operated exclusively on the strategic model. It‟s clear
that the Right/Right is perhaps the most alien body that we have within the nine-
centered context. The Left/Left carries this quintessentially human frequency whe-
reas the Right/Right is carrying this, well, we don‟t know. It‟s very different and it‟s
a body that‟s going to feel different and it‟s going to feel different through the aura.
The Difference in the Left Classroom and the Right Classroom
To be a Left/Left Manifestor is to really have people be wary of you, because every-
thing is in the frequency. It‟s not like they know I‟m Left/Left. But they can feel it.
They can feel the quality of that. It was that wonderful delicious surprise that I had
when I was at the last Ibiza event when I did Left-Right and separated the class into
Left beings and Right beings. That was personality, but anyway, the difference was

Introduction to Systems Analysis
phenomenal. And you could see that in the Left classroom everybody was strategi-
cally prepared. That is, they were there, they had a purpose, they showed anticipa-
tion, they got excited about things. It was a totally different experience. You looked
at the Right classroom and you wondered if they were waiting for a plane. You had
no idea why they were there. It was a totally different frequency. You could feel the
frequency. It‟s so dense. It is quite incredible.
The Left/Left Frequency
So, obviously when we think about holistic interpretation, think about the Left/Left
body and the fact that despite what the design may turn out to be, despite what the
personality is like that the Left/Left body is going to create discomfort in many that
meet it. And of course that means that this poor Left/Left being, whoever they hap-
pen to be, they don‟t necessarily know why. They don‟t know why their gesture at a
given moment is treated with suspicion when in fact it may be treated with suspicion
because it comes with this Left/Left frequency. This is the frequency that says noth-
ing is for free. There are no free rides. There have never been free rides; there
never will be free rides. This is Left/Left.
When they bring you in, when you look at somebody and you see that their design
external is Left you know that whenever you‟re in an environment with them, they
have an agenda. You better believe it. And what I mean by that, and again I don‟t
mean that to be negative, it‟s just that that‟s what the environment is for, from their
programming. Their environment is the place in which they can deal with people.
And of course, their way of dealing with people always includes the strategic angle.
Remember we‟re still talking about the form. We‟re not talking about mind. We‟re
not talking about whether the personality is going to go along with all of this. We‟re
not necessarily talking about somebody who is operating correctly. We‟re just look-
ing theoretically at what this represents. This is a strategic creature. This is a stra-
tegic brain; deeply alert, very busy checking everything out always that insecurity
about their survival driving them to maintain their vigilance. This activity of brain
needs to be supported obviously, supported by diet, whatever.
And at the same time, the Left/Left is gifted with having environments that will sup-
port their strategic advantage. If you‟re dealing with somebody who is not-self and
they‟re Left/Left, never accept their setting the place of a meeting or gathering be-
cause they will bring you directly into their lair. And as not-self it may be entirely
incorrect and they will try strategically to manipulate you in that situation and usual-
ly these are things that really blow up.
Now, there are many, many different combinations. And given there is this duality,
of course, the combinations get quite complex. In other words, somebody who has a
mixing of things, somebody who has let‟s say a 2nd color internal and they are a 4th
color that is external. So we have this difference between what is lower and upper in
this case, another binary in there, in a sense a kind of balance again, the “this and
that” of something, but quite different.

PHS Synthesis Left / Left
Left/Left: The Unhealthiest
Yet, at the same time, they are both Left/Left. It still remains the same kind of very
active, deeply, deeply concerned about not simply its survivability in the obvious
sense, a connection to its own well-being. After all, the people that can be the un-
healthiest are going to turn out to be Left/Left. It‟s just interesting to think about
that. This is a place where if you‟re not-self it can do such damage to your system
because your system is constantly demanding that you have a strategic edge. And
you cannot have that strategic edge unless you‟re correct. And if you‟re not correct
it means that your immune system is going to be vulnerable.
Everything about the Left/Left is oriented to the immune system. Even if you don‟t
have the 1st or 2nd tone, if you‟re a 3rd tone being it doesn‟t mean it‟s not connected
to it; it‟s deeply connected to it. Of course, it means that as a Left/Left being if
you‟re not operating correctly and the whole emphasis of your physical system is to
be able to protect yourself, then you know that your protection is going to break
down and you‟re going to have problems. It‟s also an advantage in the sense that
the Left/Left will respond very quickly to strategies. So to see somebody that has a
Left/Left design and to introduce them to Strategy and Authority, they are going to
be much more instantaneously receptive than the Right/Right. They‟ll get it right
away.
Example: Internal 2, External 4
So, what happens when
we‟re looking at this in
terms of a being?
What‟s a health profile
here? Here we have
the example of the 2.
So we have the 2 and
we know from the die-
tary perspective this is
somebody that needs
to develop their dis-
cernment, it‟s very im-
portant for them.
They‟re looking for the
ideal in life. All 2nd col-
or beings are looking
for an ideal. It‟s why
when you look at the
2nd color diet you‟re looking at the ideal. What is that perfect breakfast, what is that
perfect lunch, what is that ideal dinner, whatever the case may be? You‟re looking
for the ideal and you cannot be satisfied with anything other than the ideal.
It means strategically that this is a brain system that is looking for that and it‟s de-
signed to be able to find it. But of course we know that discernment is a matter of
PHS is a certificate program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

111
PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
decision making and decision making is a matter of inner authority. Without the in-
ner authority we do not get this capacity to be able to discern the ideal. And of
course, here is the open aspect of it. In other words, to be open to all possibilities of
ideal, but to have the gift of being able to settle on what is specific.
The 4th Color External
Now, in the variation that I drew here you have an external that is the 4 that is the
high ground, the mountains that we have looked at. My jokes about cigarette smok-
ing aside there are the advantages of diminished oxygen levels. But for somebody
like this in order to be able to fulfill their Left/Left potential they have two things
they have to be able to do. The first is what they do for themselves. And what they
do for themselves is that they ensure that they have what is their necessary ideal.
This is the strategic goal of their brain, because of course for their brain once the 2nd
color being is eating according to their ideal that brain is going to be enhanced, is
going to get the nutrition that it needs, it‟s going to be much more effective as a
strategic mechanism.
Now, again, underneath is going to be some kind of tonal value. Let‟s say a 1st tone
is underneath. That 1st tone is going to bring that combination of the aroma infor-
mation, how important that aroma information is in order to be able to find the right
discernment. And all of that is going to be enhanced by the fact that this is a being
that is operating according to their strategy and they have found their ideal diet and
they are eating that.
But it also says something else, it means that they have an enhanced capacity to be
able to sense strategic advantage; they have a nose for it. They have a nose for
strategic advantage. Whether they use that nose or not is dependent on whether it‟s
the inner authority that is operating. If the inner authority is operating that nose is
being used and what you‟re getting is a person in their life on the surface, that is
making decisions that are based on their sense of smell that will give them an ad-
vantage that strategically allows them to protect their immune system and beyond.
That‟s what they can do for themselves.
But that is only in isolation. That‟s what they can do for themselves when they sit
down to eat. But life is about the other. And of course for them, they move from
the lower to the upper in moving to their design external. They need the high
ground. This is their strategic advantage. This is the soldier that naturally says I
want the high ground so I can look down on them, I can see them coming. There
are many advantages strategically to be on the high ground.
If you‟re Right on the high ground you‟re looking around saying, gee this is really
pretty. And that‟s beautiful, obviously. But if you‟re Left on the high ground you‟re
looking down. You‟re looking at how to see where you can be tracked or trailed or
you‟re looking to see the pathways out, you‟re looking to see the safe road and all
those things. You have a strategic advantage out of it because you‟re designed to
take a strategic advantage out of it.

PHS Synthesis Left / Left
Left/Left: Competition and Survival
So, if this being is operating correctly, not only do they have a nose for things, but
they are in the right environment to take advantage of it. The higher up you go the
harder it is to smell. If you have a really good nose at high ground you have incred-
ible advantage in terms of your survival compared to others. Everything about
Left/Left is about competition, survival. It‟s not negative in the violence sense, the
way we could distort that. It is very mammalian, it‟s very animal. It isn‟t to say that
it isn‟t quintessentially human either. But it is that seven-centered mix of the primi-
tive form and the expanding consciousness. And within the nine-centered configura-
tion this Left/Left is probably the deepest conditioning factor, much more condition-
ing force than any of the other combinations that we are going to look at.
You can look at it in so many different ways, obviously. We have many, many varia-
tions in there. Just quickly any one of you that want to put that up there, just give
me your design internal and your design external. Just give me “I” and a number
and an “E” and a number so I have some real examples and I‟ll give you a sense of
it. The whole thing to grasp about this is to begin to see that our uniqueness ex-
tends to the environment itself. That it goes far beyond just the way in which we
can potentially function. It is about the whole process in that sense. Ok, we have
some of them coming in.
Example: Internal 4, External 1
All right, we have a 4-1
there and the external is a
1-1. It‟s always interesting
again to look at resonances,
when resonances arise
they‟re always interesting.
Here you have again an ex-
ample of this cross-over.
You are looking at a
Left/Left. Remember only
give me this if you are
Left/Left. So you are look-
ing at a Left/Left situation in
which they are fundamental-
ly strategic.
So again, here we look at the 4th color in terms of the dietary need, the calmness
and you can see how clearly there is a deep relationship between the calmness and
the cave, that the cave is the environment in which the calmness can be maintained.
There is this control over the environment, the manipulative that we understand
about the 3-4 in the internal and this combination is the ideal combination for this
being. All of which, by the way has the same rooting in terms of cognition so that
the cognitive capacity in dealing with the other through the environment is some-

Introduction to Systems Analysis
thing that is going to be enhanced, and the fact that this is where your capacity is to
be able to protect yourself.
Again, the Left/Left is deeply concerned about its immune system. Your well-being
is so deeply connected to that combination, the combination of bringing nutrition into
your vehicle correctly, the calm. And at the same time understanding that your so-
cial interaction, that the only place where you have a strategic advantage—the only
place, it‟s interesting to think about that—is in that cave. And remember that the
key to the cave is always a room with one door, a room with one door is a cave. And
any room with one door that you‟re in where you can control that door, this is the
place where you will always have strategic advantage.
It also means that because it‟s the right environment for you, it means that you‟re
protected to a certain degree from conditioning; you get much less resistance in that
environment. Those two, in that sense, can work together quite nicely. Again, re-
member, I am keeping this on the surface. We will have an enormous amount of
work in all of this, this is just an introduction. But I think you can begin to see that
the environment becomes something that is the completion of what you can do for
yourself. It‟s the thing that sets you on the track. And if you‟re Left oriented it
takes on a whole new meaning. The environment is the place for you to develop
your strategy, to protect your immune system, to be able to go beyond that.
Example: Internal 1, External 1
Let‟s look at another one. 1-1, appetite, smell and external 1 cave. That‟s very pri-
mitive. I say that in the context of ancient, rather than any negative connotation of
primitive. There is a tre-
mendous resonance here.
To be a cave-
man/cavewoman who is
rooted in smell in the caves
you can see that your strat-
egies are very ancient, fun-
damental, basic strategies.
This is something that is so
important. Our first and
foremost sense was smell,
after all. So your sense of
smell is the key to your
strategic capacity. And of
course, that strategic capac-
ity is going to be dependent
on the success of your brain
system which is going to be rooted in your consecutive diet.
And obviously, the same thing as I mentioned for Inga, to realize that in order for
you to maintain strategic advantage in your life with the other, because after all if
you cannot survive in terms of your relationship to the other your competitiveness in

PHS Synthesis Left / Left
the Left sense, then you get broken down by their resistance and their conditioning.
And of course the environment that protects you is your cave. Again, the one door,
it is an amazing thing, that one door. Please protect cave children. The worst room
to put them in is a room that has two doors and just about every bedroom has that.
They may have three—the door to the bathroom, the door to the exit and perhaps
the closet door, or just the closet door and the door out, this is very, very uncom-
fortable for these children. It‟s very uncomfortable for them.
This is where you get all of these frightened children with their nightmares. One out
of every 6 children, potentially, is going to be a cave child in terms of their nodes.
These children can have horrendous fear experiences because of those two doors.
They cannot defend that, that‟s not what they‟re designed for. It makes them very,
very nervous. And that‟s the thing for cave people, particularly rooms that have
doors at either end; it‟s very, very uncomfortable for a cave person.
So, it‟s one of the things to recognize that not only is that good for you, but these
are the ideal environments for you to deal with people. And this is where your stra-
tegic potential comes out. Of course, again, this is not about it being negative for
the other person. It‟s very important to understand that, the fact that we can think
about the strategic operation and we can sort of try to turn that into manipulation or
this or that or all the other terminology that goes with it. After all, they‟re just living
out at an unconscious level, because it‟s the design, at an unconscious level through
their inner authority they‟re simply living out what is natural for them. What is natu-
ral for them is to be in charge of the situation. It is natural for them to have a grip
on what‟s going on. That‟s what the strategic brain does. And whether it does it
through smell or taste or vision this is what the strategic brain is doing, it‟s getting a
grip on the situation.
Of course, that doesn‟t mean it is “this or that,” getting a grip is just getting a grip.
And course, in the case of the environment like here in the cave itself it simply
means that this is where the being not only has a good grip on themselves, in that
sense, but they are competent to be able to handle the impact, the effect of the oth-
er, its conditioning, the potential of resistance and therein lies the possibility for the
purest communication with the other.
Resonance Between the Internal and the External
It‟s also something I said to you earlier that there is this sense of ease that comes
with the resonance between the internal and the external. And one of the things to
see about this is that they can be very, very easily strung together. For example, it
is healthy to bring people into the cave one at a time. It is very healthy to be deeply
selective about that one thing that you‟re going to eat. In other words, in the reson-
ance they can drift across to each other and can provide a very interesting insight.
In other words, this particular cave person is going to be—let‟s say that there are
two people that want to see you, don‟t bring them into your environment at the
same time: one at a time.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
And in bringing them in one at a time you‟re going to have a strategic advantage.
And that advantage doesn‟t mean you take advantage of them, it means that you
are going to be able to operate at your best. It may mean nothing more than saying
hello to them. It‟s not about that it has to lead to anything; it is simply that the
Left/Left is never comfortable unless it has a grip on the situation. This is what it is
designed to be. It is a very alert creature.
Example: Internal 1, External 6
All right, let‟s take a look at another one. Stephen, a 1-1, and a 6, that brings a lit-
tle difference. And of course, we move away from the resonance in this case.
Again, this is one of those
things to recognize about
how being correct strategi-
cally, that if you‟re Left/Left
and you don‟t pay attention
to your environment then
there is really going to be a
dilemma for you in terms of
your relationship to the out-
side world. After all, the
Left/Left needs to have its
strategic advantage. It is
very important for it. And
of course, the gift of being
able to have that strategic
advantage isn‟t available if
you‟re not in the right envi-
ronment. In other words, the ability of this brain, once it is being fed correctly, to
take advantage of a situation and its connection to the other is going to be deter-
mined by whether it‟s in the right environment because the environment nurtures
that capacity.
In other words, you‟re going to be much more effective when you operate on the
shore. It‟s amusing to watch you in your travels because you travel quite a bit and
you end up going from east coast to west coast. You end up going from shore to
shore, which is a very healthy thing for you. Stay away from Middle America, unless
you can sit on the Great Lakes. It‟s just something to understand about the fact that
once you see the framework, it‟s essential to see that the environment is going to do
for you the equivalent of what your PHS, dietary speaking, is going to do for you
physically, what it‟s going to do for your ability to be able to work and deal with the
other. All of this is enhanced the moment that you‟re going to be in the correct envi-
ronment.
Now, it isn‟t to say that isn‟t true for everybody else. It is. But it‟s about under-
standing that for the Left/Left no matter how good you are to yourself—let‟s say that
you‟re like Stephen here you have this consecutive and you do a good job with it and
you follow your dietary regimen and you‟re operating according to your Strategy and

Authority but you happen to be living in the mountains. Now, you‟re going to be ok,
but you‟re dealings with people aren‟t going to be ok and they‟re going to affect you,
slowly but surely and you‟re not going to enjoy it and it‟s not going to be to an ad-
vantage.
The Cross of Life
Now, it doesn‟t mean that you‟re going to become not-self and unhealthy and all that
stuff. But it does mean that it‟s going to put a crimp on you being able to fulfill your
purpose. We don‟t fulfill our purpose—again, to really understand the Cross of Life,
the profile shows us the internal. In other words, it shows us who the character is.
But purpose is fulfilled in the life, through the movement. You cannot fulfill your
purpose unless you fulfill your nodal determination. So, nodal determination is a real
key. It‟s a key in health.
I guess Andrea you would remember even better than me when it was because I
don‟t remember, but I remember when I was introducing PHS color and I talked
about the kind of clinic that we could develop in the future, this clinic where you had
these six different environments and that you could introduce somebody to their PHS
and that you could bring them into that section of the clinic so that the clinic has a
nice big pond so you have part of the clinic by the shore, whatever it is, you can
create all of that environmentally. It‟s something to grasp, the moment that you put
somebody in their right environment they are going to deeply resonate to that.
Of course, one of the dilemmas we have, which is in some ways an advantage, is
that we do live in the jet age. One of the most startling things that has changed the
world is airplane travel. It‟s phenomenal what it has done in changing the world.
Those of us who are fortunate enough have been able to take advantage of that to
be able to travel widely and to be able to be seduced by different kinds of environ-
ments—go to Goa in the winter and go to Brazil and do this and do that and all of the
things that can be hip, cool or whatever, and people end up getting stuck in various
environments simply because it‟s possible, rather than it being what is correct for
them.
I think one of the—I‟ve talked about it, I think, in this class. That is, when I first
started doing readings I introduced people to the first law of abnormalcy. That is,
sleep in your own bed in your own aura. The second law of abnormalcy, I began in
teaching PHS. That is, eat according to your dietary regimen and not to any social
construct. Both of which can be quite unsettling in terms of the way in which the
not-self deals with that, can be unsettling in terms of the way in which the homoge-
nized patterns of the life process have been established.
Living in Your Correct Environment
Obviously, it can be very unsettling to have to come to grips with the fact that you
may not be in the Right nodal environment. My point about the jet age is that not
that you sell your house, or whatever, but to begin to experiment—your vacations,

whatever it is, your work if it takes you places—with orientating yourself towards the
environment that is correct for you. You will see that it will make an enormous dif-
ference. You‟ll just see it. It makes a difference in the quality of your relationship to
the other.
It‟s why it‟s often so difficult. People that you think—that kind of thing where you‟re
arranging a dinner party and you‟re going to invite people and you‟re thinking about
people who might get along with each other, you can have people that are naturals
in terms of you think they‟re really going to get along with each other. They have
these great electro-magnetics and there is this and there‟s that and they both did
similar things and so forth and so on. One of them is a kitchen person and the other
one is by the shore and one of them loses. And it means that that relationship that
you thought would be terrific, that‟s going to work real nice, it doesn‟t.
It is one of the most fantastic things to understand—it‟s why the personality has
such a trouble with our relationships. The personality doesn‟t understand what the
body wants. The personality just assumes that it‟s food and sex. The personality
doesn‟t know what the body really needs. It has no idea. That environment for the
body is essential. That means that your differentiation is beginning to express some-
thing that is far beyond what you‟ve learned so far.
People ask me all the time about fractals. If you want to see who is on your fractal,
be in the right place. If you‟re not in the right place they‟re not there, and if they‟re
not there you don‟t get to fulfill your purpose. In the end the environment becomes
a key to the process of transcendence. It is about being in the right environment.
The environment is so important, because it is the ground rules; it is the framework
of our relationship to the other. And it means that relationships that we may have
may no longer be able to function in the way that they once did.
For example, it is clear to me that I have a much better relationship with my stu-
dents virtually than I ever can live, and for an obvious reason. Regardless of what
our relationship is to each other, our respect for each other and so forth and so on, if
we‟re not sharing the same kind of environmental advantage we don‟t have the same
kind of connection. Virtually we do, because it‟s just that. It‟s virtual. You can be in
yours and I can be in mine and everything is ok.
And again, a lot of the ways in which we see our social interaction in so many ways
needs to change, or at least in the sense that we need to become more aware of it.
If you have children, whether they‟re at home or not, look at what is environmentally
correct for them, and compare it to what it‟s environmentally correct for you and for
your partner. Don‟t throw a fit when you see it all, because this is one of the basic
ways in which we can understand our vehicle‟s taste for people—not personality,
don‟t confuse this, please. Your personality will fall in love with something that your
body doesn‟t want and in the end you find that out, often too late. We‟re not talking
about the same things; I‟m not talking about the personality and foolishness of the
personality. I‟m talking about what your body wants and who your body wants.
This is the most difficult thing for the personality to accept. It‟s not the personality
that can ever recognize who truly belongs next to your aura and when and where.

PHS Synthesis Left / Left
We‟re only here to deal fractally the ideal, the relationships that we have in the flesh.
Those relationships where we can, as beings, operate correctly. Now, there are
many combinations that work—a kitchen by the shore or in the mountains—you
know what I mean. In other words, in the same way that we saw with the eating
that there are certain combinations that can get along with each other and not dis-
turb each other in that eating process, the same thing is true in relationships and
something that we will explore.
But I want you to begin to see something about the process of discernment, how it
becomes deeper and deeper and deeper and gets more involved in your life. In oth-
er words, that your vehicle is not simply just to make those decisions in terms of this
and that, it is the decisions for everything and it is your vehicle that knows precisely
where and through the “where” who is for you in this life for whatever. It‟s quite
something.
So, it‟s time to begin to put your focus on this synthetic view, to begin to look at the
combinations, begin with those people close to you. Begin with them and see how
environmentally you relate to each other. It‟s going to give you a lot of surprises
and some fascinating insights.
Anyway, a pleasure to share this, this is a new foundation in the level of our work
and we‟ll have an interesting treat for the rest of the ride. Anyway, to all of you, you
take care and until next time, bye for now.

PHS Synthesis: Left / Right
Let‟s continue with our PHS synthesis adventure and you can see today we‟re going
to look at the Left/Right—Left internal, Right external. There are some things that
you really have to understand to begin with. One of the things is that everything
having to do with the quality of the personal being, the nature of personal well-
being, that all of this is connected to what is the internal. In other words, we‟ve al-
ready seen that in depth that the internal represents the brain function and in that
brain function, that is, the organization of the vehicle itself, the well-being of the ve-
hicle, everything having to do with what we understand as the processes, the physi-
cal processes that take place within the illusion that is us.
When we‟re dealing with the external, we have a transition that takes place, that this
truly has nothing directly to do with us, it has to do with our relationship to the other
and in essence our relationship to the cosmos as a whole, because in fact as nodes
always do, they connect us to a larger continuity and it is this larger continuity that
gives us our direction. So, it‟s something to see that when you‟re looking at some-
body that is Left/Left as we did last week, or Left/Right as we do now, that in fact
we‟re not looking at a revolutionary problem in dealing with the discovery that they
are nodally Right, because that being nodally Right isn‟t impacting the way they are.
In other words, they don‟t suddenly have a passive brain. They don‟t suddenly have
a passive brain system; they don‟t have what is the right mechanism in terms of the
way in which the vehicle operates. This is not changing.
A Way to Reduce Resistance
So, when we‟re looking at a Left/Left and a Left/Right, one of the things to recognize
is that this is not a place where being Right, in that sense, that is nodally Right, is
something that makes an enormous difference to our understanding of the way
things can be experienced. It is simply a nuance of the way in which the quality of
life or the resistance process of this being can be reduced. It‟s very, very different
as you‟ll see when we enter into the next two weeks, because we‟re going to be
looking in both cases at Right internals. And at the moment we‟re looking at Right
internals, everything shifts. But as long as we‟re staying with the Left internal we‟re
still staying within the bounds of the strategic process, the human process, the sur-
vival agenda, and the immune system dominance, all of those things that we under-
stand about the Left nature of the being.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
The Left/Right Being
The fact that they are nodally Right simply means that they have an unusual way in
which they express that in their relationship to the other. It‟s unusual only in the
sense that it is not archetypically human—the Left/Left, the human archetype, the
Right/Right, the potential rave archetype in that. So, when we‟re looking at this
Left/Right being, what we‟re seeing is that you have this very, very strategic active,
physical system, a physical system that‟s on alert, a physical system that is very
much ready. And at the same time, the moment you move them out into the world
you‟d never know it.
When you meet a Left/Left you know it right away. You can feel it, you can feel it in
their body—somebody like me—you just feel it. Because what they are as a brain
system is what they display in their relationship to the other. But here you have a
kind of chameleon; you have a kind of surprise. And of course, after all, we‟re going
to get to see that in terms of the population, these are relatively going to be divided.
I am waiting for the statistical numbers to be accurate so I am not going to dabble in
numbers, but my assumption is that relatively it‟s a quarter of the population, there
may be slight variations.
But the fact is you have these Left/Right beings and they are, in a sense, in terms of
the way in which they‟re perceived by the other are often deeply misread. And
they‟re often deeply misread because the way in which they deal with the other is
through the Right passive process and it‟s very different, and it‟s not what you ex-
pect. So, here we‟re dealing with something where you can begin to distinguish the

PHS Synthesis Left / Right
differences between the values that the internal brings and the values that the ex-
ternal brings.
Let‟s take an example to begin with and as I did last week, if there are any of you
that are Left/Right could you give me your Left/Right data, what the color is, so we
have that. I don‟t know if any of you are Left/Right. I‟ll just wait a moment and see
if there are any that show up. It looks like there‟s one, so far. Ok, let‟s begin with
yours, Becky.
An Example: Internal 3, External 5 Colors
You have a 3 internal and it‟s the 3rd tone. The external is 5. So think about this for
a moment. Let‟s look at this. When we‟re looking at this Left configuration we have
the obvious things about how to maintain the body. We know all of that in terms of
the dietary regimen, the hot food
that is anything that is above body
temperature. At the same time
the outer vision is something that
is essential to this being, that is,
to look at their food, that the food
has to be aesthetically presented,
that it‟s important how it looks.
The very look of the food itself,
that it‟s not damaged or odd, or
whatever the case may be; any-
way, all of that.
What we‟re looking at is the way
in which this brain system is being
oriented and this is a brain system that is being oriented towards the visual cortex.
And it‟s oriented towards the visual cortex which means that as long as Becky is op-
erating according to her Strategy and Authority that her decision making process is
based on more and more and more her visual acuity. In other words, how well her
visual cortex actually operates.
Now, somebody who is a 3/3, divorced from looking at their external, one of the
things that you would expect from somebody like this, is that you would expect that
here is a very calculating mind, because that‟s what it is. The moment that you‟re
dealing with this kind of configuration, the moment you‟re dealing with the Left, the
moment you‟re dealing with the outer vision you‟re dealing with a visual cortex that
wants to isolate things, to be able to see things precisely within context in order to
be able to have an agenda to deal with them.
If we were dealing with somebody who was also Left nodally, then what we would
get to see is the immediate application of that strategy in the way in which they op-
erate relative to the other. But that‟s not what we‟re going to see here. Now, of
course, we know that we are dealing with valleys, so we are dealing with an envi-
ronment, and I don‟t want to go back and repeat that, but just talking about the es-

Introduction to Systems Analysis
sential environment, that is, the lower levels where the pressure is the highest, this
is going to be the natural environment for this being.
The Right Always Pulls Others to You
What is essential to grasp, though, is that once this being is in that environment they
are not taking action. This is what the Right always brings. The Right always pulls
others to you, always. If you‟re Right minded it is the other that will pull out from
you the essentials that are necessary. If you‟re nodally Right you always know that
the other is going to be there approaching you, coming towards you, at least that‟s
the way it‟s going to appear.
The Left node is always looking towards something. It is always picking somebody
out of the crowd. It is always focusing, in that sense, in its environment. But here is
somebody that has stepped away from that because they are Right nodally fixed. In
other words, the moment that they get into those environments, in essence, there is
no need for their mental strategy. It‟s just something that makes them curious. In
other words, it seems like when they‟re in the environment on the outside, that they
are not as equipped to be able to look after themselves as they actually can, which
means they can be very surprising people.
The Right brings out a perception in the other that one is either unable or holding
back, that there is an insecurity, that there is not this pressing forward that the Left
is always about. Of course, this can be a great advantage strategically. In other
words, you can be a wolf dressed like a sheep, everyone sees you as a sheep and
you can still do your wolf‟s business. Ah, life‟s grand. Ah, wolf in sheep‟s clothing.
How do you like that one, Becky?
An Example: Internal 1, External 2
All right, let me look at another
one. Don‟t mind my sense of hu-
mor. Andrea, we have a 1 and it‟s
a 2nd tone. On the other side we
have 2. Again you can see the
same kind of thing. Think about
the environment for the moment.
What is the environment about?
We live our life in two ways. That
is, we live a lot of our lives within
our own skin separate from oth-
ers. And then we live an aspect of
our lives in the auras of others
connected to others. Not every-
thing that we need to accomplish
in this life is accomplished with the other; not directly.

PHS Synthesis Left / Right
We have seen in the development of our technologies that the ability to be able to
deal with the other does not require an aura. It‟s one of the most interesting things
about the transformation that‟s taken place since Alexander Graham Bell on the tele-
phone. When you begin to be able to communicate and be able to work things out
with the other without being in their aura contact.
Left/Right Superb at Taking in Information
So, again once you understand environment, that is, the nodal environment that is
correct for you, it does not mean that that is the only place that works for you. It
means that‟s the place that works for you in your relationship to the other. One of
the things that is interesting about Left/Right beings is that they are superb in a
crowd in terms of taking in information. Being a Right nodally forces them to be
much more deeply observant when they are in the aura of the other than they would
naturally be, because the moment they go back into their own space they go deeply
into their Left focus.
These are beings that take advantage of the social interaction as a research mechan-
ism. They pick up information, they take the information in. And in taking that in-
formation in the moment that they go back into their own aura their Left brain starts
cranking away. In terms of the social interaction itself obviously the external envi-
ronment is going to be something that‟s really important. But the Left/Right being is
always going to be underestimated, always.
Again, to be underestimated when you are aware is a great advantage. To be unde-
restimated when you are not-self can be deeply painful. This is one of the dilemmas
of the Left/Right. No matter what they construct within their own conceptual process
within their own private space, the way that they‟re going to interact on the outside
is never going to follow what is in that sense they naturally would like to go. It
doesn‟t work that way.
Again, so much of learning to love yourself is about surrendering to the limitation of
our imprints and we are all limited by the imprint. So, if you‟re looking, any of you
because it‟s just one of those things to really grasp, if you‟re looking at your design
or anyone else‟s, and you see they‟re Left/Right what you‟re really looking at is a so-
cial dilemma that arises out of that. And the social dilemma is that no matter how
ready they are as a being they are limited in the way in which they can deal with the
other, because they‟re Right.
This is not about what I was showing you as I was introducing you to the thematics
of the external—understanding what the market is, and what that means as an envi-
ronment and that is a valuable environment for you. This is another level that I‟m
trying to get across. It is beginning to grasp what the synthesis brings in terms of
the impact on the being. And it‟s a reminder of something. It is a guide in a sense.
It says that you have to be correct within the way in which your authority operates in
order to be comfortable in those environments, because they‟re not natural for your
being. It doesn‟t seem that way.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
Design and Personality Have Nothing to Do with Each Other
Lately one of the things that I have been really trying to get across is how design
and personality, it is the result of the depth of my work over these last years, it is so
obvious to me now that it‟s painful that design and personality literally have nothing
to do with each other. They really don‟t have anything to do with each other. And I
have a little secret for you. The Cross of Life is such a beautiful thing, but the
Sun/Earth and the nodes don‟t have anything to do with each other. It is the great
wonder of the chart. It‟s a wonder.
Whenever I look at it, and again, it has been my great good fortune that I have been
able to teach all these years and been able to come around in cycles in the know-
ledge. To understand how different the Sun/Earth and the nodes are, is in essence
what I‟m really trying to get across to you today, the Sun/Earth represents your be-
ing. The nodes don‟t. Personalize your nodes at great danger. They‟re so different.
They‟re not about you, they‟re about an environmental direction, but they‟re not
about you. Obviously it‟s your direction; the being‟s direction and so forth and so
on. We can see, obviously, because it‟s all aspects, ultimately we can see how it all
fits together. But when I deconstruct these two things, I get to a place where I real-
ize we have apples and oranges here, and this is a dilemma.
The Sun/Earth are objects, the sun produces the neutrino field. They go around in
their specific counterclockwise movement. And there are the nodes. They‟re posi-
tions, they don‟t produce any neutrinos, they‟re windows of stellar neutrinos, and
they basically go backwards. You have two things that are diametrically opposed to
each other. It‟s what binds them. Like the design and the personality, so different,
yet bound in the illusion. Sun/Earth and nodes are so different, but bound in the il-
lusion.
The Right: Gateway to Surrender
So you see when you‟re Left you always think of yourself as Left. If you‟re Left/Left
it all seems correct even if you‟re not-self. But if you‟re Left/Right it can feel like you
have a handicap. It can feel like you don‟t have power in the social dynamic. Ob-
viously, if you‟re operating correctly, those environments are nurturing for you. And
the moment that you can accept that the moment you step beyond your skin, in the
sense of the moment that you move out into the world, you have to wait for every-
thing to come to you. Oh, such a thing to say, isn‟t it?
Everything that I teach is about understanding that we are choiceless and helpless
and reactive. We either have a geometry or we don‟t; we either have a fractal or we
don‟t. We are not creative, we are re-creative. There is nothing to do but surrender.
But it is the most difficult of all things. The great advantage of the Right node, the
Right external is a gateway to surrender. The Right is; it has to be. There is no oth-
er way for it. It is the polarity of being strategic.

PHS Synthesis Left / Right
The moment that you have a Right external, whether you are Left or Right, it says
that the social dynamic of your life is in the hands of the other. This is the thing that
is so important to understand. This whole deconstruction, this process, and we will
really see when we get to next year when I begin to do holistic work with you so we
can begin to integrate all of these aspects to understand the larger being within the
context of design, yet seeing it holistically. That you have to understand these com-
ponents are very, very separate from each other. They are. And each of them has
its own kind of process that could be correct or not. And yet, there is no life without
it all fitting together, none.
Surrender to Being an Observer
But there is a great lesson to be learned if your body which is the life, that if it is a
Right trajectory, a Right movement, the Right external, then you have to see that
the social dynamic of your life, what will bring the best to you in this life will come to
you. And you have to surrender all of that potential to being an observer in those
environments, because the moment you try to stand up in those environments and
you try to express your Leftness it will all backfire. It just will.
We are nothing but formula, keynote on top of keynote, layer on top of layer. We‟re
already at a place where we are in the deep mysteries of the nature of being. And
one of our dilemmas is coming to grips with our relationship to the other. And of
course our relationship to the other is so confused. It‟s confused because of the his-
tory of homogenization and the not-self. It is confused by not being able to make
decisions correctly or to communicate correctly. But most of all, it is simply that we
are a prisoner of our genes. Everything about the social context of our life has al-
ways been determined by our openness. We cannot escape the genetic imperative
to be attracted to what is different. And yet, it is beginning to fall apart.
And as it falls apart, as we move towards 2027, when we have a mutation of the 59th
gate, the polarity to the 55, when the human sexual drive is going to be trans-
formed, a sexual drive that will not be able to function because it will not have
access to a motor wave, we‟re going to have a very, very different way in which the
interaction with the other begins to operate. But for those of you that are Left/Right,
how important it is for you to see that going out in the world is the way in which you
gather material. It is what it‟s for, for you. You gather material, you gather infor-
mation, you gather people, you gather these things. They‟re there.
And because you are in the correct environment you get the correct forces that are
there. And socially there is no other way. What happens to most Left/Right beings
is that they try to be Left/Left. They have all this stimulation that‟s there in them,
they have a very, very active brain system, neurons firing, and they‟re ready to go.
And within themselves all of that is just pounding away. But put them on the outside
and it all shifts.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
Being Underestimated
It‟s interesting to be underestimated. As a 5/1 I know the horrors of being overes-
timated, what the projection field can do to you. To be underestimated is an advan-
tage because you‟re allowed to see things that nobody else gets to see. You can
take in information, whatever your sensory quality as a Left, you can take in infor-
mation that nobody else can take in because you‟re not putting out that strategic
frequency.
Think about the Left/Left. The Left/Left goes into its environment, putting out that
strategic frequency and everybody feels it. They feel it. This is the way they oper-
ate. But as a Right, it‟s not like that. And of course, you can feel very uncomforta-
ble. You can feel like there‟s something wrong with you. You can feel like you have
all this power when you‟re in your own environment and then where did it go the
moment that you step outside. This is what it is to be Left/Right. And it is not in
any way, shape or form a disadvantage.
Think about the Left/Left person going into the correct environment and there are
four people in that environment. They‟re going to take in one. They‟re going to see
them; they‟re going to use their strategic ability to move towards them and to en-
gage them. This is the way the Left/Left works. And the others basically don‟t exist.
It‟s the same situation. You‟re Left/Right. You enter into the environment and
you‟re Left brain is already wanting to focus on someone, and you can‟t. Oh, you
can focus on them, but you can‟t move towards them. You have to wait.
And while you‟re waiting, you notice something. You get bored with focusing just on
them and you focus on the others. And you take in a tremendous amount of infor-
mation relative to whatever your sensory capacity is. That information is going to be
of value to you. You just don‟t know why or how or when. And being correct in that
environment, not only does it give you the advantage of being able to take in infor-
mation that otherwise you would not take in, but you‟re not Right/Right. You do
have a Left brain, you are going to be able to bring that information in and use that
information. It‟s another story. We‟ll see holistically what if anything the personality
and the way the personality sees how that is going to relate to it.
But since the body is the life, if you‟re going to be Left/Right, you‟re going to end up
with a mind that torments you, a mind that in your not-self was always trying to find
ways to get around that process, because it could feel so uncomfortable. It‟s a great
gift, like anything. I can look at the Left/Left and see how narrow it is. It is; it‟s
narrow. Once it gets hooked in it‟s just so narrow. The narrowness might be lovely.
I‟ve spent my whole life now in this knowledge, it can be lovely, but it‟s still—woof—
Left/Left.

PHS Synthesis Left / Right
Relaxing into Being You
Everything can be a “this” and a “that.” It‟s always going to be a dilemma as not-
self, always. By grasping this, those of you that are Left/Right, there‟s nothing to
do. It‟s not like you do anything about this. It‟s about relaxing into being you, this
staying in love with yourself, not just falling in love with yourself, but staying in love
with yourself. Oh yeah, Left/Left Projectors are like Baghdad missiles, woof; of
course. This is the whole thing. And of course, it can be so painful for them, be-
cause if they‟re not correct it blows up in their face. Left/Left people who are not-
self boy do they ever get into trouble, because they push themselves into situations
that are disastrous.
To know your nature—I remember, I was the kind of person that if you as not-self if
you put me into a situation where there was a lot of people I would just naturally
want to dominate. I‟m an ego being, powerful Throat, blah, blah, blah. But I‟m
Left/Left. I didn‟t understand that. I actually didn‟t want the attention. And I could
never understand the fact this was the movie that I was playing. But it is what it‟s
about.
The Left/Right is the beginning of understanding the deep, deep nuances that are
there in the way in which we are all constructed. This has nothing to do with the
personality or the mind, not directly. We still don‟t know what this is about. We‟re
not looking at gates, crosses. We‟re not looking at the design; we‟re not seeing the
being. Always remember that I am deconstructing. We are going to have many,
many ways of looking at Left/Rights because it‟s going to depend on all those confi-
gurations. It‟s not just a simple thing of saying, aha, your design is Left/Right and
bang, bang, bang. Yes, there are some things, obviously, that are generic truths,
the kinds of things that I suggest. But these are just surface things.
We Have Two Kinds of Lives
When it really becomes profound is when you see it in the synthesis in relationship to
the whole design. And then you can begin to get a sense of what is really the being.
And of course, as you‟re going through your own process in operating correctly in
this process you can begin to relax by understanding that we all have two kinds of
lives: The private life, our aura, and the other. And the private life is owned and op-
erated by Sun/Earth. And the other, the Sun/Earth has no control; none. It‟s quite
something.
Life is not what the Sun/Earth brings. It‟s what the nodes bring. This is the thing
that is so interesting about the nodes. This is the river, Lao Tzu‟s river, a wonderful
river. This is the cosmic river. This is the nodes; they‟re wonderful. It is the magic
of objects moving in space. And it‟s where you are that is your life.
So, with the nodes we have to see that we need to have a totally different approach
in simply understanding that they don‟t simply represent the basic that I‟ve given

you which is that they are an environment which is nurturing in that sense. It is an
environment where one is protected against resistance. It is an environment that is
good for one in terms of quality of life and longevity. But the key to that environ-
ment is that‟s what you need in terms of what you have to do in this life, which is
you have to spend some of your time interacting with the other.
The Outside World is Not the Place You Create the Moment
Funny when you go back to the very core of Human Design and you go back to
Strategy and Authority you get to the one thing that actually makes a difference no
matter how many nuances you look at. If you‟re operating according to your Strate-
gy and Authority and you‟re Left/Right you‟re going to see right away that the out-
side world is not the place where you create the moment. The moment can only be
created for you. And if there is nothing that is happening, there is still all of this in-
formation that you‟re taking in.
But more than that, to understand something about how vulnerable your geometry
is, because that‟s what the Right represents. It represents it in that sense that you
cannot defend yourself in that environment. Let‟s say that you‟re a Left/Right per-
son and somebody has upset you. They called you on the telephone or they sent
you an email and they really pissed you off. And there is your Left strategic brain
rattling away, and of course, the mind is feeding off of that. You have a reaction to
it and all of that stuff.
But you know, if you go rushing out there to make your stand, to say your piece and
all of that stuff, it‟s going to blow up on you, because it‟s not what you‟re about. If
you have a Right external you are actually here to experience being protected by the
gods, because that‟s really what it is. If you‟re Left external you‟re always in those
environments having to take control, you have to. These are the places where you
can do that, these are the places where you can make those things happen and they
will be successful in that sense.
But not if you‟re Right; if you‟re Right life provides, the gods provide, you watch.
You move like the leaf in the stream. You wait, you watch. When you‟re out in the
world, you‟re protected. Every Right being, somewhere deep inside of them, under-
stands that. They have to because they‟re not strategic. If you‟re Left/Right, the
environments, no matter what they are, whether it is a kitchen or a mountain, the
environments are passive environments for you and you have to be passive in those
environments.
You allow everything to come to you. This is always the magic of the Right. And be-
cause you‟re going to be in the right environment doesn‟t matter if it‟s hardscape,
landscape, whatever the case may be, because you‟re going to be in the right envi-
ronment then you‟re going to get those forces that are going to move towards you,
which is going to be the thing that is correct for you. After all, the vast majority of
designs are specifically about waiting. And all of them, in the end, are about waiting.

PHS Synthesis Left / Right
As Not-Self a Right External can be a Burden
It gives a tremendous advantage to the Right external being that is on the path, that
they‟re on their way to liberating their personality. But if you are not-self having a
Right external can be a burden. It can truly be a burden and it can feel so uncom-
fortable. You‟re either trying to force your way through the environment, or you‟re
running away from the environment. So many beings need to run into themselves
and get away from their nodes. The Sun/Earth and the nodes, as I said, are very
different. There are so many beings that are running away from their nodes, run-
ning away from the environments, running away from seeing things for what they
are. It‟s so much safer for them to sit inside of their internal and dream and fantas-
ize and live in delusion about what is possible.
This process of our work and we‟re coming towards the end of our second year to-
gether in this process it has taken us into a territory that is uncharted. This is an
understanding about the nature of what it is to be human that has never, ever been
there. And it is so important for us in terms of the purpose of design to be able to
lay the foundation for those that have the good fortune, the privilege of the fractal
and their whatever—children, grandchildren, great grandchildren—to lay a platform
for correctness for a future that will demand it. And that it is in our hands to be able
to provide the keys to aligning the form to what its perfection is, to the exaltation of
the uniqueness in each of us.
It‟s one thing to understand where your nodal trajectory puts you. But it‟s very im-
portant to see what it demands of you when you step outside of the illusion of being
alone. We are so trapped within these boxes in our illusions. And this is a great
key, both physically and psychologically. And you can see that the moment that we
are dealing with color, and I think earlier Alok you made a point about that. Just as
we see that at the line level we develop the four types, we can see that there are
behavioral models, literally, these four basic behavioral models, because that‟s what
they are in a sense. How the vehicle is going to behave or how it‟s going to function
in its aloneness, how it‟s going to function with the other.
It is important to see that again we have these basic, basic structured division polari-
ties that make up what we are. We‟ve been down very deep and it is really some-
thing to climb to the surface. I‟m taking great pleasure in it, as a matter of fact, be-
cause when you go down as deep as we have gone down and you begin to climb
back up you have a whole new level of respect for the complexity of actually really
seeing a unique being.
Remember something, when you‟re looking at somebody‟s chart, we‟ve all seen
charts that look like other charts. We‟ve seen charts that look exactly like other
charts, and they don‟t have to be the same day. There is this level on the surface
that is simply sufficient for what the surface needs to do. And anyone who comes
into this knowledge, you spend a long time mastering that surface, that surface of
type and definition and profile, all of the basic things, the strategy, the authority, the
story, all of that on the surface. But that, in essence, is a generic model. It is not a
unique model. You know that and I know that. You do an overview reading, it is not
unique, it‟s generic. You‟re pointing somebody towards a strategy that they them-

selves can experience the expression of their uniqueness, but in fact in that reading
you‟re looking at what is their general imprint.
Synthesizing into One View: The Uniqueness of the Holistic Being
This is the next level. It‟s more than the next level because it involves many levels,
actively in our work, the color and tone level that as you will see as we enter into the
third year program and look at the holistic. It will also involve the bases as well, so
that all the information can then be synthesized into one view so that we can catch
the full significance of the uniqueness of that holistic being. And even at that level,
it‟s still to a certain degree generic, because there are all those other activations.
It‟s one of the delicious courses that I‟m really looking forward to next year which is
the color interpretation of the moon and the planets. There is all this other data that
is there, and each of them points towards another aspect of the uniqueness of the
being.
You are a part of the exploration of the science of differentiation. And not simply its
exploration, but each step is another brick that is laid in the foundation of this
science. And everything about Human Design is that Human Design stresses, it is its
main point, that we are all born with the potential to differentiate. It is only when
you begin to get to these levels that you begin to see the complexity and at the
same time understand how we are all nuanced this way and that way and how
unique a configuration ultimately each of us has.
This is the beauty of the knowledge, to truly bring somebody to the core of their be-
ing and to offer them, because you understand how it‟s constructed, you get to de-
rive mechanics from that, that can allow for the successful involvement in this life.
God, there is a lot of sadness in the world; all the pain and the hunger and every-
thing else. Human beings who are so deeply, deeply unaware, lost in this homogeni-
zation, not able to catch a glimpse of the magic of what it is to be them, just to be
them. Not to look across the way and see, oh, if only.
I know. I have always known, that it is simply enough to give somebody the keys
and send them on their way, because they‟re either ready or they‟re not. They‟re
either there for it or they‟re not. But I love mind. There is nothing else to do with
mind but to look, to see, to grasp. And out of that to have the pleasure of one‟s own
pure authority, one‟s outer expression. It‟s why I do this. There is no why in that,
but it is certainly a way I can describe it in terms of how it pleases me.
That is, to see it all, just to see it. To see how it‟s built. To see how it works. Each
time I see the mechanic there is still another part of me that just dissolves. All of
the things that I know, the illusions that I am aware of, the mythologies that I‟ve
mastered, all of those things, the delusions of what it is to be a creature on this
plane, every mechanical step eliminates the nonsense, the ignorance and it places
you in a place of wonder. How incredible it is. It‟s a fantastic mechanism, the maia.
And there is a key.

PHS Synthesis Left / Right
All our history, humanity has looked for the keys. It‟s the key. It literally explains
how it all works. And all you have to do is live it. That‟s the story. It‟s nice to know
if you‟re Left/Right, what it means. But if you‟re honoring your Strategy and Au-
thority and your mind is a good passenger, it‟s not like you had to know, you didn‟t.
There are other things that will be so much more interesting in your uniqueness. We
all have things that are there for us, that wait for us on the intellectual plane when
the passenger is liberated. We all have our gifts, our perceptions, our truths.
Begin to Look at Charts
Anyway, the Left/Right business, one of the things that I suggest is that you start
doing simple holistic—take somebody‟s chart and write on the design side whether
they are Left/Left or Left/Right. Write on the personality side whether they‟re
Left/Right or Right/Left or Right/Right. Think about it; think about what it tells you.
It‟s your outer authority ultimately that matters. Those on your fractal line who wait
for your outer authority, they expect that wisdom from you. You need to begin to
feel it, not simply just see it within yourself and recognize it within yourself, but be-
gin to recognize it as patterns in others. Begin to intuit or imagine what it means in
terms of them as a being, what it brings into their lives, where the problems are.
But most of all, it‟s about beginning to see that if you‟re really to master this know-
ledge, you have to be able to see that there are very, very powerful unitary forces
that stand alone, that only through an act of synthesis can be pulled together into
something that is truly holistic. It‟s the thing to see that the Sun/Earth and the de-
sign nodes have nothing to do with each other. They really don‟t. And yet, within
the illusion of our being from the work of the monopole it is all brought together in
this holistic process that we call our existence. And by understanding what they de-
mand on their own, what their nature is on their own, then the ability ultimately to
be able to see what is our true behavioral model, and we all have one, that holistic
behavioral model that is precisely the nature of the cross that you incarnated on.
And it is that nature that fulfills the purpose of that process. It is what we offer in
the knowledge to others, the potential to fulfill one‟s purpose as oneself.
Ok, that‟s all I have today. We‟ll take a look at the Right next week and we will en-
ter into very different territory, but we‟ll see. To all of you, you take care; until next
time, bye for now.

PHS Synthesis: Right / Left
Ok, welcome to our continuation of our introduction to PHS synthesis. We move to a
different territory today. That is, we move to the combination of the Right and the
Left. That is, the Right internal and the Left external. We‟ve been looking at the two
variations of internal that have been Left. In looking at the Left obviously we have a
very basic kind of construct in which we have a tendency to try to interpret that into
the life. That is, for example, to see the fact that the internal is active is an assump-
tion that the vehicle itself is going to be active. That isn‟t necessarily so.
That is, we know that the internal workings, that is, the way that the brain operates,
the way in which the basic receptivity operates that this is where there is going to be
the activity, the action. Again, here when we‟re looking at the passive the assump-
tion can also be that this is a necessarily a passive being, as I will show you today in
this combination of Right/Left, that it can be very, very misleading to jump to that
conclusion.
Let‟s begin with a couple of things. After all, the thing that is absolutely essential is
this grasping of the difference between what is for the self, that is, what is essential-
ly a totally personal aspect and what is in fact one‟s potential or what happens to
one when one is in an environment with others. It makes for very different informa-
tion. We know that when you enter into your process of operating correctly as your-
self that the greatest transformation is taking place in the internal and in the inter-
nal, relative to what we‟re looking at in terms of this configuration on the right, that
what we have here is that this is a key in being able to understand the way in which
this brain system is going to operate.
One of the things that we know right away about the Right system is that we have a
very different kind of brain that is being built. As a matter of fact, if we think about
the way the mutative process has been operating since 1781, that is, our movement
away from the seven-centered dominance of the Left and the opening up of the mu-
tation because in fact the Right is a mutation that emerged in 1781 with a nine-
centered being. The fact that this is mutative means that the way in which this brain
system operates, or its variations operate is in a sense diametrically different from
the way in which the Left had operated traditionally or historically in the seven-
centered being.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
The Right: No Focusing Orientation
What we‟re dealing with the Right is a brain that does not have a focusing orienta-
tion, or a focusing way in which it processes information. In other words, when
we‟re looking at a Left brain, we‟re looking at a brain that is designed to work with
specific focused information. In other words, the work on developing that brain is a
relative amount of memory with a high potential of being able to play with the mem-
ory feedback and being able to take advantage of that stored information, ultimately
through the personality.
So what we have with the strategic brain is that we have a kind of limitation on the
way in which its memory system was designed. It‟s the one thing one notices about
a strategic brain. That is, it can be very smart, but it‟s very limited in the range of
that smartness. In other words, there is a focus where it is going to be able to pro-
vide certain potential to the personality, but that‟s the limitation of it. And obviously,
that limitation is fine if one is correct, that limitation when one is in transference can
be quite a dilemma.
When we‟re looking at the Right, though, because we are looking at something that
is deeply mutative and we are looking at something that, in essence, has yet to fully
emerge. That is, the potential that we associate with the Right, that is the potential
that can only be realized in the rave, that is, the post-2027, the true rave in that
sense, we are limited in the way in which we can look at it. We are looking at work
in progress. It‟s something to keep in mind. That is, it‟s one of my great joys to be

able to be an existential participant in evolution. Human Design has made that poss-
ible for me. Of all of the knowledge that I‟ve garnered in my work in Design there is
nothing that gives me a deeper sense of wonder and sense of privilege than it is to
actually see where I stand or where we stand in the turning of the wheel. And to
understand what is before and to see very clearly, because it is mechanical, to see
what is there and what will follow.
What we‟re dealing with when we‟re looking at the Right brain is that we‟re looking
at a brain and mutation in which the focusing potential of the neo-cortex, particularly
through the visual cortex that this is no longer where the stress is, if I can use that
language. That is, where the mutative process is pointed at. One of the things
that‟s very interesting about changes in levels of consciousness is that certain things
diminish as other certain things improve. For example, the advent of binary vision is
something that put a damper on the potential of the olfactory system. It was just a
natural process.
The Right Gives Up Some Strategic Focus Potential
And one of the things that‟s interesting about the Right is that it gives up a certain
amount of strategic focus potential. In other words, this is where there is a dimi-
nishment of a potential, or what was a potential. One could even say that it was a
negative mutation. It is not, but in the sense of the Left, the Left could consider it
so. That is, a mind that doesn‟t appear or the potential of a mind that would not ap-
pear to be ready to handle in initiation—again, not-self—to be able to handle the
strategic processes necessary for survival.
But of course, what we‟re looking at in this mutation is that the stress is being placed
on memory. In other words, it‟s one of the things that we‟ve seen, for example, in
the advent of the personal computer. I‟m not the oldest veteran of the computer,
but I have been working with computers since 1992. One of the things that is so ob-
vious about computers is that they were deeply disadvantaged by their limitation of
memory.
I can remember having one of the very earliest laptops that I was taking on my first
trip to America. I think it was in 1994. I had the very, very first rudimentary calcu-
lation program, really rudimentary. And in order to get that into the computer, eve-
rything in the computer had to be taken out. I couldn‟t write on that computer, I
couldn‟t draw, I couldn‟t email. I couldn‟t do anything. The only thing it could do
was run that program, which it was amazing that it even did that, quite frankly. And
it was a memory problem.
One of the things you notice about a memory problem is that you‟re very limited in
what you can do. You have to work with the information that you have. Of course,
this is the nature of the strategic mind. What that means is given that the strategic
is a limitation, that is, the strategic brain in that sense is a limitation, it‟s only in ful-
filling that limitation that you succeed. And of course, that was the whole point in
the evolutionary development of the Left, that deep, deep focus on survival led to
what we have today as culture and civilization.

Introduction to Systems Analysis
But now we have something else happening, it‟s not now, it‟s been going on in this
whole Pluto interregnum since 1781. What‟s going on now is that there are human
beings that are coming into the world, approximately about 50% of them are going
to be coming into the world and they come in with a brain system that is built on ex-
pansion of memory at the cost of having initiating tools. Basically, what that means
is that rather than a brain that sets up the mind for strategic purposes, you have a
brain that doesn‟t set up the mind at all. In other words, there is no natural focusing
on anything. It can lead to a mind that wonders about what it has. Or what it
doesn‟t have.
Memory
Of course, what‟s going on is that there is this vast opening up of the potential of
memory. I want to talk to you about memory for a moment, storage capacity ac-
tually. The storage capacity is an interesting thing. You have a lot of physicists on
the planet, very serious people trying to figure out how to develop a quantum com-
puter. And the quantum domain is very different from the domain of relativity. That
is, the quantum domain is the rules that exist when one goes beneath the surface of
the relative illusion. That is, when one gets down to subatomic particles.
Theoretically a quantum computer would be capable of having more memory than
everything stored in the universe and then more memory, because in essence theo-
retically speaking there is no limit. I remember being deeply moved by a story by
Jorge Luis Borges called Funes, the Memorius about this man that suddenly has
complete memory, a classic Right in a way, astonishing memory. That is, he re-
members every blade of grass. It is so much memory that it could fill up all of time
just to ponder a fragment of a moment of such memory.
Then you think about the nature of the brain. The brain is unbelievable, isn‟t it? It‟s
just unbelievable. That‟s the thing that‟s so delightful. If you ever see one, I‟ve
seen them in jars, that kind of thing, science labs, it‟s just a wonder. The ancients
had no idea what all that was; it sort of didn‟t make any sense to them whatsoever.
They thought the seat of the consciousness was in the heart. Just the function of the
brain—the thing that gives us so called quality of intelligence is neurons firing, liter-
ally, sparks, if you will. It‟s all in the sparks, so to speak.
That sparking, which is phenomenal in and of itself, the electricity of the brain is re-
ally something to ponder. It took three generations of stars to produce the atomic
elements necessary in order for our neurons to spark, which I think is a delightful
inheritance from our stellar source, our true ancestors, in that sense. Not to digress
even further, but they just released photographs from the most distant galaxies that
they have ever seen, which means the furthest back in time. They calculate the big
bang at about 13.5 billion years ago, at least that‟s the recent sort of standard they
use. And they have seen objects now that are approximately 500 million years old,
which means that basically speaking the baby stage of the universe.

PHS Synthesis Right / Left
This is Access Mutation
It was from those original galaxies that the stars would be born that would give birth
to the stars that would be born that gave birth to the firing of the neurons in our
brain. I don‟t know, perhaps it‟s just that I‟m a romantic, but I find that to be rather
spectacular. Then you think about the way the brain works and you being to realize
that the brain operates relatively speaking with a quantum mechanic. That is, sto-
rage space in the brain is actually infinite. It‟s access that‟s the problem. And this is
where the mutation of the Right is taking place. This is access mutation.
The way in which the Left brain gets to focus in order to lay out the strategic poten-
tial, the Right brain uses what are probably the same agencies through mutation to
simply open up new systems of access, a kind of inward focus instead of outward
focus, if I can put it that way; and rather than an outward focus, an inward peri-
phery, or an inward spreading. One of the things that‟s interesting for me about the
Right brain is that it is a collection mechanism. And it is a collection mechanism that
is focused through an access system. And it‟s this access system that makes the
Right so unusual. It just does.
Both the Left and the Right brain, in the experience of life, in the quantum sense of
the word, all things could be stored, everything, every blade of grass. But the Left
cuts it off in order to form the strategic frame. And the Right, in a sense, narrows it
enough so that it can create access lines so that it can be at some point or another
brought back to the surface. But there‟s nothing built in to bring it to the surface of
the mind, whereas with the Left it is there to be brought to the surface of the mind.
So the moment that we move over to this passive, it‟s a kind of misnomer, isn‟t it, in
a way. This is actually not a brain without its high level of activity. It‟s simply not
doing anything but streaming the information into different areas, rather than work-
ing with the information and trying to create a frame for the mind. But it appears to
be passive in the sense that you do not get a focused response from these beings.
These are passive bodies. And when they‟re by themselves, and again this is one of
the real keys for today is what happens when you go Right/Left. Because the Right
is all about the being, it‟s only about the being.
For the Right, PHS is Very Soothing
And of course, we understand quite clearly that at least in terms of an adult, because
I think for children it‟s self-explanatory, but in terms of an adult the greater gifts that
are inherent in that accessing ability are things that can only be honed and enhanced
by PHS. And it is something that I think needs to be stressed particularly to those
that are Right and particularly Right bodies because I think that PHS for a Right body
is something that is very, very soothing, because it takes a lot of the conditioned
energy away from the problem of being Right in a Left world.
Despite the fact that half of the population is going to have Rightness in one way or
another, the reality is that we still live in a Left conditioned environment. And that
the Left conditioned world that we live in puts stress on both the Right personality,

Introduction to Systems Analysis
where it puts incredible stress; where you see the greatest distortion of personality is
the Right personality having to deal with Left personality consciousness and its not-
self power. And then of course when you‟re dealing with a Right body, the Right
body can be soothed much more and much more quickly with the addition of PHS in
the process.
Now, as I say that, in my class earlier today I was really stressing in terms of PHS
what we talked about last year which of course is that people have to be ready for
this. They do. Because one of the things about the holistic process is that first of all
it must begin in yourself. It can‟t start anywhere else. It can‟t start with you disco-
vering and working it out with your relationship or this or that or whatever. There is
a period in which this is something that is just about you. And of course, when it‟s
just about you, and when you can come to grips with this “just about you,” then you
can begin to satisfy the demands of what it is to be Right.
The Need to Free Your Vehicle from Conditioning
First of all, you need to free your vehicle from as much conditioning as possible, be-
cause it‟s all Left conditioning. And you need to free your vehicle of that. Now ob-
viously Strategy and Authority is the beginning of that process; but as I said, given
that the Right has been more deeply homogenized since it arrived in 1781, much
more homogenized than the Left, that PHS is something that can be very, very bene-
ficial. Needless to say, and obvious to say, that it is essential for Right design child-
ren. If your child has a Right internal it is so important to grasp what that means.
Now, you cannot equate that to their personality, please understand that. As I men-
tioned at the beginning of this introduction a couple of weeks ago that I am setting
the foundation for what will be a holistic training so you can see how to look at your
client from the complete perspective of both the PHS and the Rave Psychology point
of view in terms of seeing the holistic framework. And the holistic framework is four
elements. That is, it is the internal and external, both personality and design. So
we have four elements in that mix.
I‟m three parts Left and one part Right. There are many variations in all of that.
And it‟s only when you can see the being completely that this knowledge, what I‟m
introducing to you now, can begin to be integrated successfully in understanding of
the being. As I warned you, please be careful about taking this deconstructed pers-
pective and applying it to a being, or to yourself. That is obviously you‟re seeing
things, there‟s no question about that. But that‟s not the point. The point of all of
this is to get us to a place in which we can finally as professionals with the most pro-
found training of any professionals that I‟ve ever trained have the ability to really see
in a depth that has never been available, to really see the holistic being and to see
everything that makes up the basic components of what it is that they are and can
be and how they can be helped.
And you see, the moment you look at this Right brain, this Right internal, don‟t jump
to conclusions that this is the way the personality is going to be. The fact that there
is going to be this passive brain structure, we‟re going to see what happens when

140
Lecture Ten
PHS Synthesis Right / Left
this passive brain structure has a strategic personality. It becomes something else.
This is the magic of a binary. Wherever you look in Human Design the mechanics
will say to you “here‟s this and here‟s that.” But what you get is the binary turning
into something that is quantum, something that is greater than the sum of its parts.
We‟re looking at parts still. And you need to see them as parts.
What is important for us to understand about the Right is the demands that are
there in terms of the fact that this is a mutative brain and if it is not properly nou-
rished, that mutation is going to fail. And literally you will have somebody who
physically from the brain point of view, from the internal point of view is beyond be-
ing helped. And there will be all the resistance that goes with it. And this is a lot of
people on the planet.
This is something to grasp. We live on a planet of the not-self. Half of humanity
that might be born with an internal Right, that‟s a system that can be so conditioned
by the Left, burnt out, in that sense, from it. And of course, suffer the consequences
of it because the way they can operate in a strategic world is very, very limited. And
given that the not-self personality is only interested in initiating the resistance that
builds up can actually be enormous, and the discomfort of what it can be like when
one doesn‟t seem to have the equipment to be able to deal with the world, the way
in which others deal with the world or in the way in which it is expected of you to
deal with the world.
The Nodes
Now we shift over to the nodes. Again, I want you to recognize the difference be-
tween the personal and the impersonal in this. Everything about the Sun/Earth is
personal, it‟s deeply, deeply in-your-face personal. We get 70% of our programming
from the sun. This is where we live, this plane on this earth. And it is the interplay
of sun and earth that brings us our personal, that is, the personal of what we call the
internal. It‟s about us. It is our inner system. It is the way in which our inner sys-
tem can be properly nourished. And obviously, this is a key in all of this, and for its
sensory potential to be enhanced, its capacity, in this case, to be able to store, how-
ever the storage works—smell, the taste, you name it however you look at it, all of
the various things that go along.
But when we get to the nodes we are no longer dealing with the personal. It‟s not
personal. It‟s not about us. I can‟t stress that enough. It isn‟t about us. It is a
guideline that comes from beyond. That is, it‟s stellar. I want to repeat it again and
again and again, the Sun/Earth and the nodes are incredibly different from each oth-
er in every way you can imagine. And it is one of the things to grasp that you can-
not equate what is the nodal configuration with you as a personal thing; it‟s not a
personal thing. It is actually the force that is driving you to meet the other. It is the
great fractal engine.
I talk a lot about fractals. It‟s your nodes that align you to what is going to be the
correct places and beings for you in this life. It aligns you to those connections,
those fractal connections that are going to be either of great value to you or great

value to the other. But it isn‟t about you personally. And it is one of the things that
is different or difficult to grasp is that here you can have somebody who is Right,
who is passive, who is an absorber, and yet the moment that they are in the outer
environment and they meet the other they become very active, because they‟re Left.
Things happen to them in these environments. This is where the action is for them.
And you can be fooled into thinking that, aha, they‟re strategic or they‟re active, but
they‟re not. It‟s what happens to them when they‟re in the environment that they
resonate to because this is what is correct for them. If you could see them through
a magnifying glass, if you could spy on them, watch them while they were alone, you
wouldn‟t see any movement. You wouldn‟t see any kind of need for movement. It
isn‟t that they would be absolutely still. I‟m not suggesting that. But the moment
that you see them in their environment you will see that they are full of movement in
that environment, relative to what it is.
This is the place where they meet the other, and when they meet the other they
meet the other actively. They get involved with the other, when in fact, when
they‟re on their own it‟s the last thing that they want. It‟s the last thing that their
body is ready for. It just isn‟t. It tells you a lot about the Right/Left vehicle when
it‟s not correct, how easily exhausted it is in its social interactions, because the social
interactions are going to draw out the Left frequency. And yet because it‟s not cor-
rect for them, they will be in transference, they will not have the cognitive advan-
tage, they will not be in the environment necessarily that is correct for them unless
it‟s serendipity. And it‟s going to make them physically uncomfortable.
Our Personalities are Minds
Our personalities are minds. They‟re deeply engrossed. And the mind tries to con-
trol the vehicle. And it can be very disturbed in this. When the vehicle is operating
correctly there is a—I was going to say frequency, I don‟t know how to describe it,
it‟s like a hum. It‟s one of the things to understand about these vehicles, they are
absolutely incredible. And they can be perfected as vehicles as well as any bio-form
can be perfected, that it can be healthy, that it can operate according to what is its
specific nature.
No concept is more important to grasp than the fact that this is the science of diffe-
rentiation. That this is the ability not simply to look at this larger generic of the
Right and the Left, but the nuances that are there, how extraordinary it is that there
is a map for us to see precisely what is correct for the vehicle, so easy in a sense to
heal the vehicle. In adults it takes time. And I think that there are many adults that
no matter what you do for them you cannot help them.
But the fact is that those that are able to go through this process, that is beginning
to understand that the perfection of what it is to be us is something that we can see
as a signpost when we are living out the authority of our inner decision making, and
we find ourselves operating in the outer environment with the other the way we were
intended to, because that‟s where you arrive. And you begin to go to this very, very
deep level of accepting self, of understanding it.

PHS Synthesis Right / Left
And we have an unusual obligation. After all, this is the first true mind mapping
knowledge, body mapping knowledge that humanity has had. There is no other
knowledge on this plane that is able to look into and lay out the construct of what it
is to be. The nature of the Left and the Right is revolutionary in understanding both
the nature of the body and the mind, but more than that, in finally being able to
come to grips with the fact that mechanically that we are nothing but mechanisms
and in being mechanisms and in understanding the nature of the mechanism that we
have not simply the tools, but the Right to perfect these mechanisms.
And in the end, it is not a difficult thing. It simply has to be choiceless for you. You
cannot choose this journey in Human Design. No vanity can manage that. It hap-
pens. And the years, as they go by, you hold to those years because it is choiceless.
It is not so for all; it cannot be so for all. Again, this knowledge is for children. The
journey of every adult, every student that I have ever had has earned my respect
simply by being there, because there are so many who will never be there; never,
never, never.
An Obligation to Understand the Evolution of Our Times
We have an obligation in understanding the evolution of our times, in understanding
the transformation that has taken place. You see, science is seven-centered, so is
medicine. It‟s all seven centered. It‟s all rooted in seven-centered strategic aware-
ness, all of it. And there‟s something else at work. We are the ones that carry the
knowledge. And it is a responsibility to do what we can for those that are Right.
Now, I‟ve mentioned it before that being Right is much more severe as a problem or
a handicap in the path of any kind of awakening on the personality side than it is on
the design side. This is the thing that over and over again the deeper you go into
the knowledge, the more you have to come back to the surface and see that bringing
somebody to Strategy and Authority is THE story, because this is where everything
begins.
Most people in Design constantly need to remind themselves, no matter how long
you‟ve been in the process—in my DreamRave classes, I talk about how the moment
that you lie down and you go to sleep your personality disconnects and the forces,
crystal consciousness filters deep, deep conditioning through you, conditioning that is
there to make sure that you remain homogenized as a conscious being when you
awaken. And one of the things that I remind or tell to those students is that when
you wake up in the morning the most important thing is to remember who you are.
And to remember who you are within the context of what is correct for you and what
is correct for you in this life.
We Make Up the Maia
We make up the maia. Understand that; it is illusion, we make it up. We wake up in
the morning, we make it up. If you wake up in the morning that you have a prob-

lem, or you have a “this or that” that you have to deal with, you‟ve made up the not-
self maia of your life for the day. No matter how smart we get in terms of the infor-
mation that we have, the integrity, the dignity that is inherent in this knowledge is in
its simplest, basic truths. You wake up each day as yourself and you operate during
that day as yourself according to your inner authority. This is the revolution. The
revolution is stripping the mind of being the boss, this is the revolution.
The yin is smiling at last. This is the revolution. And Strategy and Authority for all
those beings that you‟re going to deal with in your work, boy you remind them this is
the movie. This is what it‟s all about, because it begins this process of aligning the
internal to its true nature. It doesn‟t mean that automatically you are going to be
aligned to your nodal, because remember the nodal is different. Your vehicle begins
to align to the right trajectory through the accumulation of decisions. This is how it
works; this is how you build a life. A life is built on one decision after the other,
nothing else. It‟s not complex. It really isn‟t. Every life is built this way; one deci-
sion after the other.
And when you‟re operating correctly as yourself and you‟re an adult you have a lot of
crap to get rid of, a lot in your body and a vast amount in your personality con-
sciousness. But the first thing you have to be is correct to yourself at the internal
level because it connects you to your cognition. It is the opening up of that cognitive
flow that begins to align you not simply to your direction but to the environment that
is going to be correct for you. It opens up the eyes of the personality. This is the
moment when somebody says I‟m seeing life differently. The three weeks into De-
sign, they‟re seeing life differently. Yes, that‟s right, because decision making aligns
your vehicle. And when you‟re aligned nodally, this crosses; it goes from the design
side to the personality side.
Life is Held Together by the Magnetic Monopole
Ah, the nodes are so different from the Sun/Earths. You only begin to understand
the node when you think monopole. The holistic life is held together by the magnetic
monopole. This is the agent of life. That is, the agent of the maia, the framework
upon which the entire maia is built, it‟s all monopole work. It holds you together in
the illusion of your separateness, moves you along in your line of geometry, the old-
est mantra I have in Human Design. This is the monopole.
And the monopole has a cabal with the design, we know that. We start it off in year
one in the first semester looking at conception mechanics and there we are, the first
88 degrees of life. There‟s no personality. There is a design and the monopole doing
their work, what only they can do, because they are the agents of existence. They
do not need the input of personality consciousness. And they have a very special
and unique relationship. The first thing that you begin to understand when you de-
construct the body into its design and personality components is that the further
down you go the more you realize how different they are from each other.
In PHS we work with tone/color fixing. There is no such thing in the personality.
The relationship between tone and color at the design side is totally different than its

relationship on the personality side. And the monopole in its relationship to the de-
sign; well, here we are. Here we are with the design with its Sun/Earth and its
nodes. And where the design has its direct relationship to the internal, the monopole
has that direct relationship to the external. And the frequency, that frequency, when
it is correct, when you enter into that strategy that is correct for you, that inner au-
thority that is correct for you, the monopole frequency relative to the nodes, you be-
gin to align and it travels through to the other side. That the personality looks out
through eyes that see something different. And it says I see things differently.
Now whether the personality itself can grasp what it sees is another story and the
most difficult one in the holistic being. But I want you to grasp the power of the
nodes to align you to your life, your purpose, everything. What you are by yourself
is only the foundation of the well-being of your existence, that you‟re properly nou-
rished, that you‟re sensory equipped, that you have general well-being in the form,
and then you‟re ready for the world, you‟re ready for the outside, you‟re ready for
the other. And you‟re taken on the journey, the monopole journey, the driver. You
get linked in.
It‟s a great power, the power of the monopole. And directly that decision to operate
correctly as yourself, you‟re basically opening up three components within you. They
can begin to function and function correctly. It doesn‟t mean they function to their
full potential, it does not. The alignment to your nodal trajectory, the alignment to
the geometry that the nodes get from the frequency of the monopole does not mean
that you‟re being brought directly to the correct environment. Think about it as
somebody who is lost and that they finally get a map that gives them the way. They
don‟t right away directly go to where they want to be. They have to follow a trail;
they have to follow a path to get there.
As an adult, as you clean out your system, slowly but surely you begin to align your
vehicle deeper and deeper and deeper to this geometry of the nodes, this direction of
the monopole. I‟m fascinated by the fact that these four components, the internal
and external, both design and personality that they‟re so different from each other.
The closest is the nodes, and even they, in the way ultimately they function, though
they connect in the way I just described so that the personality nodes, because they
are about what the mind sees, has its seeing altered simply because the body is
looking in a new direction, the body is operating differently. But the functions are
very, very different from each other. They‟re all different. We‟re nothing but com-
ponents.
Talk about mechanisms. When you study the history of evolution you see the way
life was built on components. It‟s like our cells themselves were once parts of them,
independent and separate, somewhere a few billion years back, all these components
coming together building one on top of the other until you have the whole picture,
the whole thing.
It takes an enormous amount of study to master all this knowledge, you know that.
And yet, it takes a simple act to live it all out without never having to know it. It is
what is so beautiful in the end. Operating according to Strategy and Authority brings
you everything but peace of mind. That, in and of itself, is a vast transformation in

the life. And when I say it doesn‟t bring peace of mind, the mind has to totally let go
in order for it to find itself. That‟s another process, and a very profound one. And
yet, at the same time it‟s also mechanical. It‟s what I teach at this level in Rave
Psychology, the mechanical technique of slowly but surely releasing the personality
from its seven-centered history and the delusions of being in charge.
The Not-Self Personality is Both Inner and Outer Authority
It‟s one of those things that I‟ve been talking about lately that is so obvious, is that
you can only begin to—people ask me every once in awhile about whether I know
people who are awake and things like that. You can tell by the way they communi-
cate. That‟s how you know. It‟s the nature of their outer authority. This is the
whole thing to understand ultimately about the personality. In the not-self the per-
sonality is both inner and outer authority, you can‟t be both inner and outer authori-
ty without being corrupt. You can‟t. The truth gets corrupted, communication gets
corrupted, and you can‟t avoid it. The moment your inner and outer authority, what
you‟re going to say is conditioned by what you want, what you need, what you care
about. And out of that comes distortion.
You can tell when somebody is telling you something for the joy of telling you, or
telling you because they want something out of it. And just about everything that
anyone ever tells you, they want something out of it. There is an agenda behind it.
They can‟t avoid it because they‟re both inner and outer authority, so everything is a
kind of game—what you can say, what you hide.
It‟s so interesting in human beings, they lie all the time. We know that. All human
beings lie. They don‟t have to be big lies, massive terrible things, but everybody
lies. That‟s the not-self. You have no choice. If your inner and outer authority is
the mind, you‟re going to lie a lot. You can see that in speech patterns in the way
we greet each other in the formulas we use. “How are you doing?” “Fine, thanks.”
Lie—most of the time. It‟s just the way we are. This is the not-self. This is when
the inner and outer authority trap you and keep you forever from the truth.
Inner Authority Saves Your Life
Our goal in PHS is that we are here to serve the form in a way that it has never been
served before, because we understand that the basket case is the personality, and
that the form can be saved, that the life can be saved. You don‟t have to be awake
as a personality to benefit from your life being saved. It is what design is all about.
It is what inner authority is about; it saves your life. It puts you on a track towards
things that will work for you that are correct for you.
And in the end it isn‟t going to matter much for most beings, whether or not their
personality totally grasps it or not, whether it can let go or not. Again, these are
choiceless things. But the life has been enriched because the life has been saved. If
you‟re going to travel this path, to go beyond what it is to simply meet knowledge,
but to be fully transformed by knowledge, then you can see there is a step-by-step

process in all of this. That process of first coming into the knowledge and surrender-
ing to the experiment, living long enough in the experiment to discover it has be-
come your process. And through that process enter into a movement in your life
that is correct for you.
The step that follows that is the transformation of the system that you have to full
functionality and potential, that‟s PHS, the ability to be able to transform the way in
which one is nourished, and in doing so be able to enhance as much as possible the
potential of the internal system. And all of that leads to an ultimate finding of one‟s
correct place, the physical environment that is correct for you in terms of your inte-
raction with others. And to recognize that these environments are environments
that have a natural pull to you over time.
And once you‟re in such a place, everything is there and everything is in place. You
have your well-being and the quality of your life. And your eyes can see what is
there to be seen. And all that is Left is the surrender of the personality. It‟s holistic
work. It‟s why it‟s very important for me that the students both in Rave Psychology
and PHS have an opportunity to have the basic keys they need to see the other side
and to be able to integrate the two together. I‟ve never taught anything in such de-
tail for so long. Obviously, in September we go into our third and final year, which is
a very, very complex year.
There‟s nothing quite as exciting to me as the idea of for the first time in 20 years to
teach a new analysis technique of the BodyGraph at a level that is the direct result of
20 years of work in the knowledge. It‟s something very exciting and something very
enjoyable for me. It motivates me to be very focused—I‟m a strategic being—in this
work.
Anyway, that‟s what I have for you today. To all of you, you take care and next
week we come to the end of our story of the year; well, I‟ll see you then. Until then
you take care; bye for now.

PHS Synthesis: Right / Right
I have a brief piece that I want to cover in terms of our theme, the PHS Synthesis,
the Right/Right, but I also want to spend some time with you explaining next year‟s
program. There is, obviously, going to be an open house and there actually will be a
few of them. But because this is a highly specialized program it‟s not something that
I am going to mention in detail at all in the open house so it‟s something that I want
to discuss with you so you have an idea about where the program is headed and
what my goals are for that.
The Right/Right
But first of all let‟s get to our theme. Interestingly enough in doing the first year
class earlier the theme was the great divide, something that you might remember
last year when we closed, that is, the beginnings of my introduction to you of the

Introduction to Systems Analysis
differences of the Left and the Right and where all of that leads to. And here in this
PHS when we‟re looking at the Right/Right what we‟re looking at is the physical re-
quirements for a rave. When the raves are going to be born, they‟re going to be
born quadruple Right. That is, they‟re going to be Right/Right internal and external,
both design and personality. This is the mutation.
What you have here is the actual mutative form, or the potential for the mutation.
Now, of course, there is a dilemma in all of this speaking of it in terms of mutation is
the understanding that all of this is dependent on something else. That is, it is de-
pendent on the mutation of the wave pattern of a Solar Plexus system. Without the
mutation of the wave pattern in the Solar Plexus system we are not going to have
the emergence of the eventual rave, in that sense. The mutation could not succeed.
It is only with this mutation of the Solar Plexus, the mutation we followed in histidine
in the 55th and 49th hexagrams, that this mutation is going to change the wave prin-
ciple of the emotional system as such allowing the awareness potential, or the neural
awareness potential of the Solar Plexus to begin to emerge is that it‟s only when this
takes place, that this quadruple Right combination is going to lead to the birth of a
rave.
And as we know, this is not something that—if you were a woman and pregnant and
you were told that you were about to have a Right/Right, Right/Right baby, I don‟t
think that you would be particularly excited or thrilled, because the fact of the matter
is that post-2027 what you‟re really looking at is giving birth to something that is
not, in that sense, human. I mean not human. And not human in the sense that
even though it is going to have the physical dimensionality of what will be a human
child that it is going to have a totally different functionality. That is, it is going to
have very poor muscle control, and it is going to have weak vision. There are many,
many things about it that are going to be incredibly different. It is also going to ap-
pear to be severely handicapped. And it is the kind of child, the merging into the
world that in our modern circumstances would appear to be a candidate for imme-
diate institutionalization. So, we‟re talking about something rather odd here.
Where it is also making the suggestion, and I don‟t know because I have not seen
the charts, what the dynamic of what the quadruple Right can possibly be in terms of
what we are as this interregnum prior to this transition and the emergence of the
mutation. It is obvious to me that the thing that shadows it is always, of course, the
conditioning, and particularly the Left strategic conditioning that the mental side of
this, or the personality side of this is going to succumb to.
And obviously, the conditioning of this fetus anyway, like most fetus‟ coming into the
world, when they emerge in the world they‟re emerging into a dietary regimen that
is not going to be something that is going to be conducive to them maintaining their
uniqueness. So the examples, even if they exist right now, of quadruple Right are
deeply conditioned forces.

PHS Synthesis Right / Right
A Deeply Sensitive Vehicle
My assumption is they are very vulnerable physically if not psychically. But they are
certainly going to be very vulnerable on the physical plane. And it‟s interesting to
note that the body is the life, after all. I just had this wonderful thought because it‟s
a great juxtaposition to what is ahead. When you think about the rave, the rave
gives up itself completely in a penta. There is no self. It simply is a receptive aspect
of penta. But it is different. That is, the mutation of the Solar Plexus and the way in
which this integrates into the auric configuration, after all, anyone who has a Right
vehicle has a vehicle that is deeply, deeply sensitive, and sensitive potentially at a
level that we are certainly unfamiliar with.
Of course, all of this is being offered to, it‟s not even being offered, it is simply the
by-product of the rave gathering in a penta is the conscious penta. And what is so
interesting is that this complete turning over to the conscious penta becomes the
life. And for us, it is the body that is the life. And it‟s interesting to note that this is
where this real transition is taking place, this mutation is taking place in the form.
A Natural Tendency to Surrender Authority to Others
Somebody who is Right/Right has a mutative brain and has a mutative way in which
they interact with others. Their very receptivity without it being understood could
open themselves up to powerful manipulation or conditioning of the other. Think of
the Right/Right body as a body that has a natural tendency to surrender authority to
others, to surrender its authority entirely, to turn its authority over to a larger force,
a more powerful force. So there is a deep tendency in the Right/Right vehicle to lit-
erally be overwhelmed by conditioning. And of course, the whole potential of the
Right then becomes questionable. That is, it is one of the things to grasp about the
nature of mutation. The moment that any kind of mutative force appears on this
plane, we‟ve had this mutation at work since 1781, in order for this mutation to sur-
vive it has to flower.
The actual flowering will be not the birth of the first rave because that doesn‟t mean
anything. It doesn‟t anything until there is a penta, because only when there is a
penta is the next life force actually going to emerge, because that‟s how it emerges.
It emerges out of that selfless receptive, passive offering of potential. Now, every
time you have a mutative form and the mutative form is not treated correctly or is
not able to establish a foothold as a mutation, then you know that it is going to be
discarded. Nature is cruel. And it‟s at its cruelest with failed mutation. You didn‟t
work; no point. There have been millions of variations of life on this planet. Most of
them have already died out. Evolution is cruel with mutations that do not serve the
purpose.
The Vehicle That Will Give Birth to the Rave
And of course, the purpose is established here that this is the body that will give
birth to, this is the vehicle that will give birth to the rave. It‟s interesting to think

about it. This Right/Right is a rave vehicle. I don‟t know what the genetic combina-
tions are. That is, what the couple is going to look like that produces the
Right/Right, Right/Right child. It will be very interesting statistically, and it‟s some-
thing that I have in my wish list for programming to be able to program the hap-
penstance of the Right/Right, Right/Right in a time sequence to understand how
many times that appears on a regular basis on an hour-by-hour basis, because we‟re
talking about tone shifting and we‟re talking about tiny little degrees of arc. It‟s fas-
cinating in that sense to think about being able to look at windows of emergence, if
you will.
The other thing that is so interesting and something that I will talk about later when
I talk about the third year is the consequence of the other side, in other words, the
balance, that is, the Right/Right in terms of the personality. Do any of you, by the
way, know anyone who is quadruple Right, in any of the research you‟ve looked at,
or any of the people that you know in your life? Do any of you know somebody who
is quad-Right?
Well, you have to send me an email and tell me what you find unusual about them,
because it‟s something. It‟s very interesting to think about mutations when their
time isn‟t right. It‟s one of the things that I‟ve talked about for many, many years
when I started to talk about what‟s coming in 2027 and I began to talk about autism
and prostate cancer and the impact of this mutation and the way in which this muta-
tion, the lead up to the mutation, when the timing isn‟t right and the exact elements
are there, what is the impact of that.
Of course, I have been able to see the impact negatively in that in many different
areas. It‟s interesting to look at the quadruple Right configuration and to recognize
that this is a potentially very fragile being. And obviously, how important it is to be
able to nurture them in terms of what is correct for them and what will be effective
for them in being able to take advantage in their form with what they are.
But in the deconstruction of all of this, to really get you to have this sense of seeing
the power of mutation at work, we are carrying this within us. This is really what the
story is. We‟re going to give birth to the next. That‟s why we‟re not seven-centered.
It‟s why we‟re not that past, why we‟re not really human. It is this mixing, this inte-
gration graph, what we are, neither this nor that. And of course, we‟re carrying all
these variations within it, some of us to this side and others to the other side.
How important our work is in being able to finally have a way in which we can map
holistically the dimensions of a being and what they need. And not simply what they
need from the point of view that they can operate correctly, that they can be nur-
tured correctly, that they can understand where and what is important for them in
this process. But it opens up the possibility of a healthy transformation into the fu-
ture. Our concentration has always been this build up to the mutation itself without
fully grasping that we are ignorant of what the changing of the wheel means. We do
not have any idea.

No nine-centered being has ever experienced anything but the Cross of Planning as a
background frequency. None of our kind has ever experienced anything but the
Cross of Planning as a background frequency. It‟s been there since the beginning of
the 1600s. We are carrying it over as a background frequency from the end of the
seven-centered time. There is a huge change coming, because the background fre-
quency is going to change.
We are all subject to programming. We are all part of this vast program. The whole
focus of the greater program is shifting. And it‟s moving into a configuration that is
so diametrically different, incredibly different. We‟re moving away from the 40/37 to
the 20/34. We move away from the 9 and the 16 to the 55 and the 59. We‟re mov-
ing into a background frequency of deep self-absorbed busyness, very selfish, very
individual, and deeply selfish for the beginning of the whole cycle, we begin with the
55.6. And this is a background frequency. It is moving through everything, through
every crystal of every cell of every form. It becomes the warp and woof of the di-
mension we live in. It is the ocean. This is going to be a huge change, a sea
change.
It doesn‟t happen on a dime. It is a change that is going to take place over time,
like all evolutionary processes. It will take hundreds of years for the full impact to
take hold. But it‟s going to be there from the get go. Everything about our work,
everything about this knowledge is to prepare human beings to be able to handle the
background frequency. This is not knowledge about how to obey the rules of the
tribe or the collective. This is knowledge about how to trust in one‟s own inner wis-
dom. But the moment that it‟s pointed in that direction you have to understand that
the alternative is to being destroyed, is falling apart, is dissolving, and is decaying.
It‟s not just that there is going to be this emergence of this potential new form, this
mutation emerging out of us is going to emerge in a new cycle, in a new frequency.
Human beings need to be prepared. This is what our work is. It‟s not just the sur-
face to provide them with well-being. It‟s to begin the process of transforming their
consciousness. It‟s about preparing them for what it means not simply to live by
your own authority but to teach your young the same. To empower human beings,
individuals, unique forces that can survive this transformation.
The Right are Not Survival First Beings
And the Right is going to be disadvantaged in that. These are not survival-first be-
ings. It is not what they are about. And if we do not provide the bedrock to educate
them, to bring their cognitive power to its potential, then we do a great disservice to
them, because despite the fact that we are Left and Right, we are one kind. This
mutative binary, the “this and that” that is going to create something new; the mag-
ic of juxtaposition. The juxtaposition of the Right and the Left in this form and out of
it through the binary of the bonding, boom, something new, something different,
something very right for a different world.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
It‟s quite something to be in the middle of a great evolutionary change, that if we‟re
lucky we‟ll all be there when the wheel turns. We‟re already watching; if you look
you will see the breakdown of hundreds and hundreds of years of the same frequen-
cy, slowly the disintegration. Human beings have to learn to fend for themselves in
an age of selfishness. And in a time where the gods are no longer kind to them, we
are not the agenda anymore. We are not what it‟s about. As a matter of fact, our
gods are sort of losing their juice, sort to speak. New ones will replace them, new
versions, new themes.
Our time is coming to an end. It‟s a magic window. Mystically we live in the time of
the 61.1. It‟s our return to Eden long after the beginning where you get to eat from
the tree of knowledge and satiated. You can then complete your task. That window
closes in 2027. It won‟t close completely because there are all the children that are
being born in this time with that as a theme that marks them that they will carry to
the end of their days. But this is the closing of a window of opportunity for us. That
we are not to be lost in what it is to be what we are not and cannot be.
We are not here to be raves. We are here to fully discover and live our uniqueness.
This is how we complete our cycle; this is how we complete our great struggle on the
battlefield. This is where we find our honor, where the whole purpose of incarnative
processes is realized. It‟s here in the wonder of the form. In the magic of what it is
to understand what we have been given and how to live this life in this vehicle cor-
rectly.
It‟s a magical thing, after all, to know, to understand. But the grace is the living.
It‟s living it. It‟s living the beauty of what it is to be us. And it‟s about providing
others, after all, with keys. Keys to transform their process, keys to grasp what will
enrich their lives. It‟s good work.
The Coming Year
When I began this whole process of beginning to focus on the design and the perso-
nality and looking at the potential of these two directions, when I started really to
introduce them with that specific goal in Ibiza years ago, it was clear to me that in
order for me to certify somebody at this level that I could not follow what had been
the practice that I had done in the past, which was simply to do the best that I could
to teach people and take them through a program that when they got to the end,
like I said to the students in the earlier class that just completed the first year, con-
gratulations, now you can go out and do PHS color analysis, or PHS dietary analysis.
But there is nothing that says that the level that they have attained how much they
have grasped. There is traditionally in the work that I do, I have not involved testing
in these things. I realized in many cases that particularly when it comes to analysis
that the real test can only be taken two, three years later after they have practiced
and worked and learned from their trial and error process of what it is to do this job
and do it well. With that comes the confidence and the depth and all of the other
things.

PHS Synthesis Right / Right
It‟s not something I have ever really paid attention to. However, I feel very diffe-
rently about PHS and Rave Psychology. I think it‟s very important that these certifi-
cates are, in essence,
really earned, in that
sense. And it requires
a different kind of focus
and dedication. For me
the third year program
is very special. It‟s
very special because all
of my work over the
last number of years in
relationship to both
personality and design
was to get to a new
kind of BodyGraph
analysis system, what I call an advanced analysis perspective, something that is at a
completely new level as compared to what has been the bedrock of analysis and the
way in which the BodyGraph has been approached in the first 20 years of the know-
ledge.
So, it‟s a very important step for me. That is, I have been working very hard with
Asi in developing our advanced imaging program to begin to develop a holistic matrix
that we can work with for analytical development. So for me the third year is first of
all a platform for training people at an entirely new level of analysis, which in and of
itself is going to be quite complex and is going to take up a great deal of our work.
There is also going to be holistic approaches. That is, there will be classes that will
be held in unison between third year Rave Psychology and third year PHS students in
order to be able to see together the same holistic approaches so that there is com-
monality and correctness in the way in which both sides see the BodyGraph as a
whole. But one of the main aspects for me is that it‟s something that I learned by
listening to the radio last week. I don‟t know how many of you were listening, but
for me it was the best week that Mal has put together on the radio. It was a week
basically titled Living Your Design where both the regular contributors to the radio as
well as a lot of people from different levels who are interested in Design participated
and talked about their process.
Something that is so wonderful about Human Design is that you realize, at least I did
as a teacher, that if you listen to all of those different descriptions what you will get
is the real flavor of uniqueness. These are not sheep all uttering the same line.
They talk about it very differently; they have their unique outer authority in terms of
the way in which they express it. And of course, something that is so essential for
us is that the knowledge becomes our own.
Human Design is not going to suffer because you have your perspective as long as
that perspective is grounded in a deep rooting in the knowledge. After all, we are
here to express our outer authority and that outer authority is not a matter of

155
PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
whether it is truthful or not. It is correct in the sense that it is the unique expression
of that being. And so, for me this third year is about the unique expression, that is,
the digestion of this knowledge and through that digestion being able to produce
outer authority relative to it.
I know that a number of you have noticed, obviously, there is a change in the pric-
ing. It is the regular price plus amortized over the three semesters the price for cer-
tifying and my time, because in fact I will have to do a great deal of extra classroom
work related to this particular level. We‟re also developing a testing program in or-
der to be able to have online ways in which we can work through a certification
process.
One of the main things will be a presentation similar to a thesis, similar to a major
presentation at the end of any kind of academic process. Again, this is something
that I will discuss with you in detail because it is a project that will begin in the first
semester and obviously will part of the completion of the third semester of the pro-
gram. And presentation can be done in many, many different ways. It will depend
on what you‟re approaching, what your creativity is, and the way in which you want
to express the knowledge; but anyway, there is a complexity to next year that I
want you to be aware of. It is really the first time that—I feel deeply responsible for
the quality of the being that will be able to walk away with being a practitioner and
being certified by the IHDS.
It is a challenge for me as a teacher because it is not something that is a normal part
of my process and I‟ve already spent quite a bit of time trying to develop the way in
which the mechanisms can work. I think it will enrich your process. I‟m sure of
that, as a matter of fact, because I think it‟s very, very important. Basically what
I‟m looking at is a year that is full of workshops, the professional development of this
knowledge and at the same time the transformation from you spending two years
now listening to lectures and beginning to exercise your knowledge. And to begin to
exercise your knowledge in a way in which I can be a guide for you.
It‟s something that I need to do. I need to encourage you to process the knowledge
into outer authority. It‟s only when you process knowledge into outer authority that
you recognize your grasp that you begin to really recognize the kind of depth that
you have, which is very important. But also to have the reassurance of the level of
awareness that has been brought into what your practice will be; and again, a dis-
cussion of the nature of that practice.
It‟s going to be a very different year. It really is going to be a traditional closing
year for something that is significant, deserves respect and it will really require more
time from you as students, I‟m aware of that. So I want you to be aware of the kind
of commitment you‟ll be making entering into this program. I think, as I said, I want
to warn you on one hand and on the other hand I want to encourage you because I
think that this is where—and you‟ll see because the first semester is about holistic
analysis and I will introduce you to this new level of looking at a design. This will lay
the platform for really a very specialized level of the knowledge and what you can
offer to not simply those that are out there, but quite frankly to the entire human
design community. So, it‟s very exciting for me.

I also want to thank all of you, again, for participating in this year‟s program. It was
very important for me both as a teacher and a student to go through all of the
chains. It was in many ways an enlightening experience for me about the magic of
the mathematics of all this. Interestingly enough you‟re the only students that will
get me doing that live. The second year students next year will have weekly down-
loads and monthly workshops with me. So, I guess we shared something very spe-
cial in that in the way you share in the education of the students to come, who in
their second year process will always have to take two semesters of chains and your
frequency is a part of that. So, it is nice that we have been able to create that to-
gether.
So, that‟s it; that‟s what I have to say, but we have time and if you have questions
or comments.
Questions, Answers, and Comments
Transcriptions? Yes, I will make transcriptions available at the beginning of the new
year. They‟re still not complete. Paddy Balentine, Jovian‟s transcriber, has a per-
sonal crisis in her family. Her mother is very ill and dying. It‟s going to take her
some time to catch up and complete the year‟s transcriptions. So, when all of that is
done, we‟ll make sure it‟s available to students.
Yes, praise is sweet, but thank you. But folks you can ask me practical questions. If
you have any questions about next year that I haven‟t covered because it‟s always
like me, I‟m rather condensed. But if you have anything to ask you go ahead.
Question: Ok, I’m a usual suspect. In the first semester of the third year will there
be a lot of the oral and written homework starting right at the beginning because I’m
trying to decide my workload and my commitment. I have a lot of people asking me
to teach classes and I don’t know if I want to actually do anything next year except
take these classes. I’m on three different tracks, so I’m just checking in.
Ra: The thing about the way I‟m setting it up is that there is one project that you‟re
given a year to do. It‟s something that we will discuss as we enter into the first
semester next year. So, probably by the third or fourth week we will get to that
subject because I want to introduce the holistic analysis to all of you first.
And also, to be able to give you a chance to think about—basically, the major project
is a presentation. And not to belabor it, that presentation can be done a number of
ways. You can do a typical thesis where you take, for example, a certain chain and
you examine it as it emerges in a design of a person, something like that. But those
presentations can operate in many ways. They can be oral, they can be storytelling,
they could be a film, they can be a manuscript, you know what I mean. In other
words, it‟s very important that you‟re not limited.
The other thing is that there are a few you in which it would be a dilemma, for ex-
ample to have to create this level of presentation in English. It will not be necessary.

PHS YEAR 2, SEMESTER 3: PHS Practitioner Certification
Introduction to Systems Analysis
I will go to the trouble of having somebody translate it to me however it‟s presented
so I can have a grasp of it. The fact is that this is a two-way street for me. It is a
way for me to be able to judge the mastery of any subject that you may present.
And the style and the way in which it is delivered.
And at the same time it is a tremendous journey for anyone to enter into it. My
hope is that as is done in universities that those presentations that are exceptional
that Jovian will publish them, whatever form they happen to be in. Because I think
that it‟s very important to build up a basis of knowledge. I want to encourage you
through doing these kinds of things, particularly this because it will matter to you
that you have the ability to be able to organize and to be able to present knowledge.
And whether you do a case study or this or that, I will give you all kinds of options,
not that they‟re a limitation. You can go in any direction as long as it‟s obviously
presented with me and we discuss it so that we understand. I will help you with
these. In other words, I will give you guidance with your projects. But it depends
on the kind of person you are in the way you work, so that it is a project that you
will have a year to work with. Based on that, you have to consider what your timing
and what these kinds of things require from you, in that sense.
Question: Are you going to teach any of your second year classes in person? This
year I did benefit tremendously by auditing the first year classes. It allowed me to
reinforce all this knowledge in a very different way. So, what is happening with the
second year classes next year?
Ra: I guess you missed that. I mentioned that. Basically what happens is in the
first two semesters they get a weekly download of the chains. I have no intention of
doing that again. They will have monthly workshops with me. In the third semester
I will teach them live.
Question: That would mean that we can audit the third semester, is that correct?
Ra: You can also audit the workshops. I will be doing six, seven or eight workshops
during the course of the year with them. So, third year students who still want to
audit second year classes, they can audit the workshops.
Question: Would the pricing be the same as it was this year?
Ra: As far as I know. Sarah and I still haven‟t sat down and worked out any of the
basic audits other than the Family Practice people because that is a special audit for
them. But no, we haven‟t really worked it out. We will have everything ready at the
first of August. We‟re still in the middle of some of these things.
Question: When you’ve talked to us in Rave Psychology you’ve talked about a time-
frame you think we would work with a client over. Are you going to next semester
talk with us about a timeframe and a mentoring process you think would be a good
idea with clients that would be coming to us as practitioners?

PHS Synthesis Right / Right
Ra: There is no question that—the fact that I make a statement doesn‟t really mean
that you have an idea of what I see. When I say a new level of analysis, I‟m really
talking about a new level. That opens up all kinds of possibilities for both PHS and
for Rave Psychology professionals who complete the entire program. They will be
able to operate at an entirely different level. I look at both the practitioner and the
psychologist as long-term agents of support. I think that both of these programs
lead to a relationship with a client rather than an encounter with a client.
So, yes, I think that there is—I can‟t give away anything because as with all things
you have to see it in order to really grasp it. This is the thing that‟s so exciting for
me about the third year. What all my work has been in laying out these foundations
on both sides of the track on the design and personality side is to set the foundation
for a new process. The great counterpoint of next year will be the Four Views which
is the way in which I developed analysis perspective for the BodyGraph and what ad-
vanced imaging analysis is by comparison, as a perspective. You will see that we
have a quantum leap in the level of perspective, which leads to both the practitioner
and the psychologist being of value to anyone in the journey that can be found in no
other place in Design.
For me these are very special things. After all, some of you know me going back to
my earliest years. By the time I have finished year three, we will have had one short
of 100 lectures, 100 classes together. That is an astonishing journey. It really is. It
is the greatest amount of energy and depth I have ever poured into anything in the
knowledge. It is draining, quite frankly, this rhythm of going deeper and deeper and
following these two tracks. And all of that comes to fruition in the third year pro-
gram, because all of that is to integrate all of this into another level of synthesis.
And of course, it‟s this next level of synthesis that opens up the foundation of your
work. It is the bedrock of advanced analysis in Human Design and the things that it
brings with it. As you can tell, I am very excited about it.
Written question: Is it going to be difficult if we are at a different level with rave
psychology - year 3 phs year two rave psy.
Yes and no. I don‟t think so. I certainly don‟t think so for somebody with your level
of knowledge. Students who have been working with me, particularly a lot over the
last several years, you‟re really at a different level of information than anybody else
in the knowledge. That must be obvious to you. This is a very, very different place
to be in. All the ingredients of what is to be learned are there. So, it isn‟t going to
be a dilemma that you‟re one year behind on one side. In a sense it will advance
your appreciation of what you‟re taking in on the other side more than anything else.
Comment: Thanks. I had to deal with the dilemma of being in the baby class. It’s
been a good experience.
Ra: It‟s a great experience, actually. It‟s one of the things that I see. I like going
back and teaching basics and primary things. It‟s very solid, because you always
have another perspective. You always have another way of taking it in. It broadens
the education. There‟s no question about it. As a teacher it‟s why I have been doing
these things over again in order to deepen my own understanding and the tech-

Introduction to Systems Analysis
niques for presentation. The beautiful thing about Human Design is that it‟s trans-
ferable, so the techniques for transmitting this knowledge have to be taken on and
the underlying mechanics have to be solid in order for others to transmit it out of
their uniqueness. I enjoy the process.
Question: So, Ra when you originally came up with the new protocol for teaching
someone, taking them the first three and a half years and then the next three and a
half years, you had originally said these classes that we would take like PHS and
Rave Psychology were going to be a three and a half year program, is that still part
of this. Is there some six month internship of something that will happen, or is this
third year we’re doing going to be sufficient?
Ra: No, it does exist. It is not classroom. What I envision for the PHS clinic, our
online clinic, is that there will be a place like a room like this where professionals can
gather, where they can meet each other, where they can meet clients and where I
will gather with professionals on a regular basis in the six months after the process
ends. All of that is to just bring the cellular transformation over to the tipping point.
But it will not be formal in that sense. And the way that will be setup will be in place
by the time we get to the point where we have third year students that are graduat-
ing. By then we will have a Rave Psychology online clinic as well. These are two
areas that are very important for me that are supported and promoted and devel-
oped.
But there will be an ongoing relationship between practitioners and myself once they
are actually practitioners. It‟s my goal to involve all practitioners who graduate from
the program to involve them in the online clinic, to create an international virtual on-
line clinic that is able to serve as a broad-based community virtually, where it‟s not
necessarily easy to be able to do that in person.
I have very lofty goals envisioned for where this is going to go. As practitioners, as
students that I have been most involved with over time in any program, my contin-
ued support is a natural thing. That is, we‟re all in this to learn together and to grow
in this process together. Jovian is going to invest in supporting this whole area of
the knowledge.
Ultimately, I hope to be able to spin off a primary health system school which would
be separate from the IHDS and operate through the primary health system campus
itself and virtual clinic. But all of these things are down the road. It‟s new know-
ledge, after all. What I have learned is that if one is correct and one stays with the
now that things seem to work out. So, hopefully the goals that are there and the
potential of this knowledge is something that we can all bring forward together.
Question: But at a certain point you mentioned you wanted to try some penta in-
volvements for the Right fixed. Obviously that’s not very practical virtually, but is
there something happening around that?
Ra: Well, there‟s no question that for me—I‟m beginning to watch certain babies,
these are people I know, clients that I have who are being raised with their PHS. I
get regular reports. I have more than a dozen of them now. So I‟m beginning to

watch it from that area. One of these days, if I ever manage to make the kind of
money that such a thing is a pleasure to be able to do, it‟s one of the dreams that I
shared with students of mine in one of my earliest PHS classes, the dream of the en-
vironmental clinic in which you had the six primary environments and you were able
to work in those environments with these people either according to their psychology
or according to their PHS, depending on what they‟re there for, or holistically, in that
sense.
One day I‟d love to see a physical holistic clinic, because all of the various environ-
ments can actually be architecturally placed into one environment. But that‟s the
kind of thing that it takes millions and millions of dollars. It takes an awful lot of
people which means it needs to generate a tremendous amount of revenue. My job
is to be a messenger. And virtually it is the easiest way in this day and age to be the
messenger and to deliver that. But it would be something that would be a delicious
dream to see realized somewhere down the road.
Comment: I just have to say in Ibiza in the Right fixed only class you did has been
one of the most powerful, tangible experiences for me. Maybe next year Right fixed
can experiment in meeting.
Ra: I know. There is a great deal that can be done. No, I didn‟t say, that you could
set up a virtual clinic. There are a lot of things to be done. But the experiments ul-
timately need to be done by practitioners. This is the way that it‟s going to work.
One of the things that we‟re working on for the clinic is a way in which information
can be shared. That is, the way case studies can be shared, instantly; all kinds of
things that are going to make it possible for us to be able to develop a sophisticated
database, to be able to do research, to be able to do both physical and statistical re-
search.
Again, this is new knowledge. It takes a long time. I‟ve watched what it takes. I‟ve
watched 20 years of getting Human Design to this level. I know what kind of time it
takes for these things to unfold. The key for all of us is to enjoy our process, to en-
joy the bounty that comes with such knowledge. There is nothing to do but to do
what we‟re doing and allow the rest of it to unfold. It will be all right. This is the
thing that I always know. It‟s such a beautiful thing and of great value. It is grow-
ing in the way that it should.
Anyway, to all of you, I want to thank you. You take care; have a good summer and
enjoy it; bye for now.
