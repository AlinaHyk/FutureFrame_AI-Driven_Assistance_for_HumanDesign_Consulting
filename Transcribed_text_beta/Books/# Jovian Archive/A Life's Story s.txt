Lesson One
Incarnating into a Penta
Hello and welcome to all of you
and particularly all of you that
are downloading because there
are a lot of you. For those of
you who are newcomers, I
hope you didn't have any
problems trying to get in.
Anyway, welcome to all of you
and welcome to what I think
you're going to find a
fascinating process. I’ve
actually done this once before and it was very inspiring for me. It was last summer
in Austria in the summer school there. I wanted to really show the benefit of the
various matrices we work with in Human Design. That is, the various ways we
graphically look at different kinds of forms and different ways in which ones interact
to see how all this basic, graphic-based knowledge in Human Design applies to
integrating all of these various areas of Design. It covers a full spectrum of Design
knowledge and you’ll see how all of these aspects are useful in understanding the
nature of any being’s life.
The Story of a Woman: Eva
This is the story of a woman. This is a story of her life. She is somebody who was
very much real. Though I confess I did her reading a very long time ago, I
unfortunately really do not remember her in that way. But it's just an interesting
connection to it. Anyway, it’s a story of a woman’s life. She died four years ago.
There was a whole story there. That is, the story of a life. And because of her
relationship with Human Design Teacher, we had all of the data of her parents,
brother, the man who would become her husband, and the man that when her
relationship ended with her husband, the lover she found, and her time of death.
That is the whole story from a really accurate moment of birth to an accurate
moment of death.
Whatever perspective you take on a line of a life, we have the advantage through
the mechanics of being able to explore it and to see it. And in seeing it, not simply
understand the being, but within the context of this process, to really be able to
understand the dynamics of what it is just to be a human being and what it takes as

A LIFE STORY

a human being to be correct, what it takes to shed the conditioning, and what it
takes to reach a place in one’s process where one can begin to find one's true
purpose on this plane.
Conditioning by the Parents
So, we’re going to begin at the beginning and it is something to understand about
any life. I guess it's the joke, it's the endless joke, it’s an old joke, and it goes back
forever. What each and every one of us is as a being is something that we have
taken in the biological sense directly from our parents. It is within that context that
we arrive into the world through the union of our parents.
We well know something in Human Design—everything about the nature of what it is
to be a nine-centered being, and we are a nine-centered being, is that the only
possibility for a nine-centered being is enlightened selfishness. That is, in the
capacity to be able to recognize if you do not save yourself, nothing can be saved.
You can never understand a child by looking at the child, you cannot. In essence
you can never really understand any of us, and I say that within the not-self context.
You cannot really understand any human being until you understand their parents.
It was interesting, because the opening of this lecture series is coincidental with my
Family Analysis Clinic which I also began today, that it is a very similar theme to the
one I explored earlier today. This theme is absolutely essential to understand
because the sense is, when you're looking at the not-self and you look at the
individual not-self, that you really see who they are. You don’t. What you don't see
is why they end up as not-self making the choices they do and how deeply they are
influenced by the role models that are established by their parents. And that role
model that was established by their parents, in our understanding of it, to be able to
recognize the way in which children are conditioned in a way that is so insidious. It
impacts everything you're going to do in relationship to any other for the rest of your
life.
So, in the beginning of this story of a life, and it's the story of Eva, I think that's kind
of cute, because that’s the Germanic version of Eve. I think that's kind of cute, but
anyway, I'm preparing to take in the whole frequency of this family again because
I've been there and it's quite a place to go. You have to begin with human beings.
We cannot begin with Eva, it’s not possible. We have to see what was there—in
essence, the thing that gestated, initiated, and brought all that into existence. And
we have beings.
Looking at the Not-Self
I spent so many years of my career doing individual analyses. The work of an
analyst is often very complex because we are in a dualistic knowledge. The most
obvious dualism when you see anybody's chart is the potential in terms of what's
there. And you get to see what drives the being. That is, you get to see the

Lesson One
Incarnating into a Penta
conditioning. Whenever I was going to get ready to do a reading for someone, I
wasn't interested in the stuff that's there, because that’s not driving them. It's not
what's moving them. What is moving them is something entirely different. What’s
moving them is the conditioning field, because they're not-self.
When that chart was there in front of me, I looked at the not-self because I wanted
to see what was coming in the door, just what's coming in the door. The magic of
Human Design, because Human Design is an incredible thing, it is so deep, it is so
profound and yet, its greatest work, its greatest achievement is being able to grasp
the surface. This is where everybody is stuck. Everybody is stuck on the surface.
Everybody is stuck out there on the surface. This is the homogenized world.
The Father’s Chart: Triple Split
In order to be able to understand any human being you have to see the way they
operate on the surface. What are we looking at here? We have one aspect over
here and then we have another one that's over here, and then we have another one
that's over here. We have a triple split definition. We have a Generator in which the
generative truth [green oval], if I can put it that way, is separate from the emotional
authority [purple oval] that happens to have a direct outlet to the Throat. Triple
splits are very strange beings. They're not like most everybody else.

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
About 41% of humanity are single definition. And about 45% of humanity are split
definition. That is, two aspects separate from each other. And about 11%, that’s
quite a difference between the other two, are triple split definition. So, in fact, in a
statistical sense, they are rare; they are different. As a matter of fact, their
difference is often very, very confusing to other definition qualities. For example,
triple splits are so often confused with split definitions.
Split Definitions and Bridges
What we know about a split definition is it has to have the bridge. I want the bridge.
I have to have it. But the moment you have a triple split definition, oh boy, do you
have a lot of bridges. You have a bridge over here and you have one, two, three
different bridges that are over
there. You have another bridge
that is over here, and you have
another one that's over here, all
these bridges [gates 31, 8, 33,
51, 59 and 50].
And think about what it is to be a
human being. What it is to be
human being is that we are
designed in genetic imperative to
be attracted to what we are not.
If you're a split definition and
there's this empty space hanging
there between bringing your split
together or not, that's what you
want. It’s what drives you. It's
not you. And it’s not like it's
driving you physically. It's driving your not-self mind. It’s telling your not-self mind
that this is the most important thing that you have to have and that you have to
have it soon. This is what we want to
be; this is what we need. This will
change our life.
If you’re a split definition and there's one
gate hanging there, wow, does that have
a power over you. But it’s not the same
here. As a matter of fact, triple splits
don't like getting locked in. They don't.
They need to move in and out of auras.
Think about this person as not-self and
I'll tell you what you see. You see this
[image to the left]. And everything
about this is it’s being driven by this not-
self mind. That's this being.

Lesson One
Incarnating into a Penta
Now, think about what we’re like. As not-self we don't know how we operate. We
trust our own minds to be ours, not to be the by-product of conditioning. We trust
that when our mind is telling us we need something that we actually need it, want it,
care for it, and love it. Not only is this being not going to be able to operate
correctly, they will not operate correctly; they will manifest. They will manifest
pointed at all those things that are out there that attract them. That becomes what
is important for this mind who thinks about things that don't matter, and this open
Root that's just in a hurry. This is the person that “is going to fall in love.” Oh yeah,
I like that. This is who they’re going to fall in love with, what will be the mother.
The Mother’s Chart: Split Definition and Her Bridges
Here you’re looking at what I have just described as a classic split definition—the G,
the Throat, the Ajna above, the Sacral rooted down into the Root and over to the
Spleen. And you can see there are two bridges [red arrows, gates 48 or 2], single
gate bridges. Now you know what this person wants. What they want more than
anything else—think about what it is to be a human being and to be unaware and to
begin to grasp what that costs you in this life.

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
What this person wants is this 48th gate; it wants it real bad. The 48th gate is the
gate of depth. Oh, how this person would like to be deep. They’re not meant to be
deep. Everybody's this and that, but this is not who they are. They’re good at
responding to depth. When they meet it
they can be very skillful. But all they
seek is the depth and they’re never
satisfied, searching, searching, and never
satisfied, never, ever, ever, ever, ever
satisfied, never really being able to grasp
the depth because it’s not who they are
and they think there’s something wrong
with them. It can drive them crazy. It
can. It did her.
We get so lost in what we’re not, what we
can never be. That even when we meet
it and we grab it and we allow ourselves
to be conditioned by it, it hurts us
because it’s not us and it’s not ours. And there’s no 2. This yearning for the
direction: Where do I go? Where do I go to find the depth? This is who this person
is.
The Not-Self Cannot be Helped
It doesn't matter all this other stuff. It doesn't matter all this definition and all this
possibility. Human beings are ignorant. They are not-self. They are ruled by the
mind and they are ruled by fear. They decide based on their fears, based on their
needs, driven by the fears for what they are not and what they can never be. And
oh, does that ever hurt them. Look at
this being with their built-in
unworthiness [open Heart]. I'm not
worthy. I'm not worthy because I have
not found the depth and I'm only going
to be worthy if I find the depth. And of
course, there is the avoidance of
confrontation and truth [open Solar
Plexus], the avoidance of the truth that
there is no place where that will be
found.
To be ignorant is not simply to be in
pain, it’s to think that the pain belongs to
you. It’s why it’s so difficult to help
human beings. They are not-self; you cannot help the not-self. It's not real. You
can shatter it. You can snap it down into little pieces, and you can start building up

again. Human beings—these are going to be the parents of this child. Think about
your own parents, if you're fortunate enough to have reasonable data. Take a look
at them objectively, separate from yourself to begin with. Take a look at them as
individuals and look at them only as not-self. What did they want in life?
The not-self creates a not-self purpose. This is the devil if there ever was a devil.
Not-self purpose, “Oh, my purpose is to find the depth and be worthy.” It’s not this
person's purpose. It has absolutely nothing to do with them, but I guarantee you if
they were sitting down in a room with me and I said your purpose is to find the
depth that will prove your worth, they’ll go yeah, yeah, yeah like Pavlov’s dogs.
These are the beings who made you, made me, made us. We are also the beings
who have produced children in ignorance, and have entered relationships in
ignorance. Go back and look at them. Look at your not-self. What did you want?
What was there driving you in those white spaces? Because it’s there in
understanding what was driving you in those spaces—why you looked and saw in the
other what you thought was for you, the dance of illusion. And then of course, you
get the beast. How convenient all this is. Look at it. There isn’t the depth, but hey,
there’s the vision. There’s a direction that’s there.
9 and 0: Nowhere to Go
You can also see something else. I like the simple. I’m a great fan of the simple.
You look at two people when they come together and you look at the number of
centers that are colored in. It's very important. In this case, you can see all nine
centers are colored in: 9 and 0, nowhere to go. I want you to think about that. By
the way, 8 and 1, have some fun; 7 and 2, work to do; 6 and 3, better to be free; 5
and 4, not a relationship any more. But this is 9 and 0, nowhere to go.

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
Think about nowhere to go. Let’s go
back for a moment and think about
what it means when this woman is
with that man. What we get is this.
This is part of the split that she’s
looking for, that she needs. She
wants to find the depth, though, but
she can’t. And there’s no way out,
and there's no way out because it’s
going to be a 9 and 0 and she is
locked in.
No Room for Eva
At first when you’re a 9 and 0 it can be romantic. The 9 and 0 couple sitting in a
café and you’re a friend of one of them and you see them and you move towards
them, and something inside of you says you’re not welcome, even though they might
wave or smile or whatever. There is no room in there. Think about, Eva, our little
girl who isn’t born yet. She is going to come into the world and she is going to have
parents who are 9 and 0, and there's no room for her. It is just the way the cards
get laid out. It's not about blame or fault. It’s not about earned karma or not. It's
just the mechanics of things.
But it’s something to understand, how different that would be if you had parents, for
example, who were a 7 and 2 and you turned it all into a 9 and 0. You brought the
three of you together into this closed-knit group that felt really good locked in
together. But that’s not going to happen. Eva is going to be an outsider. Everybody
is an outsider. And them, they’re prisoners. It’s what she’s going to feel like as not-
self. Slowly but surely it just becomes a prison. There is nowhere to go. And the
direction is set.
Electromagnetics
Think about electromagnetics. They
are fascinating things to grasp. We
have an electromagnetic here. We
know that she doesn’t have the 2, he
has the 14, so together they form this
channel, the keeper of the keys, the
beat. Everything about this channel is
about individual mutative direction. It
is the heart, the core of the vehicle
itself as a driving force of the mutative
direction of humanity. If you look at
an electromagnetic connection, the

Lesson One
Incarnating into a Penta
first thing to understand is that it is a dynamic tension. It is a tension that, when it
materializes at the mundane plane, is something we call love/hate. And I mean that
in a light sense, rather than an absolute sense.
In other words, the very thing that you're attracted to—she’s looking for vision, she's
looking for the direction, so you're attracted to the direction and you end up with this
guy who locks you in a 9 and 0 and gives you a direction of being a hausfrau and
being locked away from the possibility of finding the depth. What was first
attractive, you were being given this direction, what was first exciting—because this
is the way genetics operate—suddenly as time progresses this becomes something
that’s very uncomfortable. The very thing you're attracted to is the thing that you
begin to dislike. Everybody who has a relationship where you have an
electromagnetic—you all know this experience—at any given time it can be either
side of its binary. It can be very exciting or it can be just simply infuriating.
The Suffering of the 9 and 0
The way human beings come together, these two human beings coming together as
not-self, locked in with their not-self, and locked in to the limitations—now, I want to
be entirely fair here, so let’s go back for a moment and take you to the dilemma of
the father. Remember I mentioned to you that triple split definitions are unusual.
For the mother being a split definition, having that bridge is everything, which means
it's incredibly difficult to let go of it.
That's why so many breakups in
relationships are so bitter and painful
and difficult. If you are dealing with
splits—and again remember 45%, of
humanity are basic split definitions—it
can be something that is just
excruciating.
But this is something very different.
This is a triple split definition. They
don't like getting locked in. We have a
9 and 0. She's locked into a prison
where there is a direction and doesn't
ever lead to depth. He’s locked in and
gets instantaneously bored. And yet,
they’re a 9 and 0, and there’s nowhere to go. And they weren’t born in our era.
They were born in an era in which in most cases couples suffered their whatever's in
a rather veiled way; just simply dealt with things, swallowed the hard pill, as it were,
whatever the expression happens to be.
And it's not like both of them recognized they had been trapped right away. He
always had the advantage of being able to go out the door in the morning and stay
away longer and longer. There’s so much you can know about a human being by
understanding what drives them and that by seeing in the mechanics what happens.

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
Imagine what it was like, their wedding day and the people around, them being
happy and all of that stuff. So unaware of what was at work, and they would never
be aware of it.
They would never get it. She would
eventually commit suicide. They would never
get it. It is the suffering of the not-self the
world, the West particularly. There is so
much intense suffering in terms of the fixed
relationships that human beings have
because it's all rooted in something that can
never be clean and can never be satisfied. It
can never be correct, it can never be honest.
It can’t.
And this is where children come from. It is
out of this union, this double trap, typical
double trap of the not-self because that’s how
it works out there. It’s the way not-self beings come together. They come together
according to the way they're trapped by the genetic imperative. And you go from
there, this bond and out of this bond comes
our story.
Types and Auras
Little Eva, first of all you’re dealing with a
Manifestor. So, you have an interesting
combination here. Let’s go back a second,
because we're going to deal with her for a
long time. So we can afford to go back. You
have a father that is a Manifesting Generator
and you have a mother that is a Generator.
Let's talk about auras for a moment. I want
you to understand the cruel ironies of life.
You have two Generators. The aura of a
Generator is called an enveloping aura.
Every type has a unique aura.
As a matter of fact, to truly understand a
human being, the best way to understand
them, particularly the way in which they
relate to others, is through their aura
because the aura expresses their nature.
Generators have an open, enveloping aura.
Manifestors have a closed and repelling aura.
Projectors have a very focused aura.
Reflectors have a Teflon aura. The auras are

very different and it defines in so many ways the way in which the being is operating
within the context of that particular aura.
The Generator Enveloping Aura and the Manifestor Repelling Aura
So think about these parents who are Generators. They have an open and
enveloping aura. So, their little girl comes into the world. I want you to get the
joke, because the joke is, first of all, you have two Generators with their enveloping
auras who happen to be a 9 and 0 and envelop each other. There’s no room in
there, there's no room to get in here. And what is the by-product of this union? The
by-product of this union is a Manifestor with a repelling aura.
Think about that, how bizarre. You have parents who have an aura that wants to
take the other in, but they are closed off and can’t. They give birth to a child who
has a closed-off aura and will repel their aura, driving them back into their 9 and 0,
back into their trap. There is going to be a deep divide that is going to be there from
the moment this child emerges.
One of the things that is clear to understand about this relationship is that in the
beginning of this child's life—one of the things we know about Manifestors is that it is
very, very important how they are dealt with in the first seven years of their life.
Now of course, that’s true for other types. But it’s particularly true for the
Manifestor; otherwise, there are going to be problems in terms of the way in which
the child is going to operate in the relationship with the parents.
Penta
Here is this being, this Manifestor, who is an uncontrollable force. And basically what
you're going to have is a father escaping
this, going out and doing the archetypal
role. And what you're going to have is
this child in its relationship with its
mother. One of the things most people
think about when they think about
families and family analysis, at least
within the context of Human Design, is
Penta.
Penta is a trans-auric form. It is not
always present, it is fluid. A Penta takes
formation when there are three, four or
five beings who are in close auric proximity to each other. It's only then that a Penta
emerges and our ability to be able to analyze the mechanics of that emerged Penta.
But, the fact of the matter is that in a family like this, which is the initiating triangle
of family, in this particular situation because of the 9 and 0 and the inability of the

aura to be able to embrace the child, there are going to be very few examples in the
early years of this family actually being together in a Penta configuration. In other
words, all three of them being together at the same time.
So, the father goes out into the world to work, and by the time the father gets home,
the baby goes to bed. There is this process in which the child basically begins its
process with its direct interrelationship with the parent, and obviously the
relationship in most cases is going to be with the mother.
The Mother
It is always interesting to just look at basics. The surface is always going to lead you
to the real truths. What do we know about the mother? We know that the mother in
the relationship with the father,
the promise of direction doesn't
lead to the depth she wants. It
just doesn't and that promise of
direction leads into a life that
brings to her this child. And in
bringing her this child there are
two things that are there. One,
it is an 8 and 1. You can see
that there is one center in this
case that is open—8 and 1, have
some fun. In other words, that
for the mother the child can be a
real pleasure. It's there. The
possibility is there that the child
is a real pleasure.
But the child doesn't bring this either. And that means ultimately there is
resentment in the mother to the child. It is a transferred resentment that moves
away from the father who couldn’t bring
her that, to the daughter who couldn't
bring her that, and it's not like she
thinks that. It is what is moving her.
She is helpless in it. And more than
that, she is a Generator mother who
would like to embrace her child and her
child just simply repels it. She just
does. She just pushes it away.
And of course, there is much more to
that in terms of the relationship between
the two of them. Look at the mother.
We already know it was the father's
emotional power coupled with the gate 2

Lesson One
Incarnating into a Penta
that locked her into the bond with this
being. We also know this is an
unemotional person who has been
caught in the promise of a vision that
didn't lead to what she wanted, which
means she can’t be worthy [open
Heart]. And if she can’t be worthy, she
could become quite distressed. She just
can, trying to find a way to get to what
she wants [gate 48], and all along
hiding it, holding back the secrets
[channel 33/13], wondering about this
and that and the other thing [open
Head], never letting it out, and how
uncomfortable this can be.
Manifestors: Not-Self Theme is Anger
There's one thing we know about Manifestors. Their not-self theme is anger. This is
a child who is capable of conditioning incredible anger in the other. Not just about
the child displaying the anger, but conditioning it in others. Everybody's raised to be
a Manifestor. When you have a Manifestor child, most families who have a
Manifestor child, that's the time in which they begin to do better, the not-self being
driven. There's anger here, and there is huge emotional power. And this huge
emotional power is deeply sexual,
obviously not when the child comes
into the world, but something that
will arise out of that. It’s so heavily
oriented to the desire stream [red
curve channel 41/30, gate 36]. And
this is one of the ways in which the
split definitions can be linked [Throat
gates 12 and 35].
We are so hooked by what we're
not; we’re so hooked by the promise
of what we are not, so caught in it.
And of course, all of this is
happening not in a way in which
anyone is aware. The mother isn't
aware, the child obviously is not
aware and the damage begins from the beginning. It begins with the fact that there
is a 9 and 0 Generator mother and father with this Manifestor child. They are all
unaware. They are all incapable of being able to operate correctly. They don't know
how to treat this child. They don't know how to feed this child. They don't know
how to behave with each other. You can see what happens. Everything becomes
conditioning.

Eva Living with Two Generators
When we're looking at her, because we’ll look very deeply at what drives her, what
attracts her; after all, she is a split definition. In order to really understand any
basic relationship with anyone is to understand what they give you in terms of the
center they bring you. And I'm not talking about somebody who would have, for
example, an undefined G Center and hookup with this G Center and would be defined
together. No, I’m talking about somebody in
your life who has that center defined. In her
case, it’s those beings who have the Sacral, or
have the G Center or the Ajna Center or
whatever. And it is something to understand
how deep that conditioning is.
She doesn't know who she is [open G Center].
She is going to take her identity, at least in the
beginning, from the role models who are there
for her. It is the way it works. And of course,
if the role model is incorrect it’s like both of
them being Generators, and not operating
correctly as Generators, and therefore they are dissatisfied. They’re frustrated. Can
you imagine what it's like to grow up in a thick enveloping aura of frustration? When
you’re a child, what does that teach you? It’s not like you’re discerning at that age.
It’s not like you're looking at them and asking what their problem is. This is your
model. You take it in so deeply.
You grow up with Generator parents and you're naturally prone to frustration and
displays of it. You could become sick with it. This is a Manifestor; this is an
undefined Sacral Center living with two Generators. I know. I'm a Manifestor. I live
with three Generators and I have to spend an awful lot of time in my own space to
escape the buzz. This poor child. What a frequency there is, that unaware
frustration frequency that leeches into and becomes the identity, the frustrated
identity.
And they get angry. Oh, what a thing it is to understand, and how liberating it is to
be able to understand. It changes everything. It is why we have a Human Design;
it is why we have mechanics. Not so we can go through and look at a design and be
impressed with what we can see, but it is its practical application. And it always
leads back to basic truths. It leads back to the individual and the state of
consciousness of the individual. It leads back to whether the individual is operating
correctly in its relationship to the other, because otherwise there's nowhere to go.
It is through that union, through awareness, that it's possible to bring the gift of
aware parents to a child, to help them align themselves, and to grow into the beauty
of what is their particular uniqueness. This little Manifestor, to understand her
power, to be taught how to navigate with success in this life, to be fed correctly, to

be cared for correctly, to be enriched in her emotional process, to understand her
timing, how truth emerges for her, and to not be afraid of being lost [open G].
These are such simple things, such profound truths, and such great medicine.
What Eva Wants
Oh, you can see this person’s drive, what they want. You can see. It’s there; it’s
always there. You just point to it. They want progress [gate 35]. The progress
that's a bargain that ensures loyalty [gate 37]. They’re looking for romance [gate
12]. Oh, there are forces here that are going to drive this being. They are the
forces that are going to shape the holistic
life.
What is important for you to take from
today is a new perspective, to begin to
look at what the not-self is as a
manifested existence, as a manifested
form, to see alive and well in the world
around you, to understand that friend of
yours in their earnestness who wants to
tell you this or do that has no idea what's
going on. And they don’t. Look at their
chart.
Look at the white spaces, smell the fear,
see what drives them, see what's always driven them, see what they think is
important to them, and you'll see that in looking at their chart that way, you will see
them. It's not a nice thing to see. Not a nice thing to see when you're looking at
people you care about or for. But if you don't see that, you will never see the truth
of all this.
Human Design is for the Guidance of Children
Human beings in their arrogance and their vanity think they operate independently,
guided by what is their good old reliable self-awareness. It's such a bad joke. They
are deeply manipulated, conditioned, and homogenized creatures of the program.
They have no idea at all what's going on. Everything about the life is that this
knowledge wasn’t given to be some kind of medicine, save people, and fix them. It’s
just a by-product of introducing it into the world. The knowledge is here so that
there is guidance, to be aware, and to raise our children in awareness so they can
live correctly without ever being conditioned. They get to fulfill their potential and
can continue this evolutionary process in a way that is rewarding.
How difficult it is for human beings to even grasp for a moment the perfection that's
possible in this life now. I know the world. I'm nobody's fool. It's a horror wherever
you look. This is the homogenized world. And it's not to be saved. That’s another

arrogance of human beings. You cannot save it. One human being at a time, one
human being in the serendipity of being in the right place at the right time to meet
what is transforming for them. It is not meant for the world. It is meant only for
those who are ready, because it challenges everything you understand about the
nature of life. It challenges everything you grew up with and everything that you've
been taught. It is sometimes a difficult thing to swallow that it’s all a chimera. But
it is.
Approaching the Experiment Radically
I tell you one thing I’ve learned over the years. It's decades now that I do this. If
you don't approach the experiment radically, I don't think there's any where to go,
because it is a radical experiment. The most radical thing on earth is to be here for
yourself first. There is nothing more radical. And this is not about selfishness in the
way in which the not-self understands it or would term it. This is about
understanding that without the focus on our own correctness, there is nothing. And
it's not something we can share. It is not something in which someone else can hold
our hand. It's not. It is what you do for yourself.
It is the only opportunity you are ever going have. It is the potential truly to
transform your existence. See the shadow, the shadow of the not-self. Look at your
own shadow. Remember it. Remember how you lived that shadow. Remember how
important that shadow was for you. Remember all the things you did for that
shadow. And leave it behind. This is what it’s about. You leave it behind because
you change the game.
We are a binary consciousness. We have a Design Crystal consciousness that is
there to operate the vehicle and the vehicle is the life, so just let go. We have a
Personality consciousness. It's the passenger. It is here to filter the experience of
consciousness. It isn’t here to do anything else. It is here to experience and filter
the consciousness field and share it, perhaps, or not.
We’re here for the ride. We’re not here to be driven by the not-self into the
blindness of homogenization. We’re here for the glory of the free ride. It’s a great
ride. You sit back as a passenger in the backseat. And you allow your life to unfold,
your life. Not all those hooks that were out there. Not all that conditioning. Not
that person who you could never love because they could never be real. No, it’s to
sit back and see the emergence of you, the beauty and ease with which you can
move through this plane. It's in the grace of that movement you can discover love
for yourself. And then anything is possible, anything.
Anyway, I hope you all enjoyed that and nice that you’re all participating. Okay,
until next week, take care; bye for now.

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
Welcome to all of you. We come to the second part of our story. One of the things
to keep in mind about the nature of this course is that this course is about looking at
a life through Human Design mechanics. We already began that process. That is,
we began that process last week in the sense that we began to look at the individual
charts, the individual charts of the various players that are in this story. And in
doing so, obviously we’re working with the form principle as the form principle is
structured in the nine-centered being in the BodyGraph.
Not only did we look at the individuals within the context of the individual
BodyGraph, that is, the father and the mother. But of course, then we went to what
is a secondary view, another matrix, though it's fundamentally within the same
construct we have different rules that apply, that is, the rules that are inherent in a
relationship, the way in which human beings meet each other in a relationship.
One of the most important things to grasp in the end of this process is that because
we have the advantage of the knowledge we have the advantage of being able to see
mechanically the way in which various things operate in the mundane nature of our
lives. And in being given that privilege, the benefit of that particular insight, it allows
us through awareness to learn how to deal with these things. But each and every
one of these forms is different in the way in which the information operates.
The Connection Chart between the Mother and the Father
Take the example here of the combination
that is there, that is, the connection chart
that exists between the mother and the
father. The assumption when we're
looking at this is that somehow that this
is two beings together. When you look at
this BodyGraph, that is, when you look at
the way in which this is illustrated, that's
not what you see. You see the whole that
is greater than the sum of the parts. You
see the by-product of the imprints of two
different individuals, and you see the way
that by-product comes to life in that
quantum of two beings coming together

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
to form this combination. This BodyGraph is not either the father or the mother.
This is the enormous dilemma that everybody meets in the genetic imperative that
rules our lives. And remember that we are ruled by the genetic imperative. If we go
back into the designs of the individuals that we were looking at, we know that the
genetic imperative is very, very powerful, this yearning for depth, this yearning for
the direction that will bring that depth, the way in which the genetic imperative
drives us.
Losing Your Differentiated Reality
But when you come over here and you get into this being which is the combination of
them, it’s a different being. It's different. It’s not what that person was. And the
very fact that they are looking for something, the fact is that this thing that comes
into existence is very different from them. It just is. This is where we have our
problems. It’s where we have our problems in relationships because what we find in
any relationship, lovers, parental with child, it doesn't matter, whether it's a
friendship, a business relationship, it doesn't matter what it is, the moment you step
into the aura of another you lose your identity. What I mean by that is you lose your
differentiated reality, or the potential of it because you become something else.
We already know that this becoming something else for the mother is going to be a
great trial because it is this 9 and 0 locked in and there is no depth and there is no
initiation that is waiting. And it's not because that is not what this person wants,
they want it, but within the context of this, it's gone. They can never have it,
because this is not them. And it’s just not about what the impact is on her, the
impact on him, and the impact on anyone that is in a relationship.
Blending of the Auras
It’s about auras. As long as I’ve been teaching Human Design I’ve been trying to
educate people into understanding that the aura is something that must be deeply
grasped to understand a human being. You understand a human being through the
aura, but think about what happens when two beings come together. Here we have
this combination between these two beings. And the moment that they come
together, this thing has an aura; it has an aura. And that aura is not the unique
auras of the two side by side; it’s a soup. It’s a blending of those auras. It makes
this thing so different, this very powerful single definition emotional Manifesting
Generator, this thing.
We have great difficulties in relationships. You're always yearning to be yourself. No
matter how good the relationship is there are always those moments in every day
where you’d just like to be left alone. That you’d like to be able to do it your way,
that you’d like to be able to retain what you had in mind before you stepped into the
aura and everything changed. This is why that in the not-self in the way in which
the not-self bonds and the way in which couples come together that these kinds of
A Life Story is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
relationships are always calling for tragedy. It’s just waiting to happen, because
you're dealing with deep dysfunction.
But we’re talking about mechanics now, remember that. And the mechanics of
partnership are one of the most important mechanics that we have, to be able to see
what happens to us, not only to be able to see what happens to us, but to begin to
see what is really going on, why the relationship is the way it is. Why it’s held
together the way it is, where the forces are within the context of that relationship
that will make it difficult or not.
Being Correct as Yourself in a Partnership
And yet, the solution to dealing with this is about being correct yourself, it isn’t about
anything else. Again, the dilemma of the parent that isn't correct, the dilemma of a
relationship that is not correct, then you can only expect dysfunction, because that's
what's there. The not-self is very, very powerful, it really is. It’s something to
grasp, that not-self that lurks in the design of any being. Think about it. Think
about the pressures that are there. The pressures are huge. These pressures that
lie within that openness, that turn the mind towards what is not-self, what is so far
away from what is important for this being.
The Mother’s Not-Self Purpose
It is not the draw of the 48 and the 2, but this is what this being lives. And it means
that the moment that they enter into a relationship and it is not satisfied, then
there's always going to be a problem, because they’ve got a not-self purpose. This
woman's not-self purpose is to find a
direction to depth, to find initiation, to
find intimacy, to find the right
principles, to find the way. It's all there
in the design, all the hanging gates all
crying out for something.
And instead of being able to live out her
not-self purpose, it's a terrible black
joke, what would depress this woman in
her life because the 3/60 is the only
channel that carries within it a
possibility for deep depression, manic-
depression. That this chemistry of the
potential of depression in this woman is
all rooted to her failure to achieve her
not-self purpose. It’s incredible. “I can
only be of value as a human being when I find that direction to depth and that's
going to be my initiation, that's going to make me worthy, and then I don't have to
hide anymore.”

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
This individual, when this being with its not-self purpose goes into the next level of
the matrix, goes into the next level in the bonding so that you have a connection
chart, when you understand somebody's not-self you understand what they bring to
the relationship. You think that this Generator is going to give up the dream that
what everything is for her is here in that 48 and there in that 51 and she doesn't
have it. And she's going to be frustrated that she doesn't have it, and there is no
out. There just isn’t. There’s the yearning for the way, looking for the way, looking
for the fantasy. This is somebody that can get so deeply, deeply, deeply lost in that.
Relationships: The Triumph of Homogenization
And it’s not his fault. It’s not her fault. This is the triumph of homogenization. Most
human relationships are the triumph of homogenization, because you can see so
clearly how human beings are simply drawn to each other by the genetic imperative
and nothing else, nothing else. And then you have trillion dollar industries that try to
do something for these beings. All the services that are oriented towards trying to
make the impossible possible, awakening awareness in dysfunctional relationships.
And what do you get out of that, you get dysfunctional children, the innocent victims
of that. And they're the ones that carry the impression, the imprint that is there in
the nurturing that they receive in their Penta, in their environment as they’re
growing up. They carry it with them all their lives. It’s quite a thing to unload.
It’s one of the wonders in Human Design of the seven-year cycle because the cellular
cycle in correctness will clean you out so that you can start fresh. I teach
practicality. This is my job. I’m a mechanic. The moment that I understood what a
partnership chart was I discovered probably one of the most important answers for
me in being able to realize my signature as a Manifestor to find peace in a domestic
life. I understand that the moment that I'm in the aura of the other that I have
suspended my identity. And I just watch what happens to me; nothing more,
nothing less, because it's not me. I watch what my partnership with my partner is.
I watch my relationship with my children. I watch this, because when we come
together something else happens. And it is beyond either of us.
By looking at the mechanic you can see where things are, you can see what's going
on. The electromagnetic connections that bring that spark that is both attractive and
repulsive, that spark that initiates love but can bring hate. The companionship that
can be so stabilizing and at the same time potentially deeply boring. The
compromise, the thorn in the side, the constant button pushing place, and the
moment in which you can see that, is the moment that you can be free of its pain.
After all, there is no need for us to suffer when we shift into a connection auric field.
And everything about who we are is rooted in our inner authority, which is not
something that that “it” can make. I don't make decisions based on what a
partnership aura decides. Do you know what I mean? I don't. It’s just something
that happens. It’s just something that you can watch.

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
Differentiation
The journey in Human Design, the whole journey is about differentiation. That’s all it
is about. It’s about differentiation. The only way that you can emerge as a really
unique being is that first and foremost you have to release yourself from your mind
controlling your life. It’s the first and foremost thing you must do. If you cannot do
that there is nowhere to go. History is full of teachers who said give up on your
mind, but gave you nothing else; it gave you nowhere to go.
Human Design says it’s very simple. We are a binary consciousness. This is the
thing about understanding the nine-centered being. We are a binary consciousness.
And we have ignored at our own peril in terms of our development the extraordinary
potential of our design consciousness. It’s what Human Design has brought to light.
It’s what Human Design in fact is bringing to the world is an understanding of what
we are now as this kind. We are a different species, a species in mutation. We have
been different for hundreds of years now without anyone being able to point to it,
explain it, lay it out. This is what this knowledge is.
It begins with understanding that because we are a binary consciousness that we
need to divide the roles of responsibility in terms of the way in which our cognitive
program operates. At the deepest level in the studies of Human Design we
understand that at the very core of all being is cognition. At the tonal level deep,
deep below the line, at the tonal level everything is about cognition. This is our
architecture. We are here to express the perfection relative to our limitation, the
expression of our perfection, our cognitive perfection. And in that each of us have a
potential to express that uniquely.
Homogenization
It begins with abandoning the mind as the be-all, end-all. It is the beginning of
understanding that we are not seven-centered, seven-chakra beings. That we are
not limited to left orientation, that we are not limited to simply strategic mental
development. This is not what our particular turn in the wheel is about. The seven-
chakra being perfected the possibility of mind. But of course, everything is a double-
edged sword. That development of strategic mind also turned the world into what it
is today, a homogenized horror land.
We are not seven-centered beings; we are nine-centered beings. We are very
different. We are not here to be homogenized. And homogenization only takes
place when you give authority to your mind to rule your life. And anyone who gives
authority to their mind to rule their life has given that authority to everybody else as
well to run their life, their friends, their lovers, their children, their dog, their
government, their priest, you name it, all those authorities that they turn to. This is
what the mind brought—homogenization. Nine million people come down with the
same cold at the same time and take the same medicines at the same time. This is
homogenization.

A LIFE STORY

It’s only when you turn to your inner authority, when you turn to your strategy, it is
only then that you can shatter the hold that your mind has on your life. It distorts
everything. It does not care about you, because it does not know who you are. It
does not; this being, oh, the power of the not-self. How incredibly powerful it is.
Eva: A Split Definition
And of course, this is a split definition. And you’ve got this tremendous force of
attraction that is there; those forces that can make it possible for the split to come
together. This is not a being
who is listening to, who is
honoring what is in fact in their
strategy. It is not. It doesn't
know how to operate in the
world. It’s angry. It was born
ready to be angry. This is an
emotional ego Manifestor.
There is so much rage here.
And of course, it's turned
against oneself. “I don't have
this, I should have this, I don't
have this, and I should have
this.” Remember that if you're
a split definition and it takes
one bridge to bridge that gap,
that becomes everything for
you; it becomes everything
that your mind is going to think
about. It distorts every decision that you are going to make. You don’t know. Your
mind doesn’t know. It’s not you. It’s seeking the not-self purpose. That's what it's
seeking. It’s seeking the not-self purpose.
Oh how deeply this being is looking for love. This little baby that comes into the
world to these parents who are 9 and 0, this baby that is born a Manifestor that has
no real way of being able to integrate its energy with its parents. This little girl with
her open G Center and this yearning for love and direction, with this 37th gate that's
hanging there, this need for the bond that is loyal and clean, this need for affection,
this need for romance in the 12th gate, this need for sex in the 35. Oh how deep
that is, and how hard it is for this child to feel that love in this family.
You can see how deeply as this being grows up it wants these things. As I told you
last time, if a sibling brings one, the sex of the sibling will determine many things in
this person's life. It will influence the way they look at certain men. It'll influence
the way they look at certain women. Whether it's the male or female archetype as
parent that makes a connection to one of these will influence this being all their life.
We are so deeply conditioned when we come into the world.

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
Unease in Others When a Manifestor Is Born
When a Manifestor baby comes into the world everybody is slightly uneasy. The
mothers know, they know while they're pregnant. A mother carrying a Manifestor
child, in this day and age we don’t have many women who bear many children, but if
you ask a woman who's had a couple of children or three children and one of them is
a Manifestor, if you knew the difference, not that you would know it was Manifestor,
but just knew the difference, oh yes, there is a certain unease. There’s an
uncontrollable thing about to emerge. And it’s not like that's ever conscious. It is
that deep, deep auric information that is there because the mother is carrying that
power inside of her.
When a Manifestor comes into the world, the way in which they are conditioned, is
that they are conditioned in a way that is, in terms of black humor, well, it couldn’t
be funnier considering that 92% of humanity are raised to be Manifestors,
Manifestors are not raised to be Manifestors at all. As a matter of fact, they’re not
really raised; they’re controlled. This little girl with her yearning for love, with her
yearning for wholeness in order to bring that bond together, this little girl with her
Manifestor aura with 9 and 0 parents who are going to feel like all they should do,
need to do, is control this being.
Reflect on Your Own Life Story
It can be quite disturbing, these kinds of journeys. It is a way in which the dark side
of ignorance is revealed. And yet, we all know that it has been part of our lives. It
has been part of our growing up. And it means that all of you in going through this
process also need to reflect on your own life story. If you have the good fortune of
being able to have reasonable data for parents, for siblings, lovers and partners and
children, it's quite a thing to look at. And it's quite a thing to follow the progression
from where it starts, to see the way in which we were conditioned when we were
young, and to see the dilemmas.
Nobody is to blame. I don't think anything has freed me more than being able to see
the limitation of everyone within a mechanical layout because it defines helplessness.
Your BodyGraph defines helplessness. This is what's possible for you; and yet, how
easily we are conditioned in this because of the power of mind to distort our lives.
The challenge for anyone in Human Design is to make decisions through your
Strategy and Authority, nothing else.
The Design of Forms
I was given extraordinary knowledge and incredible insights, because I was given the
design of forms. I wasn't simply given Human Design. My education was form

oriented from the inanimate to the single cell, plants, and all these different forms. I
have never really had a chance over the years; I mentioned it in this morning's
class. I think in Ibiza a couple of years ago, I dedicated the Ibiza event to doing
lectures on each of the forms. There's incredible knowledge that's there.
The Penta
For me, the most fantastic of the forms are the transpersonal forms. They were
fantastic in another sense of that word, fantastic. It is almost alien. It is almost out
of this world. These trans-auric forms are really extraordinary. The Penta is the
very foundation of existence. A Penta is a trans-auric form. If you look at all the
other forms, human and mammal and so forth, these are self-contained forms. And
these are self-contained forms with a resulting aura, a resulting aura with a certain
quality to it, that quality that we end up translating as type.
When we’re looking at a Penta or we’re looking at a WA, which is the largest of the
transpersonal auras, that the moment that we’re looking at a transpersonal aura this
is something that is not biological. It is electromagnetic and auric. And it means
that the moment three or four or five people come together, that automatically what
forms is this trans-auric form that we call the Penta.
Now, something to understand about it is that it morphs so easily. It goes from non-
existing to existing in a moment. It is constantly shifting. You're sitting in a café
with a friend of yours, somebody sits down at the table beside you, they are within
auric contact of you, the moment they are in auric contact, you stop being in your
partnership, you’re actually in a Penta. And even though you don't know that
person, even though you're not talking to that person, suddenly the rules of
engagement have changed. They’ve changed because you're operating under a
totally different influence, a different kind of matrix, very different.
Penta knowledge is extraordinary knowledge. And everything about the nature of
Penta is that this is the way that we are organized on this plane. Briefly to
understand it, Penta is basically and fundamentally the design of the way in which
we procreate. In other words, you cannot separate the way in which human beings
come together and make more from the existence of Penta. This is what Penta is all
about. Penta comes into existence as the by-product of genetic imperative. And the
moment that the genetic imperative succeeds, this is the moment that the Penta
emerges and the Penta basically is a homogenizing force. That is, it is a force that is
there to homogenize together in a certain harmony or certain quality of harmony the
various auras that are involved in the particular Penta.
Everything about Penta, because it is associated with the reproduction and the
producing of family, is that Penta is something that is unidirectional and it is
unidirectional with a material direction. Everything about the family construct is that
the family construct is ruled by materialism. Now, don’t we know that. And yet we
always think that it's about us as individuals or us in the way we organize ourselves.

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
But in fact, this is the way in which we are organized, in a way in which we are
helpless in that sense.
After all, we are a bio-form living on a material plane. That the only way in which we
are going to be able to succeed in terms of the genetic imperative is not simply that
we manage to get old enough to be sexually mature so that we can actually
reproduce, but that we are able to reproduce and not only are we able to reproduce,
we are able to reproduce successfully, we’re able to nurture the young, we’re able to
raise them, we’re able to educate them, and so forth and so on, so that they can
continue the genetic line.
The Core of the Penta
In other words, on the material plane,
family is the first business. It still is
for most of the world. It still is for
about half of all businesses in the
Western world, run by Ma’s and Pa’s,
the little corner store and whatever
the case may be. It is something to
understand that the drive of the family
is always oriented to its material
direction. Here’s the core of the
Penta. Here are the demands, these
demands that are rooted in the needs
of the Penta. And the demands are
focused on that material direction, that
material direction that in the now can
demonstrate its ability to be able to
provide.
There are many things that are
inherent in this particular matrix.
Obviously, there is a lot of education
involved in all of this. One of the
basic things and the simple things to
understand is that the whole thing
about this construct is that this
construct is rooted in not having any
area open. At the moment that there
are areas that are open, these areas
become, relative to their importance
and value within the construct, these
areas become the problem of the
Penta. And instead of the group or
the family being able to focus on the
business of being a family, they end

up spending a great deal of time being concerned about these aspects. And of
course, this becomes a problem for the family.
The Originating Family Penta
Now here we have an interesting configuration. That is, here we have the father and
the mother and we have Eva as a child and this is still her as a child, and this is the
originating family Penta. In other words, the first quality of Penta, the first variation
of Penta is a three. There are threes, fours, fives—threes are always a problem.
Threes are a problem because the genetic imperative says having one child is not
enough. There's no relief. Most couples know this if they’ve had one child. The fact
is that there is no relief. There is still a very powerful genetic force that is there at
work because in fact the genetic imperative is determined to produce at least two
offspring for every relationship. After all, if you produce two offspring, you maintain
the balance of population.
I live in Spain which has one of the lowest birth rates of any country in Europe. I
think it is 1.2 now. That is, for every couple there is 1.2, as a statistic, children
being produced, which means that basically Spaniards are slowly dying out. And this
isn't just true for them. It’s true for most of the tribes of Europe. That is, in
successful countries, in wealthy countries, there is a tendency to have less and less
children because of the expense, because of the desire to be able to give children as
much as possible; there are so many one-child families as a result.
Eva is Left Out
This is the beginning of
the Penta process, but it's
a triangle. One of the
things to understand
about a triangle, again
I’m not here to teach you
all this, I’m taking you
through a journey, one of
the things to understand
about a triangle is that
when you're in a triangle
only two people can look
each other in the eye.
So, somebody is always
left out. And because the
mother and farther are a
9 and 0, and because Eva
is a Manifestor, she's the
one that is going to be
left out. This is going to

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
be a very lonely period in her life, even though she will get the relative normal
attention that babies and young toddlers get. But this is not about how it feels.
The Inner Flow
The other thing is this area here (X), this area is very, very important because it's
the area that holds family together, this theme of inner flow here. This is where the
gap is. In other words, even at
the very beginning, this family
had real problems at the
beginning holding itself together
as a family. He would go off; she
would be stuck with Eva, neither
of them satisfied in that
relationship.
If you’re a mother with a
Manifestor child, trying to have a
relationship with that child is
very difficult—the warmth, the
connectivity. The fact is as well
the mother is always trying to
envelop the child in her
Generator need to really envelop
the other and Eva remains a
mystery, which raises the
concerns about control, because she can’t get in. You can’t get in because you have
that Manifestor aura that is just repelling it.
The Penta with an Additional Child
Then you have this area here (Y). This is
about the family showing themselves
together. Not only do you have two areas
that demonstrate immediately that these
three don't look like a family at all, and don't
feel like one.
And then, life is funny, this is the son that
gets born into this family (chart next page),
the younger brother that comes into this
family. Now, this is really quite incredible.
Everything that runs between the Throat and
the Sacral Center is related to Penta. People
who have this kind of activation really belong
in family. Family for them is something that
A Life Story is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

27
A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
is going to be deeply, deeply natural. Not only that, but they bring a great deal of
consistency into the way in which
the family is going to operate.
So the moment that the son comes,
the moment that the family goes
from being a three to being a four,
we’ve got a new picture. First of all,
this (Inner Flow) has been filled in.
And you can see this is the brother;
the dominance of the brother in
terms of really gluing this family
together, this is the glue. It is right
here. So the moment that the
brother comes is the moment that a
family begins to emerge.
Now, there is still this dysfunction.
This is not a family that you’re going
to see all four of them outside very often together. I know, I have this with my
family. In my family we have this place as a gap. And the fact of the matter is that
other than extremely rare occasions, I think normally about once a year at the Ibiza
event, other than that, you never get to see all of us out together at the same time.
It’s incredibly rare.
One of the things to understand about families is that if you don't understand this, if
you don't know this is an aspect of the way in which your particular family operates,
it does become a problem. Why don't we all go out together? Why can’t we be like
those people over there or that family over there? We never do things together, why
don't we all go out and do things together? And then of course, there's blame,
because that's the first thing that happens. You get all this blame. We’re not all
going out there together because you don't want to. It’s your fault because you are
not interested. But it isn't anybody's fault. This group isn't intended to go out there
together. They’re not at all.
Stability: Safe at Home
Now, something else has happened. When
we were just with the mother and the father
and Eva and we were in the Penta theme
rooted in the three, the theme was tension,
compromised tension, constantly a basic
tension being there. And now, we've moved
into something totally different. And by the
way, it happened the moment the child was
born. It is incredible what happens when
you go from a three to four because where
A Life Story is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School
All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2008 Jovian Archive Corporation
28
Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
in a three there is always a tension—only two people can look at each other at the
same time—in a four there’s balance and in that balance is stability. It’s like a table
with three legs or four legs. It’s a four-legged table. It is very, very stable and this
theme is: safe at home.
What that means literally is that from the moment that the brother comes in, the
environment changes. It actually becomes a home. It becomes a home because the
brother makes it happen. This gap that was there that doesn't hold everybody
together, the brother brought that. But it holds everybody together within the
house. What that means is that everybody feels very safe within their own
environment. They don't really want to go out. It doesn't mean necessarily that
they're all happy, but there is harmony that is there. So, this is a different
environment. It's a very different environment.
One of the things that is interesting to
notice in this is that because you're able
to see the components and because
you're able to see the contributions the
various individuals make within the
construct of the Penta, you can begin to
understand the burdens that are there
on them. And that you can see here
that the moment that you're dealing
with Penta—remember I showed you
that everything about the nature of
Penta is that Penta is unidirectional, this
is the way that it works, it’s
unidirectional, and it is always just
doing that. This is what it's doing with
the mainstream being here.
But everything is about getting it out and the getting it out is here (Discipline,
Demonstration and Tradition). This is an area in which the model of the family is
established. You can see that there is no demonstration here. And because this is a
unidirectional form it means there's tremendous energy going there (Discipline) and
there's tremendous energy going here (Tradition), instead of out here
(Demonstration). The only person that can express this is the mother (Discipline
and Tradition).
The Mother Carries the Burden
The first thing you notice is that, and the most difficult, is the upper left side (see
circled on the next page) where the mother is going to have to be responsible for the
discipline, she's going to have to carry the burden of disciplining this group. She is
the one that has to lay down the law. She's the one who has to create the
orderliness that is going to be there in the family itself. That’s not an easy thing to
do. It isn't, because it's always there and it's always the burden. She’s the one who
A Life Story is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

29
A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
really has to make sure that everything is taken care of. She's the one who has to
make sure that there's
continuity in the development
of the children, that there is
both a past for them and a
future. It puts a tremendous
amount of weight on her.
Of course, we know something
about her. We know something
really sad. This is not what she
wants to do. This is not what
her life for her was about in
terms of her fantasy, her not-
self purpose, that just becomes
a burden and a duty. How
many families operate that way? If you break them down being by being, separate
from what happens in the constructs of the meeting of the different kinds of auras,
the dreams, the hopes. Without awareness there is no hope, there isn't.
Every Human Being Has a Right to be Correct
I look at this family and obviously I'm looking at it with an enormous advantage, the
advantage of the knowledge, the advantage of my training over all of these years to
just look at it, just see what's so obvious to see when you understand these things.
But it was human beings, it was their lives. How sad, because every human being
has a right to be correct, every human being has a right to be nurtured in a way that
is correct for them, and that there is no such thing as a design that doesn't have the
potential to transform. There is no such thing.
The most difficult thing is to not focus on what cannot be affected, the past, our own
families, the relationships that we are in, the relationships that began when we were
not-self. It's not about abandoning. It is about awakening to being aware. In
awareness, everything works out. It does. This is the magical gift of being able to
have a Strategy and Authority in this life. We are these objects moving in space.
Decisions are navigation. This is the way.
So long we have been lost. The mind cannot navigate these neutrinos seas; it
cannot. That’s not its job. There's a whole new process that is available to the
Personality. It is something that the Personality has been waiting for through
incarnation and incarnation over millennia and millennia through variations of
evolutionary development in our species, waiting for the opportunity to be able to be
free so that it can fulfill its cognitive purpose, free of the burdens, free of the lies,
free of the manipulation, free of the conditioning so that it can watch.

Lesson Two
From 3 to 4
The Doing Gets Done if You Trust in Your Vehicle
Everybody thinks there is something to do. There’s nothing to do. If you trust in
your vehicle, the doing gets done. The moment that you can have trust is the
moment that you can free yourself from the fear that drives you to look to your mind
for an answer. It’s not the answer. It will never be the answer. It's not its job. The
magic of being a binary consciousness is that there is a consciousness to run the life
and there is a consciousness to enjoy it. That's really a treat. I like being the
passenger in the back seat. I like being free of the responsibilities of the illusion, the
delusion that I'm in charge of this life, that it’s my life, that I do what I think I should
do, all that nonsense.
Oh how sweet it is to just watch. And it is not detachment. It’s hard to be detached
when you're in the back seat; you're in the back seat, you're connected to the whole
thing. That’s the magic. In being connected to the whole thing you filter it uniquely,
consciousness. It’s what your cross is about, it’s what your signature is about, and
it’s what your whole potential is about. Everywhere you look, everywhere in this
journey is conditioning, oh poor Eva, yeah, yeah, but there are so many Eva’s. The
world is full of them, because this is the way that human beings live, this is the way
they meet, love, this is the way they raise their children in ignorance based on what
they think is good.
Embrace the Simple
You’ve got 12 million teenagers in the United States taking Ritalin. What kind of
insanity is that? I don’t know any other word for it. It’s just insanity. There’s
nothing wrong with human beings. There’s something terribly wrong with the not-
self. It’s a disease, it’s a sickness. The only thing that you can do is embrace the
simple, embrace it, because this is what this knowledge is. If truth is not simple it is
not truth. It’s just blah, blah. It’s so simple.
You follow that Strategy and Authority and you let go and you watch. Your life will
be okay. Your life will be better than okay. It will be your life, slowly but surely, day
by day, decision by decision. And if you don't watch, you don't get the joy of the
movie. It’s the watching that is so incredible. It’s what we're here for. Otherwise,
why bother with Personality Crystals at all; just dumb beasts in the field. We are
here to exalt the potential of consciousness. We’re not here to be dumbed down in
universal homogenized yuck. All the old crap, all the old philosophies, all the old
religions, all the old moralities, all the stuff that chains you to somebody else's loss,
somebody else's authority until you’ve got God with his thumb on your head.
Conditioning
This is not what we’re all about. I do not teach sheep. This is not what we’re about.
These forms, what happens to a human being—hey, there is still a child here. She
still is a child. She is still a child that is a Manifestor. She is still a child whose

parents are ignorant. She’s still a child. And she’s going to carry all that crap into
her adulthood. And it’s going to affect everything she does and everyone she is
with. It is going to impact every relationship that she has. And it's just conditioning.
The great malaise is to be ignorant.
I don't mind conditioning. I think conditioning is really cool. I'm unemotional and if
I wasn't conditioned every once in a while by the emotional system life would be
really boring. I have no problem with conditioning. It doesn't make my decisions.
I'm not not-self. So what I take in is a richness in my observing experience, things I
get to learn about, become wise about. That's the magic that is there for us.
Yes, there is much we can do. We can help families, those that are trained to do so.
We can help individuals. We can do all of that. But until we awaken from being
locked in a homogenized world, until we awaken to the reality of what we are and
how we function, there is nowhere to go. It begins with each and every one of you.
It begins with your process; no one else's. It is your own process. It is guided by
your own determination and courage. It lives according to the spirit that you bring
to it.
It is only out of your own process and your own dedication that you get to that
place, not for me, not for anybody else, not to prove this or that, not to be this or
that. But to fulfill what is your right to be this unique being and to offer out of your
awareness unique expression. Oh it's easy to be here on this plane, I know, I love
it. And I love it because I understand everything has been given. Nothing has been
taken away, because when you are aware there is nothing to lose.
All right folks, that's it for today. All of you take care and until next time, bye for
now.

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
Hello and welcome to all of you. We come to a really interesting place today. I think
it's one of the most fascinating things to understand about the nature of
conditioning. You can see the title for today is: Patterns of Homogenization. This is
the way in which we are inclined to accept homogenization in life. After all, we’re a
fundamental binary and there are two ways that we can go. That is, we can be
homogenized or not. The tendency, obviously, is to be homogenized. The genetic
imperative, our attractiveness to what we are not, is an overwhelming force in our
lives.
I think it's very difficult in so many ways for an adult to remember truly what it was
like to live in the world of the giants, to live in the world of these enormous forces
that stood above you and conditioned you. There is always this assumption in the
vanity of ignorance that at some point you leave your parents, your siblings behind
and you establish your own life. Of course, it’s a joke in way. That is, the not-self is
going to navigate according to the way in which it's been conditioned, and it's going
to make choices based on the way in which it’s conditioned and it's going to lead it
into a specific conditioned life.
The Dilemma of Being a Human Being
Anyway, let's take a look at these patterns of homogenization. I want to stop for a
moment and take a look at the
dilemma of what it is to be a human
being. After all, the nature of this
course is an overview of the way in
which we can look at the human life
and see it through various levels of
mechanics. One of the things that we
see within the nature of the
BodyGraph is we see our inherent
susceptibility to conditioning.
Everything you see in white has a
conditioning value to it at one level or
another. And despite the fact that
there seems to be these very tall
columns of information, all these
various aspects that are truly you, or

33
A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
certainly represent your unique possibility on this plane, that the fact is that there is
more whiteness than anything else and always will be. And that's what we care
about. It seems almost perverse, in a way.
We are driven by our very nature to seek out what we are not and to feel that there
is something lacking in us. Now of course, from the genetic point of view, all of that
is terrific, we know what that leads to, it leads to pair bonding and reproduction and
the Penta and the whole story of the way in which life is marshaled along on this
plane. But, it is something to understand that we begin this life deeply, deeply
vulnerable to conditioning. And of course, it's what we receive.
And it isn't about the kind of conditioning that can be altered. In other words, the
way the parents treat the child, these kinds of factors. No, I'm talking about the
helplessness of what it is to be born into an environment in which you are going to
be conditioned in a certain way. And that conditioning that you meet, the way in
which you are hooked up, the way in which you're defined, the way in which you're
connected, that those very connections represent markers that are going to be
established for you, that are going to create preferences for you for the rest of your
life. Not just preferences, but prejudices as well, as we'll see. It’s an interesting
process.
Eva’s Split Definition
Okay, let's begin here. Let’s begin with something very basic because this is what
the theme is going to be today and
the theme is going to be the subject
of this particular split definition. We
know, we’ve looked at now and seen
these two aspects. We have an
emotional Manifestor. We’ve got a
split-off emotional Manifestor, and
we have this unconscious movement
from the Spleen moving up to the
Heart Center, and from the Heart
Center to the Throat Center. And of
course, this is very powerful, this is
an ego Manifestor and at the same
time it is cut off from the emotional
authority. Again, when you're
looking at this emotional system
you're looking at a very, very
powerful, recognize that, you're looking at a very powerful emotional system that
isn't integrated.
And what we know about the split definition more than anything else, and again 45%
of humanity are split definitions, so approximately half of this class is going to be a
split definition that for the split definition the most powerful of all conditioning are

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
the bridge elements that will bring the split together. And those bridge elements
that will bring the split together in the easiest possible fashion. That is, here's a
classic example where any of these three single activations, the 35, the 12, or the
37, any of these activations are going to bring together this split definition.
Not-Self Mental Decision Making
Now, think about that. It’s something to think about, because what I'm pointing to
is a whole person's life. And I do not jest. Think about the way in which the not-self
mind operates. It’s one way for you to confront what is the potential dysfunction of
your own mental process. How does the not-self work? Everything about life is
about decision making. So you have the potential for true decision making through
inner authority, or you have not-self mental decision making. And not-self mental
decision making is always based on openness. This is what the not-self mind feeds
on.
So, in this particular case, you really have three different things that that mind can
feed on. And when the mind feeds on things, the undercurrent is fear. Fear is a
great force. And understand that the mind is always trying to control the life, which
by the way for this particular being is an issue anyway. So, what does she want?
And it's not what she wants from the outside. It’s not like a split definition who
wakes up in the morning saying where am I going to find that other. It doesn't work
that way.
The way it works is they wake up in the morning and they say why can't I be like...
Why, why can I not have romance in my life? Why not? Why can't I get out of the
dullness and the boredom of all this and have some kind of different experience.
Why can't I? Why can't I find something, or anyone that I can trust? Why can't I?
Is it because of me? Is it my problem?
Now of course, that would be terrific if it was a Generator because Generators will
actually have that kind of process. But as a Manifestor, Manifestors are very, very
weak other than in specific situations. They're not the kinds of beings that are
looking inward. This person feels handicapped. They feel like there's something
missing, and that there is something that they have to have.
The Throat Center: The 45th Gate
Oh, look at this person and look at their Throat, isn't this a fascinating Throat?
There’s nothing. There's nothing. There’s nothing. There’s nothing. Come on, it’s
eleven gates. You don’t see that every day. Not only that, it's defined. And it’s
defined through an unconscious 45.
One of the most beautiful things about learning about the Throat is how profound it
is to begin to understand how each gate of the throat has its own voice and what it
really says. This 45 talks about what it has and what it doesn’t have. So, for this

being this can be an obsession that they don't have the romance, that they don't
have the excitement, that they don't have the trust, that they don't have the loyalty,
that they can’t find a deal in life that works. And they’re a Manifestor. It makes
them angry.
No matter what their life is going to be, and I'm still talking about a child, after all,
no matter what this being’s life is going to be, those three things are going to haunt
them their whole life. This is the not-self in all its power. This is what the not-self
does in the whole life. I have to have that. Why can't I have that? It’s pissing me
off. I want it. There is another tragedy that comes; that when you get it, you don’t
necessarily like it for long because it’s not yours. And it hasn't really changed you at
all. And because you are unaware, you'll just think that well, it's got to be somebody
else, and on it goes.
The Conditioning Power of the Sacral Center
There’s something else to understand about this being. It’s something to really pay
attention to when you're dealing with non-sacral beings. After all, we have three
types that make up about 30% of the population—Projectors, Manifestors and
Reflectors—who are non-sacral. Whenever you're looking at a non-sacral being, look
at the Sacral Center and see either what the hanging gates are, that is, these gates
that are sticking out, or those gates that are pointed at it, as an example, because
one of the things that is very important to understand about conditioning phenomena
in these types is the power of the conditioning of the Sacral Center itself. And of
course, this is one of those elements that is going to be there.
Remember that it's not just simply these three areas that are going to act as
conditioning fields. They are going to be the prime ones. So when this not-self mind
is deciding whether it should do this or that it's going to be based on whether it
thinks it finally has a decent deal, whether it thinks that there is something romantic
in all of that, that it can be creative with it, that it can hook into it, that something is
going to be different.
The Open G Center
But there's more. There is never knowing when enough is enough, always looking
for love and direction. Look at that G Center; where do I go? Do I look to the past;
do I look to the future? Do I stare at my navel and hope like hell something
happens? What do I do? Where do I go?
You end up looking for this (bridging gates); you never know when enough is
enough, never. It’s what it is to be a human being; it is what it is to be ignorant.
It’s nobody’s fault. It’s not about blame. It’s about serendipity, it’s about good
fortune, and it’s about fractal lines. Not everybody gets an opportunity to meet their
mechanics, to understand what drives them, what holds them, what locks them, to
understand that they were set up from the beginning.

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
The Father and the 12/22
All right, so we have the 37, the 12, and the 35. We have the father with the 12,
and we have a father that has the whole channel. So what we know about this
channel is that this channel is a compromise. There’s something interesting about
the 12/22. So many people hook into the 12/22 and think aha, the channel of the
social being. One of the most
important exercises when you first
begin to try to master this knowledge
is to look at every single channel and
look at their opposite. What I mean
by that is the “this and that.” And one
of the classic examples is the 12/22,
the channel of the social being, the
channel of the anti-social being. This
is a sociability that is particularly
individual, that is there only to be able
to try to mutate the other. And of
course the way it all comes out is
controlled by the father.
Now, let’s go back for a moment. The
12 belongs to the father. Think about
that now. When you think about the 12/22, the 12/22 carries many values sexually.
It is really all about romance. It's about listening. The attraction in the 12/22,
particularly from the perspective of the 22, is to have somebody to listen to and to
have somebody who will listen to you. But the being that's going to control that 12,
they’re going to control the whole thing, they're going to control this as a
compromise. They're going to control if there is anything to be said or not. And
they’re as likely to be anti-social as social.
The 12th Gate, the G Center, the Sacral Center and Romance for Eva
And guess what this does to this person's romance in the future. There isn't going to
be any, because the moment that she's going to smell that 12 is the moment that
she’s going to smell her father. It’s so interesting the way it works. And because it's
not fulfilling—if this was a pure electromagnetic it would be very powerful. It would
set her up for men having the 12.
The thing that really is deeply conditioning here is this (Eva’s open 6th gate pointing
at a hanging 59th gate). Here’s the father (defined 6th gate) on the other side.
Everything about the G Center, here’s the father with these same three going
upwards, but the father is a powerful, powerful Sphinx; powerful Sphinx. This is the
kind of person that really pushes other human beings into directions. This is a very

37
A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
powerful force. It lights up Eva, we know that. Lights it up, gives it an identity, she
who has nothing there.
So, we have these two places, the 12 where the father hooks into what is the natural
conditioning, but in a sense, ends up making romance in the future problematic.
That is, the romantic connection
problematic. But at the same time
there is this deep conditioning that
comes that activates the Sacral Center
and turns on all those themes in the
identity. And this intimacy, again, it is
the father that is stamping the
intimacy.
Now, think about their relationship.
These are a Manifestor and a
Manifesting Generator and they’re both
emotional. The Manifestor has a closed
off aura. There is no real intimacy
between them. There isn't. And yet, it
is the pull of intimacy and yet, it's not
there. And she's going to smell that in the imprint of any 6. And somebody that has
the 6 and has the 12 who happens to be a woman, it's not going to feel right. It's
not going to feel right, even though there's absolutely nothing. After all, we are here
to take in from the other. This is where we get our wisdom. What happens in
conditioning is that you become prejudiced. You become prejudiced that the 6-12
combination belongs to the male and not necessarily one you’re going to have sex
with. It'll depend on the nature of the relationship between the two.
The Brother
But let's keep on moving in our journey
here. Here comes the brother. You can
see that the brother is not going to be
able to bring in terms of this zone, the
37, the 12, the 35, the brother has
nothing to do with that. But the
brother has very powerful 6 activation
from Jupiter and Pluto. So, the brother,
like the father, brings the intimacy.
Think about it. Not only does it bring
the intimacy, but look at all this stuff
(brother’s 3 channels in the Penta), this
family. This is the Penta lock, this is
what draws this family together, the
power that is there in this child, the
fourth person in the Penta.

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
The Penta
Remember something about the nature of four in the Penta, it’s a lock. There’s
nothing that locks you in more than the Penta. As a matter of fact, as a family,
though other than the brother, this is not really a strong Penta-oriented family. It’s
the last child, the brother that holds all of this together. It’s their thing; and holds it
together by being a four.
Remember what the three was like, the alienation that was there from the beginning,
the difficulty of the mother being in a world with a Manifestor daughter and not being
able to penetrate her. And then finally comes this very, very powerful Generator into
the family, comes into the family and suddenly you've got this four and you’ve got
this very powerful home structure that suddenly emerges, and it locks everybody in,
whether they care about each other or not, whether they feel any real intimacy to
each other or not, regardless of what is there.
Everything about the brother is that in a sense, I don't mean to put this to sound so
negative, but the brother is sort of like the warden in the prison. It’s the one that
closes the door. It makes it very difficult to get out; very difficult to get out. Within
the context of the Penta, the 46/29 is really about the glue, it’s really about holding
things together. There is a struggle to break out of that, because this is a force
trying to pull everything in, literally trying to pull everything in.
But, I want to go back to the conditioning imprint and go back to the phenomena of
what this means in terms of the way in which she is dragged into the dual generative
field, the generation of the father, also through the 2/14, the brother through the
2/14 and all of this turning on her Sacral system and turning it on through the
channel of intimacy.
Written Comment: Eva often said she did bring up her brother – as her mother
already was very depressive.
Oh, yeah, I assume that she had no choice. His very configuration demanded that
the basic functions of the family had to be looked after. This is what this incredible
strength is that is there in terms of the way in which this dominates the Penta.
The Potential of Love for Eva
What is classic, though, is the way in which you can see that the potential of love for
her, because that's really my theme, next time I'll show you the boyfriend she left
the husband for, we haven’t reached the husband yet, we’ll get there. It's about
how without knowing how things can be so distorted for you that you really don't get
a chance, you don’t.

It’s why so often I refer to the fact that this knowledge was not intended for adults in
the sense that the knowledge was something intended for children coming into the
world so that they can be properly raised. And obviously because it's new
knowledge it has to go through an initial generation of adults. That’s why we have
all this deconditioning stuff that fills up so much of Human Design now.
The reality is that we get set up so early. And most of the time, by the time you
figure it out, you’re already deep into your life. It’s not like you figure it out when
you’re 16. You don’t. Not unless there's somebody there to help you. And really
what I'm trying to demonstrate here is how deep the genetic conditioning is. It's
really deep.
Eva Wants the 35, the 12, the 37 and is Vulnerable to the 6
So, let's go back to her story just for a moment. More than anything else she wants
the 35, she wants the 12, and she wants the 37. She is very, very vulnerable to the
6. Being a non-sacral being she's very vulnerable to that generative field and that is
a way that is going to make access. Also, by the way, are the other two
possibilities—the 52 and the 3, as an example.
Now, think about the nature of romance for her. Think about what it is to be not-
self. As a not-self being she is looking for three things to fall in love with. It’s what
happens. Think about love. Everybody has that in their story; everybody has that in
their life. Everybody knows. This is what it means to be conditioned. It isn't that
this being as a child, for example, that that’s the way it's working in them. It’s just
setting up a connection.
That 6 that is there, it’s not like the child is seeing that as not-self or whatever. This
is the frequency that they get from their father. It's a frequency that they get from
their brother. It is what becomes the most familiar thing for them in terms of what
intimacy represents. Intimacy for them is always going to have that stamp on it,
always.
And they're looking for that love, but, if we look at the 12/22 in this case, and we
see how the father is going to bring the compromise to that, how in fact that the
father can control whether it wants to listen or not, it is not ever going to be a real
two-way street. The value of the quality of that 12 is going to leave a certain taste
in this being, a certain taste that, in essence, when there is a male that is going to
carry that frequency, it’s something they're not going to trust. And they’re
conditioned to be attracted to something they're not going to trust and they will
check it out.
Always Looking for the Bridge
But this is what they’re looking for. They’re looking for those aspects. This is what
it's all about for the average human being. As long as they can find a bridge, that’s
A Life Story is a program of the (IHDS) International Human Design School

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
it. That’s the criteria. And the bridges that you’re given as a child are the ones that
you lean on. They become what you recognize. And they become in that recognition
either something that you want or something you reject because you do recognize it
as a conditioning force.
I’m a 49 down here in an open emotional system. I have two sisters that have the
19th gate. It is an uncomfortable thing for me the moment that I am somehow
attracted to a woman who has the 19. There’s something wrong with it. It's not like
there is something wrong with it; but, there's something wrong with it. It feels
funny. It feels incestuous. It doesn't feel right, even though it's not incestuous.
Even though there's absolutely nothing the matter with it. But I was conditioned by
my sisters. It's the way that it works. The fact is that there may have been in my
life many, many women, who knows, with the 19 who may have been wonderful for
me. It never worked out that way, because there was that thing.
We all have this; we all grew up with this. This is the thing to understand. It’s not
just about looking at your parents and saying, okay, blah, blah, blah. Look at the
way you hook up, look at the way you connect. Look at your siblings. Look at the
life around you. Look at your relationship with one child over another child and look
at the way those children impact those hotspots that you've got. And whether they
match the ones that your mother or your brother or your sister, whatever it was,
had. Oh, you get to see the movie. It dominates our lives. This is the tragedy of
the not-self.
And then of course, you end up being attracted to something that truly is not for
you. You end up having children. The children end up growing into the same
conditioning. It goes on and on. It’s been going on and on forever. And the
mechanics are so simple, so straightforward, it’s right in front of your face, you just
get to see it. It’s just there.
Experiment with No Longer Making Decisions with the Mind
You can’t help anybody until they're ready to experiment with no longer making
decisions with the mind. You can’t help anybody and you can't help yourself. You
can’t. You can never separate your mind making decisions from who you are not,
because that's what drives it. It’s what always drives it, has driven it from the
beginning of your life. And you cannot play some intellectual game with your mind
in which you try to instruct them into not making decisions. This is what Strategy
and Authority is.
Strategy and Authority is the only way that you shift that process. You shift it. And
the moment you do that, the moment you give it over to what is your vehicle, that's
when things can change, not until. And it's only when you give it over to the vehicle
that you can begin to free yourself from the conditioning of these forces so you can
finally see them for what they are. Conditioning in and of itself is not bad.
Ignorance is bad.

In awareness all conditioning is interesting. We are here to be stimulated. All of the
openness in us are receptors to the world. But we're not here to be lost in that.
We're here to have a defined principle that is a differentiated existence. This is what
we're here for. We're only going to be able to live out our difference when we are
not driven by these forces. But we are observers of them, and in observing them no
longer trapped, because it is not a mind that is going to decide, it is not; so one is
freed.
The Husband
Here’s the husband. I think it’s really interesting that it turned out this way, because
of course you never know when you look at charts. There are all kinds of variations
and themes. But the first
thing you’ve got to look at
it is this (12-22, 35-36).
There’s nothing there,
nothing at all. And there's
absolutely nothing here
(59-6). So that 6 and that
12, that hooking up and
firing of the Sacral through
defined powerful Sacrals,
the energy driving forward,
it’s not there.
Do you know how
uncomfortable it is to be a
Manifestor and to live with
Generators? It's difficult.
And the Generator power is
something she identifies
with, with those male
forces, and that part of the male forces that made her uncomfortable. And look at
this guy. And oh yes, there it is, laid right out.
The 40/37
By the way, there’s something very interesting about this chart. Invariably when
you see the 40/37 because they're an opposition in the wheel that form a definition,
that invariably when you see them it usually is through the Sun/Earths or through
the Nodes, but here is a case in which it is built entirely on activations—the Jupiter
with the two Plutos. And you can see that this is a very, very different kind of way in
which one can examine the 40/37. It’s not a subject I want to get into, but having
an example here is an interesting way of pointing it out.

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
The real key here is that she found something (the 37) that she could love that was
not in any way tainted. Let me go back for a second. This is the connection to the
powerful Sacral through the 6, here is the power
of the father and again the same thing, the same
combination, and you can see clearly she didn't
want to have anything to do with it. But you had
to have her conditioning. And of course, it's a
classic in that she's a 49 and he's a 19 at the
other end. Of course, that's turns out to be a
very powerful compromise, a deeply powerful
double compromise in that case in which he
controls all of that.
It’s so interesting to what happens to us. We
think we're getting away from, “I don’t want a
man like that, I want a real family,” understand
she's incredibly tribal. This is a very powerful
tribal force. There she is; that’s powerful. So,
when you’re looking at this, you’re looking at real tribal configuration. You've got
the whole circuitry. Basically not fertile; this is not the theme. And it’s not going to
be the theme. But you can see the power that is here in that alignment.
Combination Chart of Eva and Her Husband
Let’s take a look at their chart;
you can see it more clearly
here. You can see that in this
particular situation they remain
non-sacral in that. And you
can see that they’re a 6 and 3.
And of course, 9 and 0
nowhere to go, and 8 and 1
have some fun, and 7 and 2
work to do, and 6 and 3 better
to be free. This is not an ideal
relationship to begin with.
Eva is Looking for Her Tribe
But look at what she's looking for. She's looking for her tribe. She's looking for
family. But she’s looking for family that is not Pentic at all. She’s looking for that
tribal connection. She's looking for marriage. She's looking for a contract. She's
looking for a deal. This is a classic tribal approach. Thank you very much; I don't
want the intimacy, thank you very much. I just want a good solid deal. Get me the
hell out of this house and give me a bargain that's going to work.

43
A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
You can tell from the nature of this bargain that it's immediately going to break down
because the linchpin in all of this is the fact that you have compromises in these two
channels that in essence are the key to this relationship. [A written comment and
laughing] That’s wonderful. Ilse writes: the deal was that he would win a Nobel
Prize and she’d have a nice life, and he didn't. He broke the deal. That’s very funny.
The compromises are a killer.
But it's so interesting about what you think is going to set you free. I can't tell you
how many people I know in which I've looked at their first relationship or their first
marriage and then looked at the person that they think is going to be the next one.
And invariably you just simply get patterns. And if I could've seen their parents I’d
get those patterns as well. And again, it is all dependent on the variations.
A Story of a Friend of Ra’s
One of my favorite stories is a rock ‘n’ roll musician who is a friend of mine many,
many years ago, in the early years of Ibiza. He was very fond of the ladies and was
very busy with all that. He was a mama's boy. He loved his mother and his
mother—I know that simply from having the experience of being with him a few
times when he visited his parents. His mother doted on him. He was a split. He
had three possibilities that could be bridges, the similar to this. And all three the
mother brought him. The father brought him none. I went through a whole
collection of his girlfriends and their charts and it was hilarious. They were all, in
one way or another, his mother.
Patterns are Established Long before Any Kind of Cognitive Capacity
This is the whole thing about this kind of conditioning. It works either this way or
that way. If the mother was not the doting loving mother, but turned out to be a
horrible uncaring person, let's say, with those same connections, then this is the one
thing that he just wouldn't want. Do you know what I mean? Patterns are being
established long before you even have any kind of cognitive capacity. They’re just
being imprinted into you, and there is no way of escaping this.
So, when you finally get that point, when the button is hit, and you can see, classic
button, and one that doesn't come from the family so it feels different, and one that
offers a deal and one that offers the whole bargain structure that is absolutely
essential to the tribe, it all looks good on paper. It isn’t going to work.
Human beings—I’m always astonished whenever I do this kind of thing, you look at
somebody and you see how easy it is for their whole life to be distorted. And it’s not
like you can wag your finger anywhere, you can’t. It's the mechanism. It's the way
that the mechanism works. This is what this knowledge is here for. It’s not about
the fact that the by-product of this knowledge is something that can transform a
human being’s life.

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
First and foremost this knowledge is here to lay out just this, mechanics. We are
deeply privileged as these transitional nine-centered forms that the mechanics are
here, that we can see them. And in seeing the mechanics begin this process of re-
educating ourselves. But if you don't have a shudder going through you as you look
at this, think about your children or your friends or your lovers or whatever. Think
about the other. Think about these beings and what moves them in their lives.
Think about it. Think about how lost the not-self is, how lost it is.
Getting Trapped
You never get to be you. You never get to see what is correct from you, who was
correct for you, where is correct for you, how is correct for you. You don’t get any of
that. You get the trap. You get the seduction of the other thing that you think is
what you have to have, have to have, only to discover that it's not you. It's not
what you thought it was going to be, not at all, you don’t feel better at all. Now you
feel trapped.
Think about what it is to have a gate sitting in a center and it’s pointed outward. It's
pointed at 1080 possibilities. That's what it's pointed at. And 1080 possibilities
multiplied by all planetary variables that can be on the other side, we’re talking
about tens of thousands of possibilities. And there you are on the other side with
your very deeply fixed little aspect yearning for something that may be over there
and then you get one. But it’s that fixed little line of the other that you get. You
don't get all those other possibilities, those thousands of other possibilities; you don't
get them at all. And sooner or later you realize that. Sooner or later you realize
you've been trapped. Well, this was sort of the right thing, but not really the right
thing. It started off okay, but it's not really the right thing. No, and the next one
won’t be either.
Wisdom is In the Openness
It’s a trap. You get that one variation on the other side and yet you have the gift of
tasting every single one. Every single one; it’s called wisdom. Oh, I love my
hanging gates, my open centers, and my open anything now. It is incredible
entertainment. It's fascinating. My 49 in my emotional system knows so many
variations of the 19, so many variations. You can begin to really sense them,
distinguish them, understand, make sense of, know, whatever.
Oh, it’s a fabulous thing. But most human beings can never, ever, ever get to that
place where they are a passenger and they watch what they're designed to be
receptive to, not trapped by it, not locked in like a fool, because that's what you get.
You get the fool’s road. And not the exalted fool, the mundane fool. All for naught;
all this great packaging, all this fabulous hardware, this incredible possibility of what
it is to be in these forms, all for nothing, so you can die.

Surrendering
And it's just here, because here says it all. It says you can't talk yourself out of it.
You can’t think your way out of it. You can’t save yourself. You’re wired. You’re
wired at birth. You were given your preferences, your prejudices. They are not to
be shaken. They will never go away, and they will never be you. All you can do is
surrender. It is choiceless when it comes to the mind’s game. You can only
surrender. It means you surrender and give up making decisions with your mind.
It’s her mind that drives her to make that deal. It’s her mind that makes up some
cockamamie story about how good it feels that this is what she was looking for, that
she finally has found it, someone she can trust. Yeah, yeah.
Over and over and over again human beings fall into the same trap, because you
don’t know how to make a decision, because you’re a sucker for the pressure of the
world. Human beings don't care; most of them just don't care. They don't have
time to care. Most human beings can't afford to change their lives. This is what
homogenization does. It slowly kills you off. It slowly wastes you away. It dulls
everything down. It takes out all the fine points. You cannot live in that world and
be fulfilled.
Radically Embracing the Experiment of Human Design
I used to think that I had to sort of coddle people coming into Design—adults having
to go through a deconditioning process seven years, and all that stuff. I figured that
I couldn't push them too hard. It was all new. It was their experiment. I know the
river is not mine, timing doesn't belong to me. But I know something now, after all
these years, because I've seen it over and over and over again. If you do not
embrace this radically, I don't think there's anywhere for you to go. Human Design
is interesting. But then again, it's pointless unless you are the experiment; truly. To
avoid the truth by understanding the truth is so perverse.
That’s what this knowledge does. It’s here to just eliminate the bullshit. That's what
mechanics do. You can’t argue about it. It’s just mechanical. And you cannot fix it.
All these fixers that want to fix it. You can't fix it. You can’t color in what's not
there. You can’t train your mind to take care of it. You can't fix it. It’s not
supposed to be fixed. There’s nothing wrong. It's the awareness that is lacking. It
always comes back to the same thing. And you cannot be aware if your mind is
trying to run your life, because then you end up like Eva, just like her, never
knowing what kind of a being she really was. Never really having a sense of what
this life was for, for her, always just locked into the conditioning and its patterns,
deeper and deeper and deeper into the homogenization.
The Sickness of Homogenization
It’s what happens when your mind runs your life. And your mind only runs your life
because you're afraid you have nothing to trust. You do not trust yourself, you do

Lesson Three
Patterns of Homogenization: Gender Conditioning
not love yourself. This is the sickness of homogenization. It is this all penetrating
ugliness. You can only be free of fear when you can trust in your own authority.
You can only trust in your own authority when you've experienced the experiment.
And you can't dabble in it. It’s an experiment, after all. Jump in. Hell, you pay a lot
of money for vacations; jump in and try it out. If it doesn't work, be my guest,
throw it away.
This is not about believing. It is about living your life according to what the
mechanics reveal, which says that the only way that we can live our lives
successfully on this plane is through the inner authority that is there in us. That it’s
only then that we can free ourselves from the burden of this kind of mind that says
that I have to have that 37, I have to have this; I have to have that, because if I
don’t there’s something wrong with me.
Oh, to be so lost, to be in so much pain, this is what humanity is. This is how they
live, this is how they choose their partners, choose their friends, choose their
colleagues. Think about it, how insane it is. Many wonder why nobody's going to
wave a magic wand and everyone is going to wake up. You couldn’t wake them up
with a sledgehammer they’re so deep in the soup. And the soup is everywhere. You
go from your house to the school; the teacher that you like has this kind of
connection or that kind of connection. The person you befriend is this or that. You
ignore the others. It goes on and on and on and on.
Be Free of Being Your Worst Enemy
It’s time to be free. Freedom is relative, but it’s time to be free of being your worst
enemy, because that’s what you do. It’s what you do every single time your mind
says “do that” and you jump; every time. That's where it all is. I can show you this
and that, this connection and that connection, and this pattern and that pattern. So
what. All that become self-evident the moment you begin to operate correctly. It
becomes self-evident. The moment the mind stops making decisions you begin to
feel all those forces in a way that you never felt before. You're no longer powerless.
You're no longer a sucker to them.
I honestly don't mind emotional energy going through my body. I used to hate it. I
don’t mind, I don’t mind at all. It’s interesting. And aside from that, with all the
receptors that we have, if there's nothing to receive it’s not going to be interesting at
all. We’re here to be aware; we’re here to be cognitive forces. But our minds are
trapped in the lowest menial illusionary work. They haven't been given this chance
to flower, to become truly aware, to begin to see what it is to be here on this plane
and how incredible it is to be us here, now, aware.
It has nothing to do with the madness of the world. It has nothing to do with the
craziness that’s out there, its dysfunction. It is the core of the spirituality of this
knowledge; it’s at the core of its deepest truth. This knowledge is about one person
at a time, just one at a time. It's about each being in their good fortune dedicating
themselves to the only opportunity that they’re ever going to have to live their life

happen. And you can only do that when you surrender.
Well, I hope you enjoyed that. It sounded more like a Sunday sermon. Anyway, to
all of you, you take care—Strategy and Authority. Bye for now.

Lesson Four
Patterns of Homogenization: In the Pursuit of Love
Welcome to all of you. I continue, obviously, you can see by the title, I’m continuing
with this theme of patterns of homogenization. Really what I want to talk about to
begin with today, because it's an interesting story today, and in so many ways a
familiar story for most people in their not-self lives. When we look at Design,
particularly when we look at it from any kind of analytical perspective, the first thing
that's required obviously is to try to maintain a simple view.
The Student and the School in Life
One of the simplest ways to look at life is to look at life in terms of what is activated
and what is not, because it's really what we're all about. It’s something that you can
see right away in terms of the way in which this particular model, this nine-centered
being, the way in which it operates. There are areas of activations and areas that
are not active. We know that the areas that are not active are actually active
because they are receptors. They are very, very active as receptors. And that we
are nothing but bits and pieces of fixed aspects and bits and pieces of receptors that
are held together in this holistic illusion. And they’re very different things.
I can remember that when I first began teaching I used to talk about how what is
activated in you, what is defined in you, this is the student. This is the potential of
what in fact you are. This is, in essence, what is your nature. And what is open in
you is where you go to school in life. And this going to school in life is a two-way
street. Like everything having to do with Human Design, everything having to do
with this purely dualistic system is that those forces that you have receptors to can
be deeply powerful as conditioning agents in the life.
And because they can be deeply powerful as conditioning agents, and we know why,
we know because we're set up by the genetic imperative. We are set up to be, first
and foremost, attracted to what we are not. We can, in the end, transform our lives
to be attracted to what is good for us. But that's another story. But it's also part of
this basic binary.
I think one of the most common things when you enter into this process, the process
of self-knowledge through Human Design, is that you look upon the openness and its
conditioning elements as not simply a negative, but more than a negative. That is,
it’s the darkness that shrouds your life and that you're going to confront this
darkness and you’re going to fill it with light. And it’s very important to put that

aside as immature in terms of the knowledge itself. Conditioning isn't the problem.
We are here, we have receptors, and we are designed to take in. It is so important
for us to grasp that. It’s part of what we’re about.
But we are not designed to be transformed in terms of the way in which we operate
by what we take in. This is where we get the dilemma of the not-self mind, and the
dilemma of the not-self mind is an incredibly powerful thing that is the dominant
dilemma in the homogenized world.
The Not-Self Mind
A discussion I was having earlier today was that it takes a certain moment in your
life, whatever that moment may be, when something, and it isn’t necessarily clear
what that something is, that something within you tells you that something's not
right. That is the opening of the door of a possibility, the possibility of being able to
confront the real villain in the movie. And the villain in the movie is the not-self
mind, the construct, the way in which the not-self mind operates; here is the true
villain in the story.
Not the openness, per se. The openness in and of itself can be an extraordinary
thing. You’re only going to be interested in the deep, deep nature of life if you don't
have a Sacral. That's when it opens up. It opens up the possibility of being
incredibly wise about the nature of the life force, the possibility of it. It is where you
go to school.
What the not-self mind does is what you have to understand, this is what you have
to understand about Eva, because no matter how you look at her, the reality is that
she is built on these four bridges and these four bridges totally control the way in
which her not-self mind projects outwards on the world and decides what to do. And
it decides what to do not based on what is correct, but it decides what to do based
on what it thinks it has to have.
We develop reflexes. The child that is born with the undefined splenic system, there
is fear in this child. It becomes a mechanism in and of itself. It becomes something
that its mind grabs onto, this not-self mind that says we don't want to be by
ourselves, we’re afraid, let’s hold onto something, anything that will give us that feel
good. It can have absolutely nothing to do with the being, what is correct for the
being, good for the being. The mind doesn't know that. The not-self mind is the
most alienated thing about us. It's totally alienated, living in a world of lies and
fantasies. And the lies and fantasies are built on something that is really spooky.
As you enter into Design and you meet profile and cross and particularly through
profile you meet the concept of purpose, the fulfillment of purpose. But you must
understand that there is a not-self purpose, and a not-self purpose that emerges out
of the deep conditioning wherever it may be. And again, this is a case of a split
definition. This is the case of the bridges and in particular obviously the 37, the 22,
the 36 which are these bridges that actually bring that split together and there is

Patterns of Homogenization: In the Pursuit of Love
always this potential here in the effect of the Sacral Center and the intimacy that can
be called to it. But everything about this being, everything about her is going to be
conditioned by the way in which her mind constructs decision making.
Two Ways of Decision Making
If you want to understand Human Design you have to understand it at its most
mundane level, banal, mundane level—how to make a decision. And there are two
ways to go. There's making a decision according to inner authority, which means
you don't really know what the decision making process is, you only get a result.
And there is decision making with the not-self mind in which you’re always in control
of the decision making process, except it's based on things that have nothing to do
with you. So you make decisions that ultimately create a life that is not yours.
Each decision you make in your life from the moment you come into the world
defines your life. It just does. The simple of the physics, we are objects moving in
space. Every decision that you make is a navigation. If you are navigating
according to your inner authority, then you are navigating towards your purpose,
what is your true purpose. But if you're navigating according to your not-self mind
you are moving away from you, day by day, decision by decision until finally you're
lost in the homogenized world.
And there are very few opportunities; there are very few possibilities to be pulled
back out of that, because it is so dense. Because we take our minds so seriously we
think they are so important we have attached so much of vanity to our minds that
they cannot guide this life. My mind is not capable of guiding my life. I know, I’ve
been there, done that. It's not what it’s for.
Eva and the Male Model
From the moment she came into the world
there was emptiness. I don't have this. I
don't have that. And I don’t have that. And
therefore, I am not complete. There is
something wrong with me. I don't have that
37, I don't have that 12, I don't have the 35,
there is something wrong with me. I should
have that. And that's the way this being
begins to think. It thinks in terms of how can
it achieve that, how can it become whole.
And what we’ve already seen in this movie,
her movie, is that there are certain influences
that are there.
We've been looking at the male model and today we're really going to complete that
journey, it is a journey that in the end says that we are so deeply, deeply vulnerable

to conditioning that it goes back to the very first imprints that we receive from our
family from the moment we come into the world. And those imprints are going to
distort our lives because our mind is going to be dictated by them. This is the horror
of the not-self. It's its horror.
If this person wakes up, let’s say this person
wakes up, she didn’t, she died, but let's say
she wakes up, let's say that she really gets it
together, she follows her Strategy and
Authority, she goes through all of that, she's
clear. It doesn't mean that she's not going to
be attracted to these open spaces. As a
matter of fact, for the first time in her life she
is going to be able to enjoy them, appreciate
them, experience them without it being
something else, because it doesn't lead to the
mind making a decision about this or that.
It’s about that you’ve got receptors for it.
And if you have a receptor for it then it's something that's there on your plate in this
life to take in.
Outer Authority
Everything about the glory of the nine-centered mind is that the nine-centered mind
is intended to display outer authority. That is
the expression of its unique cognitive
potential based on its experiential depth.
That experiential depth, that experiential
richness in a human being does not come
from the very, very, very fine line of
definition or activation, of one tiny little
activation. It comes from the vast openness
and stimuli that is there in the openness, in
the open centers, channels, gates. It’s a
cornucopia of stimuli.
This is the richness of life. It’s not a
sentence, condemning us to blind
conditioning. Life is a duality. There is
ignorance and there's awareness. In ignorance nothing is possible. You get carried
with the flow of the program, moving us along relentlessly, our time running out,
that the homogenized humanity are like lemmings approaching the cliff. I don't
mind going over the edge. I like knowing that it is there. I like knowing the
process. I want to be able to have what has been my serendipity to have, which is
the wonder and recognition of how extraordinary it is to be on this plane, regardless
of what there is around.

Lesson Four
Patterns of Homogenization: In the Pursuit of Love
Human Design is for One Person at a Time
Over and over again I repeat the same mantra: Human Design is for one person at a
time. You can only transform yourself. Nobody can do it for you. Nobody can
change that. Nobody can make it happen. This process is not some kind of back-of-
the-wagon medicine. It's a discipline. In essence, that's what happens to you when
you enter into this experiment. It is the discipline to maintain the experiment that
brings the incredible rewards. And the discipline is necessary because this way of
living in the world does not fit in to the way in which the world lives, the normal
world, the way it functions, the way human beings find and mate and bond with each
other, the way they live together, the way they treat each other. This being—not
everybody is ready. You can take a horse, the old story, to water; it doesn’t mean
it’s going to drink.
This is the wonder of what fractals are, what serendipity is, what I like to call good
fortune, because you can tell people all kinds of things, I know I've been doing it for
a long time, you can tell them about themselves, you can tell them the way it works.
You can tell them all that. But you can’t make them live their truth. And it is so
hard for a human being to let go of the power of their mind to distort their life. You
know that. It runs around inside of you like everyone else. And mind is ready to
distort the life at any moment. It’s why the discipline is necessary. The time, the
seven years to cellularly change the form, to set it up for a new part of life, the time
it takes intellectually to digest this knowledge; time and the discipline of it.
And it is something that you do for yourself. It is not something that you do for the
other. You do not do it because of the other. You can only do it for yourself. This is
the thing about knowledge. Human Design has an enormous amount of knowledge,
but it's very simple. And it is the radical embrace of the simple that changes the life,
not all the knowledge. The knowledge is entertaining. I know, it is, it’s fascinating.
It’s fun to see how things work. But the knowledge without the life doesn't mean
anything. The promise is within a being. It’s not on a piece of paper somewhere or
hanging out here in the internet. It’s within oneself.
Self-Love
I’ve been teaching self-love for a very long time. I find that this is the most difficult
of all loves for human beings to get. The conditioned loves are easy, the love of a
parent, the love you have for a lover, for a sibling, for your children and
grandchildren. But to love yourself, love yourself is not about conditioning at all. It
isn't about something out there that's attractive. It’s about seeing the perfection of
your own uniqueness. At the simplest level it’s about being free of fear, fear that
your life isn’t going to work, fear that you're not going to get what is there for you,
fear. It’s the fear that destroys everything. It destroys the self love.
It’s so easy for human beings to fall into not-self mode because the not-self mind
operates out of fear. The fear for this being that life is always going to be so damn
dull. Why does my life have to be dull? I want something to happen. So you end

up trying to make it happen and you pay the price for it. Why can't I have romance?
Think about what it means to have hanging gates. You come into Human Design and
you’re taught what those gates are all about. This is where you’re pointed at things
and you’re attracted to them. Take it down to the very simple basic level of looking
at where you are conditioned from the earliest moments of your life. This was what
was changing you, this was what was turning you into the person that ultimately you
truly do not want to be anymore. You didn’t like that person, you didn’t love that
person, didn't care about that person.
Think about it. It’s such a thing, becoming what you’re not, a whole life. Not
everybody has the great good fortune of being able to see their parents’ designs.
From the earliest moment that I began training people I would tell them get the
designs of everybody that you're connected to, your parents, your siblings, your
lovers, whatever the case may be so you can see it. So you can understand what
happened to you. What was molding you and shaping you, because that's the way
that it works.
The 6th and 12th Gates
We already know that there is a deep influence that is there in terms of the impact of
the father and the brother on this design. We know that the impact is there in terms
of the 6th gate and we know the impact
is there in terms of the 12th gate. So,
let's look at that 6 and 12 for a moment.
Here is the father with the 6 and of
course the father has the 12/22. Let’s
think about this for a moment. It
carries a lot of sexual dynamic to it.
That is, there's an electromagnetic
connection that's going to be there in
the 59/6, so you have this very, very
strong connection and of course the
pumping up or the turning on of the
Sacral system and the 12/22.
So, one part of the duality is that the
way you are conditioned is this is your
father. So, this is a male principle. Now
it is a male principle that can be attractive or not. The fact that whether it's going to
be attractive or not, and again we've gone back and we’ve looked at the designs in
the way in which it works, the fact is that because there are difficulties in the
relationship and will be difficulties in the relationship, this after all is a compromise
on top of it between them, that though this is going to feel like male to her. It
doesn't necessarily mean that this is what she really wants to be attracted to
anymore.

Lesson Four
Patterns of Homogenization: In the Pursuit of Love
Archetypal Principles
Now remember, she's got three opens. That is, the open that is there in the 37, the
open in the 12, and the open in the 35. So there are other options. This also is
going to be, at least for her, going to taste like male. If you have your parents, and
again, you’ve got to be really lucky with that, it is so amazing to see that. I never
got to see my father’s chart data, we had no birth data at all, let alone time, we
don’t have a day, but for my mother—sometimes with your parents they remember
stories. My mother remembered her mother remembering it was around tea time,
something like that. So, there was the possibility to sort of get a relatively close
chart. It was fascinating for me. Where my mother impacted my design, these
became archetypal female principles that I would never escape in life. You don’t
escape them.
And even though you don't think that girl that you're interested in, from my
perspective, that doesn't look like or feel like your mother doesn't mean that it isn't
your mother in the sense that it isn't you going after that archetype. Now, it
depends on the relationship that the child has with the parent. If the child's
relationship with the parent is a very strong one, then that becomes a very, very
desired conditioning element. If the dynamic with the parent is strained then that
becomes something that you want to avoid. Oh, I know this type, I don’t want that.
So, you end up with the possibility of both sides of the story, but you still end up
with that conditioning, either the males that are taken in or the males that were
rejected and again, it has nothing to do with what the inner authority of Eva would
be capable of in terms of the discernment of who and when and what is going to be
right for her in response. Obviously, that’s not part of the makeup.
The Brother
We come to the brother and we can see that the brother shares with the sister the
22nd gate, but the brother brings the 6, so
again I'm just looking at these archetypal
connections. Obviously, there are many
things in charts to look at. In looking at
the 6, to see very clearly that this kind of
intimacy, and remember that the 59/6 is
an archetype of reproductive intimacy, of
making more, that this is deeply
connected with the male principle in her
life. In other words, it is going to make it
very, very difficult for her to find a male
in which she is really going to have that
kind of intimacy because it wouldn't feel
natural. In a situation like that where
both the father and the brother have the
6, the chances are that you end up with a
non-reproductive life unless it's something that is brought into it in another way.

A LIFE STORY

But it is just something interesting to notice about the way in which gender modeling
takes place in us. We all—I don't know how to make that a heavier point, if I can
phrase it that way—it’s such a powerful thing to grasp in the way in which we are set
up. It’s only a set up if you’re not-self, because it’s only your not-self that’s going to
take you there ignorantly so that you're not necessarily going to end up in a
relationship that is going to work just because you happen to have a gate that is
attractive.
But it also says that this illusion, it's an illusion that says that anyone who would
have the 6th gate that you can't really have an intimacy with them because it feels
incestuous. I talked about that in an earlier class. The 19s of my sisters to my 49,
19 women for me always have that whatever, that sisterly quality, whatever that
may be. And certainly as not-self there is no way that I ever would have had
intimacy with them. It felt funny. It would have never crossed my mind.
It is the same thing for her in terms of the 6s that are brought to her, in terms of the
archetype of what that is for her, the way she senses it and feels it. We’re so open
to these things that are at the other end of the gate. We’re constantly lurking and
looking for it and feeling out for it and trying to grasp it so we get a taste for these
things. And that taste carries a certain quality so that we get gender conditioning,
gender modeling that impacts us and impacts us deeply. So you go into the
classroom as a kid and you end up bonding with the same gender children that have
the right male connection to you and the female gender—this is how you end up in
the pattern. Patterns of homogenization and patterns that you take with you from
the moment that you come into the family, that you go into the school, that you
come out into the world, you go into your own relationship and on and on and on
and on and on.
We’re not here to make decisions with our mind and we don’t get our life. We get
the chaotic that is established by the not-self, but we don't get our life. And we’re
on a crash course. Adults who have been deeply conditioned most of their lives; this
is no easy thing to just blow this off. You’ve got to deal with the mind. You’ve got
to deal with the mind saying to you, you have to, you must, you should, you could,
when will you, can we do it now, let's do that, if we do that now we do that later.
Yeah, right; and you’re gone, just like that, gone, chasing after all the ghosts, all the
ghosts in all the gates that you don’t have, chase, chase, chase, all the centers that
you don’t have, lost in the conditioning field, never knowing what’s good for you
because you can’t.
The Husband Will Never be Man Enough for Eva
So, what does she do? She’s been conditioned that romance carries the compromise
of her father as the male archetype, that both of them have the 6, that intimacy now
is a kind of odd sort of thing; such a process this conditioning. So look at what you
get. She says okay, and I'm not saying she says that consciously, she says okay the
hell with it. I’ll take what I can get. Let's have some loyalty. Let's have family.

Lesson Four
Patterns of Homogenization: In the Pursuit of Love
Let's have a real bargain. This is going to fulfill my needs. Here is somebody that
brings the whole thing. This is somebody that is deeply, deeply, deeply tribal;
somebody that fits very nicely into
a family Penta, somebody who is
very, very tribal.
And you can see that she didn’t
want to have anything to do with
the way in which the male was set
up for her. So what do you think
that leads to? This poor guy; I’ve
got to tell you, I feel for this poor
guy because he is never going to
be man enough. Do you see what
the conditioning does to us? Oh,
yeah, she leaves the 6 and the 12
behind, but that's a lot to leave
behind. It’s juicy stuff. And she
leaves that behind for a bargain.
And in leaving it behind for the bargain she's going to miss it. He is not going to be
the man enough for her.
As a matter of fact, him not being man enough for her will end the relationship. It
just will. It has nothing to do with her or him. Ah, life is such a strange movie. It
has nothing to do with it. Neither one of them operated as themselves, not correct.
She found something that bridged the split and it allowed her to escape from that
household in which she felt so alienated, alienated from the moment that she came
into the world. And yet, at the same time you see the irony that she ends up being
attracted to a Projector and ends up being attracted to this Projector with anything
as long as it doesn't belong to the males that were part of her alienation. She
doesn’t want a man like that.
Thousands of Possibilities for Bridging
But that’s the only thing that male is for her. This is a big thing. And it's gone. It's
not there. And no matter what this guy is going to try to do, and of course, this is a
Projector; this is a Projector that is going to be on the Manifestor buzz. This is
somebody who is just going to be exhausted in that. And in the end this deal is
going to break down. Think about her. She doesn’t have the 37. She doesn’t. This
is what she wants. She wants the affection. She wants that caring. She wants that
to be part of the bargain, but there's a problem. You know how many 37s there are?
From that 40th gate where she points down there are over 1000 possibilities, let
alone the planetary configurations. It ends up being tens of thousands of

self grabs at the first bridge and says, this will do, this will do, only to discover that
when you meet that very fine line at the other end you realize something; you are

now trapped. And it isn’t precisely what you wanted and you know that there's
something else because you're not a 37. It is your receptor that knows that there
are many kinds of affection, that there are many kinds of bargains, that there are
many kinds of deals. This is what we are as human beings. And the proof—if such a
thing is even necessary. It’s so wonderful the serendipity of the way in which beings
operate.
The Lover
This is the design of the lover, the lover that comes after the husband, or during the
husband. Now look at the lover. Isn’t that just a wonderful—I’d love to be able to
hear you laugh, but anyway, because if you’re not laughing you’ve got a problem.
But look at this, this is like, okay, I want the male back, I’m not going to do without
that, I’ll do without the compromise,
thank you very much, but I want the
male back. You get the whole deal
here. I want a different bargain, I
want a different deal. I really want
that change, I want something to
happen.
Of course, she falls in love, she leaves
her husband, she falls in love and she
dies. I don’t mean to make that
sound funny. The not-self life is such
an unfulfilling thing. To not
understand what is going on, to be so
deeply lost in the program. You don't
get your life. This is not her answer.
And it isn’t to say that it might not be. Please understand me. I'm not saying that
she should avoid all these gates like poison or whatever. What I'm saying is she's
not capable of entering into a relationship based on what her mind will tell her.
That's what she’s not capable of. This is what the story is all about.
Inner Authority and Decision Making
She never knew. It was already too late. The impact had already been so profound.
And then you get to see what happens to us. Those beings that are waiting for you
at the other end of the bridge, those beings are beautiful. It is really something. It
isn't to say that those beings at the other end of the bridge are not beautiful, are not
for you. Again, we have the receptors. But at the same time because of the way in
which the mind is built on the not-self, there's no way that the mind can discern
who, what of those thousands of possibilities at the other end is truly for you. And
more than that, the moment that you liberate the mind from the day-to-day task of
trying to organize your life is a moment that you begin to have a different

awareness, you begin to see. It is your inner authority that has the ability to be able
to discern what is correct for you or not.
I have an open emotional system. It was an old joke of mind in the early years that
I plotted to eliminate all emotional people so that I could have a very peaceful life.
It was just a joke. What would life be without it? But I don’t avoid it. I don't avoid
it because I can be conditioned by the emotional system, that I have receptors to the
emotional system. No, but the emotional system doesn't control what happens to
me. I'm not not-self. My mind is not in the business of deciding what I should do.
It isn’t. It’s not what it’s about.
This is the dilemma. We have an opportunity to be wise in the purest sense of the
word. That’s what this openness is about. That’s what our receptors are for. Oh,
you spoiled my finale, but anyway we’ll leave that for next week. For those of you
that are downloading the cause of her death was brain aneurism. Anyway,
everything about this process is about understanding that only when you move
decision making to what is the inner authority process, the vehicle’s process, then all
this conditioning becomes a benefit, it becomes what you’re here to learn.
Here she was just simply lost. And all those choices that she would make, and it's
not just about what I have shown you, it's not just about the father, it’s not about
the brother, the husband, the lover, it’s about all the other people that were in her
life, the friends that she had, the colleagues that she had, the work that she did, in
every single human interaction that she had, those that she liked, those that she
didn't like, those that she was attracted to, those that she wasn't attracted to, it’s all
here. It all started when she came into the world and there is all that vulnerability
and there are those connections and it’s all setting her up. And there's nobody to
help. Her mother, who is going to commit suicide, the mother was already in dire
situation in the construct of the relationship to begin with. And there was nobody
there to help them.
Human Design: A Guide for the Nine-Centered Being
This is the whole thing about the knowledge. It is understanding what we are. It’s
what Human Design presents. It presents a guide to what it is to be this mutative
nine-centered creature. And we are deeply fortunate in the sense that we've got a
floor plan. We can see the way in which it operates mechanically. It gives us the
possibility to take advantage of it. You cannot change the way in which you were
designed to interact with the world, but you can transform the way in which that
interaction takes place. Without the receptors there is nothing. This is what
connects us to the maia. It’s what makes life interesting. It is the entertainment.
But you have to be able to see it. You have to be able to stand back from the point
of view of the passenger in the vehicle and just watch. And you can only do that
when you're freed of the fear. And you can only be freed of the fear when you see
that your inner authority will in fact guide you correctly. It will. It'll save you from
the torment of being conditioned to a point that you were lost, and it will turn it

around. It will open it up so that conditioning becomes the information, the data,
the experiential this and that, that enriches your process from the mental plane.
One of the things about understanding mind is that it is not that our minds have
nothing to do, they do. This is part of what one person at a time is. Human Design
is about uniqueness. It is the science of differentiation. It is all about the
potentiality that exists within any human being to live out a distinctly unique
differentiated life unlike any other with a perception unlike any other. This is what
outer authority is about. We don't have such things. Outer authority is an
extraordinary state. For me it’s much more exalted than the terminologies of
enlightenment, which for me is a seven-centered term. It’s quite a place to be. And
you can only be there when your mind is not involved in the mundane of your life.
It’s not what it’s for.
Surrendering to the Experiment
Mind is great at research. It’s one of the things that it’s so good at. And it's about
teaching your mind what to research. The maia is built on the measuring of the
mind, the “this” and the “that.” It’s where you focus your mental attention. If
you're constantly focusing your mental attention on taking control of your life you're
going to fall. If your attention is focused on observing your experiment, observing,
watching your life, this is a totally different state. It’s only out of watching, it’s only
out of seeing what happens to you as you begin that process of operating correctly.
It is the watching that transforms your awareness. It’s not about collecting data.
It’s not about studying.
The richest of all experiments is your own. It is the one that deserves the greatest
attention. And your mind needs to be distracted away from its bad habits of trying
to convince you what the hell you should do when you don't need that, when you
have a strategy, when you have an authority, and when you have the potential as an
intelligent human being to measure that and see if it's worth maintaining. It’s what
experiments are about.
This is what science is based on, a new experiment. You are the judge. You are the
one that has to validate the process for yourself. You are the one that has to see its
truth or not. You could never get to that place where you begin being aware until
you can first and foremost surrender to the experiment.
I began today by talking about discipline. It is discipline that brings great rewards.
The reward is the transformation of the way in which you look at the world, the way
in which you live in the world. And the gift of your signature that sits there and
waits in the background, normally out of reach for most human beings. To truly be
able to live the grandeur of what your form principle provides according to your type,
according to your profile, your cross, your this, your that until you have built this
unique entity, this unique thing. And it is its expression that will be something of
interest.

Lesson Four
Patterns of Homogenization: In the Pursuit of Love
See I look at her life and I look at all lives. There is nothing in this that is surprising.
And no, it is not very funny at all. It’s funny the way things work out, funny strange,
I guess, to see how easily a life is distorted. It’s so easy. And so many human
beings end up being impacted. And there are those that end up with children. The
whole thing just keeps on going on generation after generation after generation.
The Power of Conditioning
You have to understand how powerful conditioning is. This is the first great
challenge for anybody that really enters into this knowledge that if you really are
going to be able to break with the homogenized world you have to understand how
deeply you have been and are conditioned. And seeing it is part of the healing,
recognizing it in your relationships is part of the healing, because it is a healing. As
you move to what is your inner authority part of the whole deconditioning and
cleansing process is understanding what made your life what it was. And seeing how
that worked and seeing how that was not truly you. It’s how we grow in this
process.
I spent years in the beginning looking at the designs of the way in which my life was
formed, the way it was formed by my relationship to my siblings, their auras, the
way it worked. For the first time I understood my youth. I understood what the
not-self purpose of my youth was all about. I understood why as a Manifestor that I
was so different within that family. I saw so many things. And it's not like it
changes anything. It frees one, in a way. You can let go of it, it’s not your fault,
you’re not to blame, you just didn’t know. Nobody else knew.
And you understand now how you can live this life in a way that truly is good for
you, for that being that is there to emerge, that being that has a right to emerge. It
comes down to privilege; it comes down to understanding that each and every one of
you has an opportunity to be correct in this life. And whatever that is going to mean
for each and every one of you uniquely. But it begins with seeing that you cannot
trust what your mind is going to tell you. You cannot trust what your mind says you
must have, should have, or could have. You cannot trust your mind when it’s
dictating to you that you need to be in charge and in control, that you need to have,
that you have to do, because with that there’s no hope.
This is the way the world lives. It’s why it's filled with pain and ugliness and violence
and hunger. It is incredibly dysfunctional. One person at a time surrendering to the
experiment and accepting the depth of the conditioning that has been there in their
life so that they understand they do not want to live that way again, because that is
what it's all about. And the time it takes to cleanse the system, to align oneself to
what is correct, to begin to see that you are deeply competent on this plane, to
begin to see that there is here for you a life that matters on this plane. And it's
yours.
It's just day by day, and it is one decision at a time, because that's what it is. It is
one decision at a time made correctly. This is how you change your life. It’s how

everything changes. That one decision at a time builds up a momentum that moves
you towards what is your truth, your purpose, the fulfillment of your purpose on this
plane, your cross, your profile, your design, your uniqueness, your expression.
We’re here to shine. This is the way you shine.
Anyway, it was nice to share that with all of you; I hope you enjoyed that. Until next
time, all of you take care and enjoy your week; bye for now.

Lesson Five
Death
We are Receptors to Conditioning
All right, hello everyone and welcome. Welcome to this closing class in this exercise
of looking at a life. One of the things that this story tells us is that it tells us about
the great negative forces that are there in the process. It tells us that in essence all
forces that are ignorant are negative forces, wherever you may find them, whether
you find them in your family, whether you find them in your lover, your friends or
your children, we are nothing but receptors to conditioning. It is what we all are. It
is essential to understand that given that this is all a binary and it's all a duality that
this is what the story is all about. It’s about understanding that we have to become
aware of what is our specific this and that, because this is what this knowledge is
about. This knowledge is not the by-product of research. It was given. It was given
so that we could literally be aware, that we can take advantage of being able to look
at and understand the mechanics and take advantage of that, practical advantage of
that.
We are the first generation that understands the nature of its vehicle. And
understands the nature of its vehicle not based on observational experiential
processes that have gone on for millennia, but because we have a deep
understanding of it through this matrix. What I love about the truth, and that's a
funny word always, what I love about it is that it has to be simple and at the same
time that it's simple it has to be deliciously profound. It is the thrill that I had when
I began to grasp what was given to me, this extraordinary window. We are here to
take advantage of this. Lives are lost, not because beings are ill-equipped. It is one
of the things about being human.
Outer Authority
I think that most people consider my expression of what I call outer authority as
being some kind of idealized state. But it is in fact the way in which we are
designed. We are a deeply gregarious species. This is what makes us so different
than all other species. You put two dogs together and they’ll have a few moments of
this and that and play, but they’re not going to lie down beside each other and have
a damn conversation. I know. I watched them. They don’t do that. We do that.
That’s us. We are gregarious, we are talkative creatures. It is the secret to our
success as a mammal. It is in fact the thing that truly separates us from the beast,

because the ability to be able to communicate is the ability to be able to create a
living consciousness field.
Communicating is an incredible thing. It's an incredible thing. And then you think
about the kind of communication that exists in the world you live in and what people
really talk about and what they talk about to each other. And what they talk about
what they think is important or not. Most of my life I’ve been a teacher, and I've
taught just about every kind of age group. I found it fascinating when I was
teaching the youngest of children that I would teach which were about 11 or 12
years old. I noticed how their very phraseology and the concepts that they
expressed were obviously borrowed from an adult. One would assume one of their
parents. You could see their body posture. You could see it in those moments when
they were aggressive or in those moments when they were defensive, the posture
that their body would take. A posture that they learned from the conditioning forces
in their life.
Long Chain of Events That Creates Endless Helplessness
It was so obvious to me that these young children already had a political and moral
stance that had been imprinted in them, and no escape. This is not the story of the
failure of this woman's life. It’s not about its tragedy. It’s not about its sadness.
After all, this is the great drama of life. To be correct does not mean that you do not
know sorrow or pain. To be in a form, to be on this plane is to endure a lot. To be
correct is a way to navigate through it, to take from it what is yours to take. But
still, it’s not about that. It's about a long chain of events from one generation to a
next that creates an endless, endless helplessness and sacrifice of human beings to
the program.
My work in Human Design has always been focused on women, particularly mothers.
The only way that anything is going to change is when children are raised correctly.
Eva never had a chance. She never had a chance. She just didn't. And it's not
because she's got this design or that design or the other design. In the end it isn’t,
it is the homogenized world that destroys the life.
I read somebody's comment today; I forget who it is because it’s very, very lovely.
It said our problem is not a problem of difference. Our problem is that we're too
much alike. This is humanity. It is the problem. Homogenization is the problem.
This is the disease, the malaise. It's not even really that. It's a slowly receding
glacier. It's the past. It's the last grasping fingers of seven-centered consciousness
slowly slipping off the ledge.
There is No Life until You Claim Your Authority
There is no life until you claim your authority. There isn’t. She could never claim
her authority. Her very design became her authority. Her not-self mind became her
authority. Her fears became her authority. Her resentments became her authority.

Lesson Five
Death
Her anger became her authority. Her emotions became her authority. Everything
became her authority. And it led her further and further down the path until she just
blew up and died—brain aneurysm. Just collapsed; found by a cleaning lady.
This is most human beings lives. You’re never going to meet a life that doesn't have
its drama, its joys, its sorrows, its this and that. This is life. But to find awareness,
that’s something else. Our journey is not a journey that is collective. It is not a
journey that is tribal. It's unique. It is individual. Everything about this knowledge
is only pointed in one direction, one direction only. It's pointed at not simply the
emergence of the differentiated being, but the true and complete fulfillment of its
potential.
What are we? When I look at this movie, I just see that there is illusion wrapped
around components. I think about the Personality Crystal. It is in so many ways a
wonder. It is the eternal us. It is the eternal I. It is the eternal I always waiting for
the am. But it's the eternal I. It’s so ancient that you cannot possibly ponder the
time; 15 billion years or more. It's made of material that is timeless. I can't even
begin to imagine such a thing. It's pulled into these forms from out there, dragged
in on a song, actually, a frequency, called by the Monopole, pulled into the illusion of
the holistic form, locked into the backseat, the passenger. And then you have a life.
Only One Unique Answer
You’ve seen her life. The not-self life with all of its follies, its pain, how sad it is not
to be able to have recognized, have seen the beauty of oneself. Self love is
something that is so deeply missing on this plane because human beings do not have
their own authority, do not trust in themselves, and do not see that they are worthy.
It’s such a joke on this plane that 70% of the planet is born with an undefined Heart
Center, and instead of understanding what a statement that is, that they are worthy,
but they’re major league screw ups, all homogenized plane. What a mess. There is
only the unique answer, not my answer; your answer. We all have to go our own
way. There is no other way. She did not go that way, did not know how. There was
nobody to communicate it. Oh yeah, she would eventually get a reading later in life.
It starts so early.
One of my great concerns when I was given the knowledge was that human beings
would have to go through the deconditioning and I did not know if that would work.
I knew that there was biological deconditioning. That is, a seven-year cycle which
you have the cleansing of most of the cells. But it was obvious to me because of the
depth of the conditioning that psyche was going to be deeply, deeply embedded in
the not-self consciousness.
It's taken me all these years to understand how you get to that place, to shatter it,
to begin to give that opportunity to our kind to be able to live out the beauty of their
differentiated consciousness, their differentiated cognition so you can communicate it
to your children. That you can communicate it before there are children. That it is
something that becomes just simply common sense to know oneself, to be treated

with respect, to be raised with the best possible advantage. Then we don't have to
deal with the sadness of these lives.
Love Begins within Oneself
As I said they’re not sad because of the circumstances, they’re sad because there
has been no love and love begins within oneself. Everything else is illusion. There is
no place to turn and time is running out. Self-love is an incredible thing. It's the
closest you get to truth in your whole life. The closest you get to true spirituality in
this life is that you realize how incredible it is that you're here. How incredible it is
there is no plan. This is something that happened. And look at it, this vast
happening rolling through space. Cherish it and communicate its wonder, not the
pain, not the sadness, not the folly, not the panaceas that everybody seeks. Not the
paint that will color everybody the same color.
Death
We can only be free through our difference. We stand in our own world, our own
God, our own force, our own truth. This is what it means to breathe. And this
crystal, so-called, its endless, it seems, journey. That journey of ins and outs and
outs. As the aneurysm struck her, death is not instantaneous. There is no pain;
none. There is an awareness of the brain system shutting down and gone. There is
a vast, I can only call it a mystical curiosity, I guess.
Incarnation, decarnation, the movement of the crystal back and forth. It's a very
interesting thing. As the world became more populated and the world became
populated first in its warmest climates, death could not be tolerated in populated
environments. It is out of that you have faiths as apart from each other as
Hinduism, Judaism, all of the Middle Eastern religions, they immediately get rid of
the dead. Rave Cosmology is a fascinating study. I was certainly told things that
are extraordinary in that way.
One of the things is that the Personality Crystals come from 16 different bundles, the
Godhead, as expressed in that program. And they incarnate from those bundles, but
they don't necessarily return to them. There’s a criteria. When I was sitting under
the tree outside of my ruina after the Voice left me, I looked out at the world around
me and there was this deep sense of amazement how this whole thing worked. I
was given the information that transcended the life. I wasn't just given the design of
being human. I was given the design of all of the forms. I was given the design of
the way in which the whole thing happened. I was given the design of the way in
which it was programmed. I was given the design of where it was going to go. The
crystal doesn't necessarily get back to its source and it doesn't necessarily get back
to the source because the body cannot be disturbed for 72 hours.
If you had somebody that could truly remember their incarnations they would
remember that most of their incarnations took place long ago and very close

together. If you imagine for a moment the seven billion beings on this planet that
are incarnated, the seven billion Personality Crystals that are on this plane right now,
the vast, vast majority of them will never return to source. Now I said there was no
plan. There is no plan. There is just mutation. There's just movement. This is the
process.
Rogue Clusters
What began to happen as our population began to burst, and particularly since it
began to burst at the time of the Cross of Planning, 1615, that global cycle that
we've been in since then that will end in 2027, most of these beings will never return
to source and what they will form that has been formed since the beginning of this
particular cycle is what is called rogue bundles. It is where almost all of our science-
fiction mythology comes from, the demons and goblins and elves and aliens and
these, what are called in Rave Cosmology, rogue clusters. There is no reincarnating
from them. They're sort of like disposal units. Most human beings are going to end
their life being disposed of, being taken out of circuitry, so to speak, being taken out
of the loop, as it were.
We are heading down towards the grand finale a little bit more than a millennium
away. And this is part of the grinding down. The species is beginning to lose its
fertility. It's part of the grinding down. What is so extraordinary for me about the
nature of the knowledge that I was given is that the knowledge just wasn't about the
life. It was about before the life, the 88° from the time of conception. It was before
that, the very process itself. And it was
after, as well.
At the time of death we have these three
components in us. We have the
Personality Crystal sitting up here actually
outside of the body. You have the Design
Crystal sitting in the Ajna Center and you
have the Magnetic Monopole here in the
G Center. Biological death is when the
Design Crystal and the Monopole link up
together as they were before the life.
The two of them link up together and
they go directly down this line and they
go out and they’re gone and the vehicle is
biologically dead.
The Bardo
The Personality Crystal lingers. It was pulled in; it has to be pulled out. But the
question of how it's going to be pulled out, when it’s going to be pulled out is another
story. There is an extraordinary thing that takes place. As I get older in this life I

begin to ponder it on occasion. It is a fascinating turn of the roulette wheel. And
what I'm speaking of is what has historically been referred to as Bardo. That is, the
stages after death. I don't think there's anything more illuminating to the
Personality than understanding the nature of Bardo.
Human Design is very logical. Obviously, one cannot prove anything about after
death. And that's not the point of this. It is well documented from those who have
survived, who have died biologically and have been revived, we have all of the
stories that are associated with this phenomenon and the events of it. We know that
throughout the history of the schools of death that there is enormous similarity in all
of them.
One of the aspects of the knowledge that I was given what I originally referred to as
the Rave Book of the Dead is to understand how this mechanic operates in a human
being. That is, the dying cycle itself, and the nature of death and the nature of
Bardo. And Bardo is just as mechanical as anything else. You come in on an imprint
and you leave on an imprint. And as you leave, you leave specifically. There is a
door you go out. There is a formula in fact that you meet. And it is a formula that is
quite extraordinary. It is knowledge that is available and you can find it both in
Channel 88, and I said there will be courses on it. It’s also available as home study
courses in the home study area of the self-study area of the IHDS.
The Personality Crystal
But it's knowledge that's really essential knowledge. It is about understanding the
dilemma. The Personality Crystal has an extraordinary process in those 72 hours.
There is still activity. That is, there is still enough neural activity for that Personality
Crystal to feed on. The reality is that the Personality Crystal enters into what it is a
pre-structured formula in which they move through three different stages over those
72 hours. It is the moment that the Personality is truly liberated from the form. It
is, in essence, the reward for the life. It is that moment of perfected filtering for the
crystal dependent on what particular formula it gets to meet.
And in that process, that 72 hours where the vehicle is not disturbed in the sense
that there's no autopsy and anything that is intrusive, but after the 72 hours are
done, the Personality Crystal will be able to go back to where it belongs. It will go
back to source. It will be part of the continuum that at least expressed by the Voice
to me is something that goes on for a very long time. Whereas, those that are
unaware of this, for the majority of them this is the last incarnation and for the
majority of those it is both the first and the last incarnation.
The vast population expansion has expanded the amount of crystals of consciousness
incarnating. The vast majority of crystals of consciousness are incarnating for the
first time and are going to leave immediately from the cycle. They're here to bring
out the possibility of mutative potential. After all, we’re headed towards a deeply,
deeply mutative turn in the wheel by the time we reach 2027, and we begin the new
global cycle.

Lesson Five
Death
Human Design Teaches the Correct Way to Leave This Plane
Human Design is not simply here to teach you the correct way to be in the life, but
the correct way to leave this plane. It something that touches me very deeply,
because it is far beyond any other kind of information humanity has ever been given.
It's a formula that transcends the life itself. And of course, this in and of itself is an
extraordinary thing. It’s not about preparing the being for death. Each being in
their own authority, in their own correctness according to their design will meet their
end as they should. There is no comparison. There is no generalization that can be
expressed in this.
What is truly unique is the potential of their crystal in these strange moments of
transition to fulfill its ongoing process. In loving yourself you preserve that eternal
“I” and keep it in the game, whatever that means. I'm a teacher of mechanics. I’ve
been a teacher of mechanics for 21 years, but I am a mystic. The wonder of the
mechanics of Human Design is a deeper wonder for me that it came from a voice.
That's a much deeper wonder. And to be able to see that it’s just all laid out.
I’m a closer, I’m a door closer. This is the end. This is what the beginning of the
end in a sense looks like. It’s what you get to see. We live in the time of the Eden
Return, it lasts until 2027. If there are to be truths to be revealed now, now, now,
this is when they’re to be revealed.
This Knowledge is for Future Generations
The knowledge is so that the generations that are coming will be able to live in their
world correctly. That’s all. Yes, there’s much more. There’s much more in the
sense of the potential of the transformation of the consciousness. But the
fundamental responsibility that I have now in my life in bringing this knowledge out
is to make sure that there are enough human beings who will bring this knowledge
to their children so their children can live out the full potential of what it is to be a
nine-centered being. We’re an incredible construct with extraordinary potential.
We’re not here to be in the planet of suffering, all that old bullshit, because it's what
it is. This is not what we’re here for.
We’ve been generalized so long, we’ve been lumped together so long, and we’ve
been homogenized so long that we can’t even imagine what uniqueness represents,
what our own uniqueness represents. It is a dilemma of mind. I talked about it on
the radio today. It is that dilemma of mind. Mind is unprepared for its own
possibilities. Nobody's ever prepared it. It’s what we’re here to do. In that sense it
is handicapped. It doesn't know how to not interfere with the life. It doesn't know
how to be comfortable in a role in which it is not the dominant force in the life. It
does not let go of fear.

A LIFE STORY
A Digital Book for Newcomers
The Fear in Humans
I look at Eva and I smell it; the fear. Human beings stink of fear. They do. They’re
so fearful; it’s so profound in them. It operates at every level. They’re afraid of
everything. They’re afraid of losing what they think they might or could have;
afraid, afraid, afraid, always afraid.
You cannot find your signature. This being would never find peace being afraid.
There’s no peace in that. There is no satisfaction for the Generator in being
saturated with fear, fear of failure, fear that the things won’t work. Fear of more
frustration. It’s all just fear, layers and layers and layers and layers and layers of it.
And your mind feeds on it like a parasite. It gorges itself on fear. It keeps its power
that way.
Expressions of Difference
I don't blame when I look out there, because I know that the force that humanity is
dealing with is far greater than they are. It’s far greater than they are. It is a force
that can never be broken. You can have a crack here or there, but it's not going to
break. The homogenized world isn’t suddenly going to wake up. Jesus ain't coming
back. It doesn't work that way. Each and every one of you in one way or another is
a mutation. There’s something wrong with you. There is. You’re different. That’s
what this is all about. What Human Design brings to you is a way in which that
difference can find its validity, its truth and be expressed fully.
In the end this is what it’s about. It is about the expression of difference in the
world that demands conformity. The conformity that is demanded by family, friends,
lovers, you name it. The conformity that says you can only be different in certain
ways that's okay for us, so that you’re controlled. So that your difference becomes
something that others make fun of because you don't fit in. Or that they abuse you
because you don't fit in. Most cultures punish difference. Most tribes punish
difference.
The World beyond Your Aura is Your Construct
This knowledge is the complete other side of all of that. This is the exaltation of
difference, the glory of difference. This is the only way to go. Everything else you
cannot trust. What can you trust? Spend two weeks looking at Human Design and
then tell me what you can trust. There’s nothing out there to trust. It’s not you.
It’s the other. And the other only exists because you construct it. The world beyond
your aura is your construct. It’s your life. It’s your world. You’re here to be
different. You’re here to be nurtured in your difference, embraced for your
difference. That's what it means to be able to make a contribution in this life.

Lesson Five
Death
The most extraordinary contribution you make in this life is just by being different.
Haven't you noticed that it gets noticed? And the beauty of it when it's correct,
when the aura is so puzzling to the not-self. I talk about enlightened selfishness. In
the global cycle that we’re moving towards it opens up in the 55.6 how the spirit
needs to be nurtured through selfishness. And it's a phase in what will be a 400 year
cycle. It will last 60 or 70 years and will take us to the end of this century.
It says so much about what the frequency of the world will be about and why this
knowledge is here now. And why there are children as I speak that are being told
about this knowledge, told about themselves, that there are babies that are already
being nourished in this way. It’s so that one can be prepared for an era so different,
for the challenges of it. And it is a challenge that each and every one of us deal with
within ourselves and within ourselves only. It is only in that true inner authority that
we establish our ability to be able to navigate on this plane and to be able to fulfill
our promise, and when we get to the end of that, to complete it correctly.
If you have a will, put it in your will—don’t mess with my body. No autopsy for three
days. Leave this plane correctly. Stay in the movie. This is one of the most
profound things that you can do for yourself. The magic of what it is to be aware, to
understand how things work, to understand how you work, and to accept it, to
surrender to it, to surrender to the authority that is yours, to surrender to the power
that you have within yourself to live this life correctly, not suffer like this woman,
drop dead in a meaningless life. This is not what it’s about. And meaningless in the
sense that it was never hers. Not that there was nothing there in it, relative to the
“this and that” of the game of life. But it wasn’t her life.
It’s quite a story, a human being, what it means to be us to float through this space
with all that whiteness. What it means to navigate on this plane, what others truly
mean to us. And what is the point, after all. What is the point? Until you live
according to what is correct you never get to see what you’re here to see. So the
point will always elude you. But it’s when you begin to see what you’re here to see,
that's when the potential of your Personality, that's when there is an extraordinary
transformation and it leads to something. That is what we are all about and where I
began communicating.
Outer Authority is the Ultimate Communication
I’m a great admirer of the oral tradition. But most people when they hear that, they
think of the past, storytellers and prophets and whatever. But it’s not about the
past. It’s about every day. It's about what this life is about. It is about the
potential to enrich our relationships through the enrichment of our discourse. Outer
authority is the ultimate communication. And as a species, this is what we're here to
achieve, the ultimate communication, unique perfected communication. This is
what's built into us. This is where we can go. It is the magic of what is possible
between us. A bond in fascination and inspiration that is as profound as any bond
we have known in the body. It is our beauty.

Ultimately we are here in terms of correctness. In that sense there is this very
hokey schmaltzy expression: soul mate. But the outer authority is the purest
expression of the Personality Crystal. That is, the so-called soul. It is its purest
expression. It’s what outer authority is about. And it’s a unique thing that each of
you are entitled to. Its part of what this journey is, this following of Strategy and
Authority and slowly but surely the deep embrace of the various levels of this
knowledge so that you get to the point where you can transform, shatter, in fact, the
not-self mind so that this unique communication can emerge.
For me, outer authority is the highest state of consciousness. I don’t think there is
anything that could possibly compare to it, whether one talks about enlightenment or
awakening. Enlightenment and awakening are homogenized terms. Outer authority
is simply the expression of unique cognitive awareness. That’s what it is, unique
cognitive awareness that is no longer attached to the vehicle's life, but cognitive
awareness that is simply the by-product of filtering, unique filtering of the
experiential field.
We are passengers. No matter how dense the illusion of your body, no matter how
long you've been identifying with it as your body, it’s a meat package and you’re
going to leave it. It is just another experiential phenomenon in an evolving cognitive
process. Or at least that's what we call it. I want to be able to experience outer
authority of others. There is so much for us to express. It’s what's going to make
us truly interesting for each other. You find that out as you go deeper in this
knowledge; spend more time in this knowledge. You have less patience for a lot of
claptrap that's out there. It’s not really interesting.
You begin to see once you understand mechanics that it's actually very hard to deal
with the way in which people rationalize their lives or the activities that they are
involved in, or this or that or whatever the case may be. You begin to see that the
dialogue itself is not one that is actually rewarding. It isn’t even interesting, other
than the fact that they can become sort of guinea pigs in an ongoing investigation
into the not-self. We’ve lost something. The way in which we can communicate with
each other without an agenda, without a reason, but simply because it is what we do
best. It’s what I do best. You can hear that. This is what I do. I'm in the outer
authority game. And I'm a real joke in that because I don't even have any idea
where it comes from or what it is. It just comes out, and it's interesting.
This is what we’re about. This is what makes us special. It is not about waiting for
one being to be different in assuming that that is it, that that's the way it works. But
it’s every single one of you. It is a potential that is there in every single human
being regardless if they will gain access to it, but it is there. It's there. But there’s
something to understand at the end of all this, most human beings who are different
in this life they’ve built up all kinds of defense mechanisms and strategies for
survival as a different being. In so many ways they have learned to mask their
difference in certain situations, under certain conditions. This is giving authority
away.

Lesson Five
Death
Embrace the Knowledge Radically
The only way that your life is going to be transformed through this knowledge is if
you embrace it radically. And that means you begin the experiment and once you
recognize that the experiment works, that you go as deep into that process as you
possibly can because you don't have a lot of time and your life depends on it. And
they're not that many human beings who are on that fractal who have that
opportunity. There is that possibility. You cannot claim ignorance.
To embrace this radically is to create a disturbed field around you in relationship to
the world around you. There is always a price to be paid, but there is no other way.
Every step along the way in Human Design moves you further and further away from
your dependency on the outer authority out there, those people out there to be your
authority. It moves you further and further away. It moves you away the moment
it gives you a different way of making decisions. It moves you away when it puts
you into a bedroom by yourself. It moves you away when it shows you that you
have to eat in a certain way. It moves you away when it points to a location that is
correct for you and not necessarily for anyone else in your life. It moves you away
to you.
It is your journey to difference, a difference that makes a difference in your life and
the life of others. But this is not something to dabble with. It’s not something where
the pursuit of truth gets in the way of living it. It’s something that requires
discipline, dedication and fascination. You cannot really go all the way in this
journey unless you are intellectually fascinated, because in the end the final journey
is dealing with the mind. The body is easy. The mind is not. The deeper the
intellectual grasp, the deeper the curiosity, the more profound the experience. The
deeper the knowledge penetrates; the sooner awareness begins to emerge.
Well, I never really know where I'm going, but I assume given that I was dealing
with death today that this was the way that I would go. Anyway, it is really a
remarkable thing, and it's what I want you to take with you, that you can see. At
least, this is the first and most important seeing that's there in your life. To see it
and to be it is really what it's all about.
So, I want to thank all of you. I hope you enjoyed this story and this look at
conditioning and this journey through conditioning. Remember about death and the
72 hours, the Bardo. We all have those beings in our lives that are going to die, one
way or another, and it’s something important to share. It really is.
Anyway to all of you, do take care, and until next time, whenever that is, bye for
now.
