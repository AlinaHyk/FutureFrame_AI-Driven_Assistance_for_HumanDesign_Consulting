Lecture One
The Mechanics of the Maia
Welcome to all of you. It‟s been a long time since I have just simply focused on the
basics of Human Design. It is obvious and clear to me that after all of these years
that it is really the basics that carry with it the real depth of the knowledge. If you
don‟t get the basics it doesn‟t really matter where you go. You don‟t really the grasp
the story. And the story ultimately is always about us. That is, each and every one
of us. It‟s about being able to reassure your mind, which gets in the way of every-
thing, that the mechanics are correct and that if you follow the mechanics it is clear
that it is transforming in the life.
What I really want to do over this next 10 weeks that we have together is to go
through basic concepts in Human Design and to look at them in terms of seeing
them for what they are, the real key to the knowledge. And it begins with the focus
that I have for you today which is the illusion we have that we are a wholeness, that
we are a oneness. It is perhaps the deepest illusion of all. It comes down to some
very basic questions and some very basic principles.
A Dualistic Knowledge
I am a dualist. Human Design is dualistic knowledge. It is rooted in the obvious of
the Maia. It is clear that everything in the Maia operates through polarities. That it
is all about dualities, whether it is up or down, in or out, and so forth and so on, all
the variations on the themes of duality, the yin and the yang of the story. Without
the ability to really
see that duality in
everything, you can-
not see the movie
and you cannot see
things for what they
really are.
We are a duality
ourselves. It is this
duality in many ways
that is the key to the significance of what Human Design really brings. The illustra-
tion in front of you, when I was first given the knowledge, this is basically the way in
which I laid it out. In other words, if you could see the charts that I was drawing by
hand in the late 80‟s this is what they looked like. There was a bodygraph in the

center and there was a wheel on the right and a wheel on the left. In this case, in
this illustration, everything is blank. But in terms of the charts I was drawing then,
basically I would put in all of the data in both wheels and the integrating field was in
the center, that is, the bodygraph.
A Synthesis
When you think about the nature of Human Design, it‟s a synthesis and so many
people get stuck in its parts. I think if you get stuck in its parts you get lost. It‟s a
synthesis of many things. Obviously, it has a profound relationship to the I‟Ching.
But it‟s not the I‟Ching. It‟s one of those things to understand about what synthesis
brings is that Human Design is a synthesis of the esoteric and the exoteric. In so
many ways they are really, in a sense, unrecognizable in what is taken from them
and what is left behind.
The perfect example is astrology. There is always a tendency in people who first
meet Human Design who have any kind of astrological background to see it through
an astrological lens. And yet, astrology and Human Design basically only have one
thing in common. That is, an understanding that the planets have influence. But the
way in which the systems operate, the example that in Human Design there is no
ascendant, there is no house system, and so forth and so on, that these are very,
very different things. And that what was taken into Human Design in its synthesis
was the influence of the planets. And the influences of the planets based on the
physics of the neutrino, but it didn‟t take all the other accouterment that goes with
it.
In other words, it is something really to grasp about this synthesis is that when you
look at Human Design you see all these components. You see chakras, as an exam-
ple, the channels themselves are rooted in the Sefirot of the Kabala. Yet, they are
none of those things. That is, Human Design is not astrology and it‟s not the
I‟Ching, it‟s not Kabala and it‟s not the Chakra system. It‟s none of those things.
If you‟re looking for what‟s new and what makes, in that sense, Human Design so
extraordinary is that what‟s new is this bodygraph. That is, the bodygraph has never
existed before. Yes, obviously, there have been graphic illustrations of bodies and
systems. You can look at acupuncture, line system drawings, sketches of the way
the Chakra system might operate within the vehicle, but there has never been any-
thing like the bodygraph.
The bodygraph is unique. First of all, it is based on an entirely new numerical confi-
guration. In other words, this is not a seven-center Chakra system. This is a nine-
centered being. And that the information of the way in which everything is drawn
together all has derivatives in other systems. In other words, the bodygraph is the
real synthetic field.

LECTURE ONE
The Mechanics of the Maia
The Difference between the Right and Left
When we‟re looking to the right or to the left, basically what we are looking at is the
data. And I think that the first thing to really grasp when you‟re looking a bodygraph
is to understand that there is an enormous distance between the data here [red
wheel] and the data here [black wheel]. And I don‟t think that that is given enough
consideration or really, truly understood what that means.
After all, we all know it‟s the formula of Human Design calculation that the Design is
always 88 degrees retrograde of the Sun from birth. Now, that 88 degrees of the
Sun represents approximately 88 or 89 days of movement of the Sun. In the lan-
guage of everyday life, we‟re looking at approximately three months. In other
words, the calculation on the right and the calculation on the left are separated by
each other by three months. They are very different from each other.
Yes, they have commonalities; the obvious of outer planets and the fact that they
move slowly. And yes, there are commonalities between the Personality and the De-
sign. But not everybody has their Neptune‟s and Uranus‟ in the same gates. The
fact of the matter is in most cases the nodal configuration is different. The whole
potential of the way in which the environment is perceived is dealt with entirely diffe-
rently.
We live with this illusion that we are this one thing in the center. And oh boy is that
ever a trap, because we‟re not. What this one thing does, and it is through the
agency of the Magnetic Monopole that sits here, is that it holds these two aspects
together in a magnetic tension. It holds them together to create this illusion. They
do not voluntarily embrace each other. They don‟t.
One of my standing jokes is that if you‟re looking for your mystical partner, your soul
mate, well, you‟re looking for your Design, the Personality in you, because this is the
great dilemma of life that the Personality and the Design are not in any way, truly,
connected to each other. They wouldn‟t, if I can anthropomorphize that, necessarily

like each other, which is also quite a joke. But then again, we have that all the
time—Personalities that don‟t like their bodies, as an example. Personalities that
don‟t like what their unconscious brings out in the illusion of the wholeness that they
have no access to. There is this incredible struggle that‟s taking place.
A Special Relationship between the Design and the Form Principle
There‟s something else to consider about the nature of these two databases and the
way they operate within the whole. There is a special relationship that exists be-
tween the Design and the form principle itself. When we‟re thinking about the De-
sign, this is the Design Crystal. In other words, this would be the data configuration,
the data wheel, of the Design Crystal, what you see on the left-hand side of a normal
chart [below].
Now, we know that the De-
sign Crystal sits here in the
Ajna Center and the Magnet-
ic Monopole sits here in the
G Center and they have a
very, very special relation-
ship to each other. If you
go back to the very beginning of life, if you go back into the conception process, until
that point, 88 degrees of the Sun before birth. Until that point there is no Personali-
ty. It‟s still up there waiting to be called in.
This, in fact, for two-thirds
of what is a normal preg-
nancy, is what is building
the vehicle and the illusion
of the vehicle. Not only
that, but because this is the
Design Crystal and because
it‟s responsible for building
the structure, it is going to
build into the structure the
availability for the Personal-
ity to be able to tune in.
And what happens at that
88-degree point before
birth? This Personality is
brought in all right. It‟s
brought in and it sits up
here in the Head Center. In
sitting up here in the Head
Center, there‟s something curious to think about.

LECTURE ONE
The Mechanics of the Maia
The Personality
If you look carefully you‟ll see that in terms of the way the bodygraph is always
drawn, you can see that this portion of the Head Center isn‟t even in the body. And
this is where the Personality goes. So, think about the relationship now that we
have. This is really the life right here. This is the life; this is what it‟s all about.
This is what you come in with, this is what prepares you. This is the vehicle that is
going to move you through this life. And just for entertainment, we have this Perso-
nality that‟s brought in, not even allowed into the vehicle, and this Personality is
brought in and sits there in the passenger seat and watches this movie, the life.
We put so much stock into the by-product of Personality, because the by-product of
Personality is what we call „mind‟. Think about the joke now. I want you to grasp
the joke. There is your Personality. It thinks it‟s in control of your life, it really does.
It thinks that it is its body, that it can manage it, that it can control it, that it can tell
it what to do, that it can give it its direction in life, all of those things. This is the
Personality. The Personality pays no attention to the fact that that really is an illu-
sion, pure and simple. If you look at the mechanics you can see that the only thing
Design Concepts is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

DESIGN CONCEPTS

the Personality can do is accept, choicelessly, what has been constructed for it as a
potential. All of this comes from the Design.
The Not-Self
If you grasp that you can see why life is hell for so many human beings, absolute
hell, because the Personality does not run the life. It can‟t run the life. It‟s con-
trolled deeply. The parameters of its possibilities are controlled deeply by the ve-
hicle. When it‟s not in harmony with its vehicle and when the vehicle is not operat-
ing correctly this is when we have the deep dysfunction of the Personality and this is
what we call the „not-self‟. That is, the mind refusing to accept that it is helpless,
because it doesn‟t know how and it doesn‟t know why.
I don‟t want you to get caught in the illusion. The black and the red, that‟s my basic
teaching. If I go back to the very first classes that I gave in 1992 I began with the
black and the red. It‟s the whole story. Most people go flying by it because they
love that illusion in the center, that bodygraph where it looks like the Personality re-
ally has potential. But it‟s the black and the red. And it‟s almost devious the way
the gods work, because what we have conscious access to, the Personality, the
black, is what we have conscious access to. In other words, aren‟t the gods sweet?
They give us conscious access to what, in fact, is helpless. It‟s a nice joke. They
hide from us, and I‟m just playing when I say they hide, what we don‟t have con-
scious access to, which is everything.
People get stuck with not grasping what the formula of Design is really about, this
Strategy and Authority. It‟s not spiritual. It‟s not some kind of mantra. It‟s about
finally giving to the form, to the Design, to the unconscious, its Authority to just
simply be correct in its process. What Strategy does is take authority away from the
Personality that has no authority. And you can see that it has no authority. Locked
away in this little bubble up here watching the movie, and yet so ignorant and lost in
the light of the projection that it thinks it is it. And it‟s not. And the great dilemma
that we face in this knowledge is the stubbornness of the mind. And the tricks that it
has that it can use to frighten us, to give it its power, the illusion of its power, to
drive us against our very form, to think that the mind knows better, and it doesn‟t.
The Form has to be Correct
So, when you look at a bodygraph you have to look to either side first. The last cen-
tury has been full of those exploring the way in which mind works from every possi-
ble level. And it‟s something to understand: Everything about what it is to be human
is about recognizing that it is the form and the form alone that has to be correct. We
have all of this emphasis on the nature of mind, how important it is, how clever it is,
how smart it is. But when you think about the way in which we‟ve looked at psy-
chology, how important it is to understand that when you‟re looking at the red, when
you‟re looking at the way it works in the vehicle, this was always confused with the
unconscious as if it was somehow mentally related.

LECTURE ONE
The Mechanics of the Maia
A Binary Consciousness
This is the vehicle itself. And it leads us to grasp something that is very, very impor-
tant. We have two consciousnesses. We are binary consciousness. We are a dualis-
tic consciousness. In the basic introduction to Human Design I talk about the crys-
tals of consciousness, the yin and the yang of that. And these crystals of conscious-
ness—the Personality Crystal, the Design Crystal—are not related to each other. It‟s
not like they know each oth-
er or have a cabal with each
other. They‟re very differ-
ent.
Yet, they are each con-
sciousness potential. The
Design consciousness, the
vehicle consciousness, is
what we have ignored for so long. And it is the consciousness that runs our vehicle.
And not runs our vehicle in the sense that it requires mechanics and technicians and
whatever. It‟s conscious. It is a living, interactive consciousness. Our vehicle is dri-
ven, guided, moved by a consciousness that has nothing to do with our Personality
and we have no access to it. But it‟s not mind.
The magic of Type is that Type allows you to see almost instantaneously where your
true Design consciousness Authority lies. It‟s not like we‟re giving up consciousness
when we turn to Strategy and we turn to the vehicle‟s mechanics. We are shifting
from a consciousness of helplessness to a consciousness of empowerment. Yet, we
have no access to it, no conscious access to it. No way in which we can participate
in that process. All we get to participate with is the mind and its endless turning
over of the varieties of the „this‟ and the „that‟ in the spectrum.
When you enter into your process correctly as yourself, what you are really doing is
turning over conscious Authority to your vehicle. And you are placing your Personali-
ty in a situation where the best that it can do is just see. To get to that place is real-
ly an accomplishment. We are cursed by the very consciousness of our Personality,
that that is what‟s on the surface, that that is what we see.
When you look at somebody‟s chart—I‟ve done thousands and thousands of read-
ings—if you tell them about what‟s colored in in black, it‟s all so familiar to them.
“That‟s me, that‟s me, that‟s me.” And then you start describing what‟s red and
there‟s this kind of “I don‟t know if that‟s me, but people say that‟s me,” it‟s alien.
It‟s what‟s been grafted on to them. They don‟t really know. It‟s like that person
who has a defined Emotional system and all of the ways in which it‟s defined is un-
conscious. They don‟t even know that they‟re emotional themselves. Everybody
else does. Everybody else will remind them of that. But being reminded of that
doesn‟t bring them any certainty, because they have no conscious access to it.

Then the mind is in turmoil because the mind is always in turmoil. That‟s what mind
is good at, being in turmoil. It‟s terrified of helplessness. It‟s terrified of choiceless-
ness. Mind hates all that. And mind hates all that because it has been conditioned
to hate all that—the not-self. The only way that the mind can maintain the illusion of
authority is by moving away from who you are.
The Science of Differentiation
I describe Design as the science of differentiation, and it is. It is a magical thing.
What is truly magical is to be able to see mechanically the potential of any being to
be unique. And the other side of differentiation is homogenization. To be homoge-
nized is to be conditioned. The moment that mind is confronted with situations in
which the vehicle does not go along with it, then mind is looking for a way to get
around that, always. Then it looks for not itself, not who it is, not its potential. But
it looks to the homogenized field in order to be able to accomplish what it thinks it
needs to accomplish.
We live in a homogenized world. And it is the world that we call normal. It‟s normal
to be homogenized, to be far, far, far away from what your potential is. It‟s normal.
This is the world that we live in. It‟s why in the years that I did neutrino forecasts it
was so easy to be able to see what was going to happen, because it‟s a homogenized
field. So the program affects everybody basically the same way in the homogenized
field. And you have all of these sheep who think they‟re wolves running around like
chickens. What to do.
To follow your Strategy and Authority is not to be homogenized. It is not to be nor-
mal; it is abnormal. It is abnormal to force the mind to abdicate its authority; it‟s
abnormal. It‟s abnormal to act according to your own Authority rather than the au-
thority of your lover, your children, your parents, your government, your doctor,
your lawyer, you name it, everybody else‟s authority but your own. And oh, I left
out your God or whatever else you carry for authority.
To operate according to your own Authority is abnormal. And it‟s understandable,
after all. You don‟t have any access to it. You only have access to the Personality
and to the distortion that Personality has in being homogenized, in not operating cor-
rectly, in assuming that it has control. And the Personality, because it is conscious,
has enormous power to influence you. It‟s obvious, isn‟t it? Think about any situa-
tion in your life and think about what your mind does with it. And not only that the
most interesting thing about mind is that it can set you up to make a decision about
something very significant, and when it doesn‟t work out, it already has something
else in mind. There‟s always something else.
The whole thing about Maia is that it is rooted in the Sanskrit “ma” which is to meas-
ure. This is what mind does. Mind is always measuring. And the only way you can
measure is that you have to have the perspective, there has to be the „this‟ and
„that.‟ It‟s always one of those jokes that when your mind makes a decision to go

LECTURE ONE
The Mechanics of the Maia
one way it‟s already processed the decision to go the other way and it doesn‟t really
know which way to go. It‟s just following the homogenized pattern. And the homo-
genized pattern is rooted in the openness of the being to conditioning.
The Openness in the Chart
When we take a look at a standard chart and we replace our wheels with just simply
data configurations and we move into the illusion that is this wholeness, you have to
see that the mind has fantastic weapons to use against itself—joke being that. And
it is the openness in you. The duality, the basic duality between what is fixed in you
and what is open. That what is fixed represents the potential of what is reliable,
consistent, and points the way towards differentiation. And the openness—oh, the
pain of the openness—because
the openness is so powerful;
it‟s our genes, after all. We
have a dilemma being genetic
bio-forms. Genes only have
one imperative and that is to
divide and make more. This is
the imperative. The impera-
tive is to survive, to exist, to
be, to flourish, if possible.
Once we have an organism as
complex as what we are as a
bio-form, the understanding
that replication is something
that has to be very carefully
controlled. Sameness at the
biological level is a dead end
street. Everything about what it is to us as a being is to understand that our funda-
mental imperative, our deepest, deepest, deepest genetic imperative is to be at-
tracted to what we are not. Not because it‟s good for you, but because it is the only
way that there can assurance that if a bond is formed and reproduction takes place
that a viable new life comes into the world. That is, a new genetic combination that
carries with it a potential of being able to maintain the species.
We‟re technically, morally, biologically warned against copulating with our relatives.
Think about what means for us. You look at that bodygraph and it looks like it has a
lot of activation, that first impression of—you have a defined G and the Spleen, the
Sacral and the Root. And there are all these little things that are colored in. There
are all these lists on either side of data. But there is much more openness in this
Design than fixedness, by a lot. There‟s a huge amount of openness. And I‟m not
just talking about the open centers. All these open channels and these open gates,
every single one of them, within the imperative genetically, is looking for that other,
lost in it.

This is what the mind feeds on. It feeds on openness. It says, “I cannot make a de-
cision about anything unless that decision will prove my worthiness. Is this going to
be good for showing others that I‟m of value?” This is the undefined Heart Center
influencing the way in which mind works. Or the open emotional system of avoiding
confrontation and truth, making a decision based on avoiding confrontation and
truth—“No, I don‟t want to get involved in that, that could lead to this or that or the
other thing,”—and all of this bypassing the Authority over and over again.
What human beings live out is this openness. This is what they live. Remember,
this is about duality today, the „this‟ and the „that.‟ And the deepest „this‟ and „that‟
is this openness and fixedness that you see in the chart, because the openness is a
curse. You get lost in it. Hu-
manity is lost in it, thinking
about things that don‟t matter,
trying to convince themselves
that they are right, trying to
attract attention, trying to
prove themselves, trying to
avoid confrontation and truth.
That‟s who this person is.
The fact that this is an arche-
type of perfected form, a very
deep focus potential archetype
of perfected form that we see
in this definition can only be
realized through the Authority
of the vehicle and the Sacral.
Here is a pure splenic Genera-
tor—“un-huh; uh-uh.” There is Authority, the expression of the consciousness of the
form. And only through the expression of this Sacral is there any possibility that this
being can shed the torment that is brought to them through the openness and begin
to live the perfection of what is possible.
Human beings are caught by their openness, locked into it, lost in it. And they think
that‟s who they are. I know. It was always my great dilemma when people would
sit down beside me for an analysis, and I would look at the definition and think, hey
that‟s quite something. Then I would look at the openness and say, but yeah, here‟s
where they are. And how sad that place is.
Think about this being. We‟re all—well, schizophrenic is a funny word, I don‟t want
to get too—we are all of two sorts, let‟s put it that way. There is this extraordinary
potential in all of us to live out our uniqueness. It‟s really there. And in fact, it is
incredibly simple to access. It is. After all, if you look at Human Design and you
look at Strategy, an answer in six words or something, it‟s extraordinarily simple on
the surface. And yet, it‟s the surface where everybody‟s lost, because on the surface
they‟re lost in all of that openness and all of that conditioning in minds that do not
speak for their nature. Your mind does not speak for your nature; it speaks for your

conditioning. It is the spokesperson of your conditioning and your yearning to be
something that you‟re not. It‟s the cheerleader that stands there and says, “We can
become something we are not.” It‟s the great killer of the spirit on the planet.
It‟s not easy. I know. I‟ve watched years and years and years. What it means to
give up and to abandon the power of the not-self to run your life. So you have to
see that when you‟re looking at the illusion itself, when you‟re looking at the body-
graph itself, to see that in the bodygraph this difference of Personality and Design
becomes something else. It becomes embodied in the difference between fixedness
and openness. That the fixedness leads to the possibility of Strategy and Authority,
and the openness leads to conditioning and homogenization and the life through the
not-self—binaries, this and that‟s. The not-self is a fascinating thing. At first you
have to paint it in the corner as this dark force. It‟s almost scary how it moves us
away from our truth by frightening us, by turning on the paranoia of life, by making
us so uncomfortable, controlling us through our deepest, deepest genetic yearnings,
fooling us over and over again.
This openness, how the not-self can distort, but only as long as the mind is allowed
to make decisions. That‟s the key. Again, mind is an extraordinary thing. I love it.
Human Design is deeply intellectual; it‟s mind-y. Mind is wonderful as long as mind
isn‟t making decisions. Mind is great at research; it‟s great at looking at the „this‟
and the „that.‟ And the moment you take away the pressure on mind to be the deci-
sion maker in your life, the moment you‟re operating through what is your correct
Authority so that life looks after itself and you get to see the advantages of that, so
that mind doesn‟t constantly have to be on alert that there‟s something wrong, that
it‟s not running the show, then all that openness in you becomes something else.
Definition is the Student and Openness is the Courses in Life
It‟s one of my earliest descrip-
tions of the difference be-
tween what is defined in us
and what is open, that what‟s
defined in us is the student.
And what is open are the
courses that we take in this
life. And if you look at this
being, they are here to take
emotional courses and ego
courses. They‟re here to
learn about them. That very
openness that can be a curse
the moment you want what‟s
there, is an openness that be-
comes the roots of wisdom
the moment that you see
what‟s there.

I‟m undefined emotionally. In the years before my experience and when I was not-
self and unaware, my undefined emotional system was a deep curse in my life and in
horrendous pain. Not just for me, but the by-product of my relationships with oth-
ers. I was constantly rising and falling and amplifying on the wave of other being‟s
emotions. Not being clear, not operating as myself. It caused a lot of pain.
Awakeness is about Seeing
The Solar Plexus for me today is an extraordinary thing because I see it. It‟s not
that I don‟t feel it when someone is emotional and they‟re „this‟ or „that‟. I take it in.
It‟s not about not taking it in. But it‟s not me; it‟s just something I can see. And out
of that has come so much wisdom about the nature of the Solar Plexus and the emo-
tional system and emotional beings. How important it is for you to see that this
openness, this so-called not-self, is a great observer when it is freed from the ten-
sion and pressure of decision making. And the seeing itself is so deeply enriching in
this life. It is what awakenness is all about. It‟s about seeing.
This basic duality in the chart is something that each and every one of you needs to
grasp within yourself. There is your potential for wisdom. Wisdom is not in your De-
sign. That is, it‟s not in your definition. There is no wisdom in your definition unless
you have a particularly wise line. It is your potential to be correct. And in that cor-
rectness, the potential of wisdom is in everything else that allows you to be an ob-
server, an interactor with life itself. And it‟s not just the centers that are about wis-
dom; it‟s each and every one of those open gates and open channels that are there.
The richness of what is available to your Personality is food for thought.
The Key Belongs to the Vehicle
But you have to strip the Personality of any illusion that it has the right to make a
decision about anything, because it doesn‟t. The magic of the duality is to under-
stand where the key is. The key belongs to the vehicle. This is the basis of Human
Design as a form principle knowledge. Differentiation ultimately can be experienced
in the self-reflected consciousness, but it cannot even exist in the self-reflected con-
sciousness until the differentiation of the form is established.
Everything about being unique in this life, everything about being your own Authority
in this life belongs to the vehicle. And the only way in which this duality can be ba-
lanced is not when the Personality tries to do the vehicle‟s job, then there‟s distortion
and imbalance. It‟s when the Personality begins to do its job: The passenger in the
back seat looking out the windows watching the movie. That‟s what it‟s for. It‟s so
good at it.

The Mechanics of the Maia
The Chart of Pope Benedict
This chart, by the way, just so you know who this is, this is Pope Benedict. It‟s al-
ways interesting in looking at any being to look at what‟s possible and to look at how
lost they can be in conditioning. All of us, we are all on the same platform. We all
have the potential to live our lives correctly. We do. The mechanics are available.
And because this is about basics, it‟s something that you really need to grasp about
Human Design. There‟s so much
knowledge in Human Design. I‟ve
been teaching non-stop it seems
forever. There is so much know-
ledge.
But that‟s not the point. All of that
knowledge simply acts as verifica-
tion of the validity of the mechan-
ics that have been revealed.
There‟s only one thing that mat-
ters, that each and every one of
you take the opportunity that you
have that is a choiceless opportuni-
ty. This is your fractal, after all, to
meet this knowledge, to be en-
gaged with this knowledge, to live
according to your Strategy. This is what it‟s all about. You live according to your
Strategy and your Authority. There is no other way. And with it comes the pressure
that always comes to those who do not act normally in this life, that do not fit into
the homogenized conditioned field with all of its expected nuances. It takes courage.
And it takes courage to understand that the most powerful force opposed to you liv-
ing out your life is your mind. It‟s the most powerful force.
Human Design is About Decision Making
And you cannot talk to it and say, “Listen mind, why don‟t you cool it for awhile.”
You can‟t talk to it; it‟s not the way it works. You simply have to strip it of its power.
There is no other way. Its power over you is the decision making Authority that you
have given it in this life that was conditioned in you to give it by your parents, by
your culture. You need to strip away that authority. And there is only one way to do
that. It‟s what this knowledge is here for. Human Design is very simple. It is about
decision making and how to make decisions as yourself. You have a Strategy and
Authority. Follow it. And slowly, it takes time, everything does, but the discipline is
deeply rewarded because you begin to see. And seeing is what it‟s all about.

Lecture Two
Type and Strategy
Welcome to all of you. You can see that the subject today is probably the most
overworked and dealt with subject in Human Design and deserves every little bit of
attention that it gets. It‟s so clear to me that this is the story and it‟s the only story.
It‟s interesting. Human Design as a science of differentiation, that word “science,”
there is nothing about Human Design that is just stated. I think it‟s the thing that
gives it integrity and value. For every aspect of Human Design that is offered on the
surface there has been an enormous amount of time spent verifying the underlying
mechanics that lead to that.
In fact, that journey of verifying and laying out the basics of the sciences is enorm-
ously exciting. But it‟s exciting in the intellectual sense that we‟re dealing with the
ability to look at the world with an entirely new perspective, and to look at and to
see the nature of being in its pure mechanics. And obviously, out of that comes
many things that are of value. That is, things like the Primary Health System, our
ability to be able to learn so much about the potential in the human body to differen-
tiate.
And yet, from the point of view of the value of Human Design and what needs to be
shared on the surface, it remains entirely focused here on Type and Strategy. It re-
ally is the whole story. And it‟s the whole story in the sense that it is the synthesis
of all the mechanical information that lies underneath. Everything about Type and
Strategy is that it points us towards the only viable solution in terms of the being
able to liberate the human spirit from the drudgery of the homogenized life and the
dilemma of what it is to be not-self.
We are not equipped to simply be motivated by propaganda to transform our percep-
tion of life. It‟s not enough for us to be moved, whether spirituality, religiously,
mystically. The fact of the matter is that the mind is something that is helpless in
being able to transform the life. And the only thing that truly aligns the life is the
ability to be able to know where to find the essence of personal truth. I guess that‟s
really one of the most difficult places for a human being to go to. That is, to deny
the possibility that the other has your truth. It takes a great deal of courage to be
able to not only embrace your own Authority, but to live it. It is quite a thing to live
your own Authority.
So in dealing with Type and Strategy today, yes, it‟s the basics, and it‟s the deep ba-
sics, but it is the most important knowledge that Human Design brings. There‟s
nothing like it. And any human being that goes through the process of living their

Type and Strategy knows profoundly how this has transformed their life and how
valuable that process really is. And despite all the things that go on—the dilemmas
of mind, the power of the other to be a conditioning force that if you are clearly,
deeply involved in following the experiment of your Type and Strategy then you are
able to find your way through all that.
It‟s something else as well, that Type and Strategy is the only thing that can begin
the process of the transformation of the mind, the transformation of the passenger,
of the Personality consciousness, of that potential to reach a state of acuity in which
no matter what term we want to apply to it, the fact that the mind is finally released
from the burden of being preoccupied with the illusion. Type and Strategy, no mat-
ter where you go, leads to the perfection of what it is to be us. So, basic it may be,
it is the whole story.
The Generator
So let‟s begin with the Generator. I‟ve told a lot of Generator stories over the years.
In many ways I was deeply fooled by Generators. As a matter of fact, I had spent
my entire life being conditioned by Generators. I‟m a Manifestor and I have a totally
undefined Sacral Center so I have
been very much influenced by Ge-
RRR
nerators in my life. They‟re an in-
OOO credible force. I tried to explain to
TTT Generators that they are the only
AAA holy ones. And of course, I don‟t
RRR mean to offend Projectors and Ref-
lectors and Manifestors. However,
EEE
the reality is that everything about
NNN
planet earth is in the hands of a
EEE
Generator.
GGG
The first thing to understand about
the Generator is to understand the
Generator‟s aura. It has this en-
veloping aura, an open aura that‟s
enveloping. Now, that sounds like
it‟s taking everything in, this enve-
loping aura. It goes around every-
thing, surrounds everything within
its auric field. But something to
really understand about the Generator is that instead of so much taking it in, and it
does, is that it puts the life force out.
The thing to understand about the Generator is that the Generator is literally, mo-
ment-by-moment, breath-by-breath generating the life force through its aura. And if
you think about the fact that Generators represent slightly less than 70% of humani-
ty, that‟s Generators and Manifesting Generators together—a Generator is a Genera-

Type and Strategy
tor is a Generator—that this almost 70% of Generators represents nearly 5 billion
people on the planet. If you think about the world that we live in and you think
about the Generator enveloping aura, that wherever there are human beings there
are human beings living inside a Generator generated bubble. And that bubble ge-
nerates one thing consistently: frustration.
We live on an earthly plane in which the one thing that stands out is the deep, deep,
deep frustration that is the hallmark of life on this planet. It‟s not like I want Gene-
rators to feel guilty; though, I don‟t mind if they do, quite frankly. Anything that can
wake a Generator up, I‟ll take. Manifestors like me, who go plowing through this life,
do not have in any way shape or form the same capacity to transform the life as a
Generator. It‟s the Generators that I can impact as a Manifestor that might, in fact,
be able to change the world because they are the world, they are life, and they are
the life force.
You take away all the Generators, and the Reflectors and the Projectors and the Ma-
nifestors wilt like cut flowers. It‟s a Generator world. It‟s my joke about the temple
at Delphi, the one that said, “Know Thyself.” There used to be a sign above it that
said, “Generators Only.” And at the same time, the Generator Strategy seems to be
on the surface the simplest damn thing you could imagine: Respond, don‟t initiate,
respond, don‟t initiation, respond. It‟s so incredibly simple it‟s mind boggling, and
it‟s perfect.
This is what the Generator is about. This is a response machine constantly respond-
ing to a sound, to something they see, to something that happens, whatever the
case may be. And the Generator in response is absolutely perfect. I used to tell that
story about Generators. Let‟s say this Generator is a little girl and is invited to:
“Would you like to do ballet?” This little girl answers with this Throat. And she says,
“Oh, yes, I‟d love to do ballet. It‟s something I‟ve always wanted to do.” So off she
goes to ballet class. She goes to ballet class and quite frankly she just can‟t get it.
She tries, she tries really hard but she just can‟t get it. And at some point she gets
deeply, deeply frustrated and quits. “I don‟t want to do that.”
The Throat Center doesn‟t dance. The dancing is here. And of course, this is the
enormous dilemma for the Generator, that the Generator is a human. And we hu-
man beings are gregarious, communicating, verbalizing creatures. It‟s what we do.
Oh, you have that little baby of yours and that baby is around a year old and you‟re
tired of baby talk and you want that baby to say something, you want it to articulate.
As a matter of fact, if it doesn‟t articulate on time you go into full panic. And all you
want to do is nurture that articulating capacity in that child.
Yes, on the surface I understand that. It is what it is to be human. This is the way
in which we communicate very detailed information to each other. But you also have
to see that given that nearly 70% of humanity is Generators, from the moment they
come into the world the pressure on them is to leave their Generator sounds behind
and to enter into the domain of articulation. And that no longer when somebody
speaks to them is that other going to be satisfied with anything less than an articu-
lated response. “How are you?” “I‟m fine.” “You tell me how you are.”

What‟s so extraordinary about Generators is that they may be the great generative
life force on the planet, but most Generators, the Sacral Center itself are atrophying
Centers. They‟re wilting. They have never been used correctly. They have simply
been taken advantage of in terms of their physical power.
But the children who come into the world who are born as Generators, the first thing
they‟re taught is to leave that behind. Not only that, but they‟re conditioned to be
Manifestors. They‟re conditioned to initiate. And that if they don‟t initiate they are
assumed to be slow, problem children, unmotivated, and on and on and on and on,
all the pretend homogenized problems supposedly the Generator children have that
they don‟t have.
But what is a Generator? The Generator has to have the ability to set the terms.
This is the whole thing for a Generator to grasp that you were given this power so
you could establish the terms. The most difficult thing for the Generator is its mind.
I remember the look on the faces of Generator women when I would say to them, “If
you want Prince Charming you have to wait for Prince Charming to want you.” And
that look that says, “There is no Prince Charming that will ever want me. If I don‟t
go after things, I will not get them.” It‟s amazing how many Generators believe that
and suffer the consequences of it.
It‟s very simple. I love that Tom Wait‟s line: The large print given and the small
print taken away. It‟s extraordinary the potential of the Generator, and simple. But
they do have an open and enveloping aura so they take in deep conditioning from
the beginning. And that deep conditioning influences their mind. “If I am waiting, I
am missing things,” says the Generator mind. “I‟m going to miss it; I‟m going to
miss this, I‟m going to miss that. They won‟t just come to me, they won‟t just ask
me.”
It‟s like those Generators when I was first introducing Type and their Type to them
who would say to me things like, “I‟m going to have to tell people to ask me.” No,
you don‟t have to tell anybody to ask you. You‟re a Generator and you have a Gene-
rator‟s aura and it is an enveloping aura and it takes the other in so deeply, it‟s such
a powerful force and if you just stay silent, they‟re forced to ask you, and then it‟s
correct.
When I meet Generators who have taken the radial path, and there is a radial path,
the absolute denial of initiation, life finds you. But you have to deal with the battle
with your mind, the mind that desires, the mind that wants, the mind that is so
deeply afraid, the mind of this Generator with its open Spleen and its fears for its
very survival, for its security, for its well-being, fears that turn its mind into a clutch-
ing, grasping, holding on mind. “I just can‟t wait. I‟m vulnerable. I have to do this,
and I have to do that. I can‟t wait for a job to come. I can‟t wait for the right thing
to be there. I can‟t; I‟m afraid.”
The mind is a very powerful thing. No one experiences transformation more quickly
than a Generator that‟s correct; and yet, what an ordeal. This Sacral Center and
these sounds—it‟s been a funny, long-running conversation with Generators over all
of these years. I know Generators who work with Generators. It‟s amazing how

Type and Strategy
damaged the Sacral is in so many Generators. How difficult it is at times to even get
that Sacral to begin to truly express itself.
And there‟s something else that I think Generators really miss about the nature of
the Sacral. It‟s not aware. The Sacral is sort of like having a music system and it‟s
mono, so you only have one speaker, and the speaker is the Sacral. After all, as a
Generator your Sacral is only defining you as a Generator because it‟s connected to
something. If you look at [below], for example, in this case, we‟re dealing with a
Split Definition, so if you look at this case and you look at this Sacral Center, you will
see that when the Sacral Center goes “uh-huh” it is based on the adrenalized emo-
tional response. It‟s based on what defines it. And what defines it gives it its infor-
mation base and its criteria.
The Sacral speaks in the same way that the Throat speaks. And the Sacral speaks
specifically for Definition. If you have your Sacral connected to the Spleen, then
every time your Sacral makes a decision it‟s based on your immune system. In oth-
er words, the Sacral is expressing aspects of your fixed nature. And it needs to be
allowed to speak; you need to hear it. Question and response is something that is
deeply important for Generators, not so much for the answers. Yes, they‟re interest-
ing, but in fact, the answers are only of value because they interest the mind. “I
think this; what‟s my Sacral going to think?” Interesting for the mind, it keeps the
mind occupied in the experiment.
What‟s really important in the question and response is that you begin to wake up
the Sacral‟s power to be the spokesperson for the Authority of the vehicle, and that
Sacral response is so important. When I ask a Generator anything and the first re-
sponse is verbal, I don‟t give it much credence because I know that may or may not
be anything like the truth in terms of what the response is. The response that comes
out of the Sacral you can always trust.
The other thing is the Generator in relationship, and to recognize the potential of
Generators together, how profound that it. That is, the potential of having what can
be such an incredibly honest relationship between two beings as long as there is mu-
tual question and response. But most important is to see the damage that is done to
Generator children and how important it is to
raise Generators as Generators, that they under-
stand where they can find their truth, that they
R R R
learn to see that by responding with a sound fol- OOO
lowed by articulation is acceptable. But just res- TTT
AAA
ponding with articulation leads them separate
RRR
and away from their true Authority and their true EEE
ability to make decisions as themselves. NNN
EEE
GGG
The real dilemma for the Generator is when the
Generator, as is in this illustration, is Emotional.
The Emotional system always brings this no truth
in the now, and the demands of patience and
time. One of my favorite things for Emotional
Generators is to remind them of their power to

get exactly what they want if they can learn how to reject. It‟s not an easy thing for
Generators with their open and enveloping aura. But the fact of the matter is, that
for an Emotional Generator it‟s always necessary that even when Prince Charming
shows up you tell Prince Charming no matter what you feel in that moment that
you‟re busy and that it will have to wait, and you won‟t lose Prince Charming. You‟ll
just increase Prince Charming‟s desire.
It‟s something to understand about the power of the Emotional system. It is such a
deep source of pleasure. Yes, there‟s pain on the other side, but for those that are
seeking the Emotional being, in fact they are willing to wait a long time in order to
gain access to what they consider to be something that is really of value to them.
Generators are responsible for the world that we live in. Every time that you can
influence somebody, every time you meet somebody who is a Generator, it‟s so im-
portant to let them know the basic Strategy to avoid initiation, to respond, to learn
how to respond with sounds. And in that, open up the whole potential of finally be-
ing able to live a life in which frustration is not the theme, but satisfaction is really
the reality.
The Manifestor
The Manifestor and the Generator represent very much the energy dynamic of the
planet. That is, they are the two so-called energy Types. Obviously together they
represent nearly 80% of humanity. It means that we live in a deeply energized
plane, or here on this plane to be
busy and to do our stuff. Manifes-
RRR tors have a real dilemma. The di-
OOO lemma for the Manifestor is that
they‟re so different.
TTT
SSS
They‟re different to begin with be-
EEE
cause of the nature of the Manifes-
FFF
tor aura. The Manifestor has a re-
III
pelling aura. That repelling aura
NNN
just blocks everything off. And it
AAA
can make it extremely difficult for
MMM
Manifestors to have an intimate and
nurturing environment when they
are children. It‟s very difficult for
Manifestor children. They do not
have the same kind of connection
to their mother or their father, par-
ticularly the relationship to the
mother. And it is often very diffi-
cult, particularly for Generator
mothers to have a Manifestor child. There is the Generator mother with her envelop-
ing aura and constantly the child is, in essence, pushing it away.

LECTURE TWO
Type and Strategy
Something to understand about Manifestor auras is that though they are repelling it
does not mean they are impervious, they are not at all. If you can get past the re-
pelling, and of course this is a matter of one‟s fractal connection with that particular
Manifestor, if you can get past their repelling you can stay in their aura. But of
course, generally speaking, the way in which Manifestors influence the other is that
because there is this repelling—and understand, basically what happens is when
somebody meets the Manifestor aura their own aura retracts, it backs up. And out of
that comes a certain kind of psychological approach towards the Manifestor itself.
Everything we know about the Manifestor is that the Manifestor is here to initiate,
the deep opposite of the Generator. These are the archetypal doers. Of course,
there‟s a great joke in all of that, is that everybody else on the planet—Manifestors
are about 8% of the population—everybody on the planet has to wait and has to
cooperate. So, that immediately makes the Manifestor something that is suspicious,
different, and potentially uncontrollable. No child is punished more than the Manifes-
tor child. And I don‟t necessarily mean physical abuse; I just mean general punish-
ment, control mechanisms that are placed on them. The classic of the Manifestor
child that simply opens the door because it can and goes out and gets lost, being
punished and being restricted because it didn‟t ask, it wasn‟t dependent on the coop-
erative invited response mechanisms; it‟s just being a Manifestor.
There is a dilemma with Manifestors—an odd thing to say about them—is that their
Strategy and Authority is just a technique to make life easier for them. It‟s not their
time. Manifestors had their time long ago. And with the advent of the nine-centered
being in 1781, Manifestors went from the top of the ladder to being retired. They‟re
basically retired, and they‟re angry in their retirement. Manifestors are an angry lot.
Anger is always there as frustration is always there for the Generator. And under-
stand that anger and frustration are enormously powerful because they are the fre-
quency by-product of energy beings. It‟s always in their energy; it‟s always in their
aura. It can always be pulled out.
So, you have the Manifestor come into the world, and of course what it meets is re-
straint, constant restraint. And this only increases the level of its anger. Manifestor
is the only Type that actually has two strategies: A Strategy for the Manifestor child
that lives in their parent‟s home, and a Manifestor as adult. The child has to learn to
ask permission, which means it has to be taught to ask permission. There is no oth-
er way to provide the Manifestor child with an opportunity to feel its power.
And yet, at the same time learn the rule that all Manifestors must learn: that they
have to pay attention to the other and they have to find a way to relax the other, to
put the other at ease so that they can live out their nature. The Manifestor child that
learns to ask permission, if asking permission is not unrealistically denied unfairly,
what that Manifestor child will realize is that that asking frees it from the potential of
retribution and punishment and then it can go do what it likes.
So that the Manifestor child after being punished for going out the door learns to ask
permission—“Can I go out now?” “Yes, and don‟t go far,” whatever. And the Mani-
festor goes out the door and of course once it goes out the door it does what Mani-

festors do. It can‟t really be punished anymore because it asked permission, and so
forth and so on.
This is the training of a young Manifestor. I was blessed in my life as a Manifestor.
My mother was one of these teach-your-children-manners people. Learning to ask
permission was something that was just simply a rule. And I would ask permission.
Though, I do remember doing precisely what I wanted once I got out the door; but,
nonetheless, I played the game as a Manifestor.
And the Manifestor adult—you can‟t go around asking permission any more. It
doesn‟t work. The secret for a Manifestor adult is to inform. Let them know. The
Manifestor sitting on the couch with its lover, it‟s one of my favorites, and the Mani-
festor realizes it doesn‟t have any more tobacco and it jumps up and runs out the
door; says nothing, just jumps up, runs out the door. And comes back five minutes
later, comes back to all hell breaking loose—“What did you do? Where did you go?
Why didn‟t you tell me,” and on and on and on.
Manifestors have a deep impact on the other. You can look at the repelling aura and
think negative, but you can also think positive. When my aura swings through a
room, attention gets paid; what to do. It is an impactful aura because other auras
are retracting. There is a positive to all of that, and of course for the Manifestor,
once the Manifestor understands that they are here to have impact on the other,
then they need to pay attention to that other and they need to let them know what‟s
going on.
The Manifestor that informs relaxes the other, puts the other Types at ease. Good
Manifestor, isn‟t that nice? They told us what they were going to do before they did
it. It‟s my joke about the Manifestor driving its truck down the middle of the road
and there‟s somebody crossing the road. Now, an unaware Manifestor just drives
over it. A Manifestor that‟s following its Strategy and Authority honks the horn. It
doesn‟t slow down necessarily; but it does honk the horn. This is what Manifestors
are all about. They have to learn how to honk the horn.
The real dilemma for Manifestors is that unlike Generators they‟re not gifted with the
potential to know themselves or to want to know themselves. They often do not un-
derstand how negatively that can be perceived when they are incorrect. It is some-
thing that can prove to be very difficult for them because it brings out a kind of isola-
tion and in that isolation this burning of the anger inside.
The real tragedy is that unlike the other Types where you can meet a Generator in
the middle of its life and still transform that life, it‟s not so easy with Manifestors.
Most Manifestor children run away from being at home, run away from the con-
straints, swear that they will never be controlled or punished again. They‟re not like-
ly to be ready for this kind of transformation. I‟m always surprised when Manifestors
show up, because in fact it‟s a sign they are very lucky. Most Manifestor children, by
the time they reach adulthood, basically the line, the story has been drawn for them.
So teach them young.

LECTURE TWO
Type and Strategy
The Projector
This is a rather extreme example of Projectors. I think it‟s one of the things I like
the most about Projectors is how diverse their Designs are. I know Projectors that
have eight centers defined; obviously, not the Sacral. I‟ve seen every kind of Projec-
tor configuration—the purely Men-
tal Projectors, the energy Projec-
tors, the ones that have defined RRR
motors—there are all these differ- OOO
ent varieties of Projector. I TTT
charted them once. I think there
CCC
are about four or five basic varia-
EEE
tions of Projector.
JJJ
OOO
Of course, this is really the non-
RRR
energy dimension of the planet.
PPP
Yes, there are Reflectors, but Ref-
lectors are always something dif-
ferent. I think in my own work,
and I mentioned this before, I
think it did a real disservice to Pro-
jectors in the early years. I felt
that if I could transform Genera-
tors that Human Design would just
be like a steamroller. And I put so
much attention to the instantane-
ous gratification that comes with being an energy Type, being a Generator or in fact
a Manifestor, and truly being able to deal with Strategy and Authority on a moment-
by-moment basis, and being able to get the rewards on a moment-by-moment basis.
And of course, this was deeply unfair to the Projector.
The Projector really has an extraordinary gift and the gift is something that can be
seen in its aura because the Projector aura is a focused aura. It‟s focused. And it
focuses on the G Center of the other. Where the Generator is designed to be wholly
absorbed with realizing its own nature, the Projector is wholly absorbed in witnessing
that in the other.
This aura of theirs, in its deep penetration into the other, obviously is a double-
edged sword. It is necessary for the Projector because the Projector needs to gain
access to generation or manifestation in some way. This is the way that they con-
nect to the life force of the planet. Yet, we know that what we don‟t have in our De-
sign is always the potential of wisdom in us, that the great wisdom inherent in the
Projector, deep wisdom in the Projector, is to know how to use energy, but not have
access to it itself.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

And the Projector, because it is focused on the other, has a unique capacity. That is,
they are designed to master systems in order to be able to quantify, qualify, cubby-
hole, whatever you want to call it, to be able to measure correctly the other. It‟s
why we talk about the gift of Projectors as being a gift of guidance. In fact, the
great skill of the Projector is knowing how to ask a question. I guess the role model
of all Projectors should be Socrates, the question asker, because this is the magic of
the Projector. The correct aware Projector knows precisely what questions to ask,
and it is a great gift.
But the Projector child, to begin the story, is deeply disadvantaged. They‟re not an
energy Type. So, the clean-up-your-room, be good, do this, do that, all of this is
part of a deep conditioning malaise. And we know that in dealing with the Projector
we‟re dealing with the theme of bitterness, of not being seen. And not being seen
because the Projector is here to recognize and be recognized; in other words, to rec-
ognize the other and to recognize the other clearly. And at the same time, to be
recognized, to be recognized of being of value, as an example, to be recognized in
terms of what they are.
The Projector child comes into the world; they‟re not recognized from day one, not at
all. You know parents who spend their time inviting their Projector children to do
this or that, other than the Projector parents that we have in Human Design who
might have a Projector child. You really have to see that Projectors are the most
deeply conditioned children and oh, yeah, they have a right to be bitter.
And how difficult that is if you don‟t have the support mechanism, because as a non-
energy Type, one of the most primary things for the Projector is its relationship with
the other and the need for a valued relationship with the other; it‟s essential for
them. The fact is that Projectors are naturally opened to conditioning; while their
aura is focused and absorbing, the other auras, and particularly in the sense of the
Generator aura and Generator field, is totally enveloping the Projector and condition-
ing it at that same time.
All Projectors are here to be correctly conditioned. You cannot not be conditioned if
you‟re a Projector. However, it does not mean that you have to be taken away from
what is your Authority and what is correct for you. But for the Projector, the dis-
cernment of the other is so important. These Projector children need to understand
the importance of the invitation. How devastating it‟s going to be for them. Projec-
tors are constantly playing Manifestor, constantly playing Generator, they are ex-
hausted beings. These are exhausted children.
I see it in the life around me. My son, who is a Generator, has a particular connec-
tion to Projectors. His best male friends, three of them, are Projectors, his girlfriend
is a Projector, and he‟s a Generator. It‟s so obvious that he keeps them going late
into the night, early into the morning. Then you see them the next day and the Ge-
nerator is generating. He‟s all right. He doesn‟t lack for any energy. And I look at
these Projector kids and I tell them, they‟re exhausted, just riding on this wave. And
they‟re not designed for it at all. No other Type suffers from more sleep disorders
and energy problems than Projectors, they just do.

LECTURE TWO
Type and Strategy
If you come into the world with an undefined Sacral you‟re not here to work. So it
already tells you something about your capacities, energy-wise. And if you‟re a Pro-
jector you have to see that being able to rest and being able to have proper rest is
something that is enormously important to the physical life. How important it is for
Projectors not to be dragged to the point of exhaustion. How important it is for
them. It‟s like having a Projector child and a Generator child, and the Generator
child you can‟t give a bedtime to. But the Projector child you give them an early
bedtime. You tell them that they don‟t have to go to sleep, just get into bed, read a
book, listen to music, watch something, and relax.
Human Design is for Children
If we don‟t teach our Projector children the beauty of their gift and how they can
take that bitter taste out of their mouth—all Projector children come into the world to
be a success. They do, truly. And so quickly that becomes bitterness for them. You
can see that everything about bringing Type and Strategy into the world, I‟ve had to
do this through adults, but it‟s for children. It‟s only an adult that I say, “You have
to go through a seven year deconditioning process. You have to have some kind of
cellular regeneration. You have to unload all that stuff.” But that‟s a burden al-
ready. And for many, psychologically it‟s very difficult to unburden oneself from the
deep conditioning that one has experienced in one‟s life. This knowledge is for child-
ren.
You can see the fragility of Manifestor and Projector children. They are truly fragile.
By the way, Generators are poorly raised, but they are not fragile. They are the life
force. They‟ll plow through a whole lifetime of frustration. They do all the time. But
the fragility that is there in the non-Sacral and that you have to get to them early,
that it‟s so important to get to them early.
I don‟t want to suggest that you don‟t pay attention to the adults. As a matter of
fact, it‟s the only way you can save the children. But it‟s about realizing what this
knowledge is actually about. It is knowledge that you‟re supposed to be able to give
to your children when they come into the world. In other words, it‟s foundation
knowledge. It‟s like learning how to read and write. You learn about yourself and
you learn how to operate correctly as yourself. And you‟re nurtured and you‟re
guided by the forces that are responsible for you in your incarnation. It‟s not about
trying to heal beings that have been deeply conditioned and have suffered and all of
that is deeply ingrained in them, that they are in relationships that are incorrect, and
on and on and on and on. It really is about kids.
My thing for adult Projectors is study. It‟s why Jovian has a Projector endowment
because no other Type has more responsibility to investigate and study this know-
ledge than Projectors. And for the Projector adult, in fact, the very study, much
more than their Strategy and Authority that takes time to mature in their process,
that the study itself is so liberating for them. It just is. They are able to put into
perspective what has happened to them in their life.

They‟re able to understand for the first time what their mechanism is. And that is
something that through the self-recognition opens up the possibility for the Projector
that they can see that life does not have to be something that is bitter. That there
is, in fact, the potential in them for success and that they need to simply master the
process.
And with Projectors in my life, what I do is I encourage them to study deeper and
deeper. It‟s so healing for them. But in the end, we have to see that we have to
make sure that when we know adults who have Projector children, or we have Pro-
jector children in our lives, that we do everything in our power to awaken their at-
tention to the mechanics, because that for them, giving them the gift of truly being
able to recognize, that is what will be transforming in their lives.
The Reflector
I don‟t want to leave out Reflectors. I always give them short shrift, this 1% of hu-
manity. But then again, 1% of humanity is really 70 million people. It‟s a lot; there
are a lot of them in the world. They are so different that it‟s almost the „Reflector
Design System‟, instead of the
Human Design because they are
R R R so different. We tend to look,
that is, those of us that have any
OOO
kind of Definition, we tend to look
TTT
at all that openness and say,
CCC
“Oh, my,” because our openness
EEE
brings that to us. Yet, it only
LLL
brings that to us because it is a
FFF
counterpoint to our Definition.
EEE
Openness is not a counterpoint to
RRR
anything, in that sense, for the
Reflector. They are open. They
are quintessentially open.
And there is some nice irony in
that. That is, while they are to-
tally open in the way in which
their body graph operates, that
their aura itself, this is the Teflon.
This is the aura where you just
touch the surface. This is a sampling aura. As a matter of fact, Reflectors are de-
signed specifically to be impacted by the program, much more than the impact that
comes from the aura of other human beings.
Again, like the Manifestor, Manifestor and Reflectors auras will keep people away un-
less they insist. It‟s just something to understand about them. It‟s not like you
can‟t get in there and influence them in terms of aura-to-aura contact—the typical

Type and Strategy
partnership chart—it‟s not like they‟re blocking that off. You can get in if you get
past their protection system.
And when you‟re dealing with a Reflector, the Reflector would rather be in the wind
of the program that moves its Reflector sail in its life than to be caught up in what
happens to them when they have to deal with the other. And in many ways, be-
cause of the mystical importance of Reflectors, is that Reflectors are here to take in
the program and measure it against the sample of humans that they meet.
Reflectors have a different role in this life. They work in a different time frame. Its
common Type knowledge that Reflectors, in their decision making process, need to
wait out a full cycle of the moon. It‟s very different; a very different time frame.
They have a very different way of processing information.
And the moon is important for them because obviously, because of all of their open-
ness, the moon goes around the wheel the fastest of all the objects and it means
that in a lunar cycle all the possibilities of Definition in their chart. So when the
moon is in the 48, or when the moon is in the 57, or when the moon is in the 10,
and so forth and so on, that they have a regular cycle—14 times a year approx-
imately—of lunar activations that go through and highlight their mapping in a certain
ritual, one thing after the other. So they may be Splenic followed by being Throat
dominated or G dominated or Emotional. In other words, they go through a specific
cycle.
But, as children, it is so difficult for them. They‟re so absorbed. After all, the Reflec-
tor is not here to be absorbed and overwhelmed by the physical human domain. And
yet, as children, they are. Of course, this is the only Type that automatically comes
into the world with an undefined G. It comes into the world not knowing if it‟s in the
right place with the right beings. And it‟s something to understand about all Reflec-
tor incarnations that these are special forces in the day-to-day life in the nature of
being that are absolutely essential but have very, very weak connections to the
forces that bring them into the world.
It‟s difficult for them; very difficult for them as children. They need to be in the mid-
dle and not necessarily approached. To raise a Reflector correctly, that‟s quite a
journey. The beauty for the Reflector is that almost all Reflectors that I know find
this intimacy with the program as they mature. In other words, more and more they
become aligned to the world that we live in. In fact, Reflectors are more aligned to
the world we live in than anyone else, in the sense that because humanity is not-self
and because humanity operates as a puppet on the string of the program, that no
one is more deeply connected to what the strings are and what‟s attached than the
Reflector.
It‟s why, now for example, on Jovian Radio there is a Reflector doing the neutrino
forecast. It is their potential; it is their gift. The most important thing in meeting
Reflectors and particularly in meeting adult Reflectors, because adult Reflectors can
really be helped, it is much easier to help an adult Reflector that has been through
the conditioning of family life than just about any other Type. And the moment you

introduce to them the obvious of their mechanics, that everything about what
they‟ve been through immediately falls into place. And they begin a long process.
And like the Projector, it is a theme of non-energy Types that knowledge is essential
for them. They have to learn. Where for the Projector the study of the knowledge
has to be very broad, in other words, they have to go very deep over the full spec-
trum, for the Reflector it‟s different. My advice when I deal with adult Reflectors is
to make sure they get themselves a computer program so that they can have an
ephemeris in which they can draw out for themselves their cycle, watch it carefully,
see how the program influences them. In other words, they need to understand the
way the transit field operates and the impact of the transit field on them.
Surprisingly they do not need, for example, to have any kind of explanation of what
the planets do, or what planets are like. The reality is that the Reflector has an abili-
ty to learn all these things themselves just by being tuned into the program and tak-
ing it in into their natural receptivity to the program. Out of that will come their own
realization and their own depth of knowledge. So, for the non-energy Types, infor-
mation, knowledge, is something that can be very healing, can be something that
can be truly nurturing for them as they slowly comes to grips with their Strategy and
Authority.
It‟s been nice to share the basics with you. But I want to leave you with one thing.
There are those that think that Strategy and Authority and the deep focus that Hu-
man Design has on Strategy and Authority is a kind of slogan that too much informa-
tion, too much emphasis I should say is placed on Strategy and Authority. I want to
tell you something. We cannot emphasis it enough. It is what it‟s all about. As I
said, the science is wonderful. The knowledge is beautiful and it can be deeply en-
tertaining, let alone revealing to probe the knowledge. But it‟s not what it‟s all
about.
I know so many people who in the study of knowledge miss the truth. The truth
here is how you operate. If you operate according to your Strategy and your Au-
thority this is what changes the life. It‟s the only thing that changes the life. And
it‟s the message that will always be the message of this knowledge: Strategy and
Authority. All of you, wherever you are from early morning California to Australia at
dinnertime, you all have a good day. I look forward to seeing you next week. Bye
for now.

Lecture Three
Personality and Design
Ok, we‟re off and running. We have an interesting one today. I guess what I like
about the basics is that they‟re everything in Human Design. When you really grasp
the basics it opens up so many possibilities for the way in which you can see the
nuances. Personality and Design is a bedrock of Human Design. It is in fact what
makes Human Design so unusual.
The Phoenicians
I‟ll tell you a story; it‟s always nice to tell a story. My mystical process began with
me disappearing from North America and ending up on this little island in the Medi-
terranean, which at that time wasn‟t such a big deal and not something that I had
ever heard of before. I never knew about the existence of Ibiza. One of the inter-
esting historical things about this island is that it was/has been conquered by 11 or
12 different civilizations.
One of the earliest settlers on the island was the ancient Phoenicians. They were
people of Levant, somewhere around what we would call Lebanon today. They were
an extraordinary people. They were seafaring, trading people. Being that they
emerged on the Mediterranean they ultimately traveled the southern part of the Me-
diterranean, conquering all along North Africa, and eventually in their journeys dis-
covering the Balearic Islands.
So, they settled here in Ibiza. The very foundations of the central town here on the
island, which is a national heritage site, it is the walled city of the old town of Ibiza.
The original foundations were carved out of cliffs on a part of the island by the Phoe-
nicians. They left many remnants here. Where I had ultimately my mystical expe-
rience right behind the ruin that I was living in at the time was an old Phoenician
step-down well.
The Phoenicians were an extraordinary people. For example, the alphabet, or at
least the Western alphabet, what we call or refer to as the Western alphabet can go
back and be directly derived from the Phoenicians. They were a trading people; they
needed a way to calculate things. The world is a business, even then. Out of that
came a written language system, an alphabet system that we all took.
One would think that given they had such a profound influence, their gods ended up
all over the Mediterranean, obviously the alphabet became something that was rec-

ognized as a very important contribution to civilization and everybody jumped on the
bandwagon. But there was something about them that was ignored, totally ignored.
As a matter of fact, unless you‟re a history buff you don‟t even find it out. What was
extraordinary about the Phoenicians was that they believed that every human being
had two souls. They are the only culture that ever existed on this planet that had
such a belief that we were endowed with two souls and there were twin burial
grounds. There was a burial ground for the soul of the body and there was a burial
ground for the soul of the spirit.
What was so curious for me about all of that was after I had my mystical experience,
obviously the bedrock of the mystical experience was that the biverse is a duality,
that we are a duality, that we are endowed with binary crystals of consciousness. I
think it was ten years after that that somebody I knew on the island had been writ-
ing a history of the island and had given me the first edition that was published.
That‟s where I discovered that. It was an awe-inspiring moment for me, this seren-
dipity of this experience taking place; I was within footsteps of this old Phoenician
well.
We are a Binary
So many things emerged out of
the understanding that we are a
binary. It‟s like the continual at-
tempts by people in astrology to
assume that Human Design is as-
trological, which it is not. It‟s such
an obvious, and you can see the
obvious in the dynamic of this im-
age in that is there as an illustra-
tion. That is, there is no cross if
there is only a single calculation.
In our understanding of the single
calculation, it‟s what we call the
calculation for the Personality
which means that there is an
enormous amount of information;
not simply the Design information
that is not there, but in fact the
open centers and the potential of
the not-self that is going to
emerge that is not there.
What emerges out of the duality is a multidimensional being, a holistic being. And it
gives us an advantage for the first time not only to be able to see the unconscious,
which in itself is remarkable, but our ability to put the Personality in its place; in oth-
er words, to be able to see the limitation, truly the limitation of the Personality.

LECTURE THREE
Personality and Design
As a binary consciousness, to recognize that there is a fundamental tension that is
always going to exist between the „this and that‟ that are the components of what we
are. We have three different ways, in essence, that we look at a Design. Here is the
familiar configuration and this is the Design that we‟re going to be looking at today.
When we look at this, obvious we have these two different zones. And it‟s very im-
portant to recognize these zones as truly separate.
One of the interesting things about the educational process in Human Design when I
first began, there was not yet a computer program and the kinds of things that facili-
tate easy calculation, and so forth. At the point where we finally had a calculating
program, just the calculating program, not a drawing program, I began to work with
students. The first thing that my students had to have in their supplies was a red
pen and a black pen because I made all these photocopies of bodygraphs. In the
early years they were
all still copies of the
original drawings and
students would have to
color them in. Because
of the fact that we were
going to have situations
where we were going to
have activations as
here, for example, with
Uranus both being in
the 31 that we were
going to have prepare
for the fact that we
could have these com-
binations. It was ob-
vious that the first color
that had to be drawn in
was going to be the De-
sign.
The early students of
Human Design had the experience that I always had which was one that was re-
markably alive as an experience. That is, you‟d start drawing in somebody‟s graph.
And you‟d draw it in gate by gate, channel by channel, color in center by center.
You‟d go from the Design first and then suddenly you would put the Personality in
and the whole being would begin to emerge. It was an extraordinary process.
As much as I love technology, and I‟m a great lover of technology, it is the most im-
portant ally that Human Design has, that was one thing lost to technology that in
many ways is unfortunate. I‟m not at a place in my career where I deal with new-
comers. The opportunity to be able to remind them that the reason we divide these
graphs into Design and Personality is so that you can go through that process and
you can look at the building of this. And at the same time see the duality itself.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

The Design
Let‟s begin where we would begin if we were drawing it in. Obviously, here we are
looking at the Design. In looking at this, the first thing we talk about when we talk
the Design is that this is the bio-inheritance. This is what we‟ve inherited from most-
ly our grandparents. We know that genetically we have more in common with our
grandparents than we do with our parents, hence the joke that grandparents and
grandchildren love each other because they have an enemy in common.
So, what we‟re looking at is what we‟ve inherited from our particular genetic line, our
particular family tree. We‟re looking at something else. We‟re looking at a way of
understanding that despite the brilliance of Freud and Jung, that their concept of the
unconscious was a combination of the Design and the openness that leads to the
not-self. In other words, within their way of perceiving mind, it was impossible be-
cause they did not have the mechanics to understand that they were lumping to-
gether two very different things from each other. This is something that only when
you see the holistic bodygraph can you talk about openness. And only when you see
the holistic bodygraph does the not-self emerge, which is, in fact, the driving force
that motivates the mind. Freud‟s famous comment about what does woman want,
the motivation that is moving the mind was something he couldn‟t grasp.
The unconscious they could get a hold of that, that is, part of that unconscious be-
cause in fact it was hardwired. That‟s what you‟re looking at here. You‟re looking at
hardwiring. In fact, in many ways when you‟re looking at both the Design and the

Personality and Design
Personality you‟re looking at the work of the Design to establish the parameters of
what the whole is going to be, because after all it is all about the vehicle. And the
Personality, in essence, is nothing more than our reference point to our self-reflected
consciousness.
Here, looking at the Design what you‟re actually seeing is the hardwired attributes of
differentiation that the holistic mind has no access to. So it‟s you—it‟s hardwired—
it‟s not like the openness that‟s not you that influences the way in which you think,
the way in which you make decisions. In fact, this is the hardwiring, and if you tune
into it, in that sense, what we do through Strategy and Authority, that is you have
the ability to operate correctly out of the vehicle itself.
The 7th Gate: An Unconscious Administrator
What does it mean? When I do introductory readings, one of the things I always re-
fer to about the Design is that this is where you see traits. Think about this person
and let‟s look at just simply the Definition that‟s here. We have an unconscious De-
finition in the 31/7. We say earlier, by the way, because of the Uranus, there is a
Personality aspect to the 31, but the whole channel functions as an unconscious
channel. And the deep unconscious part, because there is going to be a conscious
31, and obviously they‟re both
Uranus‟s, the deep uncons-
cious part is this 7.
This 7 is a role. And we can
see what the role is; it is the
6th line role of the administra-
tor. So here is this being and
this being has a trait. The
trait is that they are an un-
conscious administrator. Now,
they don‟t think of themselves
that way. This is the hard-
wired differentiation that the
holistic mind has no access to.
So they don‟t think about
themselves this way.
But what happens to them in
their life is that what you have you‟re always putting into the other. And this person
is always putting their unconscious 7, obviously the Definition, into the other. And
when the other takes that in and puts it back out, they‟re saying to this person,
“You‟re always trying to arrange everything. You‟re a very good administrator,” and
this person thinks, “What is it they see in me?” The first time they hear it they don‟t
necessarily believe it. “That‟s not who I think I am. I don‟t think of myself as an
administrator, I think of myself as a hero adventurer,” or whatever it happens to be.
But they don‟t think of themselves as an administrator.

But then it goes on, not one person, not two, not three, not four, but years and
years and years of people seeing that in them, and them beginning to accept, “That
must be a part of me. That must be some aspect of me.” And they begin, if they‟re
relatively healthy, to trust that that is a consistent, that it‟s a constant, that it‟s al-
ways there for them. But it‟s not like the mind has access to this. And it certainly
doesn‟t have access to this while it is functioning.
Roads and Tunnels
I mentioned my fondness for technology. In 1999 I actually did my first internet
teaching. These were pre-prepared kinds of animated PowerPoints and I can re-
member how excited I was that that would actually get up on the internet and
people could gain access to it, which wasn‟t that easy. It was very primitive in those
days. But it was called Roads and Tunnels. And Roads and Tunnels is still available
in the States. It was one of my favorite works on the Personality and the Design,
and I love that terminology.
When I look at the bodygraph, and this is something very basic in Human Design
and it‟s something that everyone who enters into this knowledge should be aware of,
that is, this is a visual science. We are learning how to see and we‟re learning how
to see a matrix, and we‟re learning how to analyze and understand a matrix. When I
look at the G Center it‟s a kind of a map for me. It‟s just a mapping. It‟s just about
being able to look at that map and being able to see what‟s going on.
And at the very basis of that map is that we have two kinds of transmission/ com-
munication systems. We have our roads, which is the Personality, where everything
is on the surface. And we have the tunnels. Of course, this is the Design. When
you think of a Design as a tunnel, it‟s actually a very profound way of grasping what
happens to us as our Design operates. In other words, we don‟t know what‟s going
on until it concretizes. We have no idea what it is until it concretizes.
So, you‟re a 31/7 and you‟re this administrating leader with your influence. You
have no idea when it‟s going to come out, how it‟s going to come out and the mo-
ment it‟s there it‟s there, no preparation. You just don‟t know. Of course, when you
look at anybody‟s Design and I mean their Human Design, it is the Design part of
them that makes them uncomfortable. It is the openness that destroys their pur-
pose. But it‟s the Design that makes them uncomfortable.
Think about the person who is emotionally defined at the unconscious level only.
Here you have somebody who cannot identify, cannot feel, see, watch, and be a part
of the shifting of their wave. Suddenly it just goes from this to that. They don‟t
know why. They‟ve had no preparation. It‟s suddenly just there. The Design can be
something that is very uncomfortable.

LECTURE THREE
Personality and Design
For us, in being able to interpret this information, this mapping, to be able to under-
stand it is to be able to open up a place of acceptance. It‟s much easier for the mind
to accept the hardwired differentiation of the unconscious than it is for the mind to
accept the not-self and its sway over the mind‟s decision making process. That‟s re-
ally difficult. Remember that every aspect of openness that you have, because of
the genetic imperative, is determined to be attracted to what it is not.
Differentiation
Of course, the one thing one can say about the unconscious is that one may not
have access to the unconscious, but it is us and it is very much a part of our diffe-
rentiation. As a matter of fact, it is the key to our ability to differentiate. If you do
not differentiate in the body there is no differentiation possible from the mind.
Again, this is to really understand the dimensional difference between the contribu-
tion of the Design and the contribution of the Personality. If the contribution of the
Design, if we could put it on a scale, in so many ways it deeply outweighs the contri-
bution of the Personality. I don‟t mean to put down self-reflected consciousness and
its present level of awareness, but the reality is that all of that is only and can only
be a by-product of the vehicle: the body.
This whole thing about mind, yes, it‟s wonderful, but it‟s only wonderful because
brain functions. And if brain doesn‟t function, mind isn‟t wonderful. It just isn‟t.
The hardware has to be correct. And when we begin to come to grips with our un-
conscious, we begin to begin—there are a lot of beginnings there—to fill out the na-
ture of what it is to be us.
When you look at somebody‟s Personality, this is who they think they are. And for
them, everything you can say about the Personality is a point of identification. In
other words, they‟ll nod their head, “uh-huh,” or whatever it is. They‟ll go along with
it, they will be comfortable with it, and they will recognize it. It‟s a road; it‟s on the
surface.
But the Design is something different. One of the most important places of work in
doing any analysis is making sure that the impact and the presence of the uncons-
cious is understood. So that for the first time you have a human being, that though
they cannot identify consciously with the process of their unconscious, they can iden-
tify with the result of their unconscious where it always brings them. So this person
says, “Now, I know where these skills of mine come from. And when I was only
thinking that I didn‟t have this, I was always nervous that when the demands were
there for me to show my skills, I wouldn‟t be able to. Not only that, now I under-
stand why I‟ve always been looking for depth.”

Logic
I love logic. I love logic because it is the bedrock of what we are as a human being.
It is the essence, this 15/5, the Design of a single cell, the essence of life, is a pat-
tern in a flow. This is what life is all about. The thing about logic is when you take
in logical truths they resonate very, very deeply in your system, because we are log-
ical systems. And when you reveal to mind the logic of, in fact, what is actually
there, consistently there, and the way that it works that mind can take that in, it
takes an enormous weight off their shoulders because it brings them confidence in
areas where they never had confidence before.
If you look at your own Design and you look at the Design aspects of it, what you‟re
looking at, if you go back to your first Saturn half cycle, the first 14 or 15 years, all
of those places of uncertainty and insecurity had nothing to do with your openness,
but had everything to do with your unconscious. I‟m a 43/23. I have a purely un-
conscious mind. All the aspects of my mind are unconscious. There is no Personality
up there; none whatsoever, from the Throat up all unconscious. I never trusted my
mind.
I can remember as a kid being told—because I was doing very, very poorly in school,
I wasn‟t there very much. My parents found out and they had me tested. I had this
extraordinary IQ. They were telling me how smart I was and I had no idea. Truly, I
had no idea. I had no access to my mind. I had no access to depth. I have the 48th
gate unconscious, and no way of knowing.
It was always a point of uncertainty for me because there was no way of knowing
that it was there, no way of knowing that the intelligence was there, no way of mea-
suring it, no way of working with it. All I could do was watch what came out. It
wasn‟t until I went through my own process and began to look at my own Design
that this weight was taken away. You get the benefit of that. I open up any of these
classes that I teach at any time and I have no idea, none whatsoever what I‟m going
to say. It‟s all unconscious.
But I‟m no longer insecure with the nature of what it is to be me. This is part of my
hardwiring. This is simply the way that it works. The moment I can relax and sit
back and say, don‟t worry because it isn‟t going to do any good, don‟t try to figure it
out because you can‟t. Don‟t be concerned, just watch the movie, see what comes
out and that‟s it, because that‟s who you are, this is how it comes out. This is the
magic with coming to grips with your own Design, beginning to see these areas not
in a sense of anything other than, ok, I can now let go and trust this function.
The Genetic Imperative
The other thing is the mysterious pull, the genetic imperative. This genetic impera-
tive to be attracted to what one is not. Let‟s take the example again, because it‟s a
nice one, of this 16th gate. The 16th gate operates unconsciously so this person has

Personality and Design
no access to it. Somebody comes along with the 48th gate and makes an electro-
magnetic connection, this dynamic of attraction and repulsion, this spark. Here you
have depth meeting skill in the Channel of Talent, and this person is mysteriously
pulled into that. And yet, all along they don‟t know why. They don‟t know what‟s
pulling them to that. And in
many ways they do not even
know how they‟re being influ-
enced, they are simply at-
tracted to that force.
Of course, it becomes some-
thing that the mind gets dis-
turbed about. And when the
mind gets disturbed, which is
every other second in most
human beings, then the first
thing it does is explore the
not-self for some kind of rea-
son in order to make a deci-
sion that has nothing to do
with anything. Oh, the sweet
dilemma of what it is to be ig-
norant.
Insecurity Points
So, when you‟re looking at your Design you‟re looking at insecurity points in your
holistic psychology and how important it is to come to grips with those places and let
go. When you let go, what you‟ll notice is that you‟ll be able to watch it. You‟ll be
able to watch those components of yourself that you have no conscious access to.
But after all, they‟re integrated—here we‟re only looking at the Design in isolation—
they are integrated into the graph as a whole, they‟re integrated into what it is for
you to be a being. And no longer are they alien anymore. And you begin to expand
the potential of understanding who you are.
The Personality
The dilemma of understanding who we are is the Personality, because the domain of
the Personality is the self-reflected consciousness that operates out of the mind.
This is the true domain of the Personality. That domain is framed by the activations
that are there as Personality activations, because each and every one of these Per-
sonality activations is an aspect of who this Personality will think it is and base all of
its life on.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

Think about that. Every single activation is an aspect of who this Personality is going
to think they are, and is going to be the foundation upon which they are going to
make decisions in their life. And of course, those decisions are influenced by their
openness. In other words, there‟s no Design. It‟s not even in the equation. And of
course, obviously there is no consideration of the openness in the not-self. It is
simply the Personality operating out of these keys. You can see when you have Per-
sonality Definition, and here we have very strong Personality Definition, this is the
minor circuitry, the defense circuit, we have this complete movement of the 50/27,
the 59/6 [blue oval]. We have an Emotional Personality.
So, this being is an Emotional being. And they know they‟re an Emotional being.
They are a tribal being and boy do they ever identify with being a tribal being, be-
cause this is who they are. They are the defense circuit. They‟re there to defend the
tribe. They are the key to that. They see themselves in that way. And they see
that they‟re here in this life to find their purpose, their 28th gate [green circle & ar-
row] Personality Sun.
This is what they identify with. This is who, really truly who, this person thinks this
person is. I am the tribe. I am the core and the heart of the tribe. And when you

Personality and Design
think back to the Design, this unconscious collective identity to the Throat, here is
somebody‟s true identity is collective, in fact. But they have no conscious access to
that. And they don‟t necessarily see themselves as a leader. They see themselves
with the potential to influence. They have that 31st gate, the Uranus. But they see
themselves as this—I‟m this, this is what I am. And I have nothing else.
In a sense, and only in a sense, that‟s actually true. It‟s true because of the nature
of this Design is that we have an Emotional Generator. Of course, here we have
both the Type and the Authority, the Emotional Authority, so it is the Personality that
truly is here to make the decisions in the life. But of course, the Personality as it
speaks through the Sacral to the Emotional system as an Emotional Generator, not
the Personality as it‟s framed here in the mind making decisions based on the not-
self.
When we put it all together we end up with something different. It‟s neither this nor
that. The magic of Human Design is that it is the ultimate synthesis. It is this ex-
traordinary synthesis, the esoteric, the exoteric, the „this‟ and the „that.‟ And the
construct of the bodygraph is an extraordinary thing. And it is the melting pot. Of
course, the rave bodygraph is inherently dualistic. It is profoundly dualistic as a
transitional form.
The Monopole
The moment you take the Design and the Personality, all this is the agency of the
Magnetic Monopole. In the old language, if you want to look at rulerships, the De-
sign Crystal rules the De-
sign and the Personality
Crystal rules the Personali-
ty, so called, and the Mono-
pole, this “rulership” is of
the bodygraph. This is the
construct of the Monopole.
And the Monopole with its
power to only attract pulls
in these aspects together
and brings this all together
in the synthesis that we call
the bodygraph. So when
we‟re looking at the body-
graph you can‟t look at the
data any more. Forget this,
don‟t look at the data. I
mean, yes, obviously, the
data is important and we‟re going to look at the information and so forth and so on,
we know all that.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

But when the Design is over here [below, left side] and the Personality is over there
[below, right side], they‟re not the same as what they are in here [below, body-
graph]. You see that more radically in charts where you have electro-magnetic Defi-
nitions. For example, if there was a Definition here in the 48 [below, green arrow]
that was black, you would have one of those classic situations where something truly
new is emerging in that sense. This is what I call a quantum field. This is something
that is very, very different from the data itself, because we do not see the data with-
in the context of the graph. In other words, to just see the 31st gate and not know
that it is in the Throat and to not know its potential in that Throat is to not know
what becomes of this Design when it enters here [bodygraph]. When it enters here
it enters into a different dimension.
Openness in the Design
So, when you‟re looking at the bodygraph it‟s so important to see it as a bodygraph,
just as a bodygraph, because the most important thing you‟re looking for in the bo-
dygraph is to come up with the 3rd
element. This 3rd element is the
openness in the Design. And the
openness in the Design only emerges
through the agency of the Monopole.
It‟s something to consider.
So what we have in the bodygraph is
the synthesis of Design and Personali-
ty—two things—and we end up with
three. That‟s the configuration.
That‟s one of those classic wonderful
number stories—1 and 1 is 3—and
that‟s exactly the way it works here.
So in the quantum, what emerges the
moment you integrate the data into
the bodygraph is something new emerges. And of course, that thing that emerges is
obviously one of the most deeply influential aspects because it is the natural body-
graph field.
After all, the Design and the Personality come from either side. But the openness is
built into the way in which the whole graph operates. It is impossible to find a graph
without openness. Yes, you could, it‟s rare, but you do find people with nine centers
defined, but obviously they do not define all the channels and gates and whatever.
And to recognize that the bodygraph itself, that the most powerful influencing force
on the bodygraph, because it is the natural feel of the bodygraph, is the openness.
And this, of course, gives life its dynamic.
In other words, given the way in which our genetic story has evolved, this openness
drives us towards the other and drives us towards our bonding in order to reproduce,
in order to maintain the species. And at the same time we know that the by-product

of the power of the not-self being in an original aspect of the bodygraph is that it has
the power to homogenize us. In other words, to be able to bring us to a place in
which we are so deeply conditioned that we no longer have the possibility to live out
the differentiation that is actually there in our Design.
When we see Design and Personality integrated into the bodygraph we see the com-
ing together of the roads and the tunnels. In other words, we get to see the emer-
gence of a different kind of structure. And at the same time we also get to see
things that immediately tell us something.
So, let‟s go back to our example here, the classic
example of the upper part of this split. And in look-
ing at the upper part of this split, again going back
to this 7th gate which is unconscious, despite the fact
that the 31 is a conscious aspect, you can see clear-
ly that when you‟re looking at this Design if you say
Influence
to this person “You‟re a leader,” they don‟t believe
Leader you. If you say “You have influence,” they‟ll believe
you. But if you say they‟re a leader, they might ac-
cept—not believe you is actually not the right term—
they don‟t trust what you‟re saying, let‟s put it that
way. They may have heard that before, but they
just don‟t trust it.
A Split Definition
So when we have the Design
integrated into the bodygraph
as a whole, it‟s so important
for the being who is finding
out about themselves under-
stands the way that works.
And also understands that
they don‟t just have, for ex-
ample, these two conscious
voices—the 31 and the 8—this
voice that says “l lead or I
don‟t,” and this voice that
says, “I know I can make a
contribution or not.” But there
are these other aspects that
are there in the Throat. One
of the most interesting things
is the fact this is a Split Defini-
tion. We will get into that lat-

er as we go through concepts, but whenever you‟re looking at a Split Definition the
easiest way to join a split is, in fact, a deeper conditioning factor than the open cen-
ters themselves.
If you look at the condition of this particular Design you will see that there is one
here [blue arrow], this is a single Definition that will bring the Design together. You
have another one here, the 2nd gate [green arrow], another one here, the 46th gate
[purple arrow], another one
here, the 22nd gate [orange ar-
row], and another one here in
the 35th gate [teal arrow]. You
can see all of these many,
many ways, that‟s five different
ways in which this being‟s Split
Definition can be pulled.
In fact, those five ways, if you
string them out in a keynote,
you describe what this person
really wants. You describe what
drives them in this life. This is
somebody who wants to find
the direction to succeed with
depth in gaining progress
through social interaction. If
you mention that to this person in that way, they go, “Yeah, that‟s me, that‟s what I
want.”
The Quantum
When we‟re looking at Design and Personality everybody thinks that‟s the story. Our
talk of Profiles and nodes, and this planet and that planet, what do you have here
and there, and what line do you have, what‟s the line say, what‟s the information
about. But the most important thing when you first look at the bodygraph is to for-
get all that because you‟re looking at something else. You‟re not looking at data.
You‟re looking at the way in which the quantum forms, the way in which the graph
emerges.
The moment that you enter into this bodygraph is the moment you enter into a do-
main that is dominated not by the Design and the Personality, but is dominated by
the Monopole and the way in which this illusion is held together. And it is the open-
ness in the illusion that drives the whole movie. It drives it, it gives it its direction;
it‟s what Monopole does. It gives us our direction.
Of course, you can see the direction of this being. You can see what they want. You
can see what‟s going to move them. And it has nothing to do with their Design or

Personality and Design
their Personality activations. And you can see the way they‟re going to think. You
can see that they‟ve got something to prove, they want to be certain about their
concepts, they think about things that do not matter, they really want to get it over
with in a hurry, they want to move it along. Then you add all of that to the aspects
of the split that‟s defining their deepest attractive desire field and you can forget
about looking at their Design, this stuff that‟s activated.
Everything has to be seen in perspective. It‟s one of the lessons that I‟ve learned in
my process beginning last year in simply looking at the crystals and understanding
the crystals. The first thing you get to see is that‟s great that you can understand
them, but that‟s not the bodygraph. It‟s not the holistic life. It is an ingredient;
they‟re ingredients. And all of those ingredients are stirred into the pot by the Mo-
nopole and you get the bodygraph.
When you see Design and Personality within the bodygraph, you have to see very
clearly its place, that its dynamic and value as a force of differentiation is only some-
thing that can emerge if the being is correct. There is no other way. It isn‟t to say
that if this being is incorrect that they‟re not going to have their communal influence.
You bet they will. It‟s in their Design. But that communal influence is driven by the
splits and the not-self mind which means that whatever their communal influence is
going to be, it has nothing to do with what is correct, and everything to do with be-
ing conditioned, and being deeply conditioned.
I‟ve mentioned this many times before that when I began my professional work as
an analyst in the early 90‟s it was horrific for me. I would look at people‟s Designs
and look at their Design and Personality and see this extraordinary potential for dif-
ferentiation. Every human being is unique. There is all this incredible potential to
fulfill purpose, to live out the potential of one‟s cross and one‟s Design, to find one‟s
true inner Authority. And what did I see? The people who sat down beside me, all I
saw was the openness in their Design. Their minds caught up in their whole not-self
trip. The 50% of them that were Split Definitions lost in chasing the holy grail of the
gate they don‟t have. Beings that were so deeply homogenized that telling them
they have this Personality and that kind of Design, well, it takes time.
Strategy and Authority
The magic of Strategy and Authority is that it immediately takes you to your source
of what is different in you. And that source of what is different in you is part of the
quantum. It‟s not outside of it. It is the synthesis of your Personality and Design,
the way in which they are designed to work in unison in this illusion of your life. This
is your hardwiring, your Personality hardwiring, your Design hardwiring, and no illu-
sion in here, not in this context.
This is really what you can rely on, truly what you can trust, truly what makes the
difference in your life. So, the Personality, the mind as we know it, the mind has to
be awakened to its partnership with the Design, to begin to trust what is hardwired

in you that you don‟t have access to. To begin to fill out this understanding of your-
self, begin to fill out the full dimension of the bodygraph.
As education and Human Design is oriented, the living Design process, all of this is to
bring a deep understanding, a shattering to those who do not grasp that their life is
dominated by this Monopole force that brings about this openness that leads to the
depth of the conditioning that is there in them.
Design and Personality, if you look at them separately and you look at them as data,
they‟re fascinating. But no single aspect of data can be understood until it‟s inte-
grated into the holistic vehicle, to see it and understand it in terms of the life, and
for this person to come to grips with the fact that there is no point in them seeking
depth. They‟re only going to be manipulated and conditioned. They are going to get
a depth that may not, in fact, be of any value to them, and yet they will not know
that. They are simply seeking depth because it brings them together in this single
potential.
The direction, they don‟t know where the hell they‟re going. They pretend that
they‟re certain. But the direction they seek can be the deep conditioning, the same
conditioning they find in the depth that not simply gives them a direction that is right
for them, but in fact can send them in a direction that is deeply detrimental to them
or their community.
And success, the serendipity of being in right place at the right time, the potential
always in the 46th gate, the potential to succeed where others fail or fail where oth-
ers succeed. That‟s not who this person is. And progress [35th gate], out of crisis, is
not who they are.
The Chart of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
Do you know who this is? Obviously,
you don‟t. It‟s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,
the President of Iran. I‟m fairly com-
fortable with the data, though I‟m not
100% certain of the accuracy of the
time, but after going through the chart
myself I‟m relatively convinced that
this is the chart. It tells you a lot
about what happens to a human being
when you take what is the extraordi-
nary potential that lies there in the da-
ta base and then you see what hap-
pens when it gets integrated into the
Design and the moment it gets inte-
grated into the Design all the other
things emerge that distort the way in
which all of that is going to work.

LECTURE THREE
Personality and Design
What I wanted to give you today is a sense of the perspective. To see that our work
is about the bodygraph, this is the foundation of Human Design. I want you to think
of the bodygraph as a glyph. In other words, to see it as almost as a language, an
expression, in and of itself; to see it separate from the data, to be able to see it as a
living thing, to be able to understand that we are more than our activations.
Genetic Highlighting
This goes back to something very basic. One of the things I was mentioning before
the class started, I discovered the actual time when Watson and Crick realized they
had discovered DNA structure [February 21, 1953, noon, Cambridge, England]. Hu-
man Design is a science of differentiation deeply related to genetics and indebted to
genetics in the I‟Ching, in that sense.
When you‟re looking at the database there‟s something for you to grasp. You‟re not
looking at anything other than genetic highlighting. The bodygraph has all 64 gates.
It has all of the codons; it has the whole genetic matrix. What you see in your own
Design, what you see in the Personality, what you see in the Design, this is where
your genetics are highlighted. But every place that‟s open, it‟s not like you lack that
in your body; you‟d be dead. This represents receptors to those that are highlighted
in a different way.
If you want to think about the genetics in Human Design it‟s not so much at the da-
ta, it‟s looking at this incredible bodygraph. This is the story. Because what you see
in your bodygraph is the potential in you to be different from everyone else. And
what is unactivated in your bodygraph is everything else. It is the whole genetic
matrix; it‟s all there.
Here in the bodygraph we see our relationship to the genetic whole. We see our dif-
ference, how different we can be as an organism and how the whole has such power
over us, and so it should. It is the whole wheel that is the life configuration mechan-
ism. And we need to be connected to everything, but as ourselves. Not that what
we are not becomes who we are, but who we are becomes more and more perfected,
more and more differentiated as we progress in our process.
So, Personality and Design are extraordinary. But when you‟re looking at some-
body‟s Design, it‟s the bodygraph that tells you the story. This is the pallet; this is
the place where it‟s all laid out. This is the perfection. It‟s the most extraordinary
thing, this bodygraph.
A Story about Osho’s Chart
I started with a little story. I‟ll finish with one. I can remember when I was prepar-
ing to give my third analyst training here in Ibiza. I think it was 1993. I had my
drawings up, the blank bodygraph, no data field, just a big blank bodygraph. I had

them blown up and photocopied so they were a fairly large size. I took a number of
famous people that I had calculated and I drew them into these very large body-
graphs to use as illustrations.
In that era when I was living in Ibiza there was a lot of sannyasins here who were
the followers of Osho, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. It was one of the illustrations that I
had done. I had stood them up against the wall in my studio. I was doing some-
thing and one of my friends
Osho dropped by. He brought along
a friend of his, a young Italian
fellow. Actually the friend was
Alok Diaz. It was just after he
had had his first reading.
Alok and I had gone outside
and we were just chatting, talk-
ing about something. I came
into my studio and here was
this young Italian guy, I don‟t
remember his name, a very
sweet fellow. He was down on
his knees—I had put these
things on the floor—and he was
totally lost in the bodygraph of
Osho, who was his master. We
came in and we sort of giggled, it was a funny scene. He got up slowly rather wide-
eyed and all he could say was, “I could actually feel him.”
The bodygraph is an amazing thing. For me it is a piece a magic, truly magic. I un-
derstand the science of it, the mechanics of it. I‟ve been doing this a long time. But
I can never get over the fact that there was a Voice that told me how to draw it and
it is, as it stands on its own, an extraordinary thing. So, the bodygraph is what you
need to know. The information is great and it is wonderful to grasp detail, but to
understand a being, to be able to understand a chart, you have to understand the
bodygraph.

Lecture Four
The Magnetic Monopole and the G Center
We have a very interesting one today, because it‟s one of the core aspects of Human
Design and carries within it one of its most extraordinary mysteries. It‟s been my
great good fortune that in terms of the information of the revelation that I was giv-
en, so much in my own lifetime I‟ve been able to see verified at some level or anoth-
er. The whole basis of Human Design, the whole basis of being in a consciousness
program, the verification of the neutrino with mass, all of this leads to an ability for
us to be able to mechanically have a reliable way to look at the way in which we op-
erate, the way in which the world operates.
The Magnetic Monopole
One of the most essential components of all of this is the Magnetic Monopole. The
Magnetic Monopole is one of those elements that has yet to, in terms of the scientific
community, be realized for what it, in fact, actually is. I can remember when I be-
gan my process of introducing Human Design, neutrinos were not something that
had mass. Neutrinos were supposed mass-less. It took years for the scientific
community to catch up with that one. Maybe if I‟m lucky in my lifetime they‟ll figure
out what exactly the Magnetic Monopole is. They don‟t know. In essence it is the
answer to the question that, in fact, the scientific community today is trying to re-
solve.
Just to put physics into a very, very simple binary, we basically have a dualistic con-
cept now of what is called the universe, what I refer to as the biverse. That is, this
dualism between what we call relativity that is a way of understanding the dimensio-
nality of the world that was put forward by Einstein, and on the other side, quantum.
We have two very different ways in which we can see and verify through those dif-
ferent ways the universe that we look at. In other words, quantum within quantum
can be verified, and relativity within relativity can be verified. But there is, as yet,
no bridge between these two domains. In other words, there is no bridge between
the relativistic view of the universe and the quantum view.
This is the holy grail of higher physics. That is, to find some kind of unified prin-
ciple—unified field theory is one of the names it goes under—to find a way in which
one can integrate these two aspects. In many ways, it goes back to the very begin-
ning of the universe itself of the big bang. That is, the fact that we know that what
emerged from singularity was a basic binary, a binary in particle physics that we can
reduce to leptons and quarks. Ultimately, as we come down the line, as we get to

this point in the development of our intellectual capacity, we‟re actually in the same
place, just in the larger dimension of that duality. In other words, that we do have
these two different ways in which dimensionally the totality functions.
The thing that holds it all together is the mystery. What is the unified force? What
is it that brings this all together? For me, anyway, it‟s clear that this is the Magnetic
Monopole. In our discussion today we are basically going to look at this in a micro-
cosmic sense. In other words, we‟re going to look at the way in which the Magnetic
Monopole holds together the illusion of our lives. And not only the illusion of our
lives, but in holding us together, it literally creates the construct that we work with.
That is, the dynamics of the wheel and everything that is associated with it. The
Monopole is really a key element in any understanding of Human Design, or any un-
derstanding of the physics beyond that.
The Monopole and the Design Crystal
To begin with, this is a very, very old illustration.
It‟s one of the first glyphs that I drew in my expe-
rience, this glyph for the Monopole. Not neces-
sarily that I particularly understand it; what I do
Personality
understand is the eight that is inherent in it.
Crystal
What is so interesting for me from that perspec-
tive is the profound relationship that exits be-
tween the Magnetic Monopole and what we in De-
Design
sign call the G Center, or what we reference to as
Crystal
the potential of consistent or inconsistent identity.
We can also see two other elements that are here
in this illustration. That is, an illustration of the
Design Crystal and an illustration of the Personali-
ty Crystal. It is these three elements that are the
essence of how life, in a way, is projected, how it‟s
put out literally into the world. There is a very
profound relationship that exits between the De-
sign and the Monopole. When we think about that
it‟s an obvious in our language. That is, that the
Monopole is labeled with the keynote of the „driv-
er‟ and the Design Crystal is the „vehicle‟.
So, here we have the driver and the vehicle to-
gether. And in essence the driver and the vehicle
is everything. The driver and the vehicle is the
life. The thing about the Monopole and the Design
Crystal is that they have an extraordinary relationship to each other because Mono-
poles embed themselves, literally, into the Design Crystal. In other words, if we
could look into the schematic of this Design Crystal we would see that this form here

The Magnetic Monopole & the G Center
can fit into this crystal, a form and mold, however you want
to see that. In other words, it can just simply fit in. Personality
Crystal
Of course, the condition of the Design Crystal and the Mo-
nopole being together, that is, being one, being in that
bond, is that that is how they exist before incarnation. And
Design
that is what happens at the moment of death. That is, at
Crystal
the moment of biological death, biological death is signaled
by the Design Crystal going down this central channel,
going down through what we know is the 43/23 and the
8/1, going into the G Center, aligning again, bonding again
with the Monopole and then continuing the journey outward
until it leaves the body and this is death.
So, there is a very special relationship that exists between
this Design Crystal and the Monopole. We know the di-
lemma then, of the Personality. That is, the dilemma of the
Personality is that it assumes that it does things, that it as-
sumes that it is the driver, that it assumes that it owns this
vehicle and can do what it likes with this vehicle. And in
fact, the only true capacity that the passenger has is just simply to look out the win-
dows.
The Personality Crystal Entering into the Vehicle
So when we‟re looking at this configuration, what I really want you deeply to think
about is this relationship that is there between the Design Crystal and the Monopole.
I don‟t think any of you actually—maybe those of you out in Australia had a chance
today to listen to my Monday heretic on the radio today. One of the things that I
was talking about, the heresy that I was talking about, is the fact that in Human De-
sign that the moment that being human comes into existence is the moment that the
Personality Crystal enters the vehicle. That is 88 degrees of the Sun before birth, or
about 88 or 89 days.
According to almost all religious traditions, the so-called soul, which in Design is
what we refer to as the Personality Crystal, that that so-called soul is there at the
moment of conception. Of course, this is one of the deepest fallacies about what it is
to be a human being. It is the Personality Crystal that gives us our humanness.
That is, it is the Personality Crystal and its relationship with the vehicle that the
quantum of this, or the holistic view of that, gives us our human nature. There is no
human nature before the point in which the Personality Crystal enters into the ve-
hicle.
So as an example, when we think about what my discussion was today about stem
cell research, or first trimester abortions, and we look at the uproar all of that causes
because it‟s murder and you‟re killing a human life, and so forth and so on. And that
the potential cures that are possible through being able to work with stem cells are

DESIGN CONCEPTS

going to be denied simply because you harvest a stem cell that is 18 hours old and
you consider that to be human life. Obviously, this is a problem that is connected
with religions and the way in which the homogenized not-self looks at things.
It‟s one of the great jokes to recognize that humanity does not know when they first
become human and does not know when it stops. In other words, the assumption
that life begins with conception and ends with death. But
we know that the Personality Crystal arrives late in the ve-
Personality
hicle and leaves late after death, and the variable of the
Crystal
lingering of the Personality Crystal up to 72 hours after
death.
Design So there is a deep misunderstanding. And that misunders-
Crystal tanding is again pointed directly at the central part of my
theme right now, which is this relationship between the De-
sign Crystal and Magnetic Monopole. They are there before
the Personality Crystal ever arrives. They build the vehicle,
they build the fetus, they build a mechanism, they build a
bio-mass, a very sophisticated bio-mass, but nonetheless,
what they‟re building is a bio-mass.
It‟s only at this point when the Personality Crystal enters
into the vehicle that that bio-mass takes on what is its
transcendent nature. That is, it becomes the potentiality of
a human being, only then. But it says how limited the in-
volvement is of the Personality. In other words, when you
understand the nature of Design and its relationship to the Monopole and the build-
ing of the vehicle in the first 88 degrees from the point of conception, that is, the 10
stages of conception in the first 88 degrees, all of the potential of what that being
might be is being created without any input from the Personality. It‟s not like the
Personality is in any way an architect, is in any way able to influence in any sense
what is going on in terms of the vehicle that it‟s going to be delivered and the driver
that is going to move it through its life.
This is one of the places where you have to begin to grasp that the rule of mind, that
is, out of the Personality Crystal we get the identity that we call the thing we think of
as ourselves, what we are identified with. It begins to be very deep and very terrible
black humor to assume that this mind is in charge of anything. The fact that it as-
sumes that it is in charge, that it assumes that it can control the destiny of its life,
that it assumes it is the life when in fact it isn‟t; it is just the passenger to the life.
Not only that, but the Personality and the potential of the Personality is limited by
the refinement of the vehicle. If the vehicle does not produce a really good brainpan
then you‟re not going to have the full advantages and potential of the Personality to
reflect consciousness because it is going to be limited by the vehicle. So, when
we‟re talking about the Monopole, which is our central theme, to begin to understand
that the Monopole transcends in so many ways the Personality. That is, the Mono-
pole, in essence, is an instrument that creates the potential of the whole drama.

LECTURE FOUR
The Magnetic Monopole & the G Center
The Neutrino
I do love illustrations and for a whole semester last year I kept on drawing this par-
ticular illustration by hand and not very well, to try to give students an understand-
ing of the way in which the whole information process operates. So, in looking at
this illustration here, first of all, the neutrino stream—in thinking about the neutrino
stream and the neutrino stream going through the crystal, what I want you to think
about is its tiny-ness for a moment and to imagine that it is one neutrino at a time
that just gets in here. In other words, the relationship is probably 3.5:1, something
like that, in terms of the size of the crystal to what a single neutrino would be rela-
tive to. So, we‟re talking about very, very tiny things to begin with.
But let‟s think about this process. We have a neutrino with mass. We have a neu-
trino with mass that is going to bang into something with mass. In other words, this
is not something that is porous. So what happens is that because the neutrino can
go through anything—a neutrino could go through a 10,000 million mile wide lead
wall like a hot knife through butter—this neutrino is going to go through this materi-
al, but in meeting this material the first thing is that there is a boundary. This is a
point at which the neutrino itself meets the surface, or meets the boundary of the
crystal.

Crystal Entry Frequency: Base
As we know, when anything meets anything there is a vibration that is given off,
there is a frequency. You can see this frequency is labeled Crystal Entry Frequency.
This crystal entry frequency is what we call Base. Now, everything about science is
about measuring frequencies. Like the sound, it‟s all about frequencies and all about
giving those measurements a name, a number, whatever the case may be, in order
to codify them. We could talk about Colors in terms of numbers, too. After all,
every Color gives off a frequency. It is, after all, just a number, in a sense.
Here what we call—that is the name that we give to this specific frequency that is
given off—when this neutrino stream hits this crystal we call this Base and we interp-
ret frequency as Base. And of course, as you well know, or most of you know, that
we have five Bases, so in fact there are five different variations of frequency that can
exist from the interaction of a neutrino with a boundary of the crystal.
Inner Frequency: Tone
The second stage is that the neutrino is going to go through the crystal. And every-
thing within the crystal, the domain within there, the architecture inside the crystal,
this is the Inner Frequency. And this inner frequency is what we refer to as Tone.
Because this is the frequency that takes place within the crystal, and understand that
every single being has a unique crystal—they‟re unique, each one. That central area
that is there within the physical crystal, this is where the information is for the build-
ing of this aspect of the whole. In other words, this is where the inner architecture is
that ultimately can emerge on the surface. This is where all the core information is
for building this vehicle.
Crystal Exit Frequency: Color
The concentrated focus of the architec-
ture is to build a vehicle that is cogni-
zant. In other words, to build a vehicle
that can display cognition. And when
that neutrino exits, when it fires
through, goes through the inner envi-
ronment, as it leaves there is this leav-
ing—exiting—frequency, the Crystal Exit
Frequency that we refer to as Color. So
this is the frequency as it leaves.
In looking at this illustration, this is the
way neutrino information programs us.
And you can see in that very program-
ming that the single piece of information
or the bit of information that as it moves

LECTURE FOUR
The Magnetic Monopole & the G Center
through it has many, many possibilities of display that comes out at the other end.
In other words, all the variations, what we call in PHS and Rave Psychology as
chains, there are chains of information so that that single neutrino, despite the fact
that it has a single bit of information, that that single bit of information is what goes
through with any of these possibilities, of one of the five Bases, one of the six Tones,
one of the six Colors until it emerges.
The Monopole Begins as a Binary
The Monopole is an extraordinary thing. For me it is the magic, the magic in the
middle of all of this. From the very beginning I had a very basic binary description of
the Monopole because the Monopole is very much a 2-4-8 thing. The Monopole be-
gins as a binary. It‟s interesting when you think about that because it‟s a mon-o-
pole. But the way in which the mon-o-pole works is that influences us in two very
specific ways.
That is, it holds us together in the illusion of our separateness. Now what does that
actually mean? The Design and the Personality are two very different things. They
have different dates, they have different data, and they function in totally different
ways. There‟s an enormous difference between the vehicle and the passenger. And
they do not have a natural relationship to each other. The ordeal of the sacred mar-
riage is insight. It‟s coming to grips with these two different things being able to ex-
ist with each other.
The way in which that is accomplished is that the Magnetic Monopole is a magnetic
that only attracts. That is, it is a mon-o-pole. So because of this attraction capacity
what the Monopole does is that it grabs onto the Color frequency. This is what
makes Color so important. It grabs onto the Color frequency and it pulls from those
two frequencies these two things together into the holistic whole that we call a body-
graph which we call a human being. This is the Monopole holding us together in the
illusion of our separateness. So that‟s its first job.
Its second job is that it‟s like the arm of a streetcar in that it connects us to our spe-
cific geometry. And that specific geometry emerges out of the quantum. We know
that. For example, the difference between being a Right Angle and a Left Angle can
only be derived once you bring the two elements together and integrate them into
the bodygraph. Only then do you get such a thing as a Profile. Only then do you
begin to see trajectory. Only then do these things emerge.
Color and the Monopole
So, all of this is a by-product of the work of the Monopole. Think about it. The hold-
ing together is a constant act, a millisecond-by-millisecond-by-millisecond act that is
not superglue, so one of the things that I want you to grasp—and it‟s a sidebar but
it‟s something that you need to really think about, is to understand that. Everything
about Color and Color is enormously important because Color is our underlying moti-

vation at the Personality level and our underlying physical determination at the De-
sign level.
One of the dilemmas of Color is that the reason that Color can be pulled by the Mo-
nopole is that Color, in a sense, is unstable enough that it can be pulled. And Color
is always, as a result, something that is subject to transference. In other words,
when a human being isn‟t operating correctly, rather than the exit frequency being
their correct Color, that the exit frequency is a transferred Color and what is being
pulled together is not them at all. And that‟s really something to grasp.
The only way that a human being can even begin to have the Monopole pull together
what is the expression of their correctness only begins with Strategy and Authority,
there is no other way. There is certainly no way with the mind; none whatsoever.
And the moment that you grasp that what‟s being pulled together is subject to
change, in other words, for the vast majority of humanity being held together in the
illusion of their separateness is being held together in the illusion of being not-self.
Their true potential, who they really are, is not what the Monopole is holding togeth-
er. And it will only be able to hold together what is correct when it is operating with-
in the vehicle as a whole, when it is operating correctly.
The Monopole is very profound in the way in which it operates. That mon-o-pole al-
so is that force that latches into what is the direction for us. One of the aspects of
Design Color is about the correctness of environments. But you cannot be pulled in-
to the correct environment if what‟s being pulled in is not the correct environment if
it‟s in transference. The way you look at anything, the motivation that underlies
your Personality that is being driven incorrectly all your life simply because the ve-
hicle is not operating correctly. So, the Monopole is going to hold together the illu-
sion it can and maintain us to a geometry in which, if we are not operating correctly,
we never gain the advantages that are there.
The G Center: Two Crosses
When you take this out of the physics and you
begin to enter into understanding how the Mo-
nopole puts its capacity, its abilities to work
within the graph, the first thing you come to is
having to deal with the G Center. When you
think about the G Center, first and foremost,
you have to think about the two crosses that
are there in the G Center. Those two crosses
as Incarnation Crosses are unusual, they‟re
anomalies, because as Incarnation Crosses
they have all four of their arms in the same
center.
So, when you‟re looking at the Cross of the
Vessel of Love [red gates] and you‟re looking

The Magnetic Monopole & the G Center
at the Cross of the Sphinx [black gates], you‟re looking at two crosses in which all
four of their arms are in the same center. These two crosses are really extraordi-
nary. When you look at them simply as two crosses, you start with the Sphinx and
when you look at the Sphinx [black gates] what you‟re looking
at is the Cross of Direction. This is simply an expression of the
attribute of the Magnetic Monopole to align us to what is our
correct direction in this life.
When you look at the Vessel of Love [red gates] and you think
about holding us together in the illusion of our separateness,
that everything about the Vessel of Love is about how this ve-
hicle in its separateness integrates into the world around it, a
direction of social interaction in the world itself. These two
crosses are not just simply unusual because they are crosses that are entirely within
the context of the G, but I want you to see what this really means.
The Lower Trigrams
If you look, you‟ll notice that I have given the lower trigram—these are lower tri-
grams of the eight gates of the G Center and one of the best meditations in Human
Design. Behind me in my studio where I‟m recording from I have a huge illustration
of the wheel. I‟ve been looking at this wheel for nearly 20 years. There are still
moments when I catch myself caught staring at the magic of this Mandala. It is an
incredibly magical Mandala. And when you‟re looking at the eight gates of the G
Center, understand that it is the G Center that, in essence, creates the whole Manda-
la, gives the entire Mandala its order.

The first thing to notice about these lower trigrams, here we‟re looking at the lower
trigram of the 25th gate, the Vessel of Love. And you‟ll notice that from the 25th gate
it will take the next eight hexagrams to get to the 2nd gate [blue line], the receptive.
If you look at every single one
10
of these eight hexagrams you
will notice that all of them
have the same lower trigram, 13 1
this lower trigram of
yang/yin/yin. Then if you go
to the 2nd gate and you go all
the way along until you get to
46
just before the 15th gate 25 yang
[orange line] and you take yin yang
yin yin
these eight hexagrams in a yang
row you will that they all have
a yin/yin/yin lower trigram.

In other words, each of the 2
gates of the G Center estab-
lishes an imprint for all of the
15
gates that follow. And though
they will have variations in the upper trigram, what is above, to give all the varia-
tions that every single one of those eight gates are literally part of a family and the
family is rooted in the lower trigram established by the G gate.
Now look [above right] at the wonder of beauty and
symmetry. Here you have the 25 on one side—
yang/yin/yin—here you have the 46 on the other side—
yin/yang/yang—they are an exact mirror to each other.
As the 15 is to the 10, as the 13 is to the 7, as the 2 is
to the 1; these are perfect mirrors of each other, three
yin, and three yang. Every single one of these eight
gates is establishing the infrastructure, the foundation
of the whole movement of energy that is going around
the wheel. But there‟s more than that.
If you start at the 13th gate [left, red oval] and you go
all the way to the 24 [left, blue oval] just before the
yin, the 2, and you have 16 hexagrams in a row, what
do you notice? The bottom two lines are the same [see
next page]. In other words, the wheel is divided up
into quarters. And you can see that you‟re going to
have two groups of eight that are going to have the
same binary base. And then if you go to the next two
groups of eight you‟ll see they have the same yin/yin,
and here the yang/yin followed by the yang/yin, and
here the yang/yang followed by the yang/yang. In
other words, the wheel is divided up into its quarters by

Then you can simply divide it in half so that you have four yin bottom lines and you

These eight gates represent these eight different houses. They represent the four
quarters and they represent the fundamental binary that is there in the wheel itself.
It takes us back to this illustration.
The Monopole Creates the Illusion of the Vehicle
When you think about the Monopole, remember it‟s almost camp to talk about life
being an illusion. We all know that it is an interesting concept but my elbows are
leaning on the desk right now. There is this solidity to this illusion that is quite im-
pressive. But I do want you to think about this Monopole and how it pulls us togeth-
er.
The Design Crystal and the Personality Crystal don‟t make bodies, the Monopole
does. The Monopole creates the illusion of the vehicle. And not only does the Mono-
pole create the illusion of the vehicle, the Monopole creates the illusion of the wheel,
of the zodiac, of the sky, of everything. It is Monopoles that hold everything togeth-

er in the illusion. It holds the totality together in the illusion of its separateness, all
the Monopoles.
The Center of Identity
You can see that by looking at this glyph of the Monopole that you can see this “8”
component. And in understanding this, really understand the way the Monopole‟s
energy is going out through these gates that each of these gates
are more than what they appear to be. We have already seen
that. And when you see that the Monopole reaches out to the
entire wheel and pulls the entire wheel back in, in that sense,
you can understand why we call this the center of identity.
In saying that, I don‟t want you to get confused about doing
Human Design analysis and thinking about what this means for a
human being and their G Center whether it is defined or unde-
fined. When we talk about the G Center as the center of identity,
it is something to grasp that we have those who have very
strong fixed identities and those who have inconsistent identities.
The inconsistent identities lead to a mind that has a not-self
Strategy that it is always looking for love and it never knows
whether it is in the right direction.
These are just by-products of the general function of the body-
graph and how the G Center operates in that sense. We‟re look-
ing at an underlying mechanic here. So I want you to keep that
in mind. We‟re looking at the way in which the Monopole oper-
ates through the G Center. It‟s in the same sense of saying that the Monopole sits in
the 2nd gate. Technically speaking it does.
Now, it doesn‟t mean specifically that if you don‟t have activation in the 2nd gate that
your Monopole doesn‟t work properly. One thing has nothing to do with the other.
It will mean that you will have an inconsistent relationship to what‟s the right direc-
tion for you in life and direction is going to be a big thing in your life. It‟s going to be
very, very important for you. But it doesn‟t mean that there is a lack of function in
what the Monopole is doing in the larger sense of the work.
So, I don‟t want you to confuse these two aspects. This is about understanding basic
concepts in Design. And to understand the Monopole in this way, to understand its
capacity to bring together, to organize, to engineer not only our physical environ-
ment, but to engineer the totality environment around us, is to begin to grasp how
significant an instrument this is. To begin to see what that really means. To begin
to understand how each and every one of us are deeply connected to the whole.
It‟s like looking at the bodygraph and understanding that when you see activations in
the bodygraph, what you‟re seeing is the highlighting of what is the complete genetic
layout. In other words, if you look at every single gate all together that is there in

The Magnetic Monopole & the G Center
the bodygraph, the potential of the 64 gates and the 384 lines, you are looking at all
the potential generalized genetic information.
What we see in our bodygraph are those aspects that are highlighted. Through
those highlights we get to live out our differentiation. But at the same time we need
to be connected to the whole genetic field. We have to be connected to it otherwise
we could not be alive. We have to be connected in order to be able to live in this en-
vironment. The wheel and the G is all the perfection of the interior mechanics. Eve-
rything emerges out of this. All of the possibilities emerge out of it.
Defined and Undefined G Centers
When we come to the mundane, that is when we come to looking at the G Center in
terms of the way in which it works within the Design of beings, is to see that the de-
fining of the G Center, to have the G Center defined—remember that any Definition
is something that is very, very narrow. You can see from the illustration of the way
in which the information moves through the crystal that you have a very fine line
from the Base to the Tone to the Color to
the Line to the Gate to the integration into
the graph. So, beings who have defined
G Centers have a very, very narrow fixed
identity. It‟s often why their identity ap-
pears to be so sharp in contrast to others
simply because there is this consistency
on this very narrow line.
The dilemma for those who have an unde-
fined G Center is an obvious dilemma.
That is, there is no consistency of identity,
but that doesn‟t mean there is no consis-
tency of persona. And I think this is often
deeply misunderstood. You can be some-
body with an undefined G, but you have
an outer persona that others recognize.
The dilemma for most people with the undefined G is that it doesn‟t have anything to
do with them. In other words, if you have an undefined G Center, identity isn‟t the
problem. Getting hooked in identity is very much the problem. The same dilemma
that exists in any open center is the moment that you get caught in trying to fulfill
the potential of that open center, trying to fix it, trying to define it, and then you end
up with the deepest possible conditioning.
Again, everything about being able to reach a point of correctness and awakeness is
to be able to accept, to be able to surrender, to what is your Design and surrender to
the Authority of your vehicle. The moment you surrender to the Authority of your
vehicle, your openness loses the power to distort life for you. Most people with un-
defined G Centers have a very distorted perception of identity. It‟s a natural by-
product of taking in information into an open center.

Remember what happens: when open centers take in conditioning they amply it, and
the amplification leads to distortion. Things become worse than they actually are;
feelings become more uncomfortable than they need to be, and so forth and so on.
Most human beings with an open G Center get carried away on the inflated identity—
while I‟m speaking I‟m remembering a woman I did an analysis for many, many
years ago, very, very early in my career. She had an undefined G. Her husband
was a Sacral to the G defined, I think two channels. I was explaining to her about
the undefined G and she just said, “I‟m so tired of his gods.” It was a very strange
comment. But that‟s literally how it was inflated, taking on this super identity that
had nothing to do whatsoever with this being.
Again, feeling lost; so many beings with the undefined G Center spend their lives
feeling lost or being lost. Most of them end up in mazes where they think they know
where they are where, in fact, if it came to really getting out of there, they really
wouldn‟t know how whatsoever. It can be very, very distracting at that point.
It also says something about not being able to consistently really connect in that
sense. Connect not in the point of the other, per se, but have a sense of where eve-
rything is going. In other words, the beings with an undefined G can really be out of
step and not know where the wind is blowing because they‟re caught up in this pur-
suit.
The Biological Association of the G Center and the Liver
But that aside, I think one of the most interesting things for me about the G Center—
the G Center and the Throat Center are the first two centers that emerge after con-
ception. The Throat Center, where ultimately from the beginning anyway, the De-
sign is going to sit and obviously the Monopole going into the G Center. At this very
beginning of this process, the bio-relationship of the G Center to the liver, that‟s
something that is interesting. We know, for example, that if we‟re talking about cel-
lular renewal we have this well known now seven-year cycle where the vast majority
of the cells in the vehicle are renewed every seven years. It‟s one of the reasons
why we talk about a seven-year deconditioning process for adults. That is, memory
is stored in the liquid of cells and over a period of seven years most of the cells are
renewed in the vehicle.
However, one of those places where you don‟t have certain aspects of cellular re-
newal is in the liver. And the liver is the biological association to the G Center. It
says something very interesting about how deep a travail it is once there is damage
to the identity to try to heal that. Just as once there is damage to the liver, it is very
difficult to rejuvenate that liver because you‟re not going to have the benefit of cellu-
lar renewal. You kill a liver cell, you really kill it. It says something to me about the
specialness of the G Center.

The Magnetic Monopole & the G Center
It also says something about the abuse of alcohol. I don‟t have any moral prob-
lems—I‟m not a moralist—I don‟t have any problems with social drugs. I never
have. It is clear to me that it is the history of humanity that we have been ingesting
all kinds of things that do stuff to us forever. Very few of us are ready to live with-
out our coffee or our tea, and so forth and so on and it goes through the full spec-
trum of all of these things.
This is not a complaint about alcohol per se; it is simply about understanding that
the abuse of alcohol and its direct impact on the liver is a clear indication that this is
something that is really dangerous for the vehicle. It‟s very dangerous for direction
in life, and very dangerous for love in life. It is
really a caution, in that sense. Again, please
understand that I am referring to abuse. I‟m
The referring to damage. I have a glass of wine
Liver with my dinner, I enjoy it. Though I didn‟t,
funny enough, start to drink until I was 50. I
did other things.
It‟s just that this is a real problem for the liver.
For me that immediately sets off all kinds of
deep warning signals about the identity and the
nature of the G and its connection to the Mono-
pole and the connection all this has to the via-
bility to our lives on this plane. So I think that‟s
something to keep in mind. I think that any of
those beings that you can caution in terms of
alcohol abuse is a caution that‟s worthwhile, because if you see the source and you
see the root and you see what this is all about, you cannot do damage on the physi-
cal plane without that having a correlating damage at every level of what is your
process and your life.
The Most Advanced Area of the Bodygraph
There‟s something else as well. That is, for me it‟s clear that this area of the body-
graph is the most advanced area of the bodygraph. I don‟t really know how to ex-
plain that. That is, because it‟s essential for the Monopole to hold together the illu-
sion of this reality, that it also has to hold together the illusion of the next potential
reality and the next. It holds together the memory of all the previous potential reali-
ties. As such, it is enormously sophisticated in its potential. In other words, the po-
tential inherent in the G Center to lay the foundation of correctness for what will be
the mutation of the Rave, while at the same time being able to provide that for hu-
manity that the infrastructure is there.

Because when you‟re looking at the G, you‟re looking at something that is so deeply,
deeply a part of everything. There isn‟t anywhere you can go in the Mandala, there
isn‟t anywhere that you can go in the bodygraph, that you don‟t find this direct line
and relationship to one of the gates of the G Center. This is the core of what it is to
create life. It‟s right here, holding it all together.
The Monopole Runs the Show
Again, this is about basics, when you come back to basics. I‟ve seen everything now
in this life—that‟s an overstatement—in relationship to the way in which awareness is
peddled, the way in which well-being is peddled. There is so much misunderstanding
that permeates the world that we live in. It is, after all, a homogenized not-self
world. It‟s so obvious that it‟s the Monopole that runs the show and that the Mono-
pole has a relationship with the Design Crystal, and a very secondary one to the Per-
sonality. That it‟s the vehicle‟s life, it‟s the vehicle‟s movement that if the vehicle is
healthy there is a chance that the Personality will be healthy. And if the vehicle is
correct, there is a chance that the Personality can surrender to the pleasure of being
the passenger of that correctness.
All of that begins with one thing and one thing only, it begins with taking away from
the mind its trip that it has control over all of this. That it has control over what the
Monopole can do; it‟s a joke. It‟s a joke to think that the passenger, that the Perso-
nality Crystal has any way of telling the Monopole, in essence, what to do. It does
not; it‟s not in charge, it has nothing to do with it. It‟s the body. It‟s what we live
in, it‟s what we ride in, it‟s a rental, it‟s leased. It‟s all there is to it.
Only when you get to the point that you can begin to accept that that means your
mind no longer makes decisions for you. And as long as your mind is making your
decisions, and I don‟t care whether you think you‟re experimenting or not, if your
mind is still making your decisions you‟re still not-self and you‟re still lost in not-self
and you‟re not going to get in this life what is the potential that is there for you.
It begins with the vehicle. It begins with understanding that we have a Design con-
sciousness that is very profound, that its whole focus is about maintaining the cor-
rectness of this vehicle. That‟s its job. And not only maintaining its correctness, but
maintaining its unique differentiation, its potential to display in this life the perfection
of what it is to be it and nothing else. And that that Authority has been overlooked
endlessly by a mind absorbed with all kinds of nonsense, and living out a life that as
you have seen in the way in which the Monopole brings together the illusion, that
they don‟t even get to the point of offering to the Monopole the correctness. They‟re
so deeply lost in the conditioning.

Strategy and Authority
Strategy and Authority is the basis of Design. But it‟s not like there‟s something else
beyond that, the next step. No, everything is here. Truly everything, and that‟s the
point. It‟s the whole thing to grasp. And it takes time. Oh, adults are deeply, deep-
ly, deeply conditioned, living in a deeply, deeply, deeply conditioned world where
everybody uses their mind all the time to make decisions. “What do you think?
What are you going to do?”
But this is the only way to transform your life; this is the only way to begin the
process of awakening. There is no other way. You can see that the moment you
turn over to your Design consciousness its natural responsibility to guide the vehicle,
there is immediately a resonance with the Monopole. They work together, driver and
vehicle. When they‟re working together, when there is correctness in that, then the
passenger has a chance, has a chance to see that this an incredible life, a beautiful
life, to see the beauty of oneself, to learn to love oneself. This is what it‟s about,
and it takes time; it‟s a journey.
But no matter what you learn, no matter what I teach you, there‟s only one thing in
this knowledge that really matters, that you get to live out what is correct for you
and you can only do that through your Strategy and your inner Authority. There is
no other way.

Definition
We come to one of those places where there is the least amount of knowledge in the
Human Design world. I guess, in a sense, it‟s surprising or shocking or however you
want to look at it, but it is one of those things where we‟re dealing with something
that truly is not well understood; it‟s Definition.
I remember when I began to try to develop techniques for the training of analysts.
My concern with Human Design is that students of Human Design grasp that this is a
very much a visual science, it is about seeing and it is about how you see and how
well you see. I developed a kind of thing that I called the four views. The four views
were four different perspectives of looking at the bodygraph, different ways of seeing
the bodygraph. Seeing the bodygraph through Type, seeing the bodygraph through
Definition, seeing the bodygraph through Authority and seeing the bodygraph
through Profile. These were the four views, four different
ways of seeing.
Yet, when we think about them, everything begins with,
in essence, the nature of what it is, our capacity to be
able to do analysis. Everything about what makes us
unique begins with Definition. Definition is something
that, though it is accounted for, obviously, it isn‟t really
something that‟s grasped. It‟s like what Definition is, in a
sense. This is just an illustration between the Root Cen-
ter and the Sacral Center and we‟re dealing with the for-
mat energy, the channel 9/52 and all of this is about the
logical format, the logical energy that drives our whole
pattern and our whole pattern-oriented logical system.
When we think about Definition the first thing to grasp is
that Definition in and of its nature is quantum. Until you
can see it that way, you can‟t begin to see what Defini-
tion is, nor what it is rooted in, because what it is rooted
in is not the gates. Of course, this is one of the things
that happens with students who are beginning their
process in Design and trying to come to grips with the terminology and the numbers
and the keynotes and all that array of things, that they have a channel they have a
name for, and they have the two gates at either end. The two gates at either end
become, in a sense, their concept of what the channel is.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

But the gates are not the Definition. Gates, in and of themselves, can be activated.
The Definition is a by-product of the serendipity of activations at either end of what
is in fact a transmission interaction field. You can see that here in
the illustration with the frequencies that are there from each, be-
cause remember, we talk about these things as if it‟s a channel and
it‟s made of polyurethane or something. These are not channels.
It‟s operating, in a sense, in the way that we see synapse operating
in the brains with neurons firing. We‟re talking about information
being released, the potential of information being released from cer-
tain points.
When you think about these frequencies that are at either end,
these single activations, they‟re very different, inherently different
from what‟s about to happen when they meet. This is the magic of
what a channel is and it is the magic of what we call Definition because without Defi-
nition—Definition is an extraordinary revolution in being able to understand that it is
not simply a matter of adding up the gates. It‟s not a matter of adding up aspects.
It‟s about recognizing that the very thing that makes the bodygraph and its differen-
tiation so extraordinary is that it is the by-product of something. It is a quantum il-
lusion that we deal with. It‟s what happens when these two frequencies meet each
other and they stop being what they are. That is, we‟re not talking about the 9th
gate anymore or the 52nd gate anymore. That‟s no longer in the language.
The Channel of Concentration
What we are dealing with is the Channel of Concentration. And the concentration, in
a sense, aspects are derived from both the activations, but what it becomes is some-
thing else. This concentration is not sitting still. But keeping still is an aspect of
concentration, but they are not the same thing. To be still doesn‟t mean that one is
necessarily concentrated at all. Show me somebody with the 52nd gate that does not
have the 9th gate and I will show you somebody who, in sitting still, is not concen-
trated. They‟re uncomfortable and irritated. It‟s something else.
It‟s the same thing about the 9th gate, this Taming Power of the Small, the potential
that is fulfilled through detailed attention to all aspects. But that‟s not concentration.
That‟s an energy potential. It isn‟t necessarily focused, this Channel of Focus and
Concentration, a Design of determination. We always think that the channel is the
gates. If you ask people to describe a channel for you rather than dealing with the
keynote and the Design of the channel and elaborating on that, they will talk gates.
They‟ll either describe it with the accent on one end of the system or the other end.
But it‟s the channel.
This is the format energy to concentrate. And of course, that concentrate is more
than the intellectual concentration; we‟re talking about an energy format, to concen-
trate things, to bring them closer together. And it is a determined energy. It builds
momentum. You notice that when you first begin to have to study when you‟re in
school and you‟re studying for some kind of examination. What you notice about

Definition
that is that the concentration isn‟t there until there is a point where somehow you‟re
lost in it. You get lost in it. Everything gets honed into what that determined focus
is going to be. And this is an energy that‟s driving the whole logical process, the
whole pattern process.
Type Comes From Definition
So the first thing to understand about Definition is that Definition doesn‟t come from
gates. Definition is channel, it‟s a channel. When we think about it everything that
we consider to be so important to us in this knowledge, that is, the ability, for exam-
ple, to be able to see the first view. The first view is Type and Type leads us to
Strategy and Strategy is the great gift of the knowledge. But where does Type come
from? Type comes from Definition. Everything that we understand as a way in
which we can see our differentiation is a by-product of Definition, or absolutely not;
in other words, the anomaly of the Reflec-
tor. Everything for us, because it leads to
what is in fact the unique imprinting.
Think about what you‟re looking at when
you‟re looking at the bodygraph. What
you‟re looking at is genetic highlighting.
You‟re looking at those particular aspects in
you that are highlighted, that synthetically
when seen together represent what is in
fact your possibility to actually be different.
The key to our difference, this enormous
potential to fulfill our purpose is all rooted in
the Definition, because what is that?
When I look at the bodygraph I look at it
two ways. One way is I look at it at the
very mundane level. That is, roads and tunnels, the basic. The other way is I look
at it as a circuit board. When I look at it as a circuit board what is always very clear
to me is that when I‟m looking at Definition I am looking at the relatively eternal
fixed. In other words, the Definition you come out of the womb with is the Definition
you go to the grave with. This is the way that it works.
When I first began to introduce Human Design, trying to explain to somebody why
there is an aspect of their nature to begin with that they can trust began with Defini-
tion because it is fixed wiring. When you think about fixed wiring, what it is saying is
that every breath, every moment, every second, the whole process, the whole life is
going to be there. It is consistent, it‟s reliable, it‟s precise, and it is very, very finite.
It‟s one of the things you discover when you explore this knowledge at a deep level,
you begin to see that what we call a Definition is in fact a very, very, very narrow,
very specific fixing, truly in the dimension of the differentiated unique. And this is
what we can trust. We can trust because it‟s always there, which means it‟s not
going to be altered. That is, it is fundamentally not going to be conditioned.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

Everything about Strategy and Authority, the rooting of all of that in Type, you get to
see very quickly that what Type is actually made up of are those aspects of you that
are reliable, consistent. This is the thing that is so obvious when you look at the bo-
dygraph and you look at the wiring. There is the Definition; Definition is the story.
It‟s a Definition that creates the fixed wiring. And in essence the counterpoint to
what is the vast and open conditioning potential of any human being‟s bodygraph.
You look here and you look at four centers that are open, let alone all the gates, the
open channels, all the various openness that is there.
And more than just simply openness, you have somebody that is a Split Definition.
You have somebody that has Definition in two aspects. Most human beings never
get a chance to live according to their Authority. Most human beings never get to
live out what is reliable in them, never get to truly trust it. And it‟s not because it‟s
not there; it is there. It is because they are totally absorbed in what they‟re not and
what they might be. Totally absorbed living in the domain of the not-self. And what
is so extraordinary about the domain of the not-self is that all of these little gates
that are hanging around, driven by the genetic imperative to find that thing at the
other end, that they are ready to sacrifice their lives to a Definition that‟s not theirs.
It‟s the Definition that they‟re waiting for.
When you think about conditioning, the thing that makes conditioning so powerful is
not simply you meet the gate at the other end, it‟s that you meet the quantum of
you and the gate at the other end. It‟s very powerful, because it carries with it all
kinds of mysteries because it‟s the chan-
nel that emerges. Human beings, the
not-self, are in the thrall of living out De-
finitions that are not theirs and giving
Authority to them through, of course, the
mind. And the way in which the mind
attaches itself to our openness and takes
advantages of our openness to condition-
ing frightens us, controls us. Channel of
Initiation
We are seduced by Definitions that we
Channel
don‟t have. And ignore the Definitions of Inti-
that we do have. Once you grasp your macy
Type and your Authority you‟re much
more concerned about your openness
Stream
than you are about what‟s fixed, because
of de-
no matter what you do your mind is con- sire
nected to all that openness in you. When
I look at Definition I see the bedrock of keynoting and of being able to lay the foun-
dation down to look at a chart and get an idea of what‟s there. You can just see it.
You have a desire for intimacy that‟s there in this being. This is the stream of desire.
This is the Channel of Intimacy. It‟s just there, a desire for intimate experiences,
because the moment that you see Definition you see keys. And stuck over here, cut
off is the power of the Ego and the G Center, the Channel of Initiation, but initiation
that is cut off from the desire for intimacy.

Definition
Split Definition
When you look at a split Definition, the moment you look at it, what you‟re seeing is
the deepest potential for conditioning. About 45% of human beings have what is a
simple split, like this with two parts [blue and green circles]. About 11% are triple
split; about 1 or 2% are quadruple
split. They‟re relatively rare, like Ref-
lectors, in a sense. But basic Split De-
finitions—that‟s a lot of people. About
41% are single Definition.
So, when you look at somebody with a
Split Definition you have to see that
more than just the openness of the
centers leads to the conditioning of the
not-self, more than that is the condi-
tioning that could link the splits to-
gether. You can have a link through
the 34 or through the 15 or through
the 2 or through the 29 [pink arrows]
that would link the initiation with the
desire for intimacy. Those aspects,
those holes, become everything for
this person. So, its mind says, “We
need to make commitments [gate 29].
We need to find the right direction [gate 2]. We need to find our rhythm [gate 15],”
all of those things. And they end up being conditioned because this is what they
seek, this is what becomes important for them, and they ignore who they are.
The only way that you can really understand your channels, because channels are a
fascinating aspect of the knowledge, if you look, if you do your research you‟ll see
that just about every other aspect has many, many, many more times information
about it than channels, per se. There is no way to truly be able to give you anything
other than the channel and its basic Design and keynote. Why? Because again, it is
a quantum, you cannot add A and B and get C. It doesn‟t work that way. It just
doesn‟t. And there are zillions of variations of how that quantum is actually going to
operate. That‟s what makes channels so fascinating. It‟s what gives Definition this
potential of displaying the uniqueness of the being.
All that openness is what we have to deal with in life. It‟s the school of hard knocks,
it‟s all the pain and suffering and the confusion and all of the things that come to us,
because that‟s what it‟s about. And where we can find solace and security is when
we enter into the domain of what is fixed in us and we begin to trust it.

The 59/6: Channel of Intimacy
When you think about the 59/6, this is an interesting channel, this Channel of Inti-
macy. In its own way it‟s really about being able to break down barriers, this Chan-
nel of Intimacy, in different ways. When we look at the nature of this, that is, the
59th gate which is a genetic imperative role gate, it is the various roles we have
energetically in trying to be attractive enough for mating. As a matter of fact, this is
one of the true examples of the Sacral mirroring the Throat in a way, in the Throat‟s
capacity to gain attention, that the 59th gate is very much about attention gathering.
It is very much about attention gathering within a specific role, that is, within a spe-
cific sexual dynamic.
Channel of
Intimacy
But what is interesting about that is when you go to the other side to the 6th gate,
the gate of Conflict, you get the gate of the pH which basically controls the barriers
and boundaries of whether there is going to be potential intimacy or not, whether
there is going to be openness or not, whether it‟s going to be locked into or closed
off and brought to conflict. It‟s emotional. It‟s all part of the emotional wave sys-
tem.
What‟s interesting here about the connection of this channel, because I just want
you to see channels as just channels, is that this is the only pure Emotional Genera-
tor. You‟ve looked at enough charts now to know that there are all kinds of people

Definition
that can be called Emotional Generators. But that doesn‟t mean that those people
who are called Emotional Generators are people who have that direct connection be-
tween the Solar Plexus Center and the Sacral.
It‟s the same thing with Manifesting Generators. There is only one pure Manifesting
Generator. That‟s the 20/34. The direct connection between the Throat and the Sa-
cral, this is the true Manifesting Generator. The others are Generators that have
manifesting potential. But they are not, in essence, true Manifesting Generators.
There‟s only one pure example of that. In the same way, there is only one true
Emotional Generator and this is the 59/6. We often misunderstand Emotional Gene-
rators because we see them in their other variations.
If you‟re a Generator and the way in which your Emotional system is hooked up is to
the Throat, for example, or it‟s hooked up as it is here to the Root Center but there is
no connection to the Sacral, you have a very different kind of Generator with emo-
tional Definition. In fact, the 59/6 is a very
unusual frequency. Aside from the poten-
tial of it being fertile in the quantum sense,
that is, that what comes out is neither a
direct result of the 59 or the 6, something
new emerges as a kind of metaphor for the
human reproductive process. Out of the
two emerges the quantum, which is some-
thing that is neither this nor that but some-
thing else. There is a difference to its
emotional frequency.
The true Emotional Generator is not some-
body who is seen as very emotional. If you
meet somebody who is a 59/6 and they
don‟t have other kinds of emotional Defini-
tion, if that is their main emotional Defini-
tion and you compare them to somebody
who is emotionally defined abstractly, individually or tribally that doesn‟t have the
59/6, you would experience them very quickly if you‟re someone like me with an
open emotional system. You would experience them very quickly as being emotional
beings. They have very, very distinct waves.
You can feel the intensity of the abstract, because again remember that when you‟re
dealing with emotional waves, basically we have three kinds of wave movements.
That is, we have the abstract movement that climbs and climbs and climbs and then
it crashes. So there is this build-up on the desire plane until finally there is, whatev-
er the goal or the hope of the goal is going to be, the end result that it‟s never ac-
tually satisfied. And then we have the individual process which basically is a plane
with spikes, and the spikes can spike up or down. Then you have the tribal wave
which is basically a ratchet wave. It‟s two steps up and one and a half down and
then it goes back up and then it goes back down and then it goes back up until it fi-
nally it crashes, there is this explosion that actually takes place.

But when you‟re looking at the 59/6 and you step into their aura as an unemotional
being, unless they‟re in a particular situation that has brought out an intensity be-
cause of whatever the thing happens to be, you don‟t really notice. It is a very, very
deceptive emotional field. When you understand it in the context that this is a
unique channel, this is a unique generated force, and to see it within the context of
the channel is to understand it differently. It‟s your Definition, after all.
Definition is what you put Into the Other
You need to truly grasp what your Definition is about. What is that, because that‟s
the part of you that‟s really here to be recognized by the other. It‟s something that
is taught to every Projector, that they need to be seen for who they are. Because
they have a focused aura, they open themselves up to very strong conditioning and
don‟t end up necessarily being seen. And where you are seen, where we are all
seen, because remember something about your Definition. This is one of the deep-
est things to grasp about your Definition is that your Definition is what you put into
the other. It‟s just something to see.
If you‟re not paying attention to it and you‟re not following your Strategy and Au-
thority, then this has no real way to operate correctly. And you have to understand
the way we are as a prana. This separation between what we put out into the other,
which is our Definition, and what we take in from the other, which is our openness
that we believe is us, the part of us that gets conditioned that our mind works from.
That‟s why it‟s so important to honor your Strategy and Authority, because not only
are you then putting yourself into the other correctly, but when the conditioning
comes to you, it can come in, but it doesn‟t have the power to change the way in
which you will make decisions and that‟s everything. But this is our basic prana.
And it‟s not simply about looking at your Definition so that you can say, “Ok, I‟m an
Emotional Generator, Split Definition,” it‟s about really looking at it to see what you
put into the other.
What happens when you‟re a 59/6 and you put that energy into the other? Think
about what happens. It becomes amplified and distorted. That‟s what happens
when anyone puts any energy into someone else, into their openness. That other
person is either going to feel suddenly uncomfortable that they‟re in your aura or too
comfortable that they‟re in your aura. And it will be the very quality of your frequen-
cy that will make the difference.
It‟s what they take in; they take in your desire. While they‟re taking in you, because
that‟s the thing that‟s so interesting, you‟re taking in them. But think about what
happens to them when they take in you. That becomes their conditioning field. If
they‟re open to these lower three centers and they‟re someone like me—open Sacral,
open emotions, open Root—if I‟m not-self and I‟m taking this in, this becomes the
root of my decision making. So I start making decisions based on the fact, gee,
since I can be intimate with this person and it‟s happens so suddenly, maybe I can
release my desires, too. Maybe they really want me. Maybe this is a sexual invita-

Definition
tion. And this is what the other person is taking in as a distorted field, of this going
into them because they take it in through their openness and it becomes their rai-
sonnent.
Isn‟t it perverse? Think about the way in which human beings function. So every-
body who meets this person, they‟re taking in the desire for intimacy. They take it
in, everyone. And it comes back as a distorted mirror. It‟s not until you get to a
point where you honor the result of your Definition, which is your Strategy, that you
can begin to reorient your relationship with the other. But Definition, channels,
channels are really something. The tradition or the synthesis of the channel comes
from the Sefirot, comes from Kabala. It comes from, in essence, one of the first sort
of based quantum theories. Channels are unique in every display of them in every
being that carries them because of this mysterious quantum field that we simply give
a name to as a channel.
Like going back to our illustration here of the 9/52, this theme
of concentration, a Design of determination, think about the
language. If you look at the Rave I‟Ching or any of the places
where you see the keynoting of these various themes, all the
channels are given this “a Design of.” But it‟s very generic.
There are all kinds of determination. Think about the varia-
tions that exist between this 9 and this 52 that can result in a
different quantum. Think about the possibilities. The 52 has
six Lines, six Colors, six Tones and five Bases as possibilities,
any one of those.
And the same is true for the other side. We are talking about a
lot of combinations. We‟re not talking about the fact that this
might be somebody‟s son, and this might be their Neptune, we
have no idea. There are so many possibilities for what is, in
fact, the actual frequency at this end [the 9] and the actual frequency at this end
[the 52] and the extraordinary emergence of this quantum. That‟s how finite a
straight line, a narrow, narrow, narrow line, is Definition.
It is also the gateway to our uniqueness and appreciating it. If you add up all of the
numbers, the thousands and thousands of the „this and that‟, and you look at every
single activation and channel you have, then you begin to see that you are indeed, at
least in terms of the way in which you are defined and have activations, something
that is truly unique. And what do you get to live out? You get to live out some kind
of homogenized super generic of what this is and not the nuance that is you because
as long as you don‟t operate correctly none of that is going to emerge.
It‟s nice to say, “They have the Channel of Initiation,” yeah, what kind of thousands
of possibilities is that, what is that in you, what is that as a defining principle in you,
what will that look like? We don‟t know. We don‟t know until it emerges. Until you
give Authority to what is in fact your Definition only then can you begin to see the
results. Only then does the doorway, in essence, open up. There is no other way.
There‟s none.

For me Definition is the first thing. It is the most exalted aspect as a view, because
out of Definition you see everything. Yes, you don‟t necessarily get to see the Pro-
file. But you get the Type and you get the Strategy and you get the Authority. It‟s
all a by-product of Definition. So, to understand that Definition at one point is the
most important thing for establishing uniqueness, and on the other side, recognizing
how little is understood about it, how little is grasped. That‟s the thing that‟s so sur-
prising. It‟s like how little human beings grasp themselves, how little understanding
they have, how deep is the lack of awareness in their process.
Dualism
When you look at a human being within the context of Human Design, the first thing
that makes Human Design unusual to begin with is this binary calculation, this ex-
tremely dualistic mechanical structure, the dual consciousness—Personality con-
sciousness, Design consciousness. Everything about Human Design is dualistic. And
the dualism is not dualism in the flat two-dimensional sense, but it really is juxtapo-
sition. In other words, it is the juxtaposing of „this and that‟ in order to be able to
establish a larger whole, a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts.
And wherever you look within Human Design you see the emergence of this, the very
construct of what we are. That is, these two databases, 88 degrees of the move-
ment of the Sun apart, are somehow held together in this illusion. They are the jux-
taposition that brings about the quantum, the whole that‟s greater than the sum of
the parts that we call the life. And the way in which the whole inner mechanism of
the bodygraph operates is that it operates on this principle. That is, it operates on a
quantum principle, it operates on juxtaposition. If you juxtapose activation in the 52
with activation in the 9, viola, all of sudden there it is. The quantum emerges and
you have concentration, determination and fixed wiring at a very, very specific, very,
very limited way.
Then you can start understanding that the only person who will ever, in a sense, un-
derstand your channels is you when you live them as they were intended to be lived,
as the foundation upon which you base your life. It goes back to the very simplest
teachings of Human Design. When you first introduce a bodygraph to someone, De-
finition—I must have said it thousands of times, look, you have an activation at one
end of the channel and you have an activation at the other end of the channel and
what you get out of that is what we call Definition and this is fixed, consistent and
reliable. And it is extraordinarily and uniquely you.
You can line up 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 people with this channel, the 59/6, I guaran-
tee you that they‟re all different, unless the cards are stacked against me, and
there‟s great good fortune in twins or something. Even then with most twins rarely
have I ever seen anything that escapes the Base. We‟re all different. These chan-
nels are all different. And we have to be careful about the way in which we look at a
channel as some kind of fixed structure that we can simply put a label on. Because
we can‟t, we only have the generic. What we‟re waiting for is the unique, the diffe-
rentiated.

Definition
When you begin to think about what the
activations are at either end, when you be-
gin to understand how finite that is, the
Base to the Tone to the Color, then you can
begin to see that in every Definition you
have lurks your uniqueness. This is this
absolutely very, very fine instruction in the
circuitry and it‟s such a powerful platform
to stand on. And you can, you can rely on
it; you can trust it. It is what you‟re about.
There is nothing wrong in this being‟s de-
sire for intimacy, or the intimate expe-
rience. As long as it is operating out of the
Authority of being an Emotional Generator,
then it‟s going to be correct. And it‟s going
to be productive for this being and it‟s
going to fulfill what is their potential.
Live Your Definition
If you‟re going to live out this life as yourself you have to live your Definition. This is
what you‟re here for. We make it simple in a way. We say, “Look, ok, here‟s your
Strategy, here‟s your Authority, so you don‟t have to think about it because your
Strategy and Authority is based on your Definition. It‟s going to live through that
Definition, express itself through that Definition.”
But I‟m a teacher of self-love. It‟s an essential ingredient. If you‟re going to have
any kind of transcendence in this life you need to be able to stand before the mirror,
and not the mundane mirror on the wall, but the mirror that you can always put in
front of you and stand before that mirror and love what you see. The only place that
you find that love is in your Definition. This is what makes you unique, special, and
different. This is the potential of your glory, your beauty, your truth, whatever it
may be. It‟s in the Definition.
And when you begin to live out your Definition and when you begin to see it flourish,
when you take away responsibility in this life from the mind and you allow your
Strategy to move you, you get to see that you‟re worthy of love, and you are.
Whenever anyone talks about love, I‟m not Mr. New Age and I‟m certainly not
schmaltzy; these kinds of things can just turn into propaganda and claptrap. For
me, self-love is the first love. If you don‟t get there, all the other ones are just mea-
surement.
To love yourself is an ordeal for most human beings. Human beings don‟t like them-
selves because of the nature of their openness, because they live in inconsistent,
conditioned Definitions all the time, because there is no stability, because they don‟t
seem to have what they think they‟re supposed to have, and because that mirror

they can hold up is never, never, never fulfilled. This is not a mirror that says “I love
myself.” This is a mirror that says, “I know what‟s wrong, I know what‟s missing, I
know what I need, I know what I should have, I know what I don‟t like about myself,
I know all these things.”
I was astonished when I began my work as a professional that I met so much self-
dislike and self-hatred. This is the great malaise of the not-self—human beings
walking around who do not think well of themselves, including the 30 plus percent
that are Ego beings who just simply put out the façade. The fact is that the not-self
is an unhappy creature and an unfulfilled creature.
It‟s why it‟s worthy to pay attention, not simply to Definition as the bedrock upon
which we build the chart and we get to see the nature of the Strategy and Authority,
but to really grasp that it is your uniqueness. This is the thing than I hope you really
get is that because it is so finite, because it is such an extraordinary connection, that
this quantum that is there in this channel, this is the uniqueness that is you. And
that it needs to be expressed purely and you can only express it when you‟re ex-
pressing it out of what it builds for you.
It‟s one of the most fascinating things to think about in terms of Definition is that
Definition builds the platform upon which we achieve Strategy and Authority. It sets
it all up. It gives you the tools you need in order to be able to experience this life as
yourself. And when you think now about Definition, it‟s not that I‟m suggesting to
you that you don‟t think about the gates that obviously make up the aspects of the
channel, but I want you want be able to meditate and focus on the channel itself as
something separate. When you think about the channel, think about it in terms of
its keynote and its Design. That‟s the place to begin.
And it‟s also the thing that is going to be recognized in you. It‟s not like this per-
son‟s 59 or this person‟s 6 are going to be recognized by others. It isn‟t. It‟s the
quantum that‟s going to be recognized. It‟s the channel that is going to have its im-
pact. It‟s the channel that is going to be put into the other. This is you. It‟s your
uniqueness. And if the frequency is not correct, think about the distortion that
you‟re going to get back from the other, because you will.
When you look at a chart, look at the Definition. See what‟s there, see who‟s there
just through the channels; just look at the channels, nothing else. Run those key-
notes through your head, loop them together in different ways, play with the Design,
and just think about them. Because if you can do that, if you can just focus on the
channel you‟re going to catch exactly what that other being puts into you and every-
one else. You catch a glimpse of them. It‟s the beginning of recognizing who they
are. You want to know who you are? You begin with your Definition. That‟s where
you being. It‟s what tells the story.

Authority
We come to, in fact, the third of the views that we‟ve been looking at, first looking at
Type and Definition and now looking at Authority. Authority is one of those things
that obviously is enormously important. It has brought confusion over the years. I
guess in many ways it will always bring some kind of confusion because there are all
kinds of variations on themes that exist in the diversity of humanity.
Inner and Outer Authority
But anyway, Authority is something that first of all needs to be seen in perspective.
That is, when we‟re talking about Authority we‟re talking about what we call Inner
Authority. In Human Design we talk about two different kinds of authorities. That
is, Outer Authority and Inner Authority. Outer Authority is the rightful domain of the
mind. In other words, for the mind, the ability of the mind to be able to process da-
ta and at the same time to be able to share that, to be able to empower, to be able
to support, whatever language you want to use,
to be able to offer mind as Outer Authority in the
same way as I do for you, as an example.
But Outer Authority is not about anything having
to do with the inner process or the inner decision
making process. It is simply Outer Authority. It
is simply the by-product of the potential of self-
reflected consciousness. Inner Authority is some-
thing else. Inner Authority is the Authority to
make decisions for the life. This is an Inner Au-
thority. When we think about mind and Inner Au-
thority, and we think about the being, if we look
up here and we look at the openness that is
there, just think about this as mind for a moment.
Here in the Head Center we have the Personality Crystal and here in the Ajna we
have the Design Crystal. Basically what we have are the two components within us
that are receiving neutrino information. We are a binary crystal consciousness.
Now, the Design Crystal consciousness is about the vehicle in the form principle we
know. And the Personality Crystal consciousness is what ends up being what we call
mind. And of course, one of the dilemmas we have is that we are so used to seeing
things in mono terms. We see ourselves through the power of the mind to distort

DESIGN CONCEPTS

our perception and the possibility that we may be, in fact, a dual consciousness. You
don‟t exactly get that feeling. It seems like we have this mind and it‟s the mind that
is in charge. Of course, one of the great steps you take in this process of under-
standing that this is a dualist construct is to see that inner Authority is when the De-
sign Crystal consciousness is in charge. Outer Authority is for the Personality Crystal
consciousness.
When we finally align our consciousness themes correctly in the sense that we do
that through the Strategy, then ultimately what we get is the benefits, the by-
product of finally being able to at least physically operate correctly in this life. It is
the Design that is here to be in charge of the vehicle. And of course, the way in
which we get to allowing the Design to be able to take its responsibility and run the
vehicle, the way we do that is through Strategy because Strategy based on Definition
reveals what, in fact, is the mechanism we can use as an Inner Authority to guide us
in our lives.
Of course, there are many variations of that. It‟s not just simply a matter of Type.
That is, Type in and of itself doesn‟t necessarily give you an Authority unless you‟re
looking at Reflectors, and as you‟ll see we‟ll take a journey through variations. It‟s
so important to realize what that means for us to be able to transfer Inner Authority
to the proper aspect of our consciousness, how it frees our mind from the delusion of
being in charge of our lives. And yet, the very expression of this consciousness isn‟t
just simple. It isn‟t just, with due exceptions, a matter of the Strategy and the Type.
It is a matter, again, through the Definition of seeing where the true Authority is;
what is the mechanism that is going to express the decision making of the Design
consciousness.
The Sacral Authority/Solar Plexus Authority
If we look, most of it is truly straightfor-
ward. In other words, let‟s take a look at
the Sacral. The Sacral world, the Gene-
rator world—Generators are approx-
imately 67% of humanity. That means
that for 67% of humanity, in most cases,
response is the Inner Authority. Out of
that 67% of Sacrals who have response
as Authority, half of them are going to be
emotional. So, the Authority is going to
switch because we know that the mo-
ment you have a defined Solar Plexus
Center, this is the moment you have your

Authority
So, if you add up the Sacral world and the Solar Plexus world, basically what you get
is about 16½% are left over. In other words, over all, generally speaking, about
83% of humanity is going to operate out of one variation of Inner Authority or
another based on either the Sacral Center or the Solar Plexus Center. So, the first
thing about Authority is, in most cases, it is very straightforward.

Let‟s think about the Sacral and let‟s talk about Sacrals that do not have an emo-
tional component. You think about anybody who is an unemotional Generator. Any-
thing that connects to the Sacral Center by Definition becomes part of the expression
of the Inner Authority. Let‟s say that you have your Splenic Center connected to the
Sacral Center by Definition, then what you have is Sacral decision making that‟s
based on Splenic awareness. But it is Sacral decision making; the Sacral Center is
the Authority.
I think it‟s one of the things that is probably the most important work. When I first
began my work in Human Design I tended to focus almost exclusively on Generators.
They are at least two-thirds of humanity. They are, in fact, the life force. It
seemed, anyway in the beginning of my process, that they were the ones who could
be transformed the quickest. It‟s not necessarily true, as I‟ve discovered—the power
of the not-self and what fractals are and many other things. However, something to

DESIGN CONCEPTS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
grasp about the nature the Sacral is that the Sacral has to be awakened from its
slumber. Most Sacral Centers as authorities are atrophied. There are so many Ge-
nerators that I know that the very Generator sounds are not something that easily
emerge from them. It‟s not such an easy thing for that to come out. It‟s not an
easy thing for them to find a way to settle into that kind of Authority.
To move away from the mind to your body is quite something and it stands out so
specifically with the Generator. “Uh-uh,” that “uh-uh” can be about something that
the mind says, why “uh-uh?” This is one of the things that one has to deal with.
And yet, for all of those unemotional Generators life, in essence, is designed to be
absolutely perfect. All they have to do is wait and respond, nothing else, perfect.
And their true Inner Authority is going to be there in the moment, all the time, on a
dime, there. They simply have to allow it to happen.
One of the dilemmas, perhaps a catch-22, of what it is to be a Generator is to be
surrendered. And to be surrendered you have to be a Generator, and to be a Gene-
rator is to be surrendered. Somehow you have to get on the wheel. For most Sacral
beings the important thing at the beginning of their process is to awaken their Sacral
response—question and response, find out about yourself. After all, Generators are
here to know themselves better than anyone else.
So, if it‟s not generated Inner Authority, most of it is then going to be emotional.
You have the 50% of those beings who are going to be emotional and it‟s not just
simply half of the Generators who are going to be emotional; it‟s going to be all the
potential Emotional Manifestors and the Emotional Projectors. What you end up with
is that between the two of them, they cover everything.
Think about Emotional Authority: No truth in the now. There‟s an Authority for you.
No truth in the now; half of humanity, no truth in the now. The other half of human-
ity is being conditioned by the amplification of the “no truth in the now.” It‟s not
surprising that humanity is relatively lost; nonetheless, no truth in the now.
If you live on a wave you can‟t trust a peak or a valley. It‟s just that simple, you
can‟t. So there is no truth in the moment because the moment is relative to a place
and it‟s on the wave. The only thing that works is time. It is, in a sense, the basis
of the abstract process. That experience is the teacher, not the existential moment,
but the experiential survival is the teacher. And it‟s something to understand about
emotional clarity, it‟s not awareness. What you‟re waiting for isn‟t the truth if you‟re
an Emotional being. It could never be THE truth. What you‟re waiting for is clarity.
What you‟re waiting for is a way in which you can balance, synthesize your wave ex-
perience, to reach a decision.
You can see something about the nature of the Design of humanity, that we‟re not
intended to rush to conclusions as a species. If half of us are Emotional, and the rest
are conditioned by it, then taking our time and being clear in terms of our decision
making process is something that is enormously important to us, all of us, regardless
of our specific configuration.

Authority
If you‟re an Emotional Generator then every response is a sample in the wave, just a
sample in the wave. No longer is the Sacral the true Authority. It is overwhelmed
by the power of the emotional system to be the final word, to be the ultimate Au-
thority. The truth is that everybody on this planet operates under the impact of the
generated emotional environment. Frustration in the wave; this is humanity, the
not-self of humanity.
Of course, this is where our true Inner Authority is as a species. Yes, there are these
other variations, I‟m one of them, I know, but they‟re just variations. They are not
what the core Authority of the planet is all about. For two-thirds of humanity life is a
matter of response, not initiation. For half of humanity there is no truth in any given
moment. These are our authorities, this is the planetary Authority and it is truly ig-
nored. We live on a mental plane.
The Mental Projector/Reflector
So, if you‟re trying to figure out Authority right away you can see that in most cases
you‟re simply going to get this Sacral, emotional configuration one way or another.
There are other things to keep in mind, though. For example, we have the Reflector
and no Definition, and we have what is called the Mental Projector who has absolute-
ly no activations below the Throat. Neither one of these examples here has an Au-
thority. There is no Inner Authority. There are only strategies; no inner Authority.
That‟s something to think about.

The Strategy of the Reflector, that is, their process, their lunar cycle, becomes their
Authority; the pure alignment of Strategy with Authority. For the Mental Projector
they only have Outer Authority, they have no Inner Authority. They go through a
process of putting things out to hear what they are thinking, this ongoing process as
a way of trying to figure out what they really might think; but, neither one of them
has an Authority, a true Inner Authority. They simply have variations of their Strat-
egy. When you add them together we get down to about 13% of humanity who
have variations that do not fit into any of this general configuration. It‟s when we
get to the nuances that we get to all kinds of discussions about how to properly ex-
press it and whatever. It can be quite a thing.

Splenic Authority
Let‟s begin with Splenic Authority. The first thing you have to be clear about is that
there have to be certain prerequisites in order to have what is one of that 13% that‟s
different. And the obvious is that you cannot have either a defined Sacral or a de-
fined emotional system. In
other words, they have to
Splenic
be out of the picture. Only
Authority then can you begin to look
for a different kind of Au-
thority. It‟s the first thing to
recognize that this has to be
out of the picture—
undefined Sacral, undefined
emotional system; obviously
not a Reflector.
We have a seniority system.
It begins with the Spleen as
number one because the
Spleen is, in fact, the only
pure awareness system, or
awareness center that a
human being is endowed
with. And Splenic aware-
ness, its relationship to our
immune system, the lym-
phatic system, all of these
various things that are part of protecting us, the fact that it‟s a bedrock of our intelli-
gence, all of this gives the Spleen the potential to be an Authority, but only if there is
no Sacral or emotional system around. The Spleen is very weak. And as an Authori-
ty, though it is very acute, you have to be quite aware to catch it.
So, here is an example in this Design of a Projector that has Splenic Authority. So
what does that mean? What that means is that they have to feel their hunch. They
have to feel that judgmentation in them that emerges in the moment, because it‟s
Splenic. It‟s there, you catch it.
I had that wonderful experience with a traffic accident a couple of months back.
Going out of my driveway, suddenly watching myself put on my seatbelt, which I
never do. I live in the countryside, I take a rural road first before I get to the main
road and I never put on my seatbelt on the rural road. I don‟t know why, I just
don‟t. Coming out of driveway I did, and I watched myself do it. And as I watched
myself do it, because I‟ve been in this process a long time and I am somebody who
is Splenic, it was clear to me what that is for. Eight or nine minutes later somebody
banged into the back of me. This is the thing about intuition, instinct or the judg-
mentation that is there in these streams in the Spleen. There is an Authority there.
But basically it is a spontaneous decision making inner Authority. Subtle, but it is
there.

Authority
It‟s not easy to live in Splenic Authority in an environment like this Projector would
have where there is the deep, deep conditioning, because the Spleen is very, very
weak as an informing source. It tells you once. You can always tell Splenic people,
because they‟re the kind of people who after something has happened to them will
say to you, “But you know, I really knew this was going to happen.” And my re-
sponse to that is, “Well, if you knew, idiot...” but, it takes a lot to trust it. It‟s like
me and my seatbelt. Was I free to interpret that as, “You‟re putting your seatbelt on
because something is going to happen and you‟re going to get hit by a car.”
Of course, in any kind of rational mind, and I‟m a 5, you can begin to think that
you‟re paranoid. Maybe it just happened that way. Maybe that was just the seren-
dipity of the moment. Maybe you decided to be safe on a country road. There are
all these things that mind will do and Spleen does not come back and say, “Hey,
idiot, just put on your seatbelt and shut up. Drive the car.” This is the thing about
the Spleen.
I want you to grasp something, that this is what it‟s all about. These are real Au-
thorities; powerful and direct. They may not always be to our liking, but “uh-uh” has
enormous power. The power of the
emotional system, these are real po-
Splenic
werful inner decision making forces.
Authority
This isn‟t. None of the nuances really
are. They‟re different. So, Splenic
Authority is different. And it is a
spontaneous one time only, catch-it-
if-you-can Authority.
This is quite an example. If you look
at this single Definition, the only thing
you see is the 18/58 [blue arrow]
which is the Design of dissatisfaction.
This is a powerful recognition of what
is not ok, what is not correct. This is
a Splenic Authority that can recognize
those things in a moment. You‟re
about to step into an elevator and this
is the kind of unconscious Splenic Au-
thority that somehow just goes, “No.” And maybe nothing more than the experience
of a sudden touch of fear, claustrophobia, a touch of anxiety as one moves towards
it. Do you listen? Do you back away? Do you go up the stairs? Or do you go inside
and get stuck for two hours?
Everything about Inner Authority is that it‟s something you have to learn about, be-
cause it‟s for your mind to recognize. Your mind has to accept the program. And
the Inner Authority, these subtle Inner Authorities, you have to pay attention. If you
don‟t pay attention to your Spleen it will tell you the most wonderful things and you
will ignore them and suffer the consequences. It‟s not going to overwhelm you like
the Sacral and the emotional system. As a matter of fact, it can be totally over-

whelmed by either. It‟s just there in the moment. You learn to trust it. But you
have to know it‟s there.
Remember that we‟re dealing with Strategy and Authority. The nature of this being
as a Projector is that those moments are decision making moments that come out of
invitation. The only way in which this person is going to deal with any invitation is
spontaneously in the moment as it comes in. This is the way they can operate cor-
rectly in this life.
Ego Authority
Now, there are different kinds of configurations in
this. You can have all kinds of ways. You can have
the Ego going through the 51/25 and any of the three
ways up [pink arrows]. Or through the 10/20 [tur-
quoise arrows], you can have it come down and then
going up. There are ways. But again, remember, we
can only discuss Ego Authority if there are three
things missing. In other words, there is no Spleen,
there is no Sacral, no there are no emotions. In other
words, notice the hierarchy now that there cannot be
a Spleen.
If there was a defined Spleen [see Ra’s chart in the middle of the next page], re-
gardless of how it was defined in this situation, if it was a split or connected to it that
this would still be Splenic Authority because Splenic Authority dominates. It may be
Splenic Ego Authority, but it‟s still going to be the Spleen that is the only awareness
and the only thing that has a right in that situation to make the inner decision.
However, when there is no such advantage, there is no true awareness, one cannot
use the false awareness and there is no emotional system. So, this is Authority that
lacks awareness. It doesn‟t mean that‟s bad. It just means that it has a very differ-
ent way in which it‟s intended to operate and fulfill its purpose. This is Ego Authori-
ty. It‟s Ego Expressed Authority, straight to the Throat; classic—the 21/45 [blue ar-
row above or chart next page].
What does that mean? Here we are dealing with a Manifestor. We can have many
variations of this. Well, not many. We could have the Projector variation or we
could have the Manifestor variation. Here we have the Manifestor variation. We
have the Manifestor variation without the awareness. So, this is all about informing.
It is about informing out of the Ego what the Ego wants. And one of the most impor-
tant things for this being is to know that their informing always has to have its pos-
sessive elements. “I have to.” But, it‟s Ego Authority.

Authority
It‟s one that is difficult, in a sense, to re-
Ego ally grasp. The Authority of this Ego is
Authority determined by its root, which is the con-
trol mechanism. Ego Authority is a con-
trolling Authority. It‟s very powerful in
its own way. And yet, it‟s at a great dis-
advantage in its lack of awareness. If
you‟re somebody who has Ego Authority
then your Ego, relative to your Type, is
going to have to operate correctly. That
means it has to be engaged correctly in
work. It‟s one of the most important
things about the Ego and particularly be-
ings with Ego Authority. Their lives are
built on their work. Anyone who has Ego
Authority in their Design, their work is
going to be their life.
I‟m an example [Ra’s chart to the right] in many ways of that. The difference is that
my Ego is connected through the channel of the 51/25 and I don‟t have this material
channel. I come down the other way with
integration, down to the Spleen. So in
fact, I have Splenic Authority. But it‟s
Splenic Ego Authority. The Ego as my
motor is a Manifestor, it‟s what driving it.
So my Splenic Authority is very much
connected with the power and the impor-
tance of work in my life. I take great
pleasure out of the work that I do.
So, it‟s something to understand about
Ego Authority and its material dimension,
its working plane dimension. But the
most important thing is to notice that you
can‟t talk about it until you see these
Ra’s Chart
things are missing.
Self-Expressed Authority
I like this one; it‟s an interesting one. I know quite a few people who have these
kinds of configurations where you have a very simple Projector Throat/G. But the G
has quite a dynamic. That is, this defined, consistent identity is quite a force. When
you see the G Center connected to the Throat what you have is self-expressed Au-
thority.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

You can see the expression that is self-expressed it is expressed through the Throat.
When people with Self-Expressed Authority ask me how that works, what I say to
them is that this is about the spontaneous, In other words, what you spontaneously
say, not what you want to say. One of the most important things for these people is
to hear themselves while they‟re speaking, because if they listen to themselves while
they‟re speaking, they‟re
going to hear their truth ex-
pressed out of their identity. Self-Expressed
It‟s their identity that be- Authority
comes their Authority.
These nuances are not easy.
The obvious again, this is a
Sacral emotional world and
the Sacral Emotional Author-
ity dominates everything.
These are very powerful
forces. The moment you
start constructing charts
where you have all of these
limitations of not having any
of these forces in there, then
you‟re beginning to see al-
ready that you have a being
who is so deeply open to
conditioning that there is the
dilemma of being able to find
this Self-Expressed Authori-
ty. Again, it‟s a Projector,
waiting for those moments in which it can bring out that self-reflected Authority.
There are other variations that are interesting. There are those variations where for
example you have somebody who only has the 51/25, only has the Channel of Initia-
tion, so you have this projected element in the middle of the body chart and every-
thing around it is white. And this is either Self-Ego Authority or Ego-Self Authority.
You can go back and forth with all kinds of terminology.
I think one of the things to really grasp about these variations is to see that each
variation, as it progresses, becomes more and more difficult in the sense that you‟re
dealing with Designs that are more and more open until you finally get to that point
that you get to nothing being there. You can see that what we‟ve been going
through is a kind of reduction. The 67% that are Sacrals, the 50% that are Emo-
tional, and then you go down to the ones who are only Splenic, so you already elimi-
nate everybody other than the Projectors and Manifestors, and then you eliminate
the Ego, and then you finally get to a point where it‟s all eliminated. As a matter of
fact, all eliminated except the anomaly of the Mental Projector.

Authority
Mental Projectors
I hate making these kinds of statements
because when I do there‟s always some-
body who‟s willing to step up onto a
cross, but it is not an easy thing to be a
Mental Projector. You have a fixed mind,
which means that in terms of the me- l a R R R
chanics of your Design you have a very t nOOO
strong mental base. Your mind is consis- e MCT CT CT
tent, it‟s always operating, you live on a EEE
JJJ
mental plane, and you live in a condi-
OOO
tioned world where mind is everything. RRR
Your mind can compete in that world so PPP
you end up lost in the maia. There is no
Inner Authority because there is nothing
below the Throat; there isn‟t anything
there that is reliable.
This is perhaps the most difficult of all the configurations, because when you get to
the Reflector, the Reflector is ok. That‟s the magnificence of Reflectors. They‟re not
like us, they‟re not solar, they‟re lunar, and they‟re very different; all of that open-
ness because there is no counterpoint to fixedness. Their openness doesn‟t operate
like our openness. They‟ve got Teflon auras; they operate in a totally different way.
And their Authority is their cycle. Their Authority is simply their cycle. So, the Ref-
lector in many ways has the most perfect Authority. There is no complexity to it.
There is no this and that you go from being a Generator to being an Emotional Gene-
rator and you shift Authority. It‟s is simply your Strategy is your Authority.
Of course, the other side, the Mental Projector where your Strategy cannot, in that
sense, be your Authority. It‟s one of the most interesting things about the Mental
Projector. You go to the Mental Projector and you invite them to do something.
Where is their Authority? They don‟t have any Inner Authority. My advice to Mental
Projectors has always been the same. You cannot afford to enter into anything in
the moment. You have to go through an experiential process, whether that expe-
riential process takes a couple of hours or a couple of days.
For Projectors, Strategy is about the invitation and the invitation is something that is
significant. I‟m not talking about mundane invitations now. For example, let‟s say
to have a personal or business partner, that kind of decision where you have to
make a decision about a person in a situation and you‟re this Mental Projector and
you‟ve been invited into that. The only way you can find any Authority, and it really
isn‟t even really an Authority, it‟s just a sampling, is that the best thing you can do it
go through the experience of taking that offer and discussing it, your Outer Authority
gift, as many times as possible with different people. Not looking for their advice,
not giving them power over you in that sense.

Actually, in fact, what you‟re doing based on what happens to you when you inte-
grate into different auras, in other words, the whole lower area of the vehicle starts
getting activated and you get different feelings about the value of what you‟re say-
ing. And over a process of bouncing things off a number of different auras, a num-
ber of different beings where you get this inner mechanism, you can come to some
kind of conclusion about what the decision should be. In other words, for all of the
variations there is a dilemma here for the Mental Projector, because for them Au-
thority is really a questionable thing and not something that is simple at all.
Authority Nuances
Because the Authority question comes up over and over again over the years from
students from various generations talking about this or that, names and how to de-
scribe these various nuances, I really see that anything that is not Sacral/Emotional
is—our authorities have mutated in a sense, they are variations of themes. They
have to be, because when you take away the Sacral and you take away the emotion-
al system, in essence you take away the life force. You take away the most powerful
instruments there are. And these nuances, these different kinds of sub variations of
themes of Authority, in so many cases they actually require a much deeper focus and
awareness in order to be able to come to grips with them.
It‟s like somebody like me. I have a very, very powerful mind. And yet, it‟s not my
Authority. I can remember the strength of my intuition long before I paid any atten-
tion to it. I was one of these people who used to say quite regularly, “Yeah, I knew
that was going to happen,” and never got it, never really grasped it because there
was no way I could have any sense of its truth or be secure in that. When I finally
got to see my Design and I understood what it was that I could see, that I had this
very fixed reliable intuition and it reached the mental plane for me—it was all part of
my single Definition—it was obvious to me that if I didn‟t pay attention to this that all
was lost for me.
It‟s going to be 20 years in January 2007 that I simply lived by my intuition and
nothing else. It‟s spontaneous and it‟s often very odd. It is what it is. It‟s very
mysterious. It‟s very difficult to penetrate. Like why did I put on the seatbelt at that
moment? What was driving that? To really understand how mysterious it can be.
It‟s not like a straightforward Sacral—uh-huh, uh-uh. It‟s not like the emotional
wave that has its own predictability to it because it is the wave. It‟s something else.
It‟s this „poof‟ and then it‟s gone. And because it‟s like that, you need to know about
it. Otherwise, there is no way you‟re going to trust this unless you realize that it is
what your life is all about. You have to know what it is. You have to learn the les-
sons of not ignoring it and the price that you pay.
It‟s the same thing with any other of these activations, the way they‟re structured.
What a handicap it is when you pull all that away. That the Authority is Ego driven;

Authority
and yet, it‟s this person‟s purpose that gets fulfilled this way. It is the mundane mo-
tor requirements of the Ego that dictate what the life should be.
Follow Your Strategy, Honor Your Authority
Your Strategy, your Authority, and your Definition all start adding up to whom you
are and how you get there and stay there. Authority and Strategy together, every-
day that‟s my mantra: follow your Strategy and honor your Authority. Honor your
Inner Authority. This is how you get to self-love; this is how you get to purpose. So
of course, it‟s important in the sense of being able to recognize it. It is simple to
pass on the Authority of Generator and Emotional being. It doesn‟t mean that it‟s
simple for them to resolve whatever the dilemmas are of their own not-self. But it‟s
very straightforward. And you don‟t have to go into a vast study to figure it out. For
most Emotional people that I meet professionally, it‟s simply a matter of reminding
them what they already know. They know they operate in waves, they know they go
up and down, they know they go from crisis to joy. It isn‟t a big deal to suggest to
them that it might be a good idea not to jump to conclusions at any given moment.
But that‟s not the same as being someone with Splenic Authority or G Authority or
Ego Authority or no Authority. For those beings it‟s not just simply a matter of „trust
your hunches,‟ because they won‟t. Because like me, like anyone, like any rational
being they‟ll say, “But how do I know I can trust this when I don‟t even really know
what it means.” Because that‟s the thing about the Spleen, it‟s not articulate. It‟s
just some kind of warning system. And you don‟t even know what it is.
Somebody comes up to me and says, “Can I talk to you?” and I say, “No.” And I
don‟t know why I‟m saying no. It‟s just what comes out spontaneously in the mo-
ment, my Spleen connected to my Throat, there it goes. And I think after I‟ve said
no and I‟m accused of being rude again, why did you say “No, it‟s the Spleen.” Ten
minutes later they can come up to me and say, “Can I talk with you?” and I say,
“Yeah, sure,” it‟s the same thing. I don‟t know why. It‟s not for knowing why. I‟ve
had to surrender to my Spleen which means that you really have to surrender be-
cause what to do. I‟m not going to second-guess my Spleen and the way in which it
operates. It doesn‟t argue. I can‟t get into some kind of discussion with it about this
or that.
I don‟t fully understand what it means when it gives a signal. Why did it say no?
Did it say no because those people 30 seconds later were going to sneeze and I was
going to end up catching a cold? Why was my immune system protecting me in that
particular moment from that encounter, was there something? Or was it what I
could do to them? Was I actually protecting them in that particular moment from
something that may have come out of me and gone into them? I have no idea. I
just know that I trust the integrity of it because I see the wiring.
This is the way in which I am intended to have an Authority so I don‟t get into a
mental trip about “I don‟t get it.” There are things that I don‟t get about it. There
are, they happen too fast. And I‟ve been paying attention for a long time now. I‟ve

gotten to layers of my intuition that I was never aware of before. But there are still
things that happened so fast I don‟t get it, they just fly by. It‟s different when you‟re
operating within the nuances.
Living Out the Nuances
So, one of the things to keep in mind about this is that if you are one of this 13%
that has some kind of variation on the theme, then it‟s very important for you to look
deep into it, to understand it, to understand the way you‟re wired, to understand
what you not simply should trust, but must trust. And in recognizing what it is, allow
it to come out. And you‟re supported in the fact that if you‟re operating according to
your Strategy, you‟re not succumbing to your mind‟s control in the decision making
process. You do have an opportunity to be able to live out your nuance of the way in
which that Authority operates.
In most cases it is Projectors. There are a lot of Projectors. About 22% of the hu-
man population is Projectors. And with the exception of a couple of percent that are
Mental Projectors, this is an enormous slice of humanity. They‟re the ones that have
so many of these different variations. Again, it goes back to that the Projector is not
here to be concerned about themselves. They‟re here to truly grasp the other. And
these nuances of Authority, that so many of them are Projector nuances of Authority,
are perhaps the only ways in which they can maintain their true nature under the
powerful conditioning of the forces they take in, in the way in which they operate in
the world.
The Sacral and the Emotional Beings
Authority is obviously a very important subject. For me, though, it comes back to
the majority. That is, to the Sacral and to the Emotional. If we could get the Sacral
and Emotional beings to operate according to their Authority, the whole world would
go through a transformation. I‟m not such a dreamer, so I have no expectation of
that. But it‟s so clear that this is what it is all about because these are the frequen-
cies that we all live in in our conditioned world. We live in a world created by Gene-
rators and imbued with the wave frequency of Emotional beings. This is our world,
an up and down frustrated world that is the by-product of Sacral and Emotional be-
ings not operating correctly.
It‟s not like the rest of us, the 13% who have all these variations because we have to
compensate for not having these powerful forces as part of our nature. It‟s not us
who are going to make any difference in the frequency of the planet. It‟s them; it‟s
you who are Generators, who are Emotional. And this is where these authorities are
so profound and so important. When Emotional Generators and other Emotional be-
ings get the message, this is the healing process at work, this is the transformation
of humanity that‟s at work.

Authority
Inner Authority
So, Authority, Inner Authority is something that is one of the bedrocks of this know-
ledge, to have your Strategy, to have your Inner Authority, to understand your Defi-
nition. All of this allows you to be able to see yourself in your bodygraph. And it‟s
something to do, to see you in the bodygraph, to see the „you‟ that‟s hardwired,
that‟s ready to fulfill its purpose, to see the „you‟ that is vulnerable and open and
what that leads to. To see what clearly is your Authority, where it comes from, why
it‟s there, what you need to know about it, and then just simply to live it. That‟s
what this knowledge is all about. It‟s about Living Your Design. It‟s only then that
the quantum emerges. It‟s only then that your uniqueness emerges, the beauty of
what it is to be you, the beauty of what it is to have an Authority that truly you can
trust. Trust that it is going to give you what is correct for you, a life that is yours,
decisions that are yours. And all of that opens up the possibility for the transcen-
dence of your mind, the ability of your mind to be able to let go of the mundane and
to enter into the domain of the passenger, the true passenger, to experience the
beauty of what it is to be here as you.
The themes we have looked at today, this is Human Design, your Definition leading
to what is your Type, your Strategy and your Authority. You don‟t need anything
else. These are the basic truths; this is what sets you on the path to being able to
live as yourself and not by anybody else‟s influence, but in your own experimenta-
tion, in your own empirical experimentation, step-by-step verification. The clearer
you are about what‟s there in your chart and what‟s not there in your chart, the eas-
ier it is for you to verify your process and each step of verification and strength to
your capacity to stay with the process.
As I say at the end of all my opportunities to teach this knowledge: Follow your
Strategy and Authority. That‟s as basic as it gets.

Living Your Design
Hello to all of you and welcome to today‟s adventure. The title may be a little mis-
leading because I don‟t really want the title to be misconstrued as having anything to
do with the Living Your Design program; it‟s just really an expression, what it is to
really live the Design. There‟s something that I‟ve met in my many years of teach-
ing. Human Design is really a cornucopia of knowledge. In fact, the knowledge base
is really vast. Depending on your intellectual capacities or tastes you can end up
wandering in the forest of information that is there in Human Design. I‟ve watched a
lot of people be caught up in the ability to be able to break through and see some-
thing, what‟s revealed in the bodygraph, be able to look in at things almost voyeuris-
tically, to be able to point at things and see them for what they are. Aha, the gate of
crisis or whatever it may be.
But to live your Design is what it really is about, not to necessarily learn about De-
sign. Learning about Design has a very different purpose than living it. Living it re-
quires, in most cases, no vast education. The moment I talk about living what it is
to be your Design, obviously I can only talk about that relative to any given Type.
Each Type has a unique way in which they live out their Design, but to live it out is
the point. The point is not necessarily to learn about it, to go into the detail, to un-
derstand the depth of it. It is true for some, but not for all. And the very value in-
herent in the knowledge is limited to what is relative to each particular Type.
My concern is that in the pursuit of truth you do not live it, in the pursuit of under-
standing to grasp power, that you miss the point. The point is to live it. And to live
it is about a commitment to what can only be taken in psychologically as an experi-
ment. I always speak in the language of experiment, it is a logical language. Every-
thing about mechanics is logical and leads to logical solutions, what we end up call-
ing Strategy and Inner Authority. But it is in following the logic, entering into the
experiment, that this language experiment is so that you can get to what experiment
is intended to lead to, proof or disproof. That‟s the whole thing about experiment—
does it work or doesn‟t it? And the only way you‟re going to realize that it works or
doesn‟t is if you enter into that experiment completely. It‟s the point.
The Generator
Obviously, there are differences. We begin with the Generator. This is a Generator
world. It is generated breath-by-breath by all the Generators on the planets, the
billions of them, nearly 4 billion Generators on the planet. That‟s a lot of Generators.

DESIGN CONCEPTS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
They are the life force, and as such they have the most immediate and most natural
Strategy—just to respond. If you‟re going to be a Generator in this life and you have
a chance to avoid all of the accumulated frustration you have gathered in the resis-
tance that you have met in your life, the frustration that has been empowered by
your not-self so that you‟re in dysfunctional careers, dysfunctional relationships, dys-
functional within yourself. And if you want to get rid of that, which one would as-
sume, it‟s very simple. You have to enter into the expe-
riment of living it: Live Your Design. You‟re a Generator,
you‟re here to respond. You‟re not here to initiate,
you‟re here to be in touch with the source of your power
and the center of your truth which is your Sacral. It‟s a
noisy machine.
Living Your Design is not about “Well, why should I do
that?” or „Why does that work?” If you don‟t know why
you should do it you shouldn‟t be there in the first place.
Your life is a mess, so you go searching for something,
anything. But you don‟t have to know why it works as a
goad to thinking it will work. This is not sheep know-
ledge. This is not where it‟s „do as I do.‟ This is the be-
ginning of learning that you have a potential to be differ-
ent, to be unique. Human beings have no idea about
what the potential of their uniqueness is; none. And it‟s not like you have to spend
months and months and months investigating, looking into, and studying because
the truth is if you live it you‟ll see it for what it is right away.
It‟s not like I‟m opposed to people being educated in Human Design; it‟s a wonderful
thing to teach and to learn. But that‟s secondary. Everything about this knowledge
is about it is in service of the other. It is for the unique fulfillment of purpose. And
you don‟t get there if you cannot enter into the experiment because there is no place
to go. There is so much conditioning, there is so much not-self. This is a dense ho-
mogenized plane that we live on. And we are ruled by mind, by the not-self mind
and its decision making power over us. And if you‟re a Generator and you think that
mental masturbation is going to set you free, it will not. It‟ll just be another deep
frustration in a life, because the mind cannot resolve the mind‟s problem. It can‟t.
The mind is caught up in its own distorted agenda, rooted in your openness, control-
ling you through your not-self fears. And if you‟re a Generator, there is only one
thing you can do—live your Design, don‟t talk it; do the walk.
It‟s about living it. There is nothing like the experience of the recognition of the va-
lidity of the way. For a Generator this is possible at every breath, the profoundest
example of an energy being. You don‟t have to chase after anything. It‟s your mind
that chases. You don‟t have to initiate anything. It‟s your mind that wants you to
initiate. It‟s your mind that‟s pulling you around by a chain to your nose. And it
doesn‟t do any good to know all this if you don‟t live it. That‟s a perversity, because
when you live it, you see it, you experience it. You can verify the value; you can
recognize that it is a truth for you. It‟s yours, after all; it‟s your experiment. Your
experiment takes this knowledge and makes it unique. It‟s the point.

Living Your Design
For Generators that are a majority on this planet, they‟re the ones who have this in-
stant access to the possibility of being correct. But it‟s an experiment and you have
to stay there, and the longer that you stay there, the clearer your process. The
longer you stay there, the deeper the transformation that takes place within you
physically, cellularly; it takes time. Adults are so deeply conditioned. It isn‟t going
to do you any good to think about being a Generator and then go ahead and initiate
things. It‟s not like you get special points because you know and you do nothing
about it.
It‟s the thing I‟ve never been able to understand about Generators. It was my naïve
assumption that when I was given this information I would just go out and tap a Ge-
nerator on the shoulder and say, “Here is the magic bullet,” and boom, instanta-
neously they‟d be transformed. Boy was I ever mistaken. How deep, how deep,
how deep is the ignorance and resistance within the Generator and their mental
complex. The power of the not-self, what happens to the Generator with its envelop-
ing aura, how deeply it takes in the conditioning, absorbs all of the conditioning, re-
cycles it through its Sacral Center.
If there is a homogenized field that we all live in it is created by Generators. If you
don‟t live it, there is no transformation and it‟s not like you have to be a rocket
scientist to figure out what this means, because it isn‟t. It is a strategic technique; it
is a mechanical thing, nothing more, nothing less than responding. And not res-
ponding with your mind, responding out of your Sacral; live it.
It takes courage. And courage isn‟t something that you can just find. The moment
you try to step out of the homogenized field, the moment you try to live out what it
is to be abnormal, this takes an enormous amount of dedication. It‟s a long process.
If you enter into the experiment of Human Design you‟re looking at, in essence, a
seven-year experiment to truly get to the results. Ask anybody who‟s been through
it; they‟ll tell you. That‟s not some small commitment. It isn‟t, it‟s seven years. It‟s
a whole cellular cycle. But this is the only way that transformation is going to come
into your life. The intellectual part of your life, the Personality part of your life, this
is not going to bring you transformation. It is not you. It‟s this homogenized imper-
sonation that you live out, but it‟s not you.
The Manifestor
Let‟s shift for a moment and think about the Manifestor; an energy Type. Yet, it‟s an
energy Type that doesn‟t have a defined Sacral Center; something totally different in
that sense. And Manifestors, in many ways, do not really have a legitimate Strategy.
They have basically a protection technique. That is, the Strategy of informing. If
you‟re a Manifestor you‟re not really interested in all this stuff; not really. It‟s not
like you have to study it; but you do have to live it. Informing gives the Manifestor
power that it thought it had long, long ago had lost. Informing takes away the pu-
nishment, but you have to do it. If you don‟t enter into the experiment, if you don‟t
start informing, it isn‟t going to happen.

DESIGN CONCEPTS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
It may seem like an obvious, but I watch people. They come into Human Design,
they learn a little bit of this, they learn a little bit of that and I watch them, and
they‟re not operating correctly. And it‟s not like that‟s me sitting in judgment of
them, it‟s simply that they‟re still not-self; what to do.
What to do, it‟s the power of the mind. Your mind holds
you hostage all the time. And I see how in these beings
there is part of them, this earnestness in really wanting
to do something with their lives, and at the same time
they have been through whatever the knowledge could
reveal to them of their Design and recognize its inherent
truth, they want to do something about it, but they don‟t.
They dabble, sort of.
If you don‟t live it, it‟s the commitment to the experi-
ment. It isn‟t about anything else. It‟s about making the
commitment to the experiment. And let your mind do
whatever your mind does, but you make the commitment
to the experiment because otherwise there is no value in
any of this for you. It‟s extraordinary to learn Human Design as you live your own,
because then you take in the information and the way it‟s intended to be taken in.
Instead of the details you‟re looking at now is the acute perception that can come
later. How different is your understanding of the mechanics when you yourself are
mechanically correct but to live it.
The Projector
It is most difficult for the Projector, truly. It is most
difficult because for the Projector there is no instant
gratification to Strategy. A Manifestor any time
they‟re ready can inform before they act. The Gene-
rator has a moment-by-moment-by-moment-by-
moment opportunity to respond to life, to what‟s
going on. But Projectors, 22% of humanity, are a
non-energy Type. They are non-Sacral. They do not
consistently manifest. That means that you cannot
say to a Projector with its Strategy of invitation, just
sit here and wait for the invitation.
Generators always think that they‟re being imprisoned
because they have to respond, they have to wait to
respond. But for a Generator the time span is usually
seconds between opportunities to respond. That isn‟t
the case for the Projector. It‟s different. It‟s why Jo-
vian has a Projector Endowment. It is in the Projector‟s very nature, it is in essence,
an aspect of their Strategy to understand the system, to go deep into it, and to go
deep into the system in order to understand the other. It‟s not so easy for them to
live their Design.

LECTURE SEVEN
Living Your Design
When a Projector enters into Human Design, yes, there‟s the obvious, there are invi-
tations. And they can begin to recognize how important those invitations are, that
they begin to see how they need to be able to deal with those invitations; they may
be an Emotional Projector or a Splenic Projector, whatever the case may be. But the
real Strategy for them in the first years of their process is the knowledge itself. And
this is a commitment to an experiment in education; truly. An experiment in educa-
tion, an experiment in learning the mechanics of the way in which the other oper-
ates. It takes Projectors—look at their aura, the way it focuses outwards—it takes
Projectors a very long time to really begin to see themselves. It isn‟t of interest to
them; it isn‟t.
The only Design, the only Type that is designed to look inward is a Generator. And
so they should because they‟re messing everything up, and they should look in as
deep as they can. But that is not true for the Projector; they look out. Their aura
focuses in on the other leaving them very vulnerable. If you‟re a Projector, you have
to live your limitation, your Design, like everyone else. But you need to go deep into
the knowledge. You need to study; you need to understand how the other works.
And as you‟re going along in that process, every once in awhile there are going to be
the invitations. And they will allow you time after time to align yourself to what is
correct for you. But you have to live it from the beginning, from the start. Only Pro-
jectors are forgiven for diving headlong deep, deep into the knowledge before they‟re
actually correct.
The Reflector
When it comes to Reflectors, they‟re something quite
different after all. They really are. Not just that they
are a large minority, but they are different with a very
different cycle, a lunar cycle. But the most important
thing for a Reflector is to understand its relationship to
the program. And you can see thematically in non-
energy Types that living their Design actually means
studying in many ways, being educated in their Design.
Whereas living the Design for the energy Types is
something that is there to be leapt into instantaneously
and immediately, because it‟s possible.
There is a different way in which the process works.
You know the story of the tortoise and the hare, be-
cause it‟s one of those cute stories. You have what ap-
pears to be the energy Types racing ahead, racing into
living out their Design. But in fact, we‟re all on a seven-year cycle. And though it
looks like the energy Types race ahead in the end everybody gets there at the same
time, it‟s a seven-year cycle.

DESIGN CONCEPTS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
The entering in for the Projector is a different process, that‟s all, or for the Reflector,
a different process, a different way in which they need to enter into living their De-
sign, which means not so much living their Design, but being focused on understand-
ing, knowing, making sense of Design in others. And for the Reflector, to under-
stand the deep impact of the program, of the planets, specially of the moon, of the
way in which they are conditioned by the general programming field and how they
have a special gift of connecting to it and to be able to see their life lived in the har-
mony of their relationship to the turning of the wheel.
But everything having to do with the legitimacy of involvement in this knowledge is
just simply living it. And whether that means the active principle that is there in the
energy Type, or the passive principle that is there in the non-energy Types, it is the
same thing. It is about the commitment to the process. This is what brings trans-
formation and it brings something much more important. That is, I have a number
of goals as a teacher. One of them is to take the burden off of the shoulders of
those beings who meet this knowledge because I think at the very simplest level, at
the very rudimentary level of understanding your Design, it already helps you re-
lease yourself from so many burdens you have carried. And it‟s a great service that
it does.
At the next level is the potential of those who enter into the experiment and stay
with it. And there are those who enter into the experiment and stay with it and end
up studying Human Design. The thing that‟s important is being involved in the
process. That‟s what‟s important. That is what this is all about. The highest goal
here is awareness. Awareness means the shedding of conditioning. You cannot be
aware as long as you are a conditioned being. You cannot be aware if your mind is
not-self. And awareness begins with very, very specific kinds of perceptions, percep-
tions that cut through the maia, perceptions that cut through the projection expecta-
tion identification fields. It‟s what happens to you when you first learn mechanics
and you look at a bodygraph and you seem to have a sense of it. You‟re cutting
through one of the layers of the maia. And in cutting through that you begin to open
up your eyes to what is there and what you are and what the potential of it can be.
As you enter into the knowledge base, slowly the possible is there for you to become
aware, not simply of yourself, but aware of the other, aware of your circumstances,
aware of the conditions, aware of the environment that you are in. And you cannot
be aware if your mind is preoccupied with the nonsense, absurdities, banalities and
sufferings of the not-self life. You can‟t. There is no awareness when the not-self
mind is at work. It‟s not possible. There are only agendas, only agendas rooted in
the openness, rooted in whatever the trip is that‟s built into the way in which a being
is conditioned. To live your Design is to save yourself from the horror of the not-self.
And the thing that is so horrifying about the not-self is that it is so homogenized that
you don‟t really have an understanding about how bad it is and how far away you are
from the potential of what you can be.

Living Your Design
Example Chart
So I brought up a little example for us to look at today [image below]. It‟s always
interesting to look at human beings, I love looking at bodygraphs. When you‟re
looking at this being, there are some things to notice. The first thing that you‟ll no-
tice is that there are three different areas of Definition. You have the Head Center
connected to the Ajna Center. Then it‟s cut off and you have the Throat connected
to the G Center. Then it‟s cut off and you have the Heart Center going down to the
Solar Plexus system. So you have somebody who is a triple Split Definition. You
have a triple Split Definition and there are three open centers. I don‟t care what you
know about Human Design in the sense of looking at the gates and the channels and
you can come with this person is
a „this‟ or a „that‟ or the other. I
only see the not-self. If you‟re
not going to live your Design
you‟re going to be not-self.
That‟s an absolute. There is no
half pregnant in any of that. It‟s
an absolute. So, if you‟re not
going to live your Design then
you‟re going to be not-self.
So, what is this person going to
be because this person is not-
self? The first thing that we see
about this person is that we have
these three open centers, so let‟s
think about these open centers.
Let‟s start with the open Spleen.
Let‟s think about how disturbed this person can be. Think about this person as a ba-
by. If you want to master Human Design always look at a chart first from the pers-
pective of an infant. You look at this chart as if it was a baby‟s chart, what do you
see? You see a baby that is deeply, deeply insecure. It‟s got an undefined immune
system. It‟s deeply insecure. It has no consistent way of feeling secure. So this is a
baby that is naturally going to be very clingy. It‟s going to hold on.
Let‟s say the mother has a defined Spleen or defines the Spleen of the child, then
what do you get? You get this child that is deeply dependent on the mother, be-
cause what does that open Spleen do? That open Spleen amplifies the defining of
the mother. You have a baby that is absolutely dependent on that mother and when
that mother tries to pull away that child screams and screams and screams and
screams, and does everything in its power to pull that mother back. And it has wea-
pons, because if the mother doesn‟t come back right away it releases its emotional
crisis machine. It puts out an emotional wave that is so powerful it can make the
mother weep.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

Do you begin to see who this not-self person is? Think about this person, think
about whom and what they‟re going to hold on to and the way they‟re going to hold
on to it. Then there is a problem, they‟re a triple split. If you‟re a triple split and
you‟re going to have to live correctly in this life, it‟s very difficult for you to have one
relationship that you lock on to and hold on to. Chances are you‟re going to end up
breaking that bond sooner than later. And this is somebody who has the 6.3. It‟s
very easy to break that bond—bonds made and broken.
So you have this person who is going to want to hold on to someone, cling to them
and then not be able to stand it. Their not-self mind is going to think that way. It‟s
going to think it is insecure; it‟s going to think it‟s in trouble; it‟s going to think it‟s
afraid. It‟s going to drive it to seek out bonds with those that it can hold on to even
if they are bad for them. And it has an undefined Sacral. This is, after all, a Projec-
tor. As an undefined Sacral, it doesn‟t know when enough is enough, and always
under pressure, this whole theme of security of pressure. And then you have all
these splits so there is no conti-
nuity in the way this person
works and they‟re a 6/2 with a
28.6 Sun; they‟re as good as
gone if you don‟t give them help.
Blaze of Glory—you can just see
them burning.
The not-self rules. When you
look at the bodygraph this way,
you just see the Definitions; you
can see who this person is, sort
of. Their Authority is Emotional,
they‟re an Emotional Projector.
So it‟s their 40/37 that is basical-
ly going to rule the way in which
they make decisions. So emo-
tionally, life for them is a bar-
gain, it must be treated as a bargain and they must wait out the wave in order for
them to be clear about what bargains. You can see that they are deeply social in
their nature. That is, they have the tribal 40/37 and the collective both abstract and
logic, the abstract 33/13, The Prodigal, the potential of the secrets out of the Fellow-
ship of Man being revealed through the 33rd gate. And they have a logical mind. It‟s
all broken up.
If they do not understand how things work, they do not understand what it means to
live their Design, because their Design for them is about movement in life. Triple
splits are here to move through life. They‟re here to move, because they need to
have many different ways in which the bridges are made between their splits in or-
der for them to truly be whole, in order for them to be able to make decisions cor-
rectly as themselves, and in this case, through this Authority of the Emotional sys-
tem.

Living Your Design
It‟s not what you get. The seven billion humans on this planet, 99.99.99.99% of
them are not-self. And this person, this openness, the splits, this is what rules this
being‟s life. This is what their life becomes. Always insecure, holding on to the
worst possible things until it all just explodes, making the worst possible bargains.
That‟s what they‟re going to live. This business about Living Your Design, it is the
whole story. There‟s only one thing that makes this being‟s life so impossible, it‟s
their mind after all. It‟s what makes any human being‟s life impossible; it‟s the
mind.
When we talk about Living Your Design, we‟re talking about living your Strategy and
Authority. What your Strategy does is that it cuts the mind off from running your
life. This is the only way to transcendence. This is the only way, let alone transcen-
dence, to living what is a decent life, a fulfilling life. You have to cut the mind off
from running the movie. Your mind is always ready to make decisions, you know
that. Why don‟t you? Don‟t you have to make a phone call, don‟t you have to do
this—you should, you must, you could, you would. Your mind babbling away about
this thing and that thing—“Oh I have to, I‟d better, tomorrow I‟m going to.”
Don‟t you understand that as long as your mind is directing your activity you can
never be whole as a person? It doesn‟t mean it has to be silent. It‟s not empty. It‟s
not about making decisions. You cannot stop your mind from looking at this and
that; it will. And even when you enter into what is correct, that is, you follow what is
your real Authority, your mind will still try. It‟s all it‟s ever known, it‟s all it‟s ever
been taught. But you take away its power to ruin your life when you live your De-
sign. Take the power away.
When I look out at the world and after all these years of teaching, it‟s the mind that
gets in everybody‟s way. It‟s the mind. It has no right to guide our lives. It
doesn‟t. It‟s not equipped for it. The deepest value of the revelation is that when
you look into the mechanics you see very clearly that the Personality has nothing to
do with the life other than to be a passenger. The rest of it is distortion and illusion.
And illusion is nothing but distorted perspective, thinking one sees what is not there.
The mind is what gets in the way of literally everything. I‟m not an anti-mind per-
son; I rather like them. They‟re beautiful things. But it‟s about the Outer Authority
of mind that I appreciate—the Outer Authority of my mind to you, the uselessness of
my mind to me when it comes to making decisions about my life, it‟s not allowed,
and it doesn‟t. I lived that horror.
This Living Your Design is almost one of these holy phrases because it is so deeply
transforming what it brings to the life, how tired one will get, incarnation after incar-
nation living out the same distorted nothingness. Uniqueness is something that is so
rare. We have become a McDonald species, just rubber-stamped. Rubber-stamped
minds, rubber-stamped bodies, rubber-stamped souls, and it‟s all this homogenized
field. You can‟t get rid of it by being intellectual and saying, “Oh, I see it. Oh, I see
over there where my distortion is. Yes, well, I‟m going to take some pills. Or I‟m
going to see my therapist, deal with that.”

DESIGN CONCEPTS
A Digital Book for Newcomers
It‟s not the way it works. There‟s only one way it works. You cut the mind off from
being your Authority. If you‟re a Generator, this is the thing that‟s the great dilem-
ma. Don‟t let your mind—your mind keeps telling you that you‟re a Manifestor. It‟s
nice to be a Generator. Cut your mind off from being the decision maker. It doesn‟t
matter what you‟re ever going to hear in this life, or what you‟ve read, in the end
what you will see is that if you go through this process you will recognize that aban-
doning the not-self is like freeing yourself from a disease, a disease that has not al-
lowed you to see your potential, life‟s potential, anything. It‟s all distorted, all ho-
mogenized.
Isn‟t it amazing how people like to comment on how human experiences are so
common? “Oh, you have the same problem I do?” Yes, and billions others because
it‟s one homogenized problem. There‟s nothing like an original; there‟s nothing like
uniqueness. This is the joy that you get to experience as yourself. The potential of
that uniqueness, the cognition that can go with that uniqueness begins with living it.
It‟s the whole point.
It‟s like those people you meet, you talk to. It‟s about giving them a key. Try it, it‟s
different, it works, you‟ll like it, try it; just do it. That‟s the whole point. It‟s the
whole point of Living Your Design. It‟s not some deep philosophy, it isn‟t. It‟s about
coming to grips with the horror of what you‟re not. It‟s coming to grips with it. It
seems to me a very, very specific binary selection. You either stay with being not-
self, thank you very much, off you go. Or you enter into the experiment. There is
no middle ground in that.
After understanding your own Design and having it pointed out to you what the not-
self brings into our life, if you‟re not ready or willing to get rid of that, what to do.
The idea that you‟re not going to live your Design and you‟re going to find out more
about it is absurd, at least from my perspective. Mondays are my heretic days [Jo-
vian radio segment in 2006], so I do get a crank on. But it really is something to
grasp.
The thing that makes all of this so incredible is that you actually live it. It‟s not one
of these damn things where you pray for it, where you hope like hell it‟ll come after
you‟ve said the mantra 8,900 times at altitude. This is just a practical thing. Any-
body can live out their nature. You just have to do it; you just have to live it.
Well, that was my stormy Monday. It‟s something that has been brought home to
me so profoundly over the last several years in the advanced courses that I‟ve been
teaching. I was always impressed with the strategic importance of the surface. But
after these last several years it is something that is so profound now, it‟s so obvious
to me that the beauty and perfection that is possible, and it‟s quite extraordinary
when you dig into it to see what is possible, that all of that in a spiral goes back to
that point of commitment to the process. It doesn‟t matter where it is, it doesn‟t
matter at what level the knowledge is, whether it is PHS or Rave Psychology, it ho-
nestly doesn‟t make any difference.

Living Your Design
The fact is that the benefits of the deepest levels of this knowledge, the differen-
tiated mind function, the opening up of the awareness potential of the Personality, all
of this begins with and is maintained, not just that it starts with it, but it is main-
tained by Strategy and Authority, because Strategy and Authority is the revolution
and the revolution is the changing of allegiance. That is, the moving away from the
Personality consciousness as the guide of the vehicle and all the illusions that come
with it, to entering into the domain of the Design Crystal consciousness and of
course it‟s capacity and Authority to run the vehicle and the life correctly.
This is what it‟s really all about, the shifting of the control mechanism over to the
Design consciousness. It is, as we are all moving towards a deep mutative point,
part of this deep mutative transition. And it is time for us to align ourselves to our
forms. This is the way it is done. All I can say to all of you is that Living Your De-
sign is something that is enormously rewarding. And offering the opportunity to oth-
ers to live their Design is truly being of service in this life.

Lecture Eight
Connecting and Conditioning
Humans are Designed to be Attracted to What We are Not
We come to one of those places in looking at the basics of Human Design where we
really come to the source of all the dilemmas, the problems, all of the things that
make it so difficult for human beings to be able to live out their nature or even be
aware of the possibility they could live out their nature. And if I guess if there is a
villain to the peace, and there is always this kind of duality I guess, then we‟re going
to have to blame it on the genes. It‟s really is really where the dilemma is for us.
I think one of the things that is evident to me about the evolutionary process of the
form principle is, in understanding the underlying themes of the form principle, to
develop the potential for cognition. In other words, the goal of the form principle is
to be able to create a viable form that can demonstrate self-reflected consciousness.
The dilemma is always the form. That is, it is a very complex thing to build, it is a
very complex thing to manage and the fact of the matter is that in order to be viable
in this kind of form, that rather than being focused on the potential of what is possi-
ble, that one is forced to deal with the consequences of being a bio-form.
And being a bio-form with a fundamental basic genetic imperative, that is, the binary
survival imperative, the survival of the individual, which is essential obviously, and
the survival of the individual long enough and healthy enough so it is able to pro-
create, then ultimately the secondary survival is the survival of the species itself. In
other words, everything about being a bio-form begins with being not alone, the
need to reproduce. And the need to reproduce leads to certain fundamental quali-
ties. That is, we are a social creature. And as a social creature we have interac-
tions, interconnections that take place all the time.
We are designed to be deeply attracted to what we are not. This is the story in a
nutshell if there ever was one. We are designed to be attracted to what we are not.
It fulfills the imperative genetically. We have a dilemma with the gene pool. The
only thing that makes a gene pool viable is when you bring together different parts
in that equation that is going to lead to the creation to something new. So, we are
inextricably caught up with the openness that is there in our bodygraph, and we are
driven to connect. Everything is about connection. And for the unaware mind, the
very act of connecting is exciting, pleasurable, habitual, addictive and ultimately a
trap. Oh, it is attractive, it is juicy.

Hanging Gates
You look at your Design. Look at the gates that are hanging there in the centers
[blue arrows]. Now there you have something to look at. They‟re hanging there
from those centers and you can imagine them as some kind of lounge lizard with its
tongue dangling waiting, breathless-
ly, longing for the other side. Those
gates where you have activation and
you don‟t have anything on the other
side; there is always this thing there.
This illusion of incompleteness, this
illusion that something is missing
and I have to have it. And if I don‟t
get it then there‟s something wrong
with me, so I want it. Look at those
gates you have hanging, look at
what‟s at the other end. “I want it.
It should be mine, I deserve it. I
need it, I‟m going to chase after it,
and I‟m going to make it happen.”
Your life becomes the pursuit of
what you‟re not at every gate, at every open center. And it‟s not like connecting or
not is a question. It isn‟t. We are born into a connective environment. We are born
into the penta of our families. We are born into connection. We are born into condi-
tioning. They are the same thing—connecting and conditioning—exactly the same
thing. It‟s just another perspective on the same process. You only connect to what
conditions you. You do not connect to anything else. You connect to what condi-
tions you. Oh, it‟s a lure.
And when you first enter into this process of Design and you‟re first introduced to the
meaning of that openness in you, what you don‟t often see is what you do to the
other in the way the other does to you. It‟s a kind of perverse do-unto-others trip.
Because the conditioner of you, you are the conditioner of them, which is why we
have dysfunctional relationships, dysfunctional families and on and on.
What I have for you today is that I‟m going to take you through an analytical jour-
ney. The surface of two beings and what happens to them in terms of how they will
perceive the other, meet the other, be conditioned by the other.
The First Chart
It‟s always nice to just sit back and look at and breathe in a bodygraph [below]. It
remains the most magical graphic aspect of this new knowledge. And there is so
much information to be gleaned from that image before you ever go near all of the
data; there is so much of it, there are so many things you can look at, so many
things that can distract you from what it‟s all about.

Connecting and Conditioning
First of all, connecting/conditioning—let‟s talk about for a moment what this person
is going to be interested in. They‟re going to be interested in someone who is going
to condition their Ego. They‟re going to be interested in Ajna and Head Center, men-
tal conditioning. It‟s attractive to them. This is the kind of person that is going to
like somebody with a fixed mind because it gives them this illusion of certainty.
Here is somebody who is going to ride the Ego to be able to show their worthiness.
They want somebody who is going to see them as worthy. They want somebody
who is going to be, and make to them, the promise of the vow. They want some-
body who is mentally strong. This is what they‟re interested in [pink arrows below].
Interested
in:
Split Definition
Of course, in this particular case we are dealing with a Split Definition. And in deal-
ing with the Split Definition there is something to understand about splits, because
we‟re looking at connecting conditioning. About 45% of humanity is a simple Split
Definition. In other words, like this Design. In this Design you have two parts. You
have this system here that runs from the Emotional system and then up to the
Throat. Then cut off from all of that you have the 18/58. So you have two parts
[purple circles above] that are defined and they‟re separate from each other—a sim-

ple split. But remember, 45% of humanity, that‟s a lot of people. That‟s about 3
billion human beings are Split Definitions.
The most important thing for a Split Definition is to feel whole. It‟s more important
than anything else. And Split Definitions by their very nature need the other, need
the other in order to make the bridges that give them that sense of wholeness. How
many ways can we bridge this split? If you look here at the 16th gate, the 16th gate
will bridge the two parts of the split together. The 57th gate will bridge it, the 50th
gate will bridge it, and the 9th gate will bridge it [blue arrows]. Four different places
in which this Split Definition can be
bridged. And those bridges become
so attractive.
Think about how attractive they be-
come. Think about what I men-
tioned; this dangling gate, never ful-
filled, never complete and not just
any dangling gate, a dangling gate
that points towards wholeness. “Oh,
if I only had this I would be whole.”
Have what? Talent? Intuition?
Sense of responsibility? The focus?
“I want a talented focus intuitive re-
sponsible partner,”—keynotes.
“That‟s what I‟m looking for. I‟m
looking for that talented, intuitive,
responsible, focused person.” If you did a survey with this person and asked them
the kind of person they were looking for a mate. “Well, I want a talented, intuitive,
responsible, focused person. Thank you very much.” You want exactly what you‟re
not, and to be conditioned by exactly what you‟re not.
And of course, the fact that this is a Split Definition, the fact that these themes are
out there screaming, on top of that you have the open centers and all of this is the
way in which this person thinks, they way they reason, the way they make decisions
with their mind. They have an open Ego. It‟s very important for them to prove their
worthiness. How do they prove their worthiness? By finding somebody that is ta-
lented, intuitive, responsible and focused. That‟s how they can prove their worthi-
ness. At least, that‟s what they‟ll think.
Remember, we‟re talking about connecting. We‟re talking about the way in which
the not-self is going to look for the other. And you can see that this is not this per-
son looking for the other—and we‟ll talk about that—this is the not-self mind that‟s
been given the power to make decisions in this person‟s life basing those decisions
on what it‟s not, and the deep attractiveness that it brings.
There is an undefined Ajna Center. This is somebody whose not-self Strategy is to
pretend that they‟re certain. And what are they certain of, what are they pretending
they‟re certain of? They‟re pretending they‟re certain that if they find that talented,

Connecting and Conditioning
intuitive, responsible, focused person everything is going to be ok, because that‟s
what they need, because that will make them feel worthy.
Human beings, we are caught in the trap of what we‟re not. Look at your relation-
ships. Look at the conditioning that you take in. If you‟re a Split Definition, look at
those bridges. This is the way the not-self is brought into not-self relationships and
its attendant problems. And it‟s not like conditioning truly is bad. It is conditioning
that is the result of and the continuation of the way in which the mind makes deci-
sions that‟s bad. It is interesting and impossible to avoid connecting to the differ-
ence in us; it‟s what we‟re for after all.
When I look at the openness in a Design what I simply see are receptors. And it is a
matter of perception and awareness whether those receptors become nothing more
than a conditioning that turns the frequency of the whole into a distortion, or their
receptors to allow us to witness with distance, with a different perspective, of what
we are not, to learn from it, to become wise through it.
But you can only live with conditioning, you can only connect in purity if the mind is
cut off from decision making. There is no other way. And this being is unaware, this
being is not awake. It‟s just another one of those billions upon billions upon billions
of human beings who operate as not-self and seek out connecting to the other based
on that.
An Emotional Manifesting Generator
This is an Emotional Manifesting Generator. And a Generator is a Generator is a Ge-
nerator. To being with, everything about this being, because it is a pure Emotional
Generator, this direct connection,
channel of intimacy, here is some-
body that carries with them a great
deal of sexual and intimate power.
The 59/6, the Channel of Intimacy,
bonding, mating [blue arrow]; the
35/36, the Channel of Sexual Talent
[green arrow] in terms of sexuality,
the Channel of Transition, the crisis
of inexperience leading to expe-
rience. Let‟s try out the Kama Sutra,
let‟s get hurt. All of those are a pos-
sibility in this.
And yet, at the same time to realize
that the only way in which this is
going to operate correctly and the
only way this being is going to be able to enter into a relationship that is truly going
to be an aware and correct relationship, is going to come over time because there is
no truth in the now. It is going to have to be a decision that is rooted in the Emo-

tional system and most of all has to come as a response. Only then can this being
begin to operate correctly. Only then can this being be freed from the power of the
not-self. Only then will this being be freed from this “I have to have. I have to have
the talented, intuitive, responsible and focused person. I have to.” It‟s gone. It
doesn‟t mean that the connection to this potential disappears, but the relationship
changes.
This is a classic example. You look at this channel here [green arrow]. This is a
beautiful channel to look at. It‟s a logical channel, a logical stream of judgment.
The 48th gate [blue arrow], the well, the gate of depth; the 16th gate [pink arrow],
enthusiasm, the gate of skills and together they form the Channel of Talent. So
think about this human being. They‟ve got the 48, they‟ve got depth, they have
judgmental depth, but they do not
have the other side. So what do
they think is important in their lives?
It‟s a horrendous joke. I‟ve been
there; by the way, I have the same
configuration. I have the 48, no 16.
You go looking for skills. You think
the answer is skills. You think the
skills are more important than your
depth. As a matter of fact, you
think the skills are everything, and
that‟s what you look for and that‟s
what you admire.
This is the trap. If you have the 16
and you have all these potential
skills that can be manifested in this
life, what do you do? You study and do nothing, because you think the study is what
it‟s all about. “I‟ve got to be deep, got to be deep, got to be deep.” This is what
happens to us. And it‟s not like it starts when you‟re 40. It starts the moment you
come into the world. This is what conditioning is all about. It is instantaneously
there. It is the maia. You‟re conditioned by the people around you, you‟re condi-
tioned by the program, and you‟re conditioned by all of these things.
We are a species that appears to operate from the mental plane. It appears. And all
of our conditioning is based on using these minds to guide our lives. You‟re not
taught anything else. When you‟re growing up nobody says to you, “Look, don‟t
make that decision with your mind.” If you heard an adult say that to you without
understanding the context, you‟d think they were crazy. What are you talking
about? Everybody is trained to use their mind. Think about it, mull it over, process
it, meditate; this is the way everybody is raised. This is what everybody accepts is a
truth that they don‟t question at any level. “My mind decides. I‟ve decided that.”
What a trap; how deep that is.
What rules the mind is fear. This is what the not-self is built on. The not-self of this
person says, “Listen to the way I decide or you‟re going to end up feeling unworthy,
as usual. The only way we‟re going to be worthy is if we get this or that or the other

Connecting and Conditioning
thing.” The not-self mind makes decisions at every single conceivable level of your
life. It‟s always there. And as long as you‟re being ruled by that mind, these spaces,
these bridge points that are there, you‟re never learning anything, you‟re being con-
trolled, you‟re being manipulated, and you‟re being conditioned.
Everything about Human Design is about decision making. This is its great practical
value. And it is about taking decision making away from this side of the graph [Per-
sonality] and transferring it over to this side [Design], because that‟s really what
we‟re doing. What we‟re doing is that we‟re trading in a dysfunctional Personality
that cannot direct this life, that has
no capacity to direct this life be-
cause it is overwhelmed with being
not-self, and it cannot cure itself
from that. It‟s not like it‟s to
blame. Personality has its role,
truly a beautiful role, but it cannot
exercise that gift because it is
caught up in the not-self because it
has this responsibility to make de-
cisions in the life.
We‟re in a time of mutation and
change. And in this time of muta-
tion and change one of the basic
changes is the way in which we
make decisions because we turn it
over to the Design consciousness, we turn it over to the vehicle‟s consciousness and
we take decision making away from the mind. Only then can the not-self begin to
collapse. How different it is to make decisions based on the distortion that the not-
self brings. And to make decisions based on what is natural.
Think about this being, this is a 5/1. This is somebody who has a heretic Personality.
This is somebody who is going to be projected on that they could be this and that
and the other. And if they blow it, their reputation takes a beating. You have to see
that when you‟re thinking about yourself, you have to begin to see that you have
been set up in life to connect in certain ways, and to transform those certain ways
into things that you seek and admire and emulate. This person can never be skillful.
It doesn‟t mean that this person cannot, over a lifetime obviously, learn different
skills. But being skillful is not their thing anymore than being intuitive is their thing.
It‟s not. And do you want to trust somebody else‟s intuition to run your life, the am-
plified variation of somebody‟s 57 that this person is going to be attracted to that‟s
not their intuition at all?
You have to think about how we turn that all around, how the not-self turns this into
something that‟s so important that they want. They need to be more intuitive. They
take intuitive classes. “I need to develop my intuition. It‟s one of the skills that I
need to develop. I really need to learn how to be more responsible. I just don‟t
know how to focus. I have to learn how to focus.” So what are important things in
life? This is person is being interviewed and they say, “Well, what are those things

that are important in life.” And they say, “Well, to be focused, responsible, intuitive
and skillful. This is the secret to my success in life.” What an incredible joke. Hu-
man beings as commedia dell‟arte, in the mask of the not-self—the true being is
never visible.
The Second Chart: A Projector
Let‟s look at the other side of the story. You look at a chart like this [below right]
and right away you go, “Oh!” First of all we‟re dealing with a Projector, so right
away we have something very basic to consider. On one side we have the Generator
and on the other side we have this gap here [open Sacral]. As a matter of fact, it‟s
not just there, it‟s here [open Solar Plexus] as well. Of course, we‟re dealing with a
non-energy Type.
So, let‟s begin with a basic lesson. There are all kinds of levels of conditioning. But
one of the most obvious levels of conditioning is simply Type related. About two-
thirds of humanity, something like 67% of humanity are Generators. Another 22%
are Projectors. And the remaining 10 or 11% is divided between the Manifestors and
the Reflectors. The vast majority of humanity, about 90% of humanity is Genera-
tor/Projector. A Projector is a non-energy Type, so the moment that a Projector is
around a Generator they are naturally attracted to the energy, as we are naturally
attracted by our openness to anything that is defined. But of course, here we are
dealing with a very, very profound influence.
There is nothing that breeds more problems than to have Generators with non-Sacral
beings, because quite literally it is so different and there is so much conditioning that
is involved. The classic example is simply the pattern of the life energy. You have a
Generator/Projector partnership. They go through their day; they get to the even-
ing, Generators crank until they drop. This is the nature of Generators. So, this Ge-
nerator is going to keep on going until it‟s finished.

Connecting and Conditioning
The Projector is going to be taking in that generative aura, it‟s going to be taking in
that enveloping aura, it‟s going to be amplifying that Sacral Center, it is going to be
riding on an amplified wave of that energy system. And that Projector is going to be
riding that wave to a point that it will go way beyond what is a healthy time for it, for
example, to go to sleep. And even-
tually that leads to all kinds of psy-
chological and physical problems as a
result of not being able to properly
rest, let alone that in most cases
couples sleep in the same bed. And
of course, you have the auric conta-
mination, literally, while these two
begins are unconscious, this being
taking in the brunt of the condition-
ing.
I know what that‟s like. I can re-
member, because I had a number of
marriages with Emotional partners
and I can remember mornings wak-
ing up, and I have an undefined Sa-
cral and Emotional system, with an energy in me that I had no idea where it came
from. If my partner happened to have a nightmare or a bad dream experience just
the rush out of that Emotional system permeating my aura and amplifying it and
leaving me with all the residue and I would wake up in the morning.
So, to begin with you have very, very fundamental conditioning here because you
have this crossing of Generator and Projector. For me, Generator/ Projector is an
alliance on the non-intimate plane. This is not about the ideal of some kind of inti-
mate sexual relationship. In fact, the ideal is Generators with Generators, and Pro-
jectors with Projectors, for that matter. That is the ideal. That‟s not necessarily
something easy to achieve because of course, the not-self rules. And the one thing
that the not-self doesn‟t like is sameness.
I‟ll tell you a wonderful story about sameness. It was in the summer of 1992 and I
did a number of trainings, the very first trainings that I did. In one of those groups
there were four people and two of them were women who were the same age; they
had exactly the same birth date, though they were born on different sides of the At-
lantic they had the same birth date. They were born a couple hours apart given time
differentiation. They had both been through very similar environments at the same
time. They had both been sannyasins in Poona at the same time. They had never
met.
And there they are sitting, actually they weren‟t sitting beside each other, there was
someone in the middle. But there they were. The fact was, if you looked at their
Designs, they were, on the surface, quite literally the same. I think there was only
one difference, and a big difference; I think there was a Design moon that was dif-
ferent. But nonetheless, it was basically the same chart. They didn‟t recognize each

other. They had crossed the same paths over and over and over again, did not rec-
ognize each other because genetically it‟s not interesting.
So, it‟s very easy for me to say that the goal of a successful bond is one that‟s
rooted in companionship. Companionship in Partnership Analysis is when both
people have the same channel. So, if you‟re looking at companionship the fact is if
you brought those people together
they wouldn‟t actually find each oth-
er very interesting. That‟s the point.
This is how the genes rule us.
The one thing that would be so har-
monious for us, for example, as a
Manifestor I know what it‟s like—I‟m
surrounded by Generators so I‟m
always dealing with a very, very dif-
ferent kind of frequency. I have a
number of male Manifestor friends.
What I really enjoy in their company
is how we all move in the same way.
And you can feel it. You can feel the
energy. There is something very
familiar. It‟s the same thing you
learn over years in working with your own Design and knowing the Design of others,
you begin to see things that you enjoy. People with certain centers you like having
around. There are all these kinds of things that you begin to build up, that are the
same as yours.
So, for example, if you‟re somebody who has a fixed mind, it is much easier for you
to deal with people who have fixed minds than it is to deal with people who don‟t
have fixed minds. There are all kinds of different configurations. I have a defined
Ego. It is easier for me to deal with people who have strong Egos. It is these things
you begin to see. But unfortunately, similarity doesn‟t click that hormonal excited—
all of that stuff. And of course, this is one of the things to see that ultimately if we
begin to truly operate through what is our Strategy so that we do entitle our Inner
Authority to its rightful position, that slowly but surely you can align yourself to what
is correct and you can align yourself to relationships that are correct for you.
Single Definition
So, anyway, let‟s take a look at our Projector and let‟s take a look at the dilemma of
the not-self. We have a Single Definition. That‟s about 42% of human population so
it‟s the other side of the Split Definition story and everything else is the rest. Triple
splits are about 11%. Quadruple splits are rare; they‟re about 1%. So here we‟re
dealing with a Single Definition. Very self contained; a Single Definition of the dissa-
tisfaction, the eternal dissatisfaction with form, the need to constantly correct the

form [channel 18/58 & 10/57, below pink arrows]. It‟s really part of what this being
is essentially. This is a Projector that is here to be invited.
But let‟s take a look at the way in which the conditioning rules this Projector‟s life.
They have an undefined Throat, and a very, very powerful undefined Throat. When
you see a Throat like this—Bill Clinton is another example that comes to mind. You
see one of these open Throats with a tremendous number of activations, here is
somebody who is desperate for at-
tention. This is a very strong need
for attention in the life. And a very
strong need for attention that at the
same time wants to avoid confronta-
tion and truth, but still wants to be
able to prove that it‟s worthy and
never knows when enough is
enough so that it can pretend finally
that it‟s certain.
You get all of these things and all of
these keynotes as you keep on roll-
ing them around. And basically
what you get is somebody who nev-
er has enough getting attention, and
at the same time, the cleverness to
avoid the confrontation in order to achieve the worthiness. That‟s who this person
is. This is not this very lovely perfected form [channel 10/57, upper pink arrow]
going down into judgment [channel 18/58, lower pink arrow].
Female Male
Human beings are not-self. The not-self rules; and you can see how the not-self
rules. Now, do you remember, because I said it enough so it should be a mantra by
now, the skills, intuition, responsible, right? This, by the way, is the female, this De-
sign in this partnership that I‟m showing you. So you have these four things that are
there that are the bells. Oh, gee, look, there is one, there is two, and there is three
[blue arrows above]. Well, you don‟t get everything. Three out of four ain‟t bad

think they hit the jackpot because they got three out of four. This is what they‟re
attracted to.
Female Male
And you can see what this person [male] is attracted to. This is somebody who is
very attracted to the sexual, physical domain [red circle]. Fifty percent of humanity
has an undefined Emotional Center. Fifty percent of humanity is in search of plea-
sure. And in search of pleasure while they‟re trying to avoid confrontation and truth,
which is really is quite a thing to try to get to. And you can see that for this being,
because they‟re a Projector, they‟re going to be deeply, deeply attracted to an ener-
gy resource and they‟re going to be possibly very turned on by somebody else‟s So-
lar Plexus Center.
Remember that the Solar Plexus is a pleasure center. It‟s also a pain center. It‟s
deeply connected with food and sex. Here is somebody who has the 35th gate [male,
red arrow] and they don‟t have the 36. Of course, we know that the other one has
the whole channel. These turning-ons of the Emotional system and the Sacral sys-
tem; the other one has the Channel of Intimacy [female, pink arrow]. All of this be-
comes conditioning and control.
When you fall for somebody‟s Solar Plexus, and I know, you never fall for the low
end, unless you‟re really bananas. You get seduced. And by the way, these two be-
ings are seducers—they both have 5th line personalities. You meet that Emotional
being when they‟re up on their wave and you have an open Emotional system, it
takes the wave in, it amplifies it, it distorts it, you get giddy with excitement. That‟s
what you fall for. And then it goes the other way. The wave, it falls, you go with it,
you go further, you go deeper, and then everything about your relationship for the
rest of your relationship is the rising and falling of the waves and trying to figure out
how to fix it and you can‟t, trying to maintain the high when the high cannot be
maintained. And then a fixing blame.
The emotional/unemotional relationship is one that always carries deep volatility. It
just does. Emotions can get cranked and amplified distorted emotions can really get
out of control. And yet, this is the hook. This is what you selected with your not-
self, what you thought you needed. “I‟ve got to have that; I‟ve got to have that.”

Connecting and Conditioning
We‟re always attracted to what we‟re not. That‟s the story. We‟re always attracted
to what we‟re not.
The only reason that we go there is that our mind tells us to, because it says, basi-
cally, that we are inadequate. It says we are not worthy. It says we have a prob-
lem. And this is the way to solve the problem. It‟s our minds that lead us into all of
this. It isn‟t to say that this [male] is somebody who is not going to be attracted by
this; of course they are. But to actually involve themselves with this being who
brings this [female], it has to be correct or there they‟re simply being overwhelmed
and will have to deal with the consequences, which means ultimately they [male] will
run away from it because they are designed to avoid confrontation and truth. At
some point they will explode and enough is enough is enough is going to be the ex-
plosion. And they will explode this other person‟s emotional energy and it will be
over.
But if they operate correctly, this [male] is somebody who has a very, very, very
deep powerful judgmental intuition. This is somebody who is intelligent in the way in
which they can deal with invitations; spontaneous, in the now, clear, precise ways of
being able to say yes and no. And without the invitation and without the guidance of
the awareness which is the Authority, then they are going to be lost. But with it, this
no longer becomes what the relationship is about. And it no longer becomes the
power of one over the other. It becomes an interesting ingredient. There is much to
be learned from the emotional system from the unemotional, and vice versa.
The Connection Chart
I do appreciate the con-
venience of Hollywood
because it‟s fun to look at
these things because one
has some kind of sense of
who these beings are.
It‟s rather an interesting
relationship in that they
both have the same
cross; I assume you‟ve
noticed that. They‟re
both 5/1‟s, both transper-
sonal beings. We have
seen that the way in
which they have operated
as not-self, what they
looked for and here we
see what they get.

I think one of the magic things about the bodygraph is the way in which you can look
at two bodgraphs and you can get to see the holistic transformation that takes place.
That is, this is not either one of them. And I think it‟s very important to understand.
This is something that happens aurically when they‟re together. And we all know
that we‟re different in a relationship when we‟re out of it, whether that‟s lover,
friend, parent, whatever the case may be. The fact is the moment you enter into the
aura of another is the moment that something, a third thing, ultimately emerges.
Here is a way to see it.
The first thing we see is that it‟s an 8 and 1 have some fun [8 defined centers, 1
open center]. That‟s one of the formulas: 9 and 0 nowhere to go; 8 and 1 have
some fun; 7 and 2 work to do; 6 and 3 better to be free. I do love my nursery
rhymes, my Human Design nursery rhymes. Anyway, this is an 8 and 1 have some
fun. It‟s an open window. In a relationship the open center is like a doorway or a
window and it means that the fun is that the two of them can go out through this
window together and this is the Ego window. So, this is the exploration of the Ego
window and they can both go out in the world together through that window.
But 8 and 1 have some fun; the problem is they‟re a split as a relationship. They‟re
a Split Definition and that‟s a problem. That‟s a real problem. It‟s one thing to have
a Split Definition in your Design; it‟s another thing to have a Split Definition in part-
nerships. Split Definition in partnership is an indication that the partnership is not
whole; mechanically, obviously. It‟s not whole. And there‟s no way for them to con-
nect that up naturally.

LECTURE EIGHT
Connecting and Conditioning
This is the example of the couple that will argue in public, or argue when there are
friends around. If they‟re lucky they have children and then they argue in front of
their children. What I mean by that is that you have the Head and Ajna cut off from
the Throat. It means that
both of them have a great
deal of mental pressure in
their relationship that
they cannot release. It
means there are a lot of
things that they‟re think-
ing about that they‟d like
to say to each other that
they do not say, because
it doesn‟t come out, which
means that it leads to that
running around inside of
them over and over again
and builds up as a pres-
sure.
And at some point, some-
thing comes along, some 17 comes along or an 11 comes along, it can be a transit, it
can be people, usually it‟s a social environment, and all of a sudden they‟re in a so-
cial environment and the bridges are there and all of that stuff that‟s in their head
suddenly comes out. We all know the situations of—at least I‟ve seen that a couple
of times in my life—where couples end up having an argument in somebody else‟s
place, whatever the case may be. This is one of those classic situations of how this
happens. All this pressure builds up and then finally there is only one way to be re-
leased.
The other part of this is what I guess in many ways is more common, particularly if
you go back to the generation that got married in the 40‟s or the 50‟s before the 60‟s
revolution, the split couple that ended up with two or three children and the children
bridge the split. So there was this, within the penta, within the various relationships
within the family, there was this illusion of wholeness. Then all of these kids, by the
60‟s, ended up going off to university to be silly and left these parents behind who
immediately got divorced, because the lack of wholeness suddenly reemerged. And
you have a whole crashing generation of marriages that suddenly fell apart that were
given all kinds of sociological explanations other than what was problem one of the
most common phenomena. There are a lot of not-self relationships that are splits.
Don’t Make Decisions with the Mind
The moment that you live your life according to your mind, and again, this is really
where we begin and where we end, if you live your live according to your mind, if

DESIGN CONCEPTS

you make decisions according to your mind, there‟s just no way. There‟s no way
you‟re going to be able to fulfill the potential that is there for you. There is certainly
no way that you‟re going to be able to bring into your life or recognize those allies
that are correct for you and that you are correct for them, you don‟t.
It often leads to dysfunctional relationships that may lead to dysfunctional families of
one kind or another. It leads to the homogenization of the life and the narrowing of
the life into the limited perspectives and possibilities of not-self couples, stuck in the
same formulas so the same joke makes them all laugh because they all know that
their lives are a pattern and the pattern is stuck. It‟s the not-self and it‟s the way
the not-self lives. And it all goes back to mind. It goes back to understanding that
what this knowledge represents is this transition, this movement now away from the
Inner Authority of mind to the Inner Authority of the vehicle because we finally know
how to access it. We know where it is, we know how it works.
The language of Human Design on its surface is extraordinarily simple, because that
is the truth. It is the truth. Respond in form, wait for the invitation, wait out the
lunar cycle, these are very, very simple basic truths. Yet, the mind is very powerful
because it has this illusion that it is in charge. There is only one thing to do. If you
turn over Authority to your vehicle you can disarm your mind. You can take away its
power to distort your life. It can.
That‟s what Strategy and Authority does, and it begins to release you from this ad-
diction to seeing that you can only be complete by having what you‟re not, that in
being complete and having what you‟re not, you will never know self-love, the beau-
ty of self-love that we are perfect, correct, unique, to live that out. And to live the
awareness that‟s the possibility of that. All of that begins with at the very, very,
very simple surface. Don‟t make decisions with your mind. Let it do whatever the
hell it wants, but don‟t make decisions with it. And it sets you free.
Then you don‟t have to end up being one of these deeply predictable not-self human
beings that you can put your finger on the openness in any place and say, “See, this
is what controls you in your life. You‟re controlled by everything you‟re not. You
bow down to everything you‟re not. You suffer in the face of everything that you‟re
not.” Ignorance is what it is. No need for that. We have the knowledge, we have
the tools. But the revolution is a revolution that goes one-by-one. It‟s not up to me
because I cannot change your life. Only you can. It has to happen in you. This is
what the experiment is all about. I wish you well in all of that.

Lecture Nine
Keynoting
Keynotes are Formulas
Well, speaking of basics, this class is focused on keynoting. Keynoting is perhaps
the only way you can enter into the analytical world of Design. What I mean by that,
and obviously I‟m not talking about anything that has to do with professional analy-
sis, it‟s about translating in language what you see in the graph. Human Design is
nothing but keynotes. And keynotes are in some ways like Haiku. Keynotes are
formulas. They are very, very specific formulas and as such, in so many ways,
they‟re generalizations, so one has to be careful.
The formula for a gate is interesting. And of course, it is valuable to know. Yet, it‟s
necessary to understand that an overall formula also consists of myriad numbers of
formulas, nuanced formulas, the thousand, plus, variations of every gate. But key-
noting, when you‟re beginning a process in Human Design and you look at a chart,
because this is one of the things about Human Design that once you get it, the ob-
vious of it, it‟s not just that you‟re interested in your chart. You‟re interested in look-
ing at a lot of charts. And it‟s not simply out of a voyeuristic or whatever there is
learning confirmation that takes place in the examination of other people‟s charts,
people you know.
One of the most important educational tools in Human Design is having the correct
data of people who are frequenting your life, those people who are around you that
you know, you‟ve had experience with over years, that you have to feel for, that you
have a sense of, to see them according to their Design, to see what they are, to see
what they‟re not, to see the not-self at work, to see their vulnerabilities, to see all of
those things. And to see them is to confirm the validity of the knowledge. Yet at the
same time it‟s not enough just to look. When you look you have to be able to see
something in the looking, not just simply see that somebody is this Type or that
Type. But to be able to find a way to be able to describe first to yourself what some-
thing is, and then share it with others.
If one were to imagine a kind of insight into the way in which the wave of Human
Design works, in other words, the way in which the information goes out, I would
guess as much as half of all the people who meet Design meet Design from some-
body who has just met it. One of the things to understand about the way in which
this knowledge works is that it works along fractal lines, it works along geometries.
You get something and there is always somebody in your life that you want to share
that with and tell about that, whatever it may be.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

Of course, one of the things that is an enormous advantage is that when you look at
a friend of yours and you see their Design, you can actually see something. That
seeing something is for you. It‟s not that I am encouraging anyone who doesn‟t
have the training to start telling other people anything other than the most very,
very basic things. But that is enough to help them change their life, and to move
them towards perhaps somebody who can really give them a professional insight.
In order to explore Design it is actually given to you. And it‟s given to you in the
keynotes, and there are keynotes for everything. There are keynotes for circuits, for
channels, for gates, for lines. There are, in fact, keynotes for everything below—the
Colors, the Tones and the Bases—there are keynotes everywhere. There are key-
notes that are specific. There are keynotes that are related to streams, there are
keynotes that are related to different perspectives of the bodygraph, sexual key-
notes, as an example. There are all kinds of keynotes—they‟re formulas.
Reading the Chart is an Art
I think I first started teaching when I was about 10. I mean that seriously. It just
simply was something that came natural to me. And I‟ve watched all my life through
a career of being a teacher, and I was a teacher of many different environments,
universities, public high schools in North America and private schools. I‟ve seen the
inside out of educational institutions. You can walk into a staff room of any educa-
tional institution and you can look around and you will see those who can and those
who can‟t. Those who can‟t, it‟s not because they don‟t care or that they don‟t love
their profession or they don‟t like the children or on and on and on and on. About
80% of teaching is art. And the rest of it is preparation, however that works. But
it‟s an art.
Reading a chart is not pure science. If it were a pure science, I already years ago
would have had a computer program that pumped out your analysis. You can‟t. It‟s
one of the things that interesting. Yes, you can get all the data. The talking body-
graph is a beautiful example of having all the information but not having a reading.
Having all the information but having no synthesis, having all the information but
having no perspective.
There are all kinds of people who can quote the information, but that‟s not the point.
We are a holistic illusion, if I can put it that way. We are the sum total of our formu-
las. And we have formulas that indicate what we are, and we have formulas that
indicate what the not-self is. We have keynotes for everything. But to be able to
use keynotes is not science; it‟s art. And it takes practice and it takes time, because
it is about the freedom that comes in the analysis of a bodygraph, the freedom that
has to be there when one looks at it and explores it. Of course, this is not science.

LECTURE NINE
Keynoting
The Chart: A Pure Generator
Ok, so here we‟re looking at a chart. What we have in this chart, we have a very
clear, obvious, pure Generator. When I say „pure Generator‟ that is not a qualitative
thing, but pure in the sense that it is not an Emotional Generator and pure in the
sense that it is not a Manifesting Generator. So here we have this Generator, and
this is a Generator in which we have the 3/60, the mutation channel from the Root
upward, and here the 15/5, the Channel of being in the Flow, here we have this
Channel of Rhythm, and here we have this connection to the identity.
So, here is this basic Design of someone. When you think about it, when you look at
this, you have to begin to grasp how many keynotes you‟re actually looking at. Eve-
rything you need to know about this being is available to you in language. It‟s all
there. We already began with the obvious, as an example. This is a Generator. And
so everything about this formula is rooted in response and will ultimately be ex-
pressed as a response formula. But everything has a formula. The open centers and
their strategies are formulas, the gates have formulas, their lines have formulas, and
the planets have formulas. The Design side has a formula. It is your unconscious,
biogenetic heritance. There are formulas for everything. Keynoting is not about
reading the formulas, it is about stringing them.

Stringing Keynotes
I don‟t know how many of you have ever played with anagrams where you mix
things around and you mix letters around to find new words. When you‟re looking at
somebody‟s Design it‟s sort of like it‟s an anagram. There are all these keynotes.
And to begin to understand what the priorities are, to begin to see which keynotes
are really significant, to begin to play with them, and to understand something about
the nature of this holistic bodygraph is that it doesn‟t matter which way you string
the keynotes, it‟s always the truth. It‟s always the truth because if you are using the
keynotes as they are, if you have not misunderstood anything, you cannot be mis-
leading.
So, here you have the Design in the wheel, here you have the cross that we are
dealing with, so we are dealing with a Right Angle Cross of Consciousness. We have
an opportunistic role model out of the Quarter of Civilization. This is purpose fulfilled
through form. So let‟s say we want to begin with just the very, very top of the story.
We‟ve got an opportunistic role model whose purpose will be fulfilled through form.
This is a person who is going to be an opportunistic role model, whose purpose can
be fulfilled through form if they are correct.

Keynoting
The Keynoting Base: Type, Definition and Attributes
We have a pure Generator. Type is the first thing we look at. We have this pure
Generator. The second thing we look at is the Definition. We have a single Defini-
tion and we have defined channels: the 3/60, the Channel of Mutation and the 15/5,
the Channel of Rhythm. And we have defined attributes coming out of that G Cen-
ter: the 7th gate and the 1st gate. And coming out of the Sacral is the 27th gate.
These are active gates that are part of the Definition. These are attributes.
Keynoting Base
Type: Pure Generator
Definition: Single
Defined Channels:
3-60 The Channel of Mutation
5-15 The Channel of Rhythm
Defined Attributes:
7 The Army
1 The Creative
27 Nourishment
So, here we have the keynoting base. In other words, just the obvious of what‟s
there in the Design. Now, of course, you can get more complex. You can have Split
Definition, you can have a lot more defined channels, and you can have defined
attributes. But the fact is that all you‟re doing is lining up what is the very basis of
what is consistent and reliable. In other words, this is Definition and the aspects
that are also active as part of that Definition. This is where you‟re going to look for
your keynotes. If we have to think about a Generator, the first thing we think about
is that a Generator is here to respond. So this being is here to respond, and the way
in which they respond is in their very nature. That is, if you look at these two de-
fined channels.

This makes it easier for you to see the Type. The primary keynote, the basic key-
note is responding. Remember there are many, many ways, many levels of key-
notes. The Personality is: opportunism and externalization. The Personality is a 4.
It is here to influence. We have so many keynotes bout the 4. It‟s here to network.
Its Design is: a role model. So we have this responding externalizing role model,
this responding opportunistic role model, the transition to externalizing that comes
through responding. Just playing around with the words, but every time you play
you describe an aspect of the nuance of the being.

Keynoting
The 3/60 is the energy that fluctuates and initiates, and it‟s a pulse energy. So, this
is a being that responds with energy that fluctuates. This is a being that responds
and initiates the externalization of transition. This is a being that in their response
has the opportunity to be a role model of initiation. The circuit is empowerment, so
this is a being that in response can empower fluctuation in transition. It goes on and
on.
I want you to see that if you take it seriously, you‟re screwed: don‟t. Enjoy it. It‟s
like people who like doing crossword puzzles, any of these kinds of things; this is re-
ally what it‟s about. It‟s an art, you play around with it, and you find incredible
things in the formula, because that‟s us. You find incredible things about who you
are just by playing around. The moment you only see it one way you‟re only looking
at limitation. Here is somebody who can bring ordering through the empowerment
of initiation as a role model that externalizes through responding. Here is transition
that comes with acceptance that empowers fluctuation in the opportunities of the
responder.
Keynoting is Magical
I love keynoting; it‟s magical. It is, truly. I‟ve watched because I have—as a matter
of fact, I‟m a natural lecturer and the only time that I only give workshops is when it
comes to keynoting in live environments. Watching people go through this process
of not being afraid to put things together, and slowly watch them string out the for-
mulas is quite something to see. I‟m going to do it again this winter in December in
Vien in about a month now. It‟s an incredible process to watch. But it really is an
art, and as with all art, ultimately a craft. I have a lot of experience at it.
When we first began in Human Design I had yet to have the time, the experience,
and the opportunity to be able to open up all of the structure. I began with stringing
keynotes, the basic keynotes. The basic keynotes still get you to the same place.
They give you the essential truth of the surface. This is the way in which I gave
readings for probably three or four years. And it created an enormous wealth of rec-
ognition, because once you start doing that it‟s always there, it‟s deep inside. Every
time you look you‟re putting the formulas together. Of course, there‟s more, there‟s
always more, you can go as far as you want to go.
The 15/5 the „being in the flow,‟ the circuit of sharing; so, this is somebody that can
empower through sharing, can empower through sharing externalization, can re-
spond to sharing, acceptance and ordering empowered with energy for transition and
the opportunism that comes. It goes on and on. It‟s always there. And you can
pick the good side, you can pick the bad side, you can see everything. Responding
that leads to opportunistic transition that is an extreme of empowerment. Whatever,
there is everything in there. It‟s what‟s interesting; it‟s what makes us interesting.
It‟s what makes us complex as beings.

DESIGN CONCEPTS

And remember these three gates, the 7, the 1, and the 27, these hanging gates that
are active that are part of the Definition. They bring their theme to what‟s there and
what is defined. They‟re like adjectives to the verb of the Definition. It‟s one of the
ways to really understand keynoting. The verb is everything, the Definition is every-
thing. This is the fixed circuitry, this is the empowerment. But the 1 and the 7 and
the 27 play their role because there is no other place for their energy to go. It goes
into the defined system.
So, the role of the self, what role one will play in leadership, the self expressing
leader, the self-expressing leader that can care about sharing, the fixed patterns that
bring acceptance and ordering and empower, initiation and energy for the externali-
zation of the opportunity—and it goes on and on. And no matter where you go, and
you don‟t have to use it all, you can totally deconstruct it. Sharing, ordering, ex-
tremes of acceptance, there are all these things that are a part of this person.
Playing with the Keynotes
Primary keynotes are beautiful. They‟re like different colors of paint on pallet. And
you just dip in and you play. And as you play you see how you can mix all of this
around, how you can build different stories about who this being is. What kind of
opportunist is this? When this opportunist responds, what does it bring? Does it
bring the empowerment of ordering? Or does it bring just fluctuation and extremes?
Does it bring self-expression? Or is it just a role model caught in its own acceptance,
or its own this or that, whatever it may be.
It‟s why it‟s an art, and not a science. The science is what lays out all the informa-
tion. It‟s the science that brings us to these keynotes. They are the distillation of
the information. But the art is how to put them together. It‟s not just about laying
them out one above the other. And this is the way most people see a chart. They
see the Type, they see the Profile, they see the Incarnation Cross, but they don‟t
play with the formula. When you play with the formula you begin to see what‟s
there. Is there a struggle in the extremes between whether this person will express
their leadership or express their caring, and whether those two can be expressed to-
gether? Are the extremes always there?
There are many questions, and there are many ways you can put this story together.
So when you look at somebody‟s Design and you see the keynotes, you know what‟s
there in terms of what they could, might be, if they‟re correct. Yes, this is who this
person is. That is, this is their differentiation potential. It isn‟t, in essence, who they
are. It is what is consistent, it is their imprint. It is what‟s there for them to filter
the consciousness field with, the by-product that they express a unique form, they
differentiate.
Of course, we know that the vast majority of humanity doesn‟t. They‟re not-self.
And the way in which any of this is going to operate is that it‟s going to be condi-
tioned by the not-self. The way this person is going to use their generative energy is
not going to be based on waiting to respond. They‟re going to be like so many Ge-

nerators. They‟re going to be pretend Manifestors and they‟re going to have enorm-
ous problems as a result.
And what they try to put out is going to be based upon what their not-self mind de-
cides, based on their openness—hold onto things that aren‟t good for you, avoid con-
frontation and truth, always trying to prove yourself, always trying to attract atten-
tion, always trying to impress everybody with how certain you are in thinking about
all kinds of things that do not matter. That‟s who this person is; that is, that‟s what
they live as not-self. And the decision they make is the way this energy is going to
be used. But it does not mean that in any way they‟re going to be able to fulfill the
potential of what that is.
This is just a way to see the way it‟s laid out. You‟ll have this in terms of having this
whole illustration package and it is very much self-evident, the teaching of it. [Note:
all illustrations are included within this lecture.] It‟s just very guided for you. This is
only a one-hour class; I don‟t have the time to teach you all that in detail. But you
will be able to go through this and see how that works.

Responding to the opportunity to be a
mutative role model
So here you can see the example of responding to the opportunity, the way the key-
noting works. To be a mutative—so you get to the mutation theme, as an example—
to be a mutative role model. And you get to see the way the structure works.
Again, to experiment with it. That is the key. The true mutative role model only
finds opportunity in life through responding. You can weave these things in any way
you want, that‟s the magic of it.
Of course, this will take you through the next level, that is, take you through the
level of all the actual gates that are involved, so again, responding to the opportunity
to be a mutative role model. And now you have in the flow, because you‟ve brought
in the next level of it. And the examples of that: a role model in the flow responding
to externalizing the acceptance of transition to a new pattern. Pretty, no?

This course has always been sub-titled The
Poetry of Geometry. It‟s really lovely to see
that. Look at this person‟s Design. You
just see it; it‟s right there. It‟s an absolute-
ly beautiful formula. Again, there are
many, and if you work at it you‟ll get your
own, they‟re lovely. But this is perfect.
You look at this person‟s Design and say,
“You’re somebody who is a role model,
you’re a role model when you’re in the flow
and you’re in the flow when you’re respond-
ing, so you have to respond to everything.
But the moment you’re really in the flow,
the moment that that’s there for you, then
you have the potential to be able to influence others and for them to be able to ac-
cept transition from something that is yesterday to something that is tomorrow, that
you’re the person in that flow that can bring people to a new pattern.”
Now, I just did somebody‟s analysis. And it‟s just about elaborating on the formula
and the little bits and pieces that are there, the bits and pieces that have other for-
mulas that express different things, different potentials of it. This is the basis upon
which all analysis is built. And obviously, the longer you study, the more knowledge
you have, the deeper the levels go on and on and on and on with keynotes. So,
there is a deeper grasp. But still, if you can put this keynote together you can see
the being. That is, you can see an aspect of what they are. And in turn, you can see
that in their context.

And of course, the same is true for yourself. What you‟ll begin to see is that there
are certain formulas you reach in keynoting about yourself that you really like, and
certain ones you‟re not so crazy about. When you find the one that you love the
best and you find the one that you like the least, put them together. It‟s quite an
experience.
The Attributes
This goes on to the next level, that is, looking at the attributes. In looking at the
attributes, this is right down to the line level. For example, this is the 7.3, this is the
line of the anarchist, and the 1 is the self-expression sustainment line, and the 27 is
the selfishness, the self-sufficiency line. So, again you have all kinds of new material
to add to your responding to the opportunity to be a mutative role model in the flow;
in other words, the nuance that can be developed out of that.
Primary Keynotes:
Type: Responding
Personality: Opportunism / Externalization
Design: Role Model / Transition
Definition: 3/60 Mutation
5/15 The flow
Attributes:
7: The Role of the Self Anarchist
1: Self expression Sustainment
27: Caring Selfishness Self-sufficiency
Keynote Stringing:
Responding to the opportunity to be a mutative role model in the flow
A self-sufficient, anarchistic, Role Model in the flow
responding to sustained externalizing
of the acceptance of transition to a new pattern.
So, for example, “A self-sufficient anarchist role model that’s in the flow responding
to sustained externalizing of the acceptance of transition to a new pattern.” In other
words, this is a new level of it. So at that other level of the potential of analysis is
saying to this person, “When you’re responding you are somebody that can be an
example for others, you can be a role model. And when you’re responding you are
really in the flow which means that you can bring people in. You, yourself, can sus-
tain yourself in that. You’re somebody that can really stand alone. But it is part of
your process to externalize your influence. So even though you’re an anarchist,
even though you’re somebody that as a role model would prefer to stand alone, in

the flow responding you sustain the influence of others in order to get them to move
into a new pattern.”
Again, this is just another level of using the keynotes as a platform for description.
It‟s what they are. The keynotes are a synthesis. Each keynote is a synthesis of the
value of that particular aspect. When you lay them out in any kind of geometry, you
truly open up this opportunity to be able to really read your formula, see your formu-
la and to expand upon it.
Homework: Writing your Code
We have a two-part program with keynoting. I‟m going to give you all homework.
What I want you to do is your primary keynoting including attributes. In other
words, I want you to do a poetic poetry geometry, poetry keynoting extravaganza of
yourself. I only want one. You will see that there are many ways that you can write
yourself.
For me, I think of it as writing your code. Particularly here, for example, because
we‟ll look in a moment at the not-self, that here in looking at the code you‟re really
looking at your imprinting code. This is what makes you different. This is what that
difference could be, if you were correct. This is what you can express as a differen-
tiated being, to be a self-fulfilled anarchist. To be a role model in the flow respond-
ing to sustained externalizing of the acceptance of transition to a new pattern. Cool;
away you go. [Note: A list of keynotes for Gates & Lines, and for Channels are
available in the Appendix of this book.]
So, primary keynote: Type, Personality, Design, Definition, the attributes. You take
each and every one of those and you lay them out. It‟s fun to do in the computer,
by the way. If you have a simple art program you can actually write out all the key-
notes and you can sort of grab things and move them around and push them here
and there, mix them up and play. But really, I want you to play. That‟s the fun of
this, is that if you enjoy doing it you‟ll get really good at it. And people get very
stuck with this kind of stuff. It‟s easy just to read things out; it‟s easy just to list
things. But the most important thing you can do in the development of your basic
skills in Human Design and to be more comfortable with looking at your chart or an-
ybody else‟s, this is the way to get there. Write your keynotes. Write it out. And
find out who‟s there, because it‟s fun. Find out all the possibilities of who‟s there.
The Not-Self Strategies
The not-self strategies—we have all of these not-self strategies that are here. We
have avoiding confrontation and truth, that‟s the Solar Plexus; holding on to what
isn‟t good for you, the Spleen; trying to prove or improve yourself [the Ego]; trying
to attract attention in the Throat; trying to be consistent conceptually [the Ajna],
and thinking about things that don‟t matter [the Head]. Look at all that. Of course,

Keynoting
this is the way the not-self mind makes decisions. So, if you look at the keynoting of
this, what you‟re really seeing is your not-self. This is the part that may spook you.
You‟ll find it fascinating to do your imprinting keynoting—in other words, keynoting
your Definition and the attributes of your Definition. But it really is a very, very dif-
ferent thing when you look at the mental keynoting. In other words, the way your
not-self mind works by stringing together your not-self strategies: Attracting atten-
tion by consistently trying to prove without confrontation what is worth having be-
cause it matters. This is who this person is. This is somebody who is always trying
to attract attention by consistently, constantly always trying to prove themselves, or
trying to prove something, but without confrontation. And trying to prove what is
worth having because it matters. This is their trip in life.
Now, when you‟re looking at your not-self and you‟re looking at your openness you
can string it together in different ways. Ultimately, though, it is horrifying to realize
that this is the way in which your mind has made and will and does make its deci-
sions as long as you‟re not correct. And how much this takes away from the poten-
tial of what is there in the imprinting—the potential of that extraordinary role model,
that opportunistic role model that can bring about transition to a new pattern, and so
forth and so on, when it‟s correct.
Not-Self Strategies:
Thinking about things which do not matter
Trying to be consistent conceptually
Trying to attract attention
Trying to prove / improve themselves
Holding on to what isn‟t good for them
Avoiding confrontation and truth
Mental Keynote Stringing:
Attracting attention by consistently trying to prove without confrontation
what is worth having because it matters.
Two Sides of the Story
So let‟s think about what happens. Here we have the two sides of the story, and
your homework is the same thing—two sides of the story. That is, the so-called true
self—the imprinting—and the not-self. So we‟ve got the two sides. On one side we
have the potential of somebody who in operating out of their Sacral correctly—
Strategy and Inner Authority—is a self-sufficient anarchist. A role model in the flow,
responding to sustained externalizing of the acceptance of transition to a new pat-
tern. This is them. They’re not holding on to anything. They are the perfection of

moving onward, moving forward, moving to the new pattern, the acceptance of
change, the acceptance of things. That‟s the true self.
The not-self is attracting attention by consistently trying to prove without confronta-
tion what is worth having because it matters. What is worth having, what is worth
holding on to; here there is no holding on. In the not-self there is the deepest of
that. And trying to attract attention to what has to be held on to. Two sides of the
story.
The True Self
A self-sufficient, anarchistic,
Role Model in the flow
responding to sustained
externalizing
of the acceptance
of transition
to a new pattern.
The Not-Self
Attracting attention by consistent-
ly trying to prove without con-
frontation
what is worth having
because it matters.
Every human being is this two-sided coin. On one side the possibility of the true
self, on the other side the possibility of the not-self. And as we well know the not-
self rules. So you have two things to do. One is to write out the code of your im-
print. Remember, there are different variations, obviously than what I have shown
you or here in the graphing—Split Definitions, triple Split Definitions. For the Split
Definition there is always the need for the bridging. And that has always had to be
part of the formula. For the triple Split Definition there is always the need for
movement, it has to be part of the formula.
But I don‟t want you to worry about this, you‟re not going to be graded, and you‟re
not going to be embarrassed because you can‟t be in this. All you can do is just
string words together. But it is very, very revealing. And truly, the more you prac-

Keynoting
tice with this, the more you look at other people‟s charts and begin this process, the
more you‟re going to see that you‟re developing a deep understanding of what you
see. Everything about this knowledge is that this knowledge is so visual. It‟s about
looking at the graph and it‟s about seeing what‟s there. As you explore the formulas
and you go through the language, slowly but surely over time the formulas in your
ability to keynote become one with your vision. It‟s there. And the moment you talk
to somebody, or the moment that you‟re sharing it with somebody, you‟ll find that
the language is there.
Manipulating the Formulas
It‟s like learning how to ride a bicycle, keynoting. Once you get your legs, every-
thing is fine. You get in there, you get used to it, and you go through the process.
It‟s a language thing. It is the comfort of being able to manipulate the language. It
is something that, for example, is fortunately relatively easy in the English language.
The English language, because of the way in which it‟s built, we can turn things into
nouns, into adjectives, and adjectives into verbs. We can really play around with the
language. It allows for incredible subtlety in the way in which you can manipulate
these formulas.
And I want you to manipulate them. I want you to go in as deep as you can, create
as many variations that you can. It‟s all you. That‟s the thing that‟s interesting. In
the end it‟s the same formula, it‟s the same collection formula. It‟s like this thing
about mixing atoms to create different molecules. There are all these possibilities in
each of us that can be seen this way, and the beauty of it. And the counterpoint of
that is your not-self.
Again, with your not-self you have to understand that if you‟re a Split Definition, and
45% are, so close to half of you might be splits, that gate that will make the differ-
ence, that will be the bridging gate, becomes a very deep conditioning gate. It has
to be part of your not-self description. If you need a channel, it has to be part of the
description. There are things to play with. And it‟s just using the keynotes that are
there, laying them out and then blending them. So we have our two sides of the
story.
The Dali Lama
I am going to show you was who that chart was. It‟s the
Dali Lama. And think about what you‟re really seeing
there. How revealing this is about the nature of the be-
ing. And also how to see how the underlying attributes
that we have, that is, the attributes we have in terms of
the Definition, the imprinting that we have, how that be-
comes enslaved to the not-self decision making process,
how it‟s burdened with the not-self decision making
process and thus how homogenization takes place and

how one is not capable of literally being able to fill one‟s purpose.
It‟s so interesting that here
is this classic Buddhist and
the whole theme of his true
self is this incredible theme
of really being there for
change, and being able to let
go and being able to move
forward and to embrace
transition. Of course, here
he is holding on to the politi-
cal dream of what his open
centers lead him to. That is,
the political dream of a free
Tibet and holding on to what
is not possible to hold on to
and there‟s nothing that is
ever going to change that in
the real politic of the world.
It‟s just interesting to see
how the not-self plays such a dynamic role in the way in which someone‟s life is ex-
pressed, even somebody that has the so-called admiration of the not-self public.
What to do about the nature of being, the nature of what it is to be human. Human
beings are deeply, deeply conditioned.
Professionals in Human Design
Keynoting is a wonderful thing. It is really the very basis of the journey. If you‟re
relatively new in Design, and some of you are, and you find that this is something
you enjoy, it‟s probably an indication that you have a real professional future in De-
sign, because this is the gift that every analyst must have. And frankly, not all ana-
lysts do; and it‟s an essential gift.
This is the talent that I look for in somebody who wants to be a professional, be-
cause I‟m not somebody who encourages everyone to become a professional be-
cause I don‟t think that that‟s valid. And I don‟t think that most people, despite
knowing the information, either have the gift of being able to naturally synthesize it,
or the Personality gifts of being able to work successfully with others.
Being a professional in Human Design is quite something in terms of the various
skills that are required. But in terms of being able to actually do the job, this is the
very basis of the tools that are required—the ability to be able to synthesize the
chart. And of course, the development of this process starts with the foundation of
keynoting and being able to string the keynotes together. This is really what it‟s all
about. And anybody who can do this, you can look at a chart and you can get it.
You can look at somebody‟s not-self and know the way they work. You have a way

of phrasing it; you have a way of giving it some value or meaning to yourself that is
consistent and logical.
Keynoting is an Adventure
What I like is the experience because you don‟t really know until you start doing it.
When you start doing it it‟s like an empty canvas in front of you and what you‟re
about to do is write your code. Think about the history of humanity, what that ac-
tually says, what kind of a moment that is for you, and what kind of grace it takes.
Anyway, keynoting is quite an adventure. And facing that canvas is quite an adven-
ture. Now that I have incredibly set you up, which of course is cute, I really want
you to confront this with excitement and respect at the same time. This is really
very special. You‟re going to write your own code, and you‟re going to see both
sides. It‟s a very different kind of mirror. You look in that mirror and you get both
sides of the picture and you see which one reflects you best as you are now.
Keynoting is a wonderful thing. I look forward to this, I look forward to finding out
who all of you are, because of course you‟re all going to tell me, which is very sweet,
and I will ask you for your not-selves first, by the way. It‟s always interesting to
hear the delusion first, and then to hear the magic underneath.

Anything Under the Sun Q & A
I like beginnings and I like ends, I like tying everything up, it‟s very nice. It‟s been a
very interesting process actually to go through the basics with you over this time.
This last class was designed to be an opportunity for you to just simply ask me
whatever you like. It‟s rare that there really is that kind of opportunity, so this is
what this is about. It‟s your opportunity to get information from me that you‟d like
to get, or would hope that you could get. So, I leave it open to you.
Every time I do these things, by the way, there is a certain reticence and sometimes
there is silence. But I‟m patient, it‟s your nickel and I‟m here to answer your ques-
tions. So I leave it up to you.
How to Interpret the Kiron?
Question: I do have a question about how to interpret the Kiron. I see there is this
Kiron Return, but there is no Kiron in the chart. Is there a reason for that?
Ra: Yes, there is, it‟s a good question. Kiron is what I refer to as a marker. It‟s a
very specific thing. It is an object. It is about the size of Manhattan Island, so it‟s
not very big. It‟s almost exactly in between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. The
discovery of Kiron in many ways represents what is the marker for the final trans-
formation of what it is as a human being or what our potential can be as a human
being.
Kiron is used very specifically in Human Design as part of understanding the nine-
centered being, and particularly understanding the nine-centered being through its
mutative process. That is, everyone who is born with a Profile that contains the 6th
line is in fact the mutative vanguard, if you will, of the Uranian process, the Uranian
age. This transition in the life, what we see in the three stages of the 6th line being,
that is, the Saturnian opening stage, and then at the Saturn Return one goes so-
called onto the roof and this interregnum stages lasts from the Saturn Return to the
Kiron Return.
In other words, Kiron is this bridging point between the Saturnian process and the
ultimate Uranian process. It‟s why, for example, that we refer to the Kiron Return as
the era that opens up the potential flowering of a human being. This is what this
process is about. In other words, no longer are we tied to what was the seven-
centered being Saturnian cycle of approximately 30 years in which basically you had
Design Concepts is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

DESIGN CONCEPTS

to take on life‟s responsibilities when you were very young, anywhere from 12 to 15
years of age, you were married, you had children, lived your life, life ended early.
This whole new process that we live in, that we‟re exploring through the nine-
centered being, this Uranian life that is 84 years instead of 30 which has a midlife
instead of 15, in its late 30‟s or early 40‟s. It is a very different process.
So Kiron is used specifically. I was given the knowledge that Kiron was never placed
in the activating imprinting category, in other words, it had nothing to do with Kiron
imprinting. So you don‟t see Kiron in a calculation in a Human Design chart. As a
matter of fact, it once was in an early version; I had it removed. It doesn‟t belong
there because it‟s not there for interpretation. To see what gate Kiron is in may be
intellectually interesting, but it is not an imprinting mode. It isn‟t affecting your spe-
cific differentiation.
But on a larger scale it is indeed a marker, and a very important one in the life. And
a Kiron Return is specially is important for those beings who carry a 6th line in their
Profile. Though, I must admit that as a 5/1 myself, my Kiron Return was a major
event in my life. And in fact, really did open up the door to the flowering. It‟s when
I created Jovian Archive with my family.
And I see that if you‟re operating correctly we‟re all aligned to what is a new way in
which, in fact, the life unfolds and a whole new era where our deepest fertility hap-
pens to be. It used to be that if you didn‟t make it by the time you were 20 you
were never going to make it. The point is with the Uranian life that you don‟t even
have the tools to make it, in the sense of yourself, the fulfillment of your own
process until you get to your Kiron and until you begin the stage of flowering. So,
Kiron for me is deeply significant, but it is not an imprinting agent so that‟s why it‟s
not in the calculations.
Dying and the Personality Crystal?
Question: I’d like to know what happened to Personality Crystals that haven’t left in
the 72 hours after the death of somebody, if there is an autopsy or all of those inva-
sive things, or organ harvesting, and stuff like that.
Ra: When the consciousness field of the planet was constituted, basically there were
16 Personality Crystal bundles, each of them in essence represent a godhead. It‟s
interesting because in this time slot in the second semester, beginning January 15
[2007] I‟m doing something for two semesters. It‟s called Quarter by Quarter. If you
look at the hexagrams, you‟ll notice that every four hexagrams have the same bot-
tom four lines. This is the quarter of a quarter. And each of these quarters are tra-
ditionally linked to one of the 16 original bundles. It is, in fact, our relationship to
let‟s call it some kind of godhead. Each of those original bundles all carry with them
certain traditional receptive names that have been here on earth. You can call it
Christ Consciousness or the Buddha Field or whatever the case may be, the Archan-
gel Michael—there are many, many of these references.

LECTURE TEN
Anything Under the Sun Q & A
Anyway, when we started the incarnative process according to what is the knowledge
about death and dying that I was given, that at the point of biological death, which is
the moment that the Design Crystal and the Magnetic Monopole link up together,
that is, the Design Crystal drops down from the Ajna Center, goes down through the
central channel system, the 43/23-8/1 into the G Center. It hooks up with the Mo-
nopole, they form one. Again, this is the end of the biological life and they leave the
body through the center going all the way down through that individual track out
through the Root Center and back down into the earth into the Design Crystal bun-
dle.
The Personality Crystal is left behind. It lingers. It can linger up to 72 hours. That
lingering is very important to us because that is where we experience what is known
as Bardo. That is, a transcendent state in which the Personality gets to operate
without the influence of the vehicle, and manages to do that with left over electrical
impulses that are there, literally, in the brain.
The Personality Crystal is designed to be picked up by its own bundle. These bun-
dles are always moving. It‟s literally designed to be picked up. So the whole thing
about the correctness of dying is that the amount of movement that takes place of
the dead body is something that should be highly limited—of course, all of the
things about autopsies and so forth and on; immediate burial, which is part of many
religions, all kinds of things disturb that process.
Rogue Bundles
If that process is disturbed, what happens to the Personality Crystal is that it is not
picked up by one of the original main bundles. This has been going on for a very
long time. The dysfunction has been going on for a very long time. The dysfunction,
just like the not-self and the homogenized world, is part of the way in which the evo-
lutionary process could actually work. What ultimately happens is that over time
these crystals that are not picked up eventually bundle together with other crystals
that are not picked up, and there are a lot of them.
In this era people who read so-called astral plane activity basically get a frequency of
this because this is the most intense, crowded, vibrating energy-interfering forces
that we have. And we have many names for them: ghosts, angels and all kinds of
things. Just about everything you could imagine that has a name in the supernatural
world is the by-product of the bundling of the crystals that never got back to their
source.
Question: So, I suppose the term lost soul might apply to those that have not been
picked up? Are they picked up by the Personality Crystal for another life at another
time? Is there is process to get back to that original bundle?
Ra: No, no there isn‟t, there isn‟t at all. That‟s it, that‟s the movie. It‟s why it‟s
very important for the incarnations that are going to take place over the next 1300
years until the end of the round, it‟s very important that the planet isn‟t constantly

being seeded by first time incarnations. When you think about the population explo-
sion that has taken place on the planet in the last 300 years in which we have pro-
duced more human beings that ever existed on the planet at any other time all to-
gether, there is a vast number of crystals coming into incarnation for the first time.
In the past this was not a problem. It has become a problem ever since the overpo-
pulation began, and overpopulation in various parts of the planet. There was a con-
sistency of being able to reincarnate and reincarnate. As a matter of fact, one of the
most interesting things to contemplate is that reincarnation was something that was
much more deeply accepted and understood a very, very long time ago, and has
steadily lost its power. It was taken out of the Old Testament, for example, because
it was in there. It was part of early thought. It was all around. Slowly, but surely it
disappeared.
It disappeared because of the way in which death was being handled. It was a total-
ly different process, the organization through religious rituals that changed the very
nature of the way in which we handled and dealt with death. Climate has a lot to do
with it. So, we ended up in a period, which in evolutionary times isn‟t a lot, but in
human history seems like a lot, thousands of years in which we have had this dys-
function in which there is, because of serendipity, a minority on the planet that are
able regularly to simply go back to source and again be available to return.
We‟re all designed to have many, many cycles. So much of that was terminated by
these rogue bundles. So, it is a very interesting study in itself. There is a course of
mine—maybe I should put that in Channel 88—which I did a number of years ago in
Ibiza, my Ghosts and Angels, describing all of that in detail, because it‟s interesting
material, at least from a cosmological point of view. [Note: Although this course is
not yet available, Rave Cosmology VI: Profile, Purpose and Function is available as
an IHDS Self Study Program. Lectures 8, 9, and 10 discuss rogue crystal bundles
(Angels, Demons, etc.)]
Question: So, does that mean that that our Personality Crystal, if we go in and out of
our bundle and don’t get stuck, that we actually, the Personality Crystal evolves or
becomes wiser through these several different incarnations?
Ra: Wiser isn‟t a word that I would use because I don‟t know how you would apply
that to something that is inanimate and is not consciousness itself. A crystal is a
crystal; it is simply a filtering agent. However, the thing to recognize about that
crystal—I showed that to you when I was talking about the way in which frequency
works, the way in which the neutrino goes through the crystal [Lecture 4].
At the quantum level we have an interaction of two things with mass. That is, the
neutrino with mass and the crystal. Any time you have any kind of interrelationship
in that way, an interrelationship that involves penetration which is what the neutrino
is doing to the crystal, there is a long term process of change that takes place in the
inner architecture of the crystal itself, in the same way that a river ultimately
changes how the landscape is going to be. We have them in Canada where I grew
up—oxbow rivers where once a upon a time there was a very strong river and as it

slowed down it began to change and move into different places and isolate bands of
water and change the whole landscape.
So, over billions of years of the neutrino ocean penetrating crystals of consciousness,
there is a changing of the inner landscape that takes place. The incarnation of your
Personality Crystal, which is 15 billion years old, like all of ours, it all goes back to
the beginning, has gone through an extraordinary process of transition in its inner
landscape over all that period. And obviously, through various incarnations, being
incarnated in a form and having that inner landscape affected while in that form car-
ries some kind of by-product of that form, if you understand what I mean. It‟s not
about wisdom.
However, the point is that Personality Crystals are absolutely essential to the future
of consciousness. Crystals that have gone through a very complex inner landscape
transition which leads to what we experience as self-reflected consciousness, they‟re
essential for the consciousness program of the future. It is very important that
these beings have a chance to incarnate.
It‟s something that I teach. In fact, next semester in Rave Cosmology 5, which is
Brahma’s Night and Beyond, it‟s my Nostradamus trip, looking at the program over
the next 1300 years and seeing how this comes to the end. And one of the things
that I was clearly told was that only those in form at the end are those that are
going to move on. And you‟re not going to be in form at the end if you don‟t leave
this plane correctly now. So, from my perspective it is very important knowledge.
[Note: Brahma’s Night and Beyond is now available as an IHDS Self-Study Program.]
I had this delicious conversation with my mother. She‟s 95 years old. She is quite a
sharp lady. Fortunately she still has a very, very good, quick mind. A couple of
years ago I was talking to her and I said, “I don‟t think you‟re going to live forever.”
I explained to her that I did not want her to be buried right away, that I would prefer
that that was all put off and that the body was not disturbed—all this stuff that‟s part
of the knowledge.
She listened and said to me, “I‟m going to be dead.” Which I thought was a hilarious
statement, that kind of “I‟m going to be dead, what difference is that going to make
to me.” It was not going to be possible to get into a crystal bundle story and tell her
all of that that night. I just said to her, “Just trust me, it‟s ok, just trust me.”
It‟s something that is very important. Those people who have this knowledge—we
had a whole program of this last semester, the death and dying—there are a lot of
people who have really good knowledge about this and hopefully they‟re going to be
able to help people. It‟s very important to leave this plane properly, not just simply
for reincarnations. I don‟t think, in essence, that‟s the point. It is clear to me we all
have a right to a Bardo state. [Note: Dying, Death and Bardo is now available as an
IHDS Self-Study Program.]
The term Bardo is a very ancient term. Basically, there have been many books of
the dead, Tibetan, Egyptian and others. A bardo, to the ancient Egyptians, was your
journey, and the out of the journey and the journey into the other life. This journey,

this movement, is truly experiential at the Personality level. It is enormously impor-
tant for the Personality. It really allows the Personality the freedom to be free of the
vehicle and to be free of being a passenger, and to experience what is its intended
symbology, if you will; the signposts for it as it leaves this plane.
For me, somebody who teaches correctness, life is about not simply living correctly,
but dying correctly and leaving this plane correctly. That‟s what that is all about, to
be able to take what is your journey, the journey that is correct for you and to return
to source.
What about the Evolution of the Design Crystal?
Question: What about the Design Crystal, the evolution of the Design Crystal. Is
there something like self-reflected consciousness there, too?
Ra: No. Self-reflected consciousness only exists when you bring a Design Crystal
and a Personality Crystal together through the agency of the Magnetic Monopole.
The self-reflected consciousness is a by-product of having a physical brain. When
you‟re talking about crystals you‟re not talking about anything. You‟re just talking
about a filtering agency. It‟s not like that crystal knows your name, in that sense.
It‟s a crystal. It is not alive.
It‟s these myths. I‟ve talked about it in my Monday heretic, it‟s these myths about
you leave the body and you have all the advantages of what you had when you were
in it. As a matter of fact, the only reason you get a Bardo state is that there is still
something left in the dying brain that can be tapped into by the Personality Crystal.
The fact is, if you don‟t have hardware there is nothing. There is no consciousness,
not self-reflected consciousness as we understand it. There is no identity, there is
no “I am this,” or “I am that,” or anything.
If you could float up beside a Personality Crystal bundle and you could listen to it, it
would just be sort of like listening to the wind going through trees. It‟s only when
these things come together that we have an illusion of a singularity, an “us-ness”
that doesn‟t exist. And ultimately, is not what the crystals are for. They‟re aspects
of the greater consciousness in which they will have no unique identity anyway.
Unique identity is only important to humanity. This is a stage in our evolutionary
process of consciousness. For us, it‟s essential to be able to define singular identity,
because ultimately one of the goals of the totality is to establish a singular identity.
As to the Design Crystals, every variation of the potential of Design Crystal from the
beginning to what will be the end is in the Design Crystal bundle. It‟s one of the
most fantastic things to understand about the form principle. All the potentials of
the forms are there. They‟re just waiting for the right time to emerge. And when
your Design Crystal at the end of your life goes into the bundle, it does not come
back out. It is very, very rare that a Design Crystal will be used more than once. It
does happen, but it‟s rare.

Anything Under the Sun Q & A
No, Design Crystals are very different. After all, this is the cognitive potential of the
form itself, to build the forms, to build different forms and in essence to have a pro-
gram of experimenting with different forms. One of the things we‟re coming to in
the transition that is coming in 2027 is where we will have the emergence of a new
form. The crystals of that form have always been here waiting.
Keynoting: What to Emphasize?
Question: Following on from all of this wonderful information, I’d like to ask a ques-
tion about keynoting. Is there a different emphasis on the Design and Personality
aspects of a bodygraph?
Ra: It all depends on what you‟re looking for. When I look at a bodygraph the first
thing that I‟m concerned with is the bodygraph, which is the holistic life. That‟s the
being. That‟s the illusion that‟s being lived out, that‟s the person. But if I‟m trying
to understand how they think of themselves, then I look at their Personality. It‟s
who they think they are. If I want to understand those aspects of themselves that
they struggle with because they have no access to it, I look at those places that are
the Design, the unconscious that emerges that can be so uncomfortable, the uncons-
cious Emotional being, the unconscious Ego being.
If I want to see their dilemma in life I look at their openness and see clearly how
they‟re being conditioned and how their not-self minds are making the decisions in
their life. If I want to go deeper, if this is somebody who can enter into the experi-
ment of Human Design and I want to provide them with something that will add to
and enhance their process, then yes, there are differences. Obviously, the differenc-
es of the Design Crystal, the way it works, and therefore the way in which we come
up with PHS and understanding the right personal dietary regimen and why that is so
important.
On the other side we have Rave Psychology and the potential of being able to bring
to the Personality Crystal the potential of awareness in the form. This is a dualistic
system and in any duality it is easy to bend this way or that at any given moment
given the circumstances of the moment. So, I don‟t really have, in that sense, an
answer. For me, it‟s all aspects of the same thing. Each aspect of the knowledge
provides a different insight to the dilemma. It‟s what mechanics does.
Certainly in my work with others I don‟t have a preference for anything other than
trying to get them to see their not-self. For me the not-self is more important than
Design or Personality in any work at the beginning because it is the worst part of
what the human experience is. It is the embodiment of the dysfunction of being
human.
But as to Personality and Design, no; I do have sympathy—a funny way to put it—for
the Personality. The Personality has everything against it. It‟s so obvious. You can
see the handicap of the Personality. It wasn‟t in the body when the body was built,
so it‟s really always an outsider, it‟s always something that came in late, and it‟s al-

ways something that ultimately shouldn‟t have any controls. So, there is always this
tension between the mind and the life. So, I have sympathy for the Personality,
much more than I do for the vehicle, because it‟s clear to me that if you treat the
vehicle correctly it will operate correctly. It‟s very simple. You follow your Strategy
and your vehicle is correct. It‟s just the way that it goes, there‟s no dilemma.
But at the same time you‟re following your physical Strategy, you can still have a
mind that is desperately trying to get back its power and still have a mind that is
very, very confused and still be caught in those moments where your mind tells you,
like a student‟s lovely joke, go take all your money and put it on this number. When
it messes up it says, oh, jeez, sorry. I guess I got that one wrong.
My sympathies are with the Personality. It‟s why Bardo for me is something that is
so important because I think that for most it will be the only opportunity to even
sense the beauty of awareness.
Question: This is the Design Crystal’s life, with the Personality Crystal as a passen-
ger. For a person whose Inner Authority is only defined by the Personality Crystal
(i.e. the only Definition is a 14-2 channel via Personality) does that impact the Au-
thority of the Design Crystal, other than the Personality being conscious of the Au-
thority?
Ra: No, what it does is it makes it particularly difficult for your Personality to accept
that it‟s not in charge, because it has access to all this power, and seemingly power
for direction. I think the most essential thing to grasp about Strategy and Authority
is that you automatically are deriving the decision from the true cognition of the ve-
hicle. In other words, you‟re tapping into the tonal level of what is the Design Crys-
tal. And so every time you‟re operating correctly you‟re operating intelligently. It
doesn‟t matter what your Design is on the surface; that is not something that can
influence them.
Is the Vehicle beyond Repair?
Question: Just in hearing you talking about PHS earlier and the health diet recom-
mendations and everything for the vehicle, I was wondering if there was a point at
which a vehicle becomes so damaged and so beyond repair. Is there a point at
which, through any disease of any sort, there is point at which even PHS as its very
rudimentary basics will it not heal the physical body?
Ra: Oh, I think there are people who are so deeply conditioned and their vehicles
are so damaged that frankly I doubt anything more can be done other than perhaps
maintaining the status quo and some improvement. It varies. This knowledge was
intended, in a sense, for infants who would come into the world, be raised correctly,
and have parents who were aware. In other words, when we‟re talking about PHS,
as an example, in one of the many things that is going to be required over the next
years is to be able to establish scientific verification of PHS. I am very much con-
vinced that I see the root to be able to do that.

Anything Under the Sun Q & A
It‟s based on neural expansion. That is, most human beings by the time they are
three years old their neural expansion is shut down. There are certain, very intelli-
gent children where they‟ve been able to see neural expansion until five. And I am
absolutely, positively convinced that it is a seven-year process. It‟s clear to me that
homogenization begins mostly with food, aside from the fact that babies are not
treated according to their Design, which is already a dilemma, but also on top of that
the food, because food is a great homogenizing agent.
In understanding PHS, you understand that PHS is not about whether mother‟s milk
is holy is or not, it is about either the conditions or the circumstances that are re-
quired for the infant. And that so many infants are being handled in their first year
in terms of the way in which they receive food, in which they are automatically and
deeply homogenized which means that their brain functions, that their capacity even
for a neural expansion is slowed down, let alone that there is going to be a shut off.
PHS is very specific in what it provides. Your Strategy and Authority is something
that over a seven-year period will heal the body to a certain point. There is no ques-
tion. So if there isn‟t vast damage, or deep conditioning in the body that the Strate-
gy and Authority alone, because you‟re going to be aligned to the vehicle‟s intelli-
gence that your vehicle is going to meet less resistance, that you‟re going to being to
have a vehicle that is an awful lot healthier for you.
However, that does not mean that the damage that was done is necessarily being
removed, and particularly the damage that was done in terms of the brain itself. The
real advantage of PHS is that in digesting correctly, which is what it is about and
knowing how to establish the right digestion, the circumstances or conditions which
is the language of PHS, once you‟re doing that what you‟re actually doing is bringing
very, very specific nutrition to very specific areas. It‟s sort of like if you‟re not doing
PHS it‟s painting that one spot on the wall with the bucket, so you don‟t really get
what you need and you don‟t get it in any depth. These are smart bullets, these are
smart missiles. In other words, you take in digestion that is absolutely specific to
the enhancement of your differentiation.
So, my push to PHS is a complement to Rave Psychology. Rave Psychology is about
developing human awareness, which is a huge task. And the potential in human
awareness, that out of that is the possibility of transcendent awareness, whatever
label you want to put on that. Transcending awareness is not something that you
can learn. To be aware is something you can learn. This is part of Rave Psychology.
Its goal is to teach the Personality Crystal how to fulfill the role of self-reflected con-
sciousness through awareness.
But to have transcendent awareness is a matter of the machine. It‟s about the box.
It‟s like having a computer and computer program and somebody gives you a super
upgrade to that program, but it won‟t run on the machine. If it doesn‟t run on the
machine you don‟t get access to it, it‟s not there. And our self-reflected conscious-
ness is something that is deeply, deeply limited by the potential of the physical
brain.

So, PHS is about realigning the potential of that, enhancing the potential of our phys-
ical brain based on what is our differentiated potential. Each of us has a specialized
cognitive potential that can be enhanced through PHS. So, they‟re complementary
to each other. And in fact, both are really only available to people who have already
gone through at least, from my perspective, a couple of years of entry into Human
Design and experimentation with their Design because if you‟re not following your
Strategy and Authority neither one of these disciplines nor the knowledge that they
can provide are really of much value at all. That‟s always something to keep in
mind.
The thing that‟s healthiest for your body is just the obvious, Strategy and Authority.
The thing that can bring about the potential perfection of your form as it was in-
tended to be when you came into this world, that‟s really what PHS provides. Ob-
viously, along the way, bringing PHS into alignment with your Strategy and Authority
you‟re bringing a lot of potential very positive developments for the way in which
many things operate in your physical life.
Emotional Definition: What Decides?
Question: I have a question kind of on the opposite side of what someone else was
asking, awhile back you had talked about Emotional beings. It was a very quick
comment specifically around Authority, that if you’re Sacral response or Splenic that
you don’t know why, but you had made a comment that over time with Emotional
beings that you know why. So, I’m curious if that can be misinterpreted as the Per-
sonality’s logic, if you will or confusion within, is it really Authority or is it the Perso-
nality Crystal that’s deciding? And then specifically if it’s conscious, if the Definition
or the way the Authority gets defined, if it’s conscious, can there be confusion with
the Personality Crystal and thinking that you’re deciding it from your mind verses
your Authority?
Ra: First of all, the Personality Crystal, this is the language, wouldn‟t think anything
because it doesn‟t think. We experience all of that through mind. Confusion, I think
the confusion is always the bedrock of the way in which mind works, and mind feeds
on those things. However, if you‟re somebody who is emotionally defined, I think it‟s
very difficult to be able to not distinguish between what is an emotional feeling over
time, which has nothing to do with mental concepts and the way in which the mind is
trying to interpret it, that‟s another story. Therein lies the potential of any kind of
confusion.
However, the whole thing about being an Emotional person is that because it is your
Authority and because there is not truth in the now, there is only time that can bring
the possibility of clarity. And it isn‟t really certainty or knowing, it can never be, it‟s
not possible. But when you frame that against what it is to be Splenic, somebody
like myself who is a Splenic Manifestor, I make split second decisions with my
Spleen. My Spleen guides me—however you want to express that. But it‟s split
second.

Anything Under the Sun Q & A
So, somebody says something and I go, no. I have no idea what the conditions of or
the basis of, the depth of whatever that “no” is out of my Spleen because in fact I
don‟t know what my Spleen bases yes and no‟s on. I don‟t. I know in a sense that it
will say no if it assumes something is not healthy for me. But what is not healthy in
answering somebody‟s question, or whatever. If my mind gets into the story about
why my Spleen says no, there will people who will tell you I can be very rude, or it
seems that way, my Spleen is very quick and it just has its absolute and it‟s gone.
There is nothing I can do about it. But if I think about it it‟s a mess because you
can‟t figure that out.
That‟s very different from being an Emotional being. An Emotional being operates in
a different time frame. There is not so much, I was going to call it reflection, but
there is the process, the movement through the wave that is an experiential refer-
ence point to the same thing over and over again in different places that brings great
depth, much more depth ultimately in the feeling of a decision than the sense of
depth in the Spleen. I never feel like I am operating out of depth. That‟s part of my
own joke. I have the 48th gate twice with Neptune, so I don‟t know if there is any
depth there. But it‟s just there; it‟s suddenly there and it‟s gone.
And not only is it suddenly there and it‟s gone, but it doesn‟t come back. The Emo-
tional being goes through this long process. Some emotional decisions can take
years to get to a place of clarity. And that can never be confused with mind. It
can‟t, ultimately. But the dilemma is that if you‟re not honoring that Emotional Au-
thority, that if it is only occasionally honoring of that Authority, then the mind has its
interim power and it has the power to be able to disturb that whole process. It can
start telling you that you‟ve processed something long enough.
I have a thing with mind. It‟s very simple: Don‟t let it make decisions. It‟s not like I
don‟t listen to my mind. It babbles on, like all minds do. But I don‟t let it make de-
cisions. It‟s not allowed—uh-uh, don‟t do that. No decision making, just looking.
Chatter, chatter, chatter; look at this, look at that. It can do all the comparing it
likes, it can measure, and it can jump up and down. I don‟t mind watching my mind
take any point of view on either side of this or that, it makes no difference as long as
it doesn‟t make a decision.
Once you stop making decisions with your mind there is nothing that is going to be
confusing about all of that. The Authority is truly then transferred and everything
about the viability of what it is to be here is all about making sure that the intelli-
gence that guides your life is the intelligence that‟s there in your form. Only then
can the Personality be liberated. There is no liberation for the Personality as long it
makes decisions. You can never be aware, truly. You can be smart, you can be
bright, but you can never be aware if your mind is making decisions, because you
cannot see anymore. As soon as your mind is involved in making decisions you‟re
blind. You have a strategic focus, that strategic focus is rooted in your not-self, your
openness, your vulnerabilities and you cannot be aware because you do not see any
more.

This is the story: Stop making decisions with your mind, trust your Authority and
then you can begin the process of bringing awareness into your life. And that‟s real-
ly something. And then you can discover something else. I think it‟s the most beau-
tiful part of what it is to experience these things we call mind. It‟s wonderful to libe-
rate your mind from decision making because you discover it sees so much, so much
more than you ever saw before, and seeing in a way that‟s quite different because
you‟re not seeing with an agenda. It takes time. It‟s not like it happens overnight.
As I said, awareness is something you can learn. It‟s a step-by-step process of un-
derstanding how all the conditioning operates on the mental plane, and exactly how
you have been taken away, and exactly how your mind has expressed itself as not-
self. When the Personality truly grasps all of that, it‟s the nice thing about mind, it
can get it. And at that point it can begin to notice and look and see and stop being
so concerned. That‟s quite a place to go.
Do Transits Affect a Defined Gate?
Question: Does a transit over a defined gate influence or condition that gate?
Ra: At a very subtle level. Where you really notice the influence of something like
that is when you happen to have a line where, let‟s say Mercury is exalted and Jupi-
ter is in detriment and you happen to have one of those planets show up in a transit,
then you really feel it because then you feel the shifting in that.
But again, it ultimately doesn‟t really change the way in which your actual Authority
would operate, but it is a nuance that you‟re going to notice because it has a direct
impact on you. I found, for example, I spent many years in the early years doing a
lot of relationship charts. There was a time I would do relationship charts with all
the various students I would teach at any given time just to see how people connect.
It was the beginning of my work in investigating all of these things.
It was always interesting for me that I could always notice those students who had
the moon in the 20th gate, the 10th gate, the 57th gate or the 34th gate. I could no-
tice them because they always brought out the detriment of my 10th gate. I‟m an
integration being, I don‟t have the 34, and I have the 10th gate and the line I have,
the moon in detriment. And I don‟t have the detriment. But every time that some-
body has the moon in integration, I feel that detriment.
These are the kinds of things where in transit or in connecting, when somebody al-
ters the way a line of yours works, rather than just meeting you at the other end it‟s
very interesting to notice that. My favorite was the relationship between Freud and
Jung. They had this very interesting relationship in the channel 31/7 in which Jung
brought out the detriment in Freud‟s 6th line of the 7, the administrator, and gave
him the detriment of the Uranian destabilizer of the organization. Poor old Sigmund
took all the blame. It‟s just interesting to see how those things work.

Anything Under the Sun Q & A
Where is Sensitivity in a Design?
Question: Is there any way to see in Design about the sensitivity of people. I don’t
just mean how open they are, what they’ve got defined, and obviously if you have a
lot more open then you’re going to be more sensitive to transits and things like that.
But there seems to be a level of acuteness to some people’s sensitivity to the weath-
er, if you like, that isn’t present in other people who may be just an undefined. I
was wondering if you have any insights on that.
Ra: It‟s a very good question. It is part of my dream package that our programmer
Asi Farran is slowly realizing. Over the next year we will release the first version of it
which is a huge statistical investigative program. It‟s the kind of thing where if we
had the Designs of 10 people who every time that the pressure drops that they sud-
denly have ear aches, or whatever the case may be, an opportunity statistically to be
able to find out what the commonalities are. And what the commonalities are not
simply at the surface, but going down into the chains.
So many of those kinds of questions are questions that I think can only be answered
that way, through experience and through statistical gathering. January 11th [2007]
Human Design is 20 years old. But that‟s a baby. I‟m very pleased with this, the
fact that this baby has grown up. But it‟s still only 20 years. There is an enormous
amount of work to be done.
There is, though, a channel of deep sensitivity in Design, and that‟s the 19/49. It is
extremely sensitive, can be so sensitive that it can lead to autism in the sense that
that can be the extreme of it. It‟s also a highly destabilized channel in this era. But
that is a place where there is a natural Design for sensitivity.
Encounter with the Voice Event
Question: The program that comes out January 11th 2006, is there a possibility in
public presentations for those of us who might want to have a gathering of folks,
would you want us to collect funds and send it to you, or is that something that
you’re ok with, a group of people participating and watching the program together.
Ra: Yeah, there really isn‟t anything I can do about it. I don‟t mind. It would be
nice because there are people who worked on the film and they all look forward to
earning their whatever. Me, personally, it‟s one of the things I accept with teaching
on the web. There are many cases where there are guests that are with people, I
don‟t have any objection to that as long as it‟s not a regular thing. The fact is, the
film on the 11th, is the only time it‟s ever going to be shown is those two screenings.
If there are other people who want to see that, I don‟t mind. But if they want to pay
for it, that‟s cool, too. [Note: This 55 minute video called “Encounter with the Voice”

Grey Matter and Inner Authority
Question: How does the grey matter and our thought process and Inner Authority
work?
Ra: I assume you are talking about the brain grey matter. Again, remember that
it‟s as I described. Everything about the Design Crystal is that it is our other con-
sciousness crystal. The tone of the Design Crystal is the cognition or the intelligence
direction of that particular vehicle. When you‟re acting according to what is correct,
Strategy and Authority, what is actually happening is that Design Crystal‟s capacity
for the vehicle‟s intelligence taps into the brain. As a matter of fact, in PHS analysis
when we‟re looking at the analysis we have two ways we look. One is the sun/earth
which is the internal and this is about the physical brain itself.
It‟s not that the cognition doesn‟t come from the brain, it does, but it bypasses the
self-reflected consciousness that‟s out there as a result of the work of the neo-
cortex. It is simply tapping into the brain through its way of tapping in to get the
information it needs, in that sense. But that‟s the way cognitively it‟s operating, so it
takes advantage of the brain. It is the brain, as a matter of fact, if I can put it that
way. It built the brain in the first place, maintains the brain. And through PHS the
brain can be enhanced.
Ok, that was very nice. Good questions, by the way, I enjoyed that. I‟ve enjoyed
this class. I like this time. Next semester there is going to be two of these, what I
call my morning or later in the day on the other side in Australia, in this time slot.
On Mondays that will be Quarter by Quarter, and I mentioned that. And on Friday
mornings I‟m going to be doing Base Theory. So I‟m going to see if I can keep these
slots going, they‟re fun. I enjoy them. [Note: Both of these courses are now availa-
ble as IHDS Self-Study Programs.]
To all of you thank you for participating, I hope you‟ve enjoyed that and I‟m glad you
were there. You take care and enjoy your winter holidays, and hopefully I‟ll see
some of you in the next semester. Bye for now.
