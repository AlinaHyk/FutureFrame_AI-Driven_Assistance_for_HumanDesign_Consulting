Introduction to Incarnation Crosses By Profile: Quarter 1
For the first time ever, in October 2003 in Ibiza, Ra began teaching Incarna-
tion Crosses by each of the 12 Profiles in each hexagram. The beauty of this
course is how Ra takes us through each evolutionary step, clicking through
each gate in the wheel with its 12 profiles, that builds the progress of hu-
manity. He describes and explains how the qualities of each hexagram are
building blocks for the next quality and how that takes humanity through all
of the stages of development and maturation necessary for progress. Each
cross and each angle and each profile has a task and a contribution to the
building of the Maia.
You will begin to understand the evolution of social structures in society as
you take this journey around the wheel. This begins in the first of four books
in Quarter 1 with Gate 13. You will see how society builds and humanity
progresses forward. The contributions of each cross are necessary for that
journey to happen. This Quarter is called several names: the Quarter of Al-
cyone, the Quarter of the Mind, and the Quarter of Initiation.
Ra explains in depth the purpose of this first Quarter and how each Incarna-
tion Cross‟ purpose in life is being fulfilled through mind. Ra then further
breaks down each gate into the nuances of the 12 profiles: Right Angles 1/3,
1/4, 2/4, 2/5, 3/5, 3/6, 4/6; Juxtaposition 4/1; and Left Angles 5/1, 5/2, 6/2
and 6/3. From these descriptions and many practical examples, you have
the most comprehensive understanding of Incarnation Crosses ever pre-
sented before.
This course for Human Design Professionals was comprised of four separate 5-day
events beginning October of 2003, and continuing on in April and October of 2004
and completing April of 2005.

A Digital Book for Students
Introduction to the Quarter of Initiation
This is the Quarter of Initiation and as a basic formula, this is purpose achieved
through mind. Remember, everything about this Quarter of Initiation is this is the
coming in. You come in in Initiation. You lay down the foundations of how you're
going to survive and exist in Civilization. You make the other and reproduce in Dual-
ity, and then finally when you get to the end of the road to Mutation, you get to that
place where you can accept the purpose and fulfillment of the process of being in life
and be ready to die so that you can come back again as a witness and again go
through this wheel. In other words, this is our movement.
So each Quarter has an archetypal value. The most important thing to recognize
with a Quarter of Initiation is each and every one of these hexagrams and each and
every one of the profile nuances within these—and I say hexagram because we are
looking at the personality Sun movement—what you‟re really going to see is that all
of them are nuances of the purpose in life being fulfilled through mind.

GATE 13
The Fellowship of Man
So, if you're somebody like me who is a Left Angle Clarion, my Sun is in the 51 so
it's part of Initiation. When I come into this life, I am here to fulfill my purpose
through mind. So I become in that essence, in watching my movie, I'm an arche-
type of that. Here I am blasting out the mental news and teaching this mental
knowledge, and so forth. It is purpose fulfilled through mind. It tells you something
about our incarnative process. That we are not incarnating to simply be form prin-
ciple; otherwise, we'd all be dolphins or we‟d be plants.
We‟re here to fulfill a consciousness program. All of the roles that are acted out in
this Quarter are going to be fulfilled in their process from the mental plane, no mat-
ter what. So you have not only the variation of the different kinds of actors and
actresses that you're going to have in the movie, but you really have to see that if
everybody in the movie comes from this Quarter, it's going to give you a headache
to listen to their conversation because everything for them, ultimately, is about fulfil-
ling their very life and fulfilling their purpose through mind. Not through body, not
through form, not through the other, on and on and on.
Characteristics do not Matter when Living Out Your Purpose
We‟re talking both the fulfillment of purpose. Everything about the cross is about the
potential to fill your purpose. It is very difficult to get to that place where your cross
runs your life. I know. And when your cross takes over in your life, boy does it take
over. It's almost as frightening as the idea of giving up the not-self because your
purpose is something that does not honor your characteristics.
So, for example, let's say that you're an anti-social, nasty, savage little survivor like
me. And you get on the wheel and the wheel turns you into some kind of social
interactive good-for-everybody nice guy. But that's the cross. It doesn't matter
once you‟re into the movement of your purpose what your characteristics are. Cha-
racteristics only matter when you're stuck with your not-self and you‟re unawake.
This is the whole thing about my joke about not being furniture in a movie, the
background. The background doesn't mean anything. But the moment you give
background purpose, it jumps to the front of the lens and everybody can see it. It
doesn't matter where you come from. The coward in the movie in the background
that suddenly emerges as the hero and everybody is wondering where that come
from.
Your characteristics don't matter when you're living out your purpose. They don't. If
I was living out my not-self, my nature, my very characteristics would create prob-
lems for me in this life as they did before I knew all of this. They just would. And
purpose would never allow me to transcend the problems of my characteristics, nev-
er. That's the magic of being yourself, because the moment you really are living out
your nature, your cross will take over, your purpose will take over and out of that
will come its archetypal demand and the opportunity to be fulfilled that way, whatev-
er that way happens to be.

The Right Angle Cross of the Sphinx 1  13  1
 7  2
A Right Angle Cross is about personal destiny. In other words, the Right Angle Cross
is your process. It‟s something that you have to go through. So it's not so much
that you have to find somebody else's
secret. You're looking for secrets
yourself, and it's very important to
find those secrets for yourself. So,
everything about the very beginning
of the process, everything about com-

ing into form right at the beginning is, 
okay, what are the secrets? It's one
of the things to understand about us
and how important it is that we're not
like other mammals that when they
come in they start fresh; we don‟t.
We do have the advantages of secrets
that have been stored and that can be

retold to us, things we can learn ra- 
pidly that we don't have to learn by
trial and error because learning has
already been done.
So, it‟s one of the most essential in-
gredients to life. When you begin this

We start off with a 1/3 so that when you're looking at that 1st
line, that 1st line says, “I have to study and find the secrets
that way. If I explore things, if I dig into things, I will find the
secrets that will show me the way to fulfilling my purpose.”
Unfortunately, there is a 3rd line unconscious which knows
that many secrets are nothing more than lies, that a lot of
secrets that are purported to be secrets aren't secrets at all.
The 3rd line unconscious is going to discover sooner or later
that the so-called secret is not true. One of the most impor-

tant things about 1/3s is that when you meet a 1/3 Sphinx who has their Personality
Sun in the 13th gate, their job this life is to discover which secrets are lies. That's
their job. Remember that secrets have power.
When you're looking at a 1/3, you can really grasp the nature of what is Right Angle.
There is no more perfect example of the Right Angle process than the very beginning
of that process. Not only that, but it's the most self-absorbed because both the 1st
and 3rd lines obviously are lower trigram so it‟s deeply absorbed in its process. Yet,
at the same time, understand what it means to be a 13 Sphinx. What it really
means to be a 13 Sphinx is that you don't swallow the secrets of others and take it
in as if that‟s truth. You look for them because you know you need them. Yet at the
same time, the greatest task for you is to discover whether or not they're true,
whether or not they‟re real secrets, and whether or not they are really of value.
What we discovered is that most of the things that are purported to be secrets, that
when you find out how sex works it's always going to be great. When I talk about
secrets I'm not just talking about the hidden treasure. I talking about anything you
don't know, anything you don't know that somebody else knows. They have the
secret. They know the experience, they could give you the direction, they could
make life easier, and you want to know what that is.
The 1/3 process is to shake it out. If it weren‟t for 1/3s, we would be easily led by
the nose all the time. And so that 1/3 Sphinx, what happens to most of them as
not-self, it‟s not like they get to live out their purpose. What happens to them as
not-self is that they end up being deeply depressed, and deeply pessimistic that
there is no secret to awakening, love, riches, the good life, you name it, whatever
the case may be. They end up in a position in which, rather than being able to pro-
vide direction—all Sphinxes are here to provide direction even if they're not trans-
personal—they simply provide the medium of direction. This is a force that will say:
Don't believe that stuff. You're not going to get rich doing that.
In other words, the 1/3 is going to break through and see that the secrets that have
been out there are not necessarily secrets, they're not necessarily valuable, and it
means that life, once again, becomes unpredictable and suspicious.

When you go to 1/4, you have a totally different phenomenon. Oh yes, you have the
same Personality that says the secret is the key. You cannot escape that if you have
that 1st line Personality. But, this is not a 3rd line anarchist underneath that says,
“Ah that's crap; Jesus is not my key,” whatever the case may be. They will go
through their process of rejection, of seeing the things that don‟t work—the kid
who‟s about to get into trouble, who spends the whole night praying and still ends up
in a lot of trouble the next day. There is this moment of: What's this all about? In
other words, breaking through that, but if you're a 4th line you do not do that. Your

mother says that the secret in life is…..and the 4th line takes that in and tries to live
it out, doesn‟t question it.
It‟s one of the most dangerous things about having a 4th line child. You cannot af-
ford to lie to them. And not because they'll find you out, which is different. It‟s that
if you're uncertain about your perspective on life, don't make that their Bible because
that 4th line child will take that in. When you're dealing with a 1/4, you're dealing
with a force, at the unconscious level, that simply wants to share a solid foundation.
These are people, that when they know a secret, everybody they know knows it. I
mean everybody. They‟re actually quite useful Sphinxes if they have a good secret.
They discover how to download some movie for nothing and they‟re immediately on
the phone telling every friend they have because this is the capacity of the 4th line
unconscious, this transpersonal influence over those who are within your community
of opportunity.
When you're looking at the 1/4 and you're looking at his introspective opportunist,
this is not an introspective anarchist. Just think about it, how different that is. The
anarchist doesn't trust the secret immediately from the beginning. The secret really
has to be valuable for the anarchist to accept it. But the opportunist just says, “Hey,
this is an opportunity. I’m not going to question whether this opportunity is really
solid or not.” That‟s not something you can impugn them with. It‟s not like they‟re
doing anything wrong; they just don't work that way. They're not going to do that.
The only thing they're going to do with their 1st line Personality is try to get as good
as they can in having all the data together so they can transpersonally give out their
secret to others in order to gain influence. It‟s very different.
It‟s a huge difference between a 1/3 child and a 1/4 child. The 1/3 child, you tell
them something and they will not accept it on face value. And whether that's con-
scious or unconscious doesn't matter. They just won‟t accept it on face value, even
while they're nodding their head. There's a part of them that has to check it out,
trial and error, one way or another. But when you tell something to a 1/4 child, it‟s
like, “Okay, okay, well I'll take your word for it. You know, I'm not interested in
checking it out. I'm just interested in telling somebody else this.” So, the 1/4 child
who has the loose tooth and the mother says that the tooth fairy is going to come
and leave a little prize under the pillow, the 1/4, even though there's a part of it they
can be deeply skeptical, the 1/4 will just accept the money. And, of course, the
next day they‟re in school telling all their friends, “Hey, look the tooth fairy brought
me this money.” There is the 1/3 saying, “You‟re a jerk, and what tooth fairy? What
bank does it use? Where does it get its money?” and on and on and on. It‟s very
different.

The 2nd line is a natural and everything about the 2nd line is that secrets are not

for. So you have somebody with that configuration and they come up to you and
say, “I'm going to India, I'm going to seek the truth, to find the secret.” The thing
is, “Hey, excuse me, when you leave here today before you get on the subway, you
may not find the secret, it will find you.”
And it‟s not going to find you where you think you're going to find it. It isn‟t. The
fulfillment of your purpose through mind is never something that you are in charge
of because it's just going to happen. It will call you. That secret is going to call you.
And at the moment you're operating correctly within yourself—the Generator who's
asked about something, who is called to something, who responds correctly, there
lies the potential. The potential is that direction, that secret is just given to them.
The other thing is when we talk about the 2nd line, generally we are talking about the
natural. Now that can be natural brilliance, that can be natural talent, that can be
naturally gifted; there is this naturalness. In other words, they don't have to study
to become something, they have a natural ability for it. So these beings, also within
this context, are naturals for the secret. What I mean by that is that where some-
body else has to go look for higher awareness, they just happen to be more aware.
They‟re lucky, they're a natural.
It was like years ago I used to talk about my neighbor and for months I noticed that
whenever the Moon was full I could hear him pumping water in the field. One day he
came over to my house to bring me firewood and I said to him, “That‟s wonderful the
way you work with the Moon.” And he looked at me like I was nuts. “What do you
mean, work with Moon?” And I said, “Well when the Moon is full, the Moon has its
strongest pull on the earth.” And I said, “Whenever the Moon is full, you're out there
pumping your water.” And he said, “Oh yeah, really?” That was natural brilliance.
He didn‟t have to study the fact that the Moon has a pull and that if you‟re actually
pumping water on a full Moon night, it actually takes less energy. He didn‟t have to
study that.
A 1st line being would study that. You know, one of these return-to-nature freaks—
All right, we‟re going to save energy; we‟re only going to pump water when the Moon
is full because it has this pull. The 2nd line being does it anyway. It doesn‟t know all
that. It‟s just attuned to it. It is a natural. The thing that makes them so uncom-
fortable is when somebody like me, Mr. 1st line, points out to them how clever they
are. He was embarrassed. He didn't know whether I was making fun of him; he
didn‟t. It was like, “What do you mean?”
And for most 2nd line beings, when somebody looks into them, because the 2nd line is
something you can look into, when you look into them and say, “Hey, you really
have a gift for, blah, blah, blah,” they get very uncomfortable because, of course,
they‟re not masters of their gift. They didn't build it themselves, work on it them-
selves, it's just there. One of the things you don‟t do with those who are natural is
re-educate them because you take away their gift. You know, you try to refine
them. You try to help them by giving them some techniques that might help. You
don't re-educate them because all of it will be lost. There‟s just a gift there.

So when you're looking here at the 2nd line variation in the 13, what you're looking at
is a natural gift, a natural gift to have secrets revealed. It‟s just there suddenly; it
calls you. Now, of course, one of things about the not-self is that you may come in
as a 2/4, Sun in 13th Sphinx and never notice that anything ever showed up. It‟s
something to recognize about the 2nd line. The 2nd line is a line of barrier. It‟s why it
has to be called. That why when you look at the 59.2, you'll see that there's a bar-
rier to intimacy that has to be broken down. If you don't break down the 2nd line‟s
barrier, you never get access to them. The not-self 2nd line being can be so self
absorbed that they don't even hear opportunity when it knocks. And this is a 2/4
configuration. We have a 2/4 waiting for that opportunity to come to call and for
them to make something out of it.
One of things you‟ll notice about 1/4s and 2/4s is that real fulfillment for them in
their process is always when their unconscious finally drags them out into the world
and they discover that they're surrounded by people who like them. It is the 4th line
quality, this brotherhood/sisterhood, this ability to be able to bond through friend-
ship, the ability to be influential to those you know. So, this 2/4 in terms of its se-
crets, it's not about, “All right you have to study George, or Jane.” It's about, “Look,
the secrets will come, wait for the call. When the call comes, the opportunity can be
there.” And once the opportunity is there, remember that if you have a 4th line at
your unconscious—the 1/3 isn‟t in a hurry to tell anybody else that the secret is a lie
because they don't want the others to say, “Aha, they found out because they fell for
it.” So they rarely tell people. But the 1/4 and the 2/4 can't help themselves. They
tell their friends; they have to. It is pulled out of them because of the social nature,
the transpersonal nature of their unconscious.

The 2/5
RAC Sphinx 1
When you get to a 2/5, you get to a projection that is very uncomfortable. You know
when a 2/5 13 walks into the room just about everybody, at some level, is projecting
that this person knows something that we don't know, and that they may or may not
tell us. That's a very uncomfortable projection. And because it's a 2nd line Personali-
ty it is going to receive the call. But it's not social in the context of the 4th line un-
conscious; you have a 5th line unconscious. The 5th line is always subject to the
projection that it can fulfill whatever the projector assumes it can fulfill. So when
you meet somebody who is a 13 Sphinx and they are 2/5, the automatic projection is
they have a secret and that secret may change my life. That secret could make my
life better, that secret to take away my pain, that secret could make me rich. They
may have no secrets at all.
This is always my story of the Buddha who gets beaten to death. This is the 2/5
because it doesn't even know that it has a secret. Everybody else assumes it has a
secret. The moment somebody's knocking on its door, it‟s demanding the secret.
This is the kind of person, where on a crowded street, a lost person is going to ask
them. There are 8000 people walking by on the street and the person who is lost is
going to grab them. And, of course, often it's really the wrong person. The assump-

tion in projection that they have the secret doesn‟t mean they do. It never means
they do, maybe. So you ask the 2/5 Sphinx on the street, “Hey I‟m lost, do you
know where—“ “No, I‟m from out of town.” They don‟t know; and not only that, but
when you walk away from them, you‟re mad at them—I‟ll never ask that idiot again.
Ah, what the 5s have to live with in terms of projection and false expectation.
One of the values of the 2/5 is that if it is called as a natural to a secret, a secret of
direction—and remember again by saying “secret” all the time it really gives it this
kind of exhausted quality. But I truly want you to see this in the whole mundane: If
I know what you don't know, I have the secret. So, it doesn‟t matter what that is,
and it doesn‟t matter at what level that is; it‟s so important. Direction in this life is
rooted in knowledge. Remember, purpose fulfilled through mind, being able to guide
people, in that sense, the direction. It's very important to see that those secrets
cover everything. We‟re always seeking that from each other. We always want
something you know that we don't know.
When you're dealing with the 5th line, you're dealing with an assumption that they
know what you don't know, just the assumption of it. Now, if there is a 2/5 who has
that capacity to be able to reveal something that is of value that the other does not
know, and they can reveal something that's practical—oh, I know where that place
is. What you do is get on this bus over here, it‟s two stops, you get out, you walk
eleven paces to the left and there's the hotel. The moment they can deliver practi-
cally, there is that person saying, “Oh you're so nice, it‟s so nice to meet somebody
like you in the city like this. Why don‟t you come along, I‟ll buy you coffee.” The
reality is that the moment the 5th line can provide a practical solution—which is al-
ways its thing, the 49.5, practical solutions in revolutionary times—all the pressure is
off and you get the reward.
So think about all these 2/5 Sphinxes who are not-self and think about how difficult
that is. Everybody assumes they know things that they may not know. The boss
assumes you know how to do something that you may not know how to do. And you
don't say anything because you're a hermit Personality, and they don't say anything
because they assume you're going to do it. And when you can‟t, you‟re fired and
then you wonder why and there was this assumption that you knew, and you didn't.

We saw our first 3 variation in the 1/3 that the intellectual potential that there is an
answer to your question because that's basically what this is all about. The potential
that there is an answer to your question doesn't mean that answer is true. So we
see right away the discernment that begins in our evolutionary process with the 1/3
and its contribution. The 1/3 keeps us all honest; the 3rd line value is that it will
show us, even if it's painful, those things that are false and it will show those things
that do not work.

On a personal level for the not-self, that‟s very painful and there's very little recov-
ery from that. It can be a lifelong process of deep pessimism in trying to live with
the results of that. I've had great success, and it's why I have a real kinship aside
from my sons being 1/3s. I've had great success in my professional life in being able
to help 3rd line beings with a very simple turnaround in their psychology, that psy-
chology of when something doesn't work, it's not, “I made a mistake and I failed.”
When something doesn't work, it's something that's been discovered, and something
valuable that's been discovered that not only is it an important lesson for that being
on their road to development, but ultimately it can be a resource and can be of value
that they can use in their interaction with others, particularly in the context of a
Sphinx.
When you're dealing when with a Sphinx, you are dealing with direction as a sche-
matic of purpose. You come into this life as a Sphinx, you are here to fulfill your
purpose, you are here to provide direction, to be the direction. And of course the
moment you're operating correctly as yourself, the direction is correct. And the
moment you have those aspects within your costume in your profile that bring you
into interaction with others, then your ability to guide them will be correct. The fact
is that the Personality of the 1/4 or the 2/4, despite the fact that that Personality has
very little interest in sharing with the other, they cannot avoid that their unconscious
will do that. It will bring them into contact with the other; it will bring out the ability
of the Right Angle to pass this message along.
Remember that the Right Angle is intended to be the research zone of a hexa-
gram. The publicity zone is a Left Angle. So, the Right Angle has to go through
research, but it cannot just do the research without passing it on; it does, the
movement of information. So, a 1/4 or a 2/4 will immediately move the 1st line and
2nd line information into the social-connected realm as opportunities arise. In other
words, it is this movement of information.
Okay, so we come to the 3/5 and in looking at the 3/5 3rd line Personality, this is
quite different. This is the pessimism that there are no secrets. This is the Sphinx
that says, “There are many directions, but there are no directions.” This is the ulti-
mate cop-out of the wise, pessimistic Sphinx. “Yes, there are many directions of the
world, lad, but they do not matter.” “I've come to find my way, master, which way
shall I go?” “Well, whichever way the wind blows, it doesn’t matter,” because the
pessimism is, “Yes, there are many paths, but I don't know if there are really many
secrets at the end of those paths. I don't really think so, and I’ve tried them.”
One thing about a 3rd line Personality is it is always going to experiment with the
secrets. When a 3rd line asks you something—is the world round—and you say very
comfortably, matter-of-factly “yes,” don't assume for a moment that they accept
that. They don‟t. They really don‟t. All these kids are being taught this stuff—it‟s
round—all those 3rd line Personalities are going, “Well, yeah, maybe, I don't know,
maybe it‟s flat.” And the only way is when they see it for themselves, when they do
it for themselves, when they live it for themselves.
They‟re designed to be the ultimate, experiential Personality. There is nothing more
experiential than a 3rd line, nothing. This is the mutative way; this is the material

The Fellowship of Man
way; this is the nature of life, and it is trial and error. These are the toughest of
beings, tough, tough fiber. You kick them, they get back up. You knock them down,
they get back up. This is the nature of the 3rd line.
So, one of the things that happens with the 3rd line being is that the not-self, in
going through and exploring, right from the beginning, trusting is one of the great
sicknesses of the 3rd line. The 3rd line and the 6th line have, through their harmony
and through the nature of the 6th line mutative process of the 3 phases, have a deep
relationship to each other. The 6th line is the potential embodiment of trust. The 3rd
line is the embodiment of distrust. The moment the 3rd line is trusting is the mo-
ment it's going to fall down and hurt itself. The moment it is trusting that it can walk
at night on a stone path in Ibiza, you will discover right away that the stones will
meet you right in the face.
It's one of the things to grasp about the nature of what is a 3rd line Sphinx. They will
have tried things that have failed. And the direction they put out to others is a
negative direction. That's why the 3/5s are the great runaways. Fifth lines, anyway,
have a problem. If you go up to a 5th line and say, “I know that you can help me,”
and the 5th line tries to help you and it doesn't work, then that person is going to say
as many bad things as they can, to as many people as they can, about that 5th line.
It was just what it is. I‟m a 5th line Personality; I know what this projection field is
like; I know how it works. If you have a projection that I‟m going to give you some-
thing and you don't get it, oh, boy the movie that people have.
So think about this poor 3/5 Sphinx; everybody assumes they know the way. They
have a secret, they know the way. And of course, when you actually have to deal
with them, you discover right away that what they're going to say to you, “No, I
don‟t have any secret,” and you don't believe them. And the moment that some-
thing goes wrong, you punish them. Three-five‟s are punished more deeply for fail-
ure than anybody else. They punish themselves over failure and are punished by
others over failure because others have the expectation that they're not going to fail.
So many 3/5 Sphinxes get into so much trouble and get blamed so much by telling
people where to go. They get into so much trouble.
There is obviously something very magical on the other side about the 3/5 expe-
rience. Trial and error does lead to certainties. It is the testing ground of the validi-
ty of any process. With the 5th line unconscious is the ability to transpersonally un-
iversalize that discovery. Three-five‟s are great at research. These are the people,
you give them a product or a drug or a thing and they analyze it and they probe it,
they're the ones who will tell you whether it works or doesn't work. They will an-
nounce it to everyone; everyone, everywhere, letting them all know.
So there is a potential. It has always been part of my discussion about the nature of
being that we live within the context of a pure binary, and in understanding the na-
ture of the binary, one must understand that half of us, in a sense, a big generaliza-
tion, half of us are about trying to find out what works and half of us are trying to
find what doesn't. It's only when we ultimately work together that we become more
and more efficient. This efficiency is the most important thing to humanity. All of us

like to be more efficient. The more efficient we are, the less we have to work. The
more we have rewards, and so forth, the easier things are. It‟s all about efficiency.
Everything about the 3rd line processes is that they are the ones we rely on. We rely
on them. The 1/3s, we rely on of them, the 3/5s, the 3/6s, the 6/3s, we rely on
them to tell us what doesn't work, otherwise we‟re not efficient. So, if secrets are
going to be tested, give it to the 3/5 to test. You know somebody who's a 13 who is
a 3/5 Sphinx, and somebody has told you about some kind of formula that can
change your life and you‟re not certain, give it to them. “Hey, will you try this out?”
The 3rd line, things bump into them because they‟re perfect. Their initial pessimism
is: This won't work. It‟s a great way to start.
How many 3rd line beings have come to opening lectures of mine? I‟ve watched this
movie, it‟s great. The moment they get in there, if they have a 5th line unconscious,
they have the potential to say, “Hey, whoa, this thing actually works,” because that‟s
what they‟re good for. They‟re great testers. So if you want to test the secrets, if
you want to test the way, here's the being when they're living out their purpose.
Think about this individual who has to live with this cross in this configuration and
they‟re not-self. All they want to do is hide. Most of the time they're hoping that the
only secret that is going to matter is death because it's a very, very uncomfortable
life. Life didn't turn out to be what they thought it could be. They didn't find the
magic in life, they're very uncomfortable with the world they live in because the
people around them are disappointed in them. That 5th line unconscious, how diffi-
cult it is for the 3/5 to live with that unconscious, that unconscious projection of
others that they are going to have the solution, that they are going to have the se-
cret, that they are the ones who can show you the way. They get into such a state
in their life where basically they just want to run away, and they do. You know, they
run away from what they assume is failure in the hope that they can start again
somewhere else where people don't know them, where people don't know that they
have failed to deliver the goods.

5/2—and basically it‟s the 4/1 and the 5/1—that are going to be concerned with
getting that secret out to others.
But the moment you get to the 6th line, what you get is the potential that the secret
can be embodied in the life. In other words, you don't have to tell anybody the se-
cret because all they have to do is see that you are the secret; it is you. It‟s not
something else. You're living it. This is the magical potential of the 6th line. We
know that the 6th line, in its three processes in life, goes from subjective, the Satur-
nian cycle, to objective, the roof cycle, until Kiron. And once you get beyond Kiron
to the final stage, in that final stage you are neither this nor that. In other words,
you are neither just objective nor just subjective; you are simply you. It's not about
learning from the subject. It's not about teaching from the object. It‟s about living
the binary as yourself in balance. Now, that‟s something else.
So, when we're looking at the 3/6 in this context, when a 3/6 walks by you, if they
really have their movie together, what you‟re thinking is, “They know something.”
It's like they know something. You don‟t know what it is they know. There‟s this
kind of—they know something. It doesn't mean you're actually even going to go and
asked them what it is. You won‟t. There is just the sense that they know some-
thing. If you‟re a 4, your friends are going to want to know and you‟re going to want
to tell them. If you‟re a 5, strangers are going to want to know and you‟re going to
want to tell them. But if you are a 6, you're just it. You're not designed to tell them.
That's not the nature of it. You are designed to be a role model. You‟re designed to
be an example of it.
So, the Right Angle will discover, and not, secrets. The beginning of the Left Angle
process will publicize what that is, but only the 6th line is actually here to live it, in
that sense. They‟re simply here to live it. They may not even know that they know
the secret. You get this all the time. Some 112 year-old woman is being inter-
viewed. And the interviewer is saying, “What‟s your secret?” And she says, “Well,
you know, one shot of bourbon a day, I smoke a stogy on Sundays and I always
walk my cow.” Whatever. And it's not like that does anybody any good because you
know that's not the truth; you know that's not the secret.
It's one of those things about the 6; what it is difficult for 6th line beings is that other
people see things in you. They see the secret alive in you. And yet there is no way
for them, within that the mechanics of how things work, to ask you for that or for the
secret. What they're ready to do is trust you because they assume you have it be-
cause they can see it in the way you will act as a role model. It‟s a curious piece of
business.
Now, whenever you're dealing with a 6th line in the Profile, you're dealing with three
phases. Anyone who has to go through being a 3/6 will understand that that first
phase is not a cup of tea. You're dealing with a 3/3 phase. In dealing with a 3/3
phase, you know that the most interesting thing for 3/6s and 6/3s is the potential in
them in the first Saturnian cycle in their lives to actually become very eclectic. In
other words, they‟re liable to open up to a great many interests at a very, very early
age.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
The more things you look at, the less frightening is the fact that most of them don't
work. If you only have to look at something very important that doesn't work, it's
frightening, like your life, your relationship with your parents as a child. That can be
very frightening as a 3rd line being. You can be deeply upset by that; it can be really
difficult in your life. But what often happens with the influence of the 6, because the
6 is designed, ultimately, to have this objective overview from the roof, is that it gets
to look and see many more things. So there is a very powerful—and remember this
Quarter where we have purpose fulfilled through mind—this is a very powerful, men-
tally stimulating field.
So, if you're somebody who comes in on the 13 and you‟re a 3/6, one things to rec-
ognize is that in that child's first thirty-year process, they are going to look at many,
many, many, many, many different things. They're going to be curious, in that
sense, about many things. They're also going to discover that many things don't
work. The more things they discover that don't work, the healthier they're going to
be. It seems odd. If you're 1/3 and you find out that only one thing doesn't work,
it‟s already disturbed you. That's very different. You're a 1 and you want things to
be solid. And the moment your mother says something and she doesn't do it, all this
kind of stuff, it‟s instantaneous, it's deep, the impact is very powerful.
But when you‟re a 3/6 and your road is that you're going to have to fulfill the poten-
tial of your unconscious which is about having that vast overview, and you‟re going
to go through a 3/3 phase at the beginning, the more things you see that don't work,
the least personal it is. For the 1/3, it is deeply personal. It's like the secret not
being true is something that was personally done to me—I hate God. Only a 1/3 can
actually say that and mean it. A 3/6 will say, “All the gods are full of shit some of
the time. So, it doesn't mean I should get depressed that my variation doesn’t pay
any attention to me. It seems like most of the variations don't pay anything to any-
body, so that's okay.”
In other words, the messier it is—it‟s very chaotic to be a 3/6 or a 6/3—the more
there is out there, the healthier it is for them. If you're going to come in and be a
3/6 in any of the variations of any of the crosses of the Quarter of Initiation, then
mental stimulation and lots of interesting stuff to explore is going to be healthy for
you because in that you begin to discover that you noticed, yourself, what doesn't
work. You begin to see you actually have a gift. You begin to resonate to seeing
clearly this isn‟t going to work, that isn‟t going to work, and so forth and so on.
Now, if you don't have proper guidance, it's very difficult to be 3/6 and to be able to
coast along as I've just described it. Obviously, there‟s a great deal of pressure;
there is a lot of pain that is possible; there‟s a lot of disappointment in terms of the
way in which you are seen by your family. Remember, 3rd line children do break
things, make mistakes, and have problems. They are going to get into trouble in the
ordinary household; they are going to be seen as children who somehow need more
help, or more work, or this or that, the concerns of the parent the child takes in,
obviously.
So, one of our responsibilities is about changing the way in which a parent sees its
child. You know if you see the profile of your child, it‟s going to make a great deal of

difference. So, a 13 who has a 3/6, there is a great potential there. The potential is
that they will look at a great many secrets. And not simply that they will explore
them intellectually to see whether they're valid or not, but they will actually incorpo-
rate them into their lives. And that incorporation, which is difficult for the 3/6, will
take place at the unconscious level; suddenly they become the thing that they inves-
tigate; it takes them over.
So they can become the embodiment, in that sense, of the secret. Obviously, in
dealing with any 6th line being, you're not going to find any stability in their process
until they enter into the second phase of their life, until they go up on the roof and
they begin to distance themselves from the direct 3rd line phenomena, the double
phenomenon, and they begin to have the possibility of finding the optimism that they
need in order to find that balance to their pessimism.

The 4/6
RAC Sphinx 1
That brings us to the 4/6 and the close of the Right Angle variation. Think about it.
When you start with the 1/3, you have two lower trigram lines. When you finish with
the 4/6, you have two upper trigram lines. The 1/3 and the 4/6 are natural harmo-
nies to each other—the 1 to the 4, the 3 to the 6. It's really a very poetic, very per-
fect, geometrical bookend, if you will. Just as the 1/3 has difficulties in its self-
absorption because it is so absorbed in itself, the 4/6 has a problem in that it's so
absorbed in the other. And yet it's not transpersonal. It‟s not a transpersonal angle.
This can be a real dilemma for them in their life, that while they‟re paying attention
to everybody else, they get ill and die because they weren't paying any attention to
themselves.
There is a tendency in the 4/6, the voyeur looking outward, to not notice what's
happening around. What I've just given you is the only way you can understand the
4/6 and its relationship to secrets. It's always looking for the secret all around
when, in fact, it may be sitting on it and doesn't see it. This is classic 4/6. “It must
be out there somewhere.” They're looking for it. It‟s like looking for the key to the
car. They're looking everywhere only to discover that it was in the ignition. And
there they are looking everywhere for it.
So one of the dilemmas of the 4/6 is that they may have paid so much attention to
the outside that they don‟t really see what's essential for them. The 4th line Perso-
nality is an opportunistic Personality and one that can be deeply influential to those
they know within their circle. And the 4th line, as a Personality, is designed to reveal
the secret in order to attain influence. They will reveal secrets whether this secret is
valuable or not. Think about that. If you're a 4th line Personality, you have no
choice but to try to influence your friends. You have no choice. That's just what you
are. You are fulfilled through moving the foundation, in the harmony from the 1 to
the 4, moving that foundation outward to the other. That's the trip.

A Digital Book for Students
So, if you‟re a 4/6 Sphinx and you read an article in a new age magazine that the
secret is water, and a certain kind of water where the water goes backwards instead
of forwards, or you get an Australian toilet or something. But anyway, the secret is
water. You're not going to look into that. You‟re the voyeur; you've seen that the
secret is water. At least the secret is water for others. And while you're having a
cup of coffee made from polluted water and drinking it down, you're telling your
friend on the phone about the wonders of your water that rotates backwards. It can
be quite hypocritical.
Now, remember that the 4/6 has the greatest tendency of any Profile to be hypocriti-
cal. And again, this is not about fault. It‟s not like they choose that. It‟s one of the
aspects of the 6th line. Remember that until we had the advent of the nine-centered
being, the 6th line, once it went up onto the roof, would stay there and get colder and
colder and more distant and more distant and more influential. And when you look
at the 10.6, 10th hexagram, 6th line and you look at the detriment, you know, the
detriment of a hypocrite: Do as I say, not as I do. So we, in our Western culture,
the philosophers who have been instruments of our Western culture, the vast majori-
ty of them were: Do as I say, not as I do.
This is one of the tendencies of the 6th line. So when you're dealing with a 4/6,
when you're dealing with an opportunistic voyeur who has the capacity within them
to say, “Do as I say not as I do,” they have the tendency of putting out any old se-
cret. Now, there‟s a value in that. If they keep on putting out secrets all the time,
some of them may be useful and may provide a real opportunity for others. The
moment the 4/6 sees that being able to provide direction is not a single path, this is
the great step forward for a 4/6 who would be a Sphinx. It's not about telling every
person you meet that this is the pathway. It's about recognizing that there are dif-
ferent pathways and that different pathways function for different people under dif-
ferent circumstances and it's the only way they can get away with being a hypocrite.
“I can tell you to take this pathway because I know that this pathway will work for
you. By the way, I never took his pathway because it wouldn't work for me.”
Only when you deal the 4/6 13th Sphinx can you speak that way. It's not: Take this
pathway because I know this is the way because I‟ve been down this line and this is
the thing to do, and blah, blah, blah, this is really the way. No, their greatest ca-
pacity to influence is their ability to be able to discern different pathways for different
situations. And so at the end of the process, the 1/3 is looking for that one path, the
one that will never disappoint it, the path that will take it to the secret is the essen-
tial, Holy Grail of its process. The 4/6 is here to discover that there are many, many
paths. As a role model, that can be opportunistic, and that by example, it can guide
others.
Ultimately the 4/6 has to find its path, but the irony is that it can only find its path if
it is with the right people. There is no other way for a 4/6. The great dilemma of
the 4/6 when it's a child is that that 4/3 configuration of the first cycle is going to
lead to them making a lot of mistakes in their friendships and being surrounded by
the wrong circle. And in being surrounded by the wrong circle, not necessarily that it
leads to them being, you know, junkies, criminals or dead on the street, but it can
also lead to the wrong people in terms of potential opportunities in the future. If all

of your friends work in the same factory, your potential as a 4/6 is to get a job in
that factory. That‟s it, because you don‟t have the circle that is going to provide you
with the potential opportunities elsewhere.
The Right Angle process of the Sphinx is the discovery through experience of an-
swers, and whether the answers are legitimate or not. And so this is the beginning
of the mental process. The beginning of the mental process is: What are the rules?
How do we play this game? How do we play the game simpler? How do we teach
each other how to play the game better? And so forth and so on. And this is a men-
tal processes; it is mental direction.

The 4/1
When you get to Juxtaposition—and again, Juxtaposition is a pure accent. Here you
get to the Juxtaposition Cross of Listening. Listening to something that's very diffi-
cult; it's very, difficult. It‟s not the
same as hearing. You listen to the
radio but you don't necessarily hear
what they're saying. You can listen
to the television, but you don‟t nec-

essarily hear what anybody is say-

z ing. It‟s how people have radios on
z
z in the background. You are listen-
z
z ing, but you‟re not really hearing it.
That's important. And it's one of the
z
things to understand about the na-
z
ture of secrets. Secrets are not
z obvious; otherwise, they wouldn‟t be
z  a secret. One of the things about
 z the secret is that it isn't necessarily
something you hear because if

you're listening, it's always there. I

z When I was going through my mys-
tical process, my deep proceszs, every once in a while I would be sitting somewhere
and there would be a certain thought that was moving across, and I would hear a
conversation suddenly, and I‟d be listening to this in the background. I would hear
these people say something and what they would say, maybe a few words of it, was
exactly what I needed to hear, exactly. Now when you're crazy, that happens a lot.
It just does, it happens a lot.

One of the things that I understand about the crazy state is that the idea isn't to
take all of that so seriously that you spend your life waiting to be guided, in that
sense. But it's something to recognize about the nature of being. It is in the air.
It's all there and it‟s all around. The thing that‟s so magical about the 13 Juxtaposi-
tion person is that they pull the secrets out of the ether. They don‟t pull the secret
directly out of you, in that sense; they don‟t. For example, they meet you on the
street, and they say, “Hi,” and you say, “Hi.” And you asked them about something
they did the other day and they say a few things. And as you're walking away, the
thought that is in your head is, “Oh, he must've just broken up with his girlfriend.”
Now, there's nothing in that conversation that was said that you could hear where
that person said, “I‟m having a lot of problems with Alice,” and blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. It's not like it was in the person's tone.
In other words, there is a magical facility to hear something in that listening to catch
something. Most of the time you don't even really know you're catching it. Most the
time it is not so much that while you're thinking you're processing. Most of the time
it's the day later, or a day after that when you're sitting with somebody else and
they ask you how Joe is and you say, “Yeah, I think he's having problems with Alice,”
and you don't know where that came from. And the friend says, “Hey, how did you
know that?” And suddenly you're in that space where, “Ah, he said it to me.” Oh
boy, you don't know how many times that has caused somebody a lot of trouble
because he didn't say it. You caught it in your listening, but you didn't hear him say
that to you. And of course it gets back to him and he calls you up (angry noises).
In American Indian tradition, there were listeners. Basically they were just there for
the background sound. It's just all the background. There's a facility of penetrating
the background and in that, a secret is revealed. By the way, for the not-self, that is
very confusing at times. You can imagine, “I thought I heard you say, I thought I
heard you say, I thought I heard you say,” and you end up being distrusted by those
very people whom you need. This is a 4/1, after all. You need your opportunities in
order to get out your depth. But you can see that buried underneath this 1st line,
underneath this introspection, this is the secret of listening, very deep underneath, in
the unconscious, taking it in. There‟s the 4 Personality babbling away to its friends
and it can get into a lot of trouble because it knows things it doesn't even know it
knows.
Now if you have such a gift, if you‟re born with that, that's something that can be
developed as a process in life. It's a skill, after all, and is the way that the purpose
is meant to be fulfilled by this being. The secrets are not obvious. Nor do they have
to be. The truth is everywhere. It's the same thing with seeing, the nature of see-
ing. There is so much to be seen, and how little we see. There is so much in the
listening field. You know it's always there. When anybody talks to you, they reveal
all their secrets, all of them.
Think about the way the brain works. The brain does not store words, it only stores
sound formulas. It does not store words. When you're stringing your sound formu-
las together, and I say „you stringing them,‟ when it's being strung, your sound for-
mula together, in that sound formula there are relationships to sounds that if you
put them beside each other, it would sound like (sound). But because you put them

in different places, they don't make that sound, but it doesn't mean they're not
there.
You'd be surprised what actually comes out of somebody's mouth in terms of infor-
mation when they're speaking that goes beyond the words, that goes beyond the
superficial mood of their words, that goes beyond the tonal fluctuation in their words,
that goes to the core of what the formulas are within the actual construct of the
words themselves. And the fact that sounds in a formula would make one meaning
together, “I need help,” broken up and placed in different areas that actually come
out sounding like they‟re other parts of other words, doesn't mean that “I need help”
isn't in that formula.
The listeners can get those secrets. And, of course, depending on your design, if
you‟re highly intuitive, it'll come out in your characteristics as your intuition. If
you're emotional, it will come out as a feeling. In other words, it will have its ways
of filtering through your characteristics so it comes to the surface that understand
the principle. Now remember that if you don't know how this works, it can be very,
very uncomfortable in terms of the not-self.

and on occasion Juxtaposition. So when you come to the 5/1, you actually come to
the only true Left Angle expression. The 5/2 rarely does its job, because again,
we‟re dealing with the not-self. So when you're dealing with a 5/1, what you're deal-
ing with is a universalizing Personality and a Personality that has a projection on it
that it can come up with the solutions.
And so it‟s 5/1s who are universally presumed to have, as Sphinxes with the Sun in
the 13th gate, if you were to line up the 12 profiles of the 13th gate, each person with
their Sun in a different profile, it is the 5/1 who will be assumed to have the secret
immediately. If you happen to know all the people, you would choose the 4/1 be-
cause, again, the 4/1 has much more influence than a 5/1. Its influence is more
direct, it has a closer circle, and it influences its friends. But if that were 12 stran-
gers looking at 12 strangers and you were asked which one of these people do you
think has an important secret, they would go to the 5/1. Which goes to show you
the kind of problems 5/1s have in this life because the fact that people assume you
have the secret if your Sun is in the 13 doesn't mean that you do; and that at the
unconscious level, you better have done your homework.
But the real role of the 5/1 is to get the secrets out, to universalize the secrets. The
only way the 5/1 is going to feel good in this life if they‟re a 13 is if they‟re out there
telling strangers the secrets. It doesn't matter what the secrets are. In most cases,
the more heretical they are, the more satisfying it is; but nonetheless, their job is to
get the secret out. This is not the secret of direction anymore because we're not
talking about Sphinxes. And this is not the secret of truths that are everywhere.
This is listening. This is the secret of masks. Everything about the 5/1 of the 13 is
to unmask those who don't provide the truth.
What I mean by “provide the truth,” remember that the responsibility of the 13th
gate is to codify our experience to make it possible for us to learn from our expe-
rience so that life can be more efficient and that we have fewer problems with it.
That is the nature of the 13th gate. That is what it's all about. And when you're
dealing with the 5th line of the 13, you're dealing with the heavy, heavy expectation
of salvation. This is the empathic force that is really going to provide you with the
secret.
When you look at the program and you see that if you don't follow your Strategy,
how painful the results are. How difficult it is to be a 5/1 on the Cross of Masks and
that rather than being able to reveal what lies beneath the masks of others, you
yourself are hidden behind a mask, and you are afraid to come out into the world.
There is nothing more paranoid than the 5th line Personality. There's nothing that
feels more threatened by the demands of the outside world than a 5th line Personali-
ty. And the demand that you have a secret, you either have it or you don't. If they
don't think the secret you gave them was worthwhile, then you have to suffer the
pain and retribution of them that you did not fulfill their expectation.
So the reality is that by the time you get to any 5/1 on any cross, what you get to is
a very weak publicity department. This is something to understand. Four-ones do a
much better job than 5/1s; they have more support. They tend to be locked into
accommodating communities where they have their opportunity to display their in-

fluence, which is why when you look at most things that come into the world, they
come in small cabals, which are basically 4th line themes. They don't instantly un-
iversalize because universalization is difficult. It's difficult because most 5/1s have
given up on trying. They give up on trying very early in life.
After all, if you‟re a 5th line Personality and you come into the world, your parents
expect the moment you're born that you‟re going to be a perfect child, which means
within hours of your birth you've already disappointed them. And you feel the vibra-
tion, and there's no escaping that. So, the expectation that 5/1s, which is a very
exalted Profile in terms of the capacity to be able to transform the universal under-
standing of something, very few 5/1s actually operate successfully in the universaliz-
ing sense. So, in this kind of configuration, you may pull out that person who is the
5/1 with the projection assumption that they're the ones who are going to give you
the secret, that they're the ones who are going to be able to unmask the truth, and
they can't. And you punish them for that. You punish them because they made a
fool out of you because you thought it was them and they really resent that. People
want help and if you don't give them something that's helpful, they really resent it;
they really resent it.

The 5/2  7  23
LAC Masks 1
When we come to the 5/2, we come to the extreme example of resistance to giving
anybody anything. You have a 2nd line unconscious, that‟s the hermetic uncons-
cious; it wants to be left alone. You have a 5th line Personality that's paranoid, that
knows it gets punished if it doesn't deliver. One of the things about the 5/2s is that
they are often considered to be dark, malevolent forces in this variation of Masks.
They're the ones who actually hold deep secrets that they never let anybody know.
These are the manipulators of the world; these are the ones who know the tricks,
who have the inside dope, who know the way to go, blah, blah, blah. And they're
not going to tell anybody.
Often, they're confronted with that. It can be very difficult for them because again,
having a 5th line Personality means there are others who assume things about them.
And because this is the Cross of Masks which means that the truth is hidden. The
mask is a diversion, after all. These are beings who have incredible masks. They
really divert you from what's really going on. So you know, you see them at the
office and she looks like a schoolmarm. She minds her own business and she's very
polite, then she goes back to the house and sacrifices newborn young to make con-
tact with God know what.
You never know about 5/2s. Most 5/2s will be very different when they feel secure
than when they feel exposed. I mean, they really have a change of Personality when
they move in those different (sentence left unfinished.) But when you're dealing
with this in particular, they're the ones who have a very, very secretive life and keep
so many things secret from others and, ultimately, build up a resentment in others
that they're not giving up their secrets, that they're not telling the truth. The other

The 6/2
LAC Masks 1
The 6/2 is an archetype of the transition to the new form. The 6th line Personality
attuned to the three cycles of life, and this movement from the subjective to the
objective to the role model or to what is really just the quantum; just there, just
there as it. Everything about the role model hermit is just that. It's a role model
hermit. It‟s not looking for any interaction. It's looking to live out the fulfillment of
its process, and this is about living the secret. The whole thing about living the se-
cret is that the mask dissolves.
So, for example, there's always this thing about talking the talk or walking it.
They're all kinds of people who can talk about Strategy, but it doesn't necessarily
mean they're living it. This is really what it's all about. Within the 6/2 lies the ca-
pacity, particularly in this example because this example gives you classic configura-
tion. They will wear a 3rd line mask in the first cycle in their life, that 3rd line mask of
suffering and pessimism. You'll see that other face. You look at them and you'll see
they‟re suffering.
When they go up on the roof, they‟ll change their mask. Suddenly they have more
composure, suddenly there's a totally different look. This has nothing to do with
what‟s going on inside of them. This just has to do with the way in which they are
seen. By the time they get to their 3rd line phase, if they‟ve gone through this
process as themselves, then the mask is gone because they don't need it anymore.
They don't need the protection of that mask anymore because they're living the se-
cret.
It‟s not that they‟ve found the secret. Some Right Angle being found it. It‟s not like
they were the ones who even heard it from the Right Angle. Some Left Angle told
them in some transpersonal karma with them. But they live it. They‟re not interest-
ed in sharing it. They're not interested in teaching anyone because that's not their
natural tendency. After all, they‟re a 2 underneath. Their unconscious just wants to
be able to live their natural gift.
So what you get is somebody who lives the secret. So somebody says, “I’ve been
doing this all my life and this is my life,” they live it. “I’ve found the secret, I live my
secret. I’ve found his knowledge and it says that I have a Strategy and I follow the
Strategy and everybody can see it.” It‟s just there. It‟s all unmasked. The illusions;
the real secret comes through, the true self comes through, not a persona that's
carried over the face.

Whenever we get to the end of a hexagram structure to the 6/3, we always get to
something very unique because this is the ultimate, transition, mutative movement.
It's not just interested in a secret, it's sunshine, if you will. And it‟s not particularly
interested in being a role model because it's sort of temporary, because it can never
get over its unconscious 3rd line. Even when it's a role model, it still gets caught up
in the subjective. So it never gets to live it out in that way.
It's looking for something else. It's looking for the secret of principles. It's looking
to the next hexagram. It's looking to where it's naturally going. It's going to the
49th hexagram. It‟s going to revolution; it‟s going to the gate of Principles. In other
words, all of those secrets, however they operated through each of the profiles, by
the time you get to the 6/3, you get to the realization that this is just a genetic chain
and these secrets are not of value in and of themselves. They lead to something.
The discovery of anything being made more efficient leads to the establishment of
fixed principles so that others can live by those principles and no longer be con-
cerned about what it took to get the place of efficiency in the first place.
So, one of things to see about 6/3s is that whenever you're looking at a 6/3, look at
the next hexagram, because what you're going to see is what they're really interest-
ed in. This is often their great dilemma. There's so much crisis around them, so
much trial and error, up-and-down, yo-yo stuff, their 3/3 phase in the beginning.
They go up on the roof and yet their unconscious never lets them really stay there.
There's all this turmoil for them and the only thing that keeps them healthy is that
there is that on the horizon, there are real principles. We don't have to look any
more. It looks back down over the building that it's a part of it and says, “All of you,
forget about that, it’s okay; we’re going to have principles now.” And principles
means it‟s not up to us, on our own, that we have to go out and find the answer.
The answer is to be provided; it's over the next hill. It's in the next hexagram.
Three-sixes and 6/3s as children need a great deal of respect from their parents to
really be able to help them go through that first phase. And then all the parent
needs to do to make the way easy is to be supportive of their process, encourage
them to see the benefits, the benefits of trial and error. As long as 3rd line beings or
6th line beings who are going to have 3rd line phases understand the benefits of trial
and error, then we‟re going to have totally different human beings. We‟re going to
have a much easier road and we‟re not going to have people going down a path that
leads to a false secret that has always been a false secret because nobody has said,
“Don't go down there, this is just a waste of time.”
One of our advantages is that science has built on 3rd line beings. If it wasn't for 3rd
line beings, we would have no challenging of established formulas or concepts. We
wouldn't. Without those people who are ready to do the research, to see whether
something is legitimate or not, we do not perfect that very product or service or

whatever it is. So, 3rd line beings really need to be treated with a great deal of re-
spect.
So, at the end of the line here we come to the 6/3 of the Masks. You have to recog-
nize this is a multi-masked person, always shifting masks; always. And the shifting
of masks is there as long as the secret hasn't been discovered. It's just a mask try-
ing to deal with the chaos of the 3 or the problems of the 6, or all of those things
that are there in a 6/3 configuration, always trying to pretend that they‟re a role
model by wearing the appropriate mask. And yet what they're really looking for is to
drop the mask and to drop the mask because there are principles that will protect
them. But of course, that's the next hexagram.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Here we have the 49th gate operating out of emotional system. Obviously, in dealing
with the emotional system, we deal with the fact that the 49th gate is not clear. The
first thing to recognize about incarnating with an emotional Personality Sun is to
recognize that it's not clear. It's not clear because it's going to operate throughout
its life in a wave that the clarity itself is only going to be possible. In other words,
when you look at the 49th gate and you see that it's a gate of principles, it‟s prin-
ciples in time. The moment you put that in its proper
context, then it will help you understand the nature of
coming into a cross like this where you know right away
that the success or failure of fulfilling purpose on this
cross will begin with and end with whether they're going
to be able to be emotionally clear and to be able to live
with the authority of their emotional system.
Again, one of the most difficult things about the nature
of Incarnation Crosses is to recognize that you cannot
live out the purpose of your cross unless you are living
your life as yourself. You can't. Because you live out
the purpose of your cross, your cross takes your life
over. It really does. It takes your life over. It‟s one of
the things you see with people with mystical trajectories in their lives. All of a sud-
den something takes them over and their lives change completely. One of the things
about your cross is that by the time you've deconditioned, your cross is ready to
grab you and do with you what it wants. It is its purpose that it's interested in. It's
not your purpose, particularly not your assumption of purpose through your not-self;
forget all of that.
Okay, here we come to the first example of the Personality Sun in the emotional
Center. We have the 49th gate, we have the gate of principles, but more than that,
we have a gate of marriage and divorce, of acceptance and rejection, of being the
sacrificer and the sacrificed. We have the only gate in human beings that is specifi-
cally about killing. This is the gate where, for example, the animals have to be sacri-
ficed. This is the gate of the butcher. This is the gate of killing in order to provide
resources for others. And of course, in the perversion of the emotional system, this
can also be the killing of others in order to preserve resources for others, and so on.
We end up going to war for it. This is a deep, tribal gate. So when you‟re dealing
with the 49th gate and you're dealing with somebody who comes in with their Sun in
the 49th gate, you‟re already dealing with a hot potato. You are; you really are.

 4  23
So, let's start off with the root of this which is the Cross of Explanation. This Cross
of Explanation is found with the 43/23, so this is where it gets the majority of its
expression. But it's very important to understand that what needs to be expressed
out of the 49, what needs to be explained, is what the tribe needs. That's very im-
portant to grasp. This is what it's all about. Remember the dilemma of the 13 and
the 6/3. The dilemma was that all of
this looking for secrets is interesting,
but why don't we just establish cer-
tain principles for life that protect
everybody from not knowing, protect
everybody from the secrets they 
don't know. Why don't we collect all

of our secrets and put them together
in a principle that we can establish
for the benefit of the community.
After all, knowing secrets is a re-
source. Every country on this planet
has a stamp that says Top Secret
and nobody gets access to because

it‟s a valuable resource.

So, the whole thing about the 49 is it
establishes, what it‟s meant to es-
tablish, are what secrets are availa-
ble to everyone. What are the basic
principles? So, here is where you
really have revolution. Revolution is when those who have been denied access to
the secrets kill all those who have them so they can get them. You have the keys to
power. We want to know what that's all about. We‟re going to take it because we
deserve it, and so on.
When you're dealing with the 49th gate, you are dealing with something that is very,
very important, very significant and very deep in all of us: The explanation of an
emotional principle of what the community needs. If you‟re a fourth world person on
this cross and you look around you, your principles of what your community needs is
very different from ours, obviously. If you're in a bad mood and you‟re in the fourth
world, your idea of what the principles should be and who should have the resources
can be enormously violent. We live with this in the world all the time, every day.
Remember, without emotional clarity—50% of humanity is emotional—without the
respect of the emotional system and the way in which it operates, without waiting in
order to be clear, nobody on an emotional cross—when the Personality Sun is in an
emotional Center—is going to be able to get to live their purpose. They can't get

The 1/3
RAC Explanation 1
So, let's begin. We have a 1/3. Now think about this. If there is no emotional clari-
ty, what do you think is going to happened to that 1 in which they discover that the
principle they been given is a lie? You can imagine what's going to come out of that
anarchistic 3 underneath. You're going to have an emotional reaction. Not only are
you going to have an emotional reaction, but have in mind how deeply, deeply sensi-
tive the 19/49 is as a system, how deeply sensitive it is. It is most sensitive to
touch. I‟ve been surrounded for 20 years by people who love nothing better than
have somebody dig their thumbs into their back—massage freaks and people who
like to have their heads twisted and their bones rattled. My only activation in the
emotional system is an unconscious 49. I can't stand it. Don't put your hands me,
the deep, deep, deep sensitivity to touch.
One of the things about the nature of principles is that the principles of the 49 are
not intellectual. The principles of the 49 are always very, very, basic; basic in the
sense that you can touch them, sensitivity to the basic needs. Don't dream about
food, don't believe in food, have food to eat. In other words, don't dream that next
hunting season is going to be the best hunting season. Let's just capture some of
these creatures and breed them in captivity and then we can kill them when we‟re
hungry, and we only have to go 25 yards.
One of the things to understand about this cross is that it has more to do with trans-
forming humanity than just about any other. The 43/23 is about the efficiency. The
4 is about coming up with essential formulas. So, this is all about giving humans an
efficient way to live together through this aspect. The 49 says, “Look, principles are
only of value if they're applied to the tribe.” So again with the 1/3 in this kind of
environment, if they are not emotionally clear, then you can see that they are going
to be very unstable in the kinds of principles they're going to establish.
There‟s always something else to understand about the nature of the tribe and what
makes the tribe so difficult: You can only change the tribe by changing its feelings.
It‟s not about the facts. Principles don't equate naturally to facts. These are emo-
tional principles. Why should the rich have all the money? It's an emotional prin-
ciple. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel right that 1% of the population earns as
much as 50%. Now, it doesn't mean whether it's actually speaking or not. However
you look at it logically, blah, blah, blah, one can see that‟s best legitimate. It is what
it is, after all. No, no, no, the emotions come in and say it's not fair.

The whole thing to understand about this cross is that it is always trying to get to a
place of fairness. Now, that‟s tough to satisfy the emotional need for fairness. But
what's fair depends on who's in your tribe. It's not like this is an absolute; it's not
like it's a fact; it's not like it's the truth. It‟s relative. It's emotionally relative. Now
look, the 1/3 will grow up and will rebel against tribal principles because the tribal
principles are never the truth. You know, as long as the emotional system operates
in a wave, the tribe will never be ruled by an actual truth. It will be ruled by feel-
ings, which means that until we have the transformation in 2027 and we have a
whole new way in which the emotional system operates, that is, for those who are
born with us, not us, only then is it possible to get to a point in which principles will
operate with awareness. They don't. It's its touchy-feely, you know. That‟s how we
got our societies to sort of go along with each other. We give them these things that
feel right and give them this feeling of fairness, even though it's not the truth, even
though it's not really fair. You know, this feel-good that America is the land of op-
portunity. It‟s great at masking a lot of poverty because it feels good and it feels
fair. “Hey, I know you don't have anything, but look, you could become anything
here.” There is this feel-good principle.
But again, that doesn't mean that when the collective analyzes it that that feel good
makes any damn sense. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, but, but, but, but, but, but…and
don‟t think for a moment that our societies operate on the logic of the collective
perspective. They don‟t. We need our feel-good because it's the basis of our prin-
ciples. And more than that, it‟s the 49th gate that represents God. Now, it doesn't
represent God personally like the 25 that will play priest or priestess. But when
you're looking at the 49, it represents the rule of God. So the 49th gate, Abraham
sacrificing or ready to sacrifice Isaac. He puts him on the slab; he‟s ready to cut his
throat in God‟s name; if God tells him, he will do so.
In other words, this is the representation of the morality of the tribe. The principles
of what are fair get distorted by the demands of the tribal spirituality and it gets very
confusing. So your spirituality tells you that you can only eat certain foods. It
doesn't matter what logic tells you. It doesn't matter that you may need a certain
substance that you're not allowed in your religion that you need for the well-being of
your body. The principles aren‟t going to pay any attention to that because the prin-
ciples are the feel-good glue for the tribe.
So the only thing we have to be grateful about is the 1/3. What makes 1/3 so spe-
cial is it comes into this setup and the 3 in it says, “Hey, this isn’t really fair.” It's
the one that recognizes there's something wrong with the principle. Now, it may not
be fair, because it's not fair to them, which is one side of their wave. It may not be
fair because it's not fair to others, which may be the other side of the wave. But the
reality is that the moment you have 1/3, they are going to recognize right away that
there's something wrong with the principles. And, of course, it's easy from our pers-
pective because we know that principles don't have to be truthful. They only have to
have the illusion of being sensitive and fair. That's all, just the illusion. As long as
the tribe has the illusion that everybody is being treated fairly, everything is ok.

It‟s like the illusion of democracy. It‟s such a wonderful illusion; you really feel like
you're in control of who is going to be in power. But we all know that's illusion. Still,
we‟re satisfied with that because it makes us feel good to think that on principle this
is fair; we have an equal say in the direction that our nation‟s going to take. This is
one of the things to understand: This is a very, very, very political gate. It is the
political elbow of the tribe. It‟s the 49 who decides who gets to eat, speaking of fair.
You were bad today Johnny, you were insensitive, you weren't fair so you don't get
to eat tonight. And by the way, taking food away from the young is one of the most
ancient paths of discipline. It‟s ancient. It‟s typical of 49—you’re bad, you don’t get
to eat. And if you‟re really bad, I‟ll throw you out of the house, another classic ex-
ample of what takes place in families.
We cannot just have anarchy. We know very well that our societies will fall apart the
moment the tribe doesn't evolve naturally. If the tribe is just shattered, it doesn't
mean we're going to have a collective success out of that; we will not. The tribe
needs to maintain its integrity. It is the extension of the family, after all. The whole
thing about transforming the tribe is the tribe has to be transformed within itself.
The real opportunity is always there in the 49. If you can get a Sun in 49 to have
the clarity of emotional awakeness, then you have somebody who‟s going to be able
to bring major changes into the tribal way of life. But, at the same time, the tribe
has to be maintained because it is the basis of how we raise our children. We need
our communities. We need those relationships. We need to have neighbors for our
children to play with and we need to have schools. We need to have towns, adminis-
trations, police, government, on and on and on. You can‟t just shatter that.
So the 1/4 brings the continuity; the 1/3 tries to make sure that it is at least as close
to being fair as possible. Now again, the unfortunate thing is that the 1/3 coming in
on the Cross of Explanation isn't going to explain anything to anybody because it's
embarrassed, because it thinks that it is the problem, not that the principle is the
problem. You know, the principle: Thou shall not kill. And you kill somebody, you
blame yourself.
You have to see very clearly that for 1/3s, everything is about overcoming the 3rd
line pessimism that permeates the life. And it turns the 3rd line being into somebody
who is embarrassed about those things that do not work because it thinks that it
lowers their self-esteem in terms of the way in which others look at them, that
they‟re seen as failures, and they‟re not.
So a 1/3 who is so important to transforming the tribe, keeping its mutated process
alive, that most 1/3s in the end simply leave the tribe because they don't feel like
they fit in. They see everybody else going along with certain principles that don't
work for them. They don't think the others are bad or sick. They think they have a
problem. “There’s something wrong with me, I can’t live like that. I can't believe
that, I can’t act like, I can't do that.” There is a lot of tribal pressure when it comes
to the principles you have to live by within the tribal law.

The 1/4
RAC Explanation 1
The 1/4 is going to take the principle it‟s given. And though it will go up and down
on its wave about that principle, it has no choice but to reinforce that principle. 1/4s
keep tribes together as a balance against 1/3s who try to tear them down. So you
have the 1/3 child that says, “No, this is not fair.” And you have the 1/4 child say-
ing, “Yes it is fair, it's always been fair.” What to do. We are a binary. And there
are deep conflicts in that.
Again, my warning about how careful you have to be as a parent, as an educator, as
a friend, as a lover, that you do not be dishonest with these beings. Because in the
end, the 1/4 child is going to take whatever the principles of the tribe are and they
are simply going to apply them and put them back out. They will tattle on you if you
don't. You were supposed to do your prayers Johnny, you didn't—whatever the case
may be. Whatever it is, the 1/4 is there and they're going to make sure that that is
followed through.
It‟s the 1/4 who wants to make sure there are enough people participating in learn-
ing how to do a folk dance that was important 1,400 years ago. They are ready to
maintain and influence others with the principles that have been established with the
resources so you have certain feasts. All feasts are 49 games. Every single feast
you‟re ever going to participate in, this is a 49 ritual. It‟s a 49 that's out there and
they're cutting and there are only two big legs on that bird, and there are six or sev-
en eyes gazing at it, and you‟re waiting to see what slice you‟re going to get. This is
a 49 trip. It‟s what it‟s all about and everybody has to accept what the principles
are—Harry is the oldest, Joe works the hardest, and you over there, you're useless,
you're just going to get the neck.

The 2/4
RAC Explanation 1
Two-fours are the ultimate missionaries. I've always talked about the 2/4s being the
missionary Profile, being called to influence others. Here is the call to influence oth-
ers to the principles. These are natural politicians, in our language how we would
understand that. In other words, once they are called, they have an incredible sen-
sitivity. The 4th line capacity as well as the 49 sensitivity has this incredible sensitivi-
ty to be able to influence others. And again, in the tribal context, there is nothing
more powerful than a 4th line because the 4th line is built for the tribe. Nothing ex-
cels more within communities than the 4th line because it's the community that is its
potential.
These are the ones, that while they're sitting around and watching somebody break
the principles of the tribe, that something can call them and they can end up having

an enormous influence in transforming that whole situation. In other words, they
can be very powerful forces once they're called out. The other thing is that they
naturally fit into the tribal mechanism. If you have a 2/4 child, it‟s one of my old
jokes, you're going to see that they‟re never going to leave home. They‟re just
going to wait for you to die and they‟ll inherent house. It will be a formal turnover.
When you‟re dealing with a 2/4 in terms of the principle, this is not like you have
somebody who is in a hurry to change any principle. They naturally have a gift for
living within the principles of the tribe. They naturally have a gift for deciding the
principles of the tribe, and in that sense, being sensitive to the demands and the
needs for resources by the tribe. So the moment they're called is the moment they
are a very powerful force.
You can see that the 1/4s and the 2/4s keep the tribe locked into its principles. This
whole phase that we‟re going through on the planet between globalization and fun-
damentalism is a classic example of this cross at work. That's what this cross is all
about. And this is the great challenge we meet because you have to see that there
are natural profiles on this cross like the 1/4 and the 2/4, that find nothing wrong
with being a 12th-century person. Nothing, if that happens to be your tradition. It‟s
like, “Well, this is the way.” And they can be enormously powerful forces in saying
that this is not the only way, it‟s the only way it‟s ever been fair. And this is God‟s
way and this is the way we can be correct and spiritual and right. All the power
comes with the emotional system.
Not only that, but recognize that is a gate of sacrifice, a gate of butchery, a gate of
revolution, a gate that says we are the only ones who know and the rest of them
don't know and they‟re not going to learn from us so let‟s kill them because they are
getting in our way. It's not like it's their fault that you come in on this cross and you
have a 2/4 and the most important thing for you is that everybody in your life
speaks Castilian. It‟s not the point, but nonetheless, we have that and they're out
there and you're not going to change them.

RAC Explanation 1
Remember that the whole thing about this Cross of Explanation is to understand that
the explanation is coming after the secret. It‟s like this is what you do with the ex-
perience in life. You ritualized it; this is a mystical channel; you codify it and you
give it principles. Our success is that we have these secrets and now we can turn
these secrets into a way, and this is the way you do it. “Let me explain it to you.”
The 43/23 will only give you the efficiency of it. It'll say that if we all work together
and we all share, then we‟re going to be safer and eat more. It will explain the effi-
ciency, that it is efficient for us to train animals, to capture them, to breed them, all
these things that have led to our development.

an explanation for everything. And basically, it's what's called tribal justification.
Why we do this? Why do we circumcise women? It is astonishing to me that in this
day and age that this is still done. It's absolutely incredible. The reality is that at
the tribal level, there is a justification. It's not like that justification is going to sway
any of us. It's not like justification seems sensitive to us, but it is an established
tribal principle than bonds the tribe together with glue. That's why God has to be a
part of it because God is the ultimate punisher. If you don't obey the tribe, ultimate-
ly the tribal God is going punish you.
Everything about the 2/5 is the expectation that the 2/5 is going to be able to pro-
vide the solutions, to be able to give the answers necessary to be able to solidify and
justify the principles. However, it doesn't mean they can and doesn't mean they
want to. There is a heresy that lies within them. And most of the time, 2/5s have
problems with the principles, deep problems with the principles because the prin-
ciples have already cost them. And remember that the 49 is emotional. This is an
emotional cross. It's in the wave. It's going through all that.
The whole decision making of this cross, everything about that is waiting out the
emotional system. So where the 1/4 and the 2/4 on this cross are going to be very
powerful in maintaining the tribe, the 2/5 is going to be under suspicion. In other
words, the 1/4s and the 2/4s are all into, let‟s say Christian religion, and everybody
suspects that the 2/5 is a witch. There's something about them that‟s suspicious.
And of course what happens to them is that what's going to be called to them is the
expectation of others that they are going to be able to explain the principles of the
tribe. And the moment they don't, the tribe turns against them.
It's like the priest who says the virgin birth is a beautiful story. This is a classic 2/5
statement, a beautiful story. It‟s within the principle. It's within the context of the
principle, but there is this heresy in there, this little heresy that doesn't really swal-
low the whole principle hook, line and sinker. And how insensitive that seems to so
many, and how aware it might seem to others. And the recognition that the 5th line,
what it doesn't provide, what the tribe wants, the tribe does not want to be threat-
ened. The tribe does not want its principles threatened. It wants its principles sup-
ported.
Most 2/5s shut up. 2/5s and 5/2s are the invisible ones. They really are. They‟re
invisible beings because you don't really see them the way in which their potential
has laid it out for them. There is so much pressure on them of expectation. And so,
when you're dealing with a 2/5 in this situation, you have to see very clearly, there's
enormous pressure on this person to go along like everybody else and be useful. In
other words, tell the story of our tribe to the world, how wonderful our tribe is. Ex-
plain to the world why our particular cruelty that we enjoy happens to be worthwhile
because it‟s what we need. Go out there and do that. It can be very difficult for
them so they don‟t.

The 3/5
RAC Explanation 1
The 3/5s are thrown out of the tribe. They‟re either thrown out of the tribe or they
run like hell and never want to go back to the village again, ever, because they learn
right away that the principles aren't fair. Third line people know immediately that
life isn't fair. That‟s the first thing; life is not fair. It's not fair. It's not fair, and it
goes on and on; it is not fair. They already know that. Then you give them this
cross, and it's not fair. Not only is it not fair to them, you don‟t want to be on the
other side of their principles because they're going to give you their trial and error
principles. And they‟re going to say, “Look, we’re going to do this experiment. I'm
going to kill you. We’re going to wait three minutes and then we're going to revive
you.”
If you ever meet a 3rd line person who offers you such an opportunity, say no. There
is a remote chance they may be able to revive you, but in most cases, they‟re going
to say, “Oops.” And I assume they got you to sign a release first so they don‟t get
into any trouble. If you‟re a 3, you‟re going to know right away that the principles of
the tribe are cockamamie. They just don‟t work. They don‟t, particularly the way
the tribe controls resources.
If you‟re a 3rd line being, you don‟t want anybody to control your resources. How
come it‟s the head man who always gets to decide not only what gets slaughtered,
but who gets to eat what? Third line beings say, “Hey, I’m out there every day look-
ing after these cows. I would like to have my own cows. I want to decide how much
I get to eat.” Basic heresy; I want my own material. So, one of the heresies of the
3/5 in this cross is, “I have my own principles.” Boy, oh boy; not only that but it's
attractive to others. It‟s your principle. “My principle is I keep a cow on the side.
Sometimes I’m hungry. I have my cow over here and I keep it off the property, it’s
my cow.”
So, one of the things about the 3rd line when it comes to principles is that all of this
becomes a problem. They, themselves, get to see that the explanations are not
legitimate and not all of them, obviously. But again, all it takes with the 3rd line
being is that you show them once that something isn‟t true. It not like they shake
that and say, okay “Ok, second chance, let's try.” There‟s a part of them that‟s al-
ready marked very deeply, very deeply with the limitation of that. They say, “Okay,
that’s not trustworthy. Maybe somewhere down the road something will come out of
it, but basically is not trustworthy.”
Yet, at the same time, they‟re a 5th line. Their real responsibility in the tribe, and
this is why they get into trouble in the tribe, is to complain about the tribe's prin-
ciples. That‟s their real responsibility. They find out that a principle doesn't work
and their job is to universalize condemnation of it. Often what gets them into
trouble is they write a book about their tribe and sell it to the collective. Then eve-
rybody in the tribe hates them because they revealed the tribal truth. And then they

are ostracized from the tribe and never can go home. In the literary world, that's
happened over and over and over again. You know, those can't-go-home books
because you write about—Salman Rushdie—you write a book, you can never go
home, they kill you.
This is something about the 3/5. What happens in most cases, if the 3/5 is living out
its nature, it‟s really going to help the tribe change because the heretic has the cou-
rage to stand up and say, “Look, I don’t want to leave here. I want us to change
because we have to. This principle doesn't work anymore. Don't you see that? This
is not truth. This is just something we lived with as a custom. And we don't have to
be locked into it.” Now, that‟s the true wisdom of the 3/5, universalizing what
doesn‟t work and increasing, in this context, the efficiency and explaining it. They
don‟t do that. What they do is either the tribe throws them out or they run away.
It was so much fun for me to see in the early years when I was doing statistical
analysis of the many, many people in my life here in Ibiza, how many were 3/5s—
the flotsam and jetsam. They‟d run away from all of their various tribes only to end
up trying to, well, end up in a tribe, a tribe full of trial and error. And it's quite a
vibration when you see a tribe like that because what you end up with is that very,
very few principles bond the tribe, very few. There's no book of laws and rules and
whatever, because it just doesn't work because you bring enough 3s together and
they will tell you all the things that don't work. They just will.

The 3/6
RAC Explanation 1
When you get to the 3/6, there's always this difference when you bring in the nature
of the 6. One things about 3/6s is that they tend to be suffering victims within tribal
principle on this cross. In other words, it gets beaten into them. It‟s not necessarily
a nice description for them, but it's so often the case. In other words, yes, they
challenge. But again, they're not challenging in the way that a 1/3 challenges.
That‟s a different story. They're not challenging some foundation that they‟re work-
ing with. The whole thing about 3/6s is that in first 30 years, nothing works and the
principles don‟t work. And it‟s not even that the principles themselves are directly
challenges, it‟s “everything doesn't work.”
What happens to them is that there is within the tribal context, everybody wants to
show them the way. And, of course, they are the ones who get deeply involved with
the tribal principle system when they're young. They will go through that trial and
error process; they will become very pessimistic about that process, but it doesn't
mean they rebel against it. Everything about the 3rd line is that it ultimately will go
along with what works for it financially. In other words, being a tribe has advantag-
es materially because there is mutual support. And 3/6s are very concerned, like
6/3s, with their material life. It's a very powerful force, particularly in the first 30
years, and it leaves them with a deep need to be able to maintain—it‟s one of the
basic principles that you have the resources you need, you have shelter, you have
food and you have a job, these kinds of things. This is all built into the 49.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1

So, one of the things about 3/6s is that they are the ones within the tribe who,
though they often break the tribal rules and often get caught and punished for
breaking the tribal rules, they‟re always seen as a good member of the tribe. In
other words, they don't try to get out of it. They‟re not heretics. They try to find a
way to be a role model hypocrite within the tribe. So, they will go to church on Sun-
day because they discovered that if they don't, their neighbors give them trouble.
So they go. The fact that they're fantasizing about something quite lewd while
they‟re sitting there has nothing to do with the fact that they‟re there and they're
living out the principle because they don‟t want to get punished. They‟ve been pu-
nished enough. They've also learned that if they play that game and don't get pu-
nished, they have larger material advantages.
So again, whenever you‟re dealing with the 6, and remember, I speak of the not-self
when I give these descriptions, you're dealing with a lot of hypocrisy. So, it's easy
for them as a 3/6 to live with what they don't believe in, to go to a temple they don't
really worship in, to go along with rituals they don't really support. But at the same
time, accept, because A) they don‟t want to be punished, and B) it is an advantage.
The longer they are like that, the more they seem to represent their people. It‟s a
great joke.
Sixth line, after all, eventually gets to be the role model, eventually gets to be the
force that people look to. And these 3/6s are like somebody who is the head of your
local church or whatever is a 3/6. What you really know about them is that they
don't believe in God. But that's not important. They believe in bringing the commu-
nity together so the community can share and experience together and enjoy the
social bond of being together and it gives them a job. They can justify their job and
its principles by saying that it's to the advantage of the community to be able to do
that. Wherever they are on their wave, whether they're down in their wave and are
uncomfortable with themselves, 3/6s and 6/3s have learned that doesn't help.
They‟ve learn to accept themselves as failures, as hypocrites because they learned
how to justify that and hear the justification as the principle.

The 4/6
RAC Explanation 1
That brings us to the 4/6. Again, you can see the similarities when you deal with the
influences of the 6th line in the context of the not-self. When you come to the 4/6,
the 4/6 is the glue of the tribe. Nobody has more power in the tribe than the 4/6.
So, this cross where you have the Sun in the 49th gate, in a tribal gate in the emo-
tional system, the 4/6 has the greatest power. And the example is an obvious one:
The 4/6 is a voyeur. As a voyeur, they don't really have to suffer directly from the
principles of the tribe; they don‟t. They don't have to be the one who gives the prin-
ciples of the tribe. In other words, as a leader, they don‟t. They can participate fully
on the outside. So they don't have to be the one who‟s called to the altar in a cere-
mony. They don't have to be the one who does a certain amount of this or that, or
whatever the case may be; they watch.

They're a tribal witness. And not only are they a tribal witness, they are influential
as that tribal witness. They‟re the ones with their 4th line Personality that‟s saying,
“Yes, we are a strong tribe. We are a good tribe, this is a great tribe. You look won-
derful doing that job, look at you building that building.” And there is the 4/6 off on
the side sipping tea and musing over the building of the building. They‟re great at
that. Given the not-self about hypocrisy of the 6th line, the whole beauty for them is
that they can sit back there and actually be an authority and deeply influential.
They're the ones who love to tell tribal stories. They‟re the ones who like to give you
an example of how wonderful the tribe is, explain to you how important the tribe is,
its history and all of this stuff. It‟s right there.
The one difficulty that can arise in that image of the 4/6 of this configuration is in the
4/3 phase, that is, in the first 30 years. If they end up hanging out with kids in the
tribe who hate the tribe, then they can be turned. Remember that everything about
the opportunities in life is about the friends of the 4. So, if all of your friends say,
“The tribe is awful, let's get the hell out of here, let‟s do something else,” that 4/6
can end up being carried away on that. This is one of the warnings I always give
parents who have 4/6 children, that the most important thing for you to tell them is
beware of your friends. Make sure that your friends are the result of your Strategy.
If your friends are the result of your Strategy, then you're going to go in the right
direction.
So, let‟s think about something here. In dealing with the 49th gate and this theme
of the tribe and tribal principles, in understanding that the Right Angle is where the
research is done, the thing to recognize is that there are very, very few forces as
potentials in the Right Angle of this configuration who are going to do anything to
actually change the tribe. You have to see that. In other words, the Right Angle is
not there to be the harbinger of transformation. They are there to provide the seeds
of potential transformation through their experience.

The 4/1
The moment you get to the 4/1, you get to this very, very fixed focus. This is the
Juxtaposition Cross of Principles, very focused. Now, this is a very powerful externa-
lizing force. This is the strongest influence within the tribe. The 4/1 has the capacity
to be of value in its tribe. One of the things I tell 4/1s is that only when you have a
strong community around you that you're bonded to are you going to be able to
fulfill your potential. Because only then is your influence legitimately going to come
out. The 4/1 is going to be focused within the tribe only on its principles, dedicated,

in that sense, fixed, in that sense, to the tribe being maintained and the principles of
the tribe being maintained.
However, there is a 1st line unconscious. And if the foundation is truly faulty, then
there's a possibility that the 4/1 can be transformed, always. This is the only hope
the tribe has is the very fixedness of the 4/1 to be transformed. Now, if you take an
adult 4/1 who has been the mouth-
piece in the community for tribal
principle and you shatter that prin-
ciple, you will shatter them. And
like Humpty Dumpty, you won't get
 them back together again.

The only way in which 1/4s or 4/1s
become of enormous value in socie-
ty is when they are properly raised
as children. If you have a 4/1 and
they are raised within the context of
the tribe, they are told that the
foundation of the principles are not

all solid, then they will be a force
 that will be able to say, “All right, I
know that not everything about the
way in which our tribe has func-
tioned over these millennia today is
suitable. It doesn't mean we have
to give up what it is to be a tribe,
what our bond is to each other. And we shouldn't be afraid of maturing, of evolving.
We don't stop being a tribe if we change this.”
They can be enormously powerful and influential in being able to establish a legiti-
mate foundation, but only if they're given a legitimate foundation to begin with by
their families. Otherwise, they are the last ones to give up, like my image of French
missionaries in French Canada in Québec in the 15th century. And the Mohawk In-
dians were always amazed that while they were boiling these guys alive—because
the Mohawks were really savage—that the missionaries were still doing their beads,
we're still doing the Rosary. This is the classic 4/1 image. You know, you're boiling
away, and there you are doing your number. It was very impressive to the Indians.
It allowed them a much more entertaining evening because they were used to boiling
people who screamed and yelled and wanted to die right away. And here were these
wonderful crazy priests who are standing there going through their religious trip and
the Indians that that was very cool.

The 5/1
Let‟s get to the transpersonal and the selling of principles. If you're a 5/1 and come
in with your Personality Sun in the 49th gate, you come in as a revolutionary. The
tribe loves to embrace the 4. It is deeply, deeply, deeply suspicious of the 5. It‟s
my joke as a 5 that the people in
Ibiza I‟ve known all my life, I have
very little influence on them.
People have watched my whole
process. I have more influence over

strangers. I have a 5 so I can influ-
 ence the world out there, but my
backyard is another story. In my
backyard it is very difficult because
I'm not a 4. I'm just not. I don't
have this natural ability to influence
those around me.
 So imagine what that's like. You‟re
a 5 and you come in on a tribal
 cross. Think about what the tribe
thinks about you. You're a danger.
You're going to bring heretical prin-
ciples. You're going to try to
change the tribe. And you‟re going
to try to change the tribe by univer-
salizing tribal principles. The Jews did that with Yahweh. Yahweh went one moment
from being a tribal God to suddenly being a universal God. It went from being a 4
God to a 5 God. What a trip. That‟s a mutation, man.
So, one of the things to recognize about the 49.5, practical solutions in revolutionary
times—it‟s mine, I have this line. You know right away what the call is: Bring heresy
to your tribe. Oh, am I a heretic to my tribe, the tribe that I grew up in, a real he-
retic, wow. I broke every principle that ever existed in my tribe. And the 5/1
comes, and that‟s its job. So, in this configuration, these are forces you know don't
last long. It's one of the things about heresy. When you're heretical within the
tribe, the tribe‟s response is visceral and this is the 49th gate. I cannot tell you how
many people have been executed for being heretics. I cannot tell you how many
people have been banished, stoned, burnt, beaten and shot for being heretics within
tribal principles.

When you come in on this cross, you come in with a bull's-eye on your back. You're
ready for somebody to take a swing at you because you're going to challenge the
tribe and the principles of the tribe. If the challenge is not practical, then you're
going to fail. And in most cases, you're either going to be banished or you‟re going
to be punished. There is no other way around it.
So the Cross of Revolution is something that is very, very difficult for those people
who grow up in strong tribal environments on the planet. Remember, most of the
societies on this planet are still rooted in deep, tribal configurations. And these
children are always at risk. They're the ones who are going to really get punished in
this life if they're not careful. Now, of course, they‟re born with paranoia. But you
have to see that the moment you get to the 5th line of any of these configurations we
moved to, you get to a place that says, “Okay, okay principles are great, that's
great, but we need to change them. We can’t stay still.”
All 5th lines bring revolution. All 5th lines bring the potential of transforming the ex-
perience of the hexagram into a principle of being. So revolution is something in
which all of us have a great stake. Our stake is that there are enough beings who
come in on this cross who are able to shake up the tribal matrix. I have a deep kin-
ship to this, though this is not my cross. I have the 43/23. I have the 4 and the 49.
In other words, I have all four aspects of this cross in my design. And so I am very
sensitive to it. At the same time, I've seen these aspects play out in my life.
In other words, really understand that we also have a certain sensitivity, so as a
Clarion, it's clear to me with that configuration that I was a Clarion who came in to
explain things, that I was a Clarion who came in with principles, that I was a Clarion
who came in to bring revolution. And then I was going to bring tribal revolution. In
other words, it was built into it that I was going to have a connection to those the-
matics. And all of us have in our designs these various configurations that add up to
a cross, and don't think it's a coincidence; there are none. It's really something to
keep in mind because it's something that you're going to relate to in your life
process.

Recognize that the 5/2 in this configuration really doesn't want to say anything to

that they can be called to revolution. They can be called to be that revolutionary
force who can bring that practical principle at exactly the right time in order to pro-
tect the tribe, in order to advance the tribe. But the chances are slim. Their heresy
has already gotten them into trouble when they were a kid because they're called to
heresy, poor things, they‟re called to that. They‟re called to break the rule; they‟re
called to see the punishment that comes with it. And in the end, they‟re paranoid
about all of it.

The 6/2 LAC Revolution 1
The 5/2 rarely does publicity and the 6/2, 6/3s, as we saw in our previous look at
them, have another priority. They're not interested in publicizing the phenomena.
They're not interested in universalizing, they're not interested in influencing. They‟re
interested in living it, just living it. So, when you get to the 6/2, you get somebody
who will ultimately will go through the trial and error stage of seeing the principles
that don't work. It will see those things that aren‟t worthy; they‟ll see those things
where revolution may be, in fact, be necessary. It will get onto the roof phase and
get to its objective phase; people who are lefties until they‟re 30, and righties after
30. It is one of those classic transitions. You start out with all of this liberal, social
whatever and then by the time you get to 30, it‟s like, “Okay yeah, but I need to
have a bank account and a steady job,” and blah, blah, blah, and everything starts
shifting into another direction and you get that shift.
When you're looking at a 6/2, they will struggle against the principles in the begin-
ning. They will begin to see their objective value on the roof, and they will embody
that combination in their post-Kironian phase. In other words, they can be the
evolved tribal member. And that's really the secret. They represent the opportunity
of the result of the research, the flaws that are seen, the fairness that‟s missing, the
lack of sensitivity, whatever that may be, both the influential and the universalizing
forces trying to then do something with that, bring about change, bring about trans-
formation based on what's been experienced, and ultimately, the 6th line living it.
So, if you want to see the example of what the tribal principle can be as a life, then
you catch that 6/2 on the Cross of Revolution when they're in their post-Kironian
phase, given that they live as themselves. Then you'd see it. You‟d see that it's
possible to both accommodate the traditional principles of the tribe without having to
pay lip service to principles that are incorrect.
This is not about eliminating the tribe. It‟s like saying you want to eliminate family.
No, it's about transforming the family. We know from our work in Design that when
you transform the knowledge of how the family can see each other, families change
and their interrelationships change. The same thing has to take place at the tribal
level. The tribe is here to evolve. The Right Angle teaches us what needs to be
worked on. The Left Angle, if it has the opportunity, may be able to influence us
enough that we can get to a place of evolving our principles until ultimately, we have
those who will express them.
Now, the truth is that in most cases the hypocrisy inherent in the 6th line is what you
get to see, that at the end of the road you see somebody who will appear to embody
the principles of the tribe. And yet, in fact, will not wholly do so. That's not what we
want. What we want are tribal principles that are correct. We‟re not going to get
there, by the way. The only way you can get there is if you take the wave away.
Remember something about the nature of emotional authority: Clarity is not truth.

The 6/3 LAC Revolution 1
When your feelings take you over to one side and you've given yourself a chance to
breathe through it, that clarity is there, but again, it's not truth. So you have to see
that no matter where we get to in this movie, no matter how evolved the role model
ultimately gets to be, when you get to the 6/3, it is standing there and it's looking
out the window and it‟s saying, “Yeah, but wait a minute, principles aren't enough.
It doesn't matter what our principles are, look at what the fates have done to us.”
Fate gets in the way, life gets in the way. It would be great for us to be able to
maintain our language in our 200-language group. But the world is overwhelming
us. Our children don't speak our language anymore. It's not our fault that the lan-
guage is disappearing. It's fate. We are being overwhelmed by that. It's just fate.
It is fate that can make you poor in your tribe because you're born in a place where
there are very few resources; fate. And the next gate, the 30th gate is the gate of
the fates, the gate of desire, a gate of feelings, another emotional gate. So, when
you get to the 6/3, remember all 6/3s are sitting on the roof, but they're looking at
the neighbor. It‟s one of the things to grasp deeply about them, so there is this
sense of, “Yes, yes, yes, yes these principles, yes, yes, yes. I know all this stuff
about all these principles, but I also know that trial and error, they don't really work.
Some of it’s okay and I know some of the things about the tribe that are all right,”
and so forth and so on. “But I know what the real answer is. It’s over there. It's
over there.”
We have to see that we cannot be fixed in our principles. Remember, this is the 6th
line; it represents transition. We cannot be fulfilled in our principles because we
have to recognize that times change. Circumstances change. The fates step in. If
we resist the change, if we still want to be Pennsylvania Dutch and go to work in our
horse buggies and not take advantage of telephones and modern medicine and eve-
rything else, folks, we‟re going to die out. It's stupid. It's stupid. And it doesn't
mean we have to give up the beauty of our way of life by recognizing that fate will
get in the way. We have to be mature. We have to evolve. We have to see that we
have to be ready to recognize what essential principles must always be retained and
what principles are open and flexible and mutative because of the consequences of
the world we live in and the times we live in.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Ok, so we come to the 30th gate. The 30th gate for me is one of those extraordinary
gates, a mysterious gate. Obviously, it‟s very significant in terms of the human ex-
periential way. The human experiential way begins with the 41st gate, which is its
harmonic. When you‟re looking at the 30th gate, you‟re looking at the potential to
recognize what experience will lead to progress, at least the hope of what experience
can lead to progress.
The Human Experiential Way
With the 30th gate, we‟re not only dealing with an emotional gate, but given the na-
ture of the transformation that‟s coming, we‟re actually dealing with an emotional
gate that never becomes aware. It‟s something to keep in mind. The human expe-
riential way is not going to be transformed in 2027. The way in which that system
operates is not going to be changed. The 49 will change; the 49 will be something
that is no longer impacted by the emotional wave, but that‟s not true for the whole
experiential stream that never wakes up.
So, when you‟re looking at the 41 to the 35, those four gates, it‟s something to keep
in mind. They are the epitome of humanness and they will disappear with human-
ness, which means Rave children won‟t pay any attention to all of that; we do. More
than that, the 41st gate, because it is the initiating codon and the place of fantasy—
I‟m using the sexual keynote—it has a
sense of what experience one should
have. It is the pressure to go for what-
ever that experience is.
Yet, one of the things about the abstract
process is that abstract people like to
think of their life as logical. If you‟re a
logical person and you go, here‟s step 1,
here‟s step 2, here‟s step 3, there‟s step
4, that‟s the goal. You know if you do
1, 2, 3, 4 you‟re going to get there; it‟s
just logical.
If you‟re an abstract person, you see
the same thing. If I do this, this and
this I‟m going to get there, except it
never works that way. And because the
abstract person assumes that it‟s logical
that if I do this, this and that I‟m going to get there, and then when it doesn‟t work
they get upset. They just do. They get upset because the fates, the 30th gate,
stand in the way. Not only do they stand in the way, they exalt the process.

The Clinging Fire
Life is not logical; Life is. Did I confuse you? Life is not logical, but Life is. The life
force is logical. It operates in patterns. But the illusion and the Maia of the life is
filled with chaos and broken ends and all of these things that seem to say there‟s no
pattern. The fates are part of that. Fates are part of the pattern, and in being part
of the pattern, what they do is create the illusion that there are limitless possibilities.
They just do. If you don‟t see it, they‟ll force you. They get in the way and say,
“Hey, you can‟t go this way, no, no, no. You thought you‟d go 1, 2, 3, 4. Now, you
have to go 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H, 1I, 1J, 1K and then maybe at the 1K
you might be able to segue into the 2-1, maybe.”
Something is going to get in the way, and the magic of the experiential way is that
it‟s not logical. If it was logical, life would be the same for most of us. There‟d be
six basic variations and it would all be the same. But the moment you bring in the
fates, everything is different, because the moment you start off on that road there‟s
something that‟s going to turn the signs slightly and you think you‟re off in the right
direction and there you go sliding off the side of the hill. Now, if you‟re lucky when
you fall down the hill you fall into the embrace of something wonderful. You discover
something that you didn‟t know was there in the logic that you presumed was going
to be your direction. The 30th gate is magic.

So when we come to incarnation crosses in which the Sun is in the 30th gate, what
do you think you get? You get instruments of the fates. These are people who get
in the way of the logic of your life.
They get in the way—Cross of Conta-
gion. It‟s my Kiron phase, my Kiron

today and I‟ll send you a letter.”

It just steps in. These are people who
do this to you. That‟s the not-self.

It‟s not like they consciously know
they have this power, contagion.
When you hear the word „contagious‟
you begin to go, “Who‟s got it; I don‟t
want it. They‟re contagious.” And
what they represent is contagion. But you have to understand the mask of that. It‟s

all in the 30th gate. You‟re being suckered; you‟re being pulled into an alternative
reality.
I love Jorge Luis Borges, a great Latin American Argentine writer. He had a wonder-
ful short story called The Garden of the Forking Paths. In that story, basically what
you have is that any moment has zillions of possibilities. And these people are the
ones who say, “Not this way; here, follow this. Let me be your fate. Let me redirect
you in where you think you‟re going.” Now, remember something about the nature
of the fates. Very few human beings can tolerate the interference of the fates. We
don‟t like it; it‟s annoying. “Oh, jeez, it was all going to be so simple.” And we all
get upset because it‟s not.
But you have to understand something—good news, bad news, who knows—when
the fates step in your way, if you resist, if you fight, if you struggle, all is lost. So
many human beings when they meet this, they‟re going to meet these people all the
time and it‟s their job to be shit disturbers. They‟re so good at it. If you have a
Cross of Contagion in front of you when you‟re in the supermarket and you‟re check-
ing out and they‟re walking out the door in front of you and your car is pointed on
the left and they go right, you find yourself walking right. “Hey, wait a minute, I‟m
going in the wrong direction, and my car is back over here”— the fates getting in
your way.
Now maybe you should have followed them and left your car there for awhile. You
might find that right around the corner is something you‟ve been looking for for
years that you never thought was available right there. But we‟re not like that. We
suddenly stand there in the middle of the street like an idiot saying, “What‟s the
matter, I‟m losing my memory. I don‟t know where I parked my car.” And there
they are, back in the car, now totally messed up. They don‟t even want to go on
with the rest of the day. All of a sudden they‟re sure they have early signs of Alz-
heimer‟s.
The fates; they just step right in; bang. And again, most of them are doing it un-
consciously. This is contagion. Think about the joke of contagion. Contagion has
the 14 and the 8. The 14, you work hard. You don‟t necessarily get anywhere, but
you work hard. And the 8 is this deep, deep need to make a contribution. One of
the things to understand about when the fates arrive is that there is this moment
where you finally can realize the transformation of your power into actually being
something that makes a contribution. Literally makes a contribution.
There are certain crosses that transform the person and certain crosses have a pur-
pose to transform others. It‟s like the Cross of Tension. Most people assume the
Cross of Tension is about the person being full of tension, when in fact, the Cross of
Tension is here to provide tension for others. It‟s the same thing with Contagion.
It‟s not about these people being caught in the web of the fates; they‟re instruments
of the fates. That‟s quite different. They‟re here to get you to fall into that. They‟re
here to misdirect you so you can really see things. These are shattering forces that
say, “Hey, don’t trust anything. You think the path is just like this? You think that
just because you pray God’s listening? Uh-uh, it’s not the way it is.”

So, these are the embodiments of those forces that shake you on your way. Again,
it‟s not like they‟re doing it consciously. Imagine when these people are conscious,
when they‟re aware, when they‟re awake, when they‟re living out their true nature,
imagine what kind of an impact they can have on the other.

The 1/3
RAC Contagion 1
Remember the blessing of the 1/3. Everything about the 1/3 is that it recognizes
that life is an evolutionary, mutative process because it sees that there are no fixed
rules. When you come to this, this is the perfect configuration for a 1/3. When a
1/3 is born on the Cross of Contagion, it‟s much less difficult for them to be a 1/3
than if they‟re born on any other cross.
And why? They already know that things get in the way. That‟s their nature. They
know that things don‟t work out the way they should. They know that just because
you say, “I do,” doesn‟t mean it will be. They know that when you make a promise
that something is going to last doesn‟t mean it will. When somebody tells you some-
thing they say is true doesn‟t mean it is. They‟ve learned all that. They know that,
they know deep inside of them that there is a cosmic spanner that gets thrown into
the work. They‟re born with it.
So when you come into the world on the Cross of Contagion and you‟re a 1/3, there‟s
no surprise. They become the great philosophers of, “Well, you start off this way but
don’t plan on getting to where you think you’re going. Just go along this way and
see what happens, ok?” They‟re not going to promise you that it‟s going to be logi-
cal. They‟re the first ones who know. Children on this cross who have the 1/3 are
much less damaged. They‟ve already seen the fates get in the way of their mother
and their father. They‟ve seen it because they‟re it. They‟ve seen it. Mama and
Papa want to go out to the theater and want to leave you with the babysitter and
you vomit over mama‟s shoes; they don‟t go out. The fates get in the way.
You know that happens. You know that if anything will go wrong, it will. You‟ve
seen it. It means that you‟re much less sensitive. Remember, a 1/3 is so introspec-
tive. You‟re much less sensitive to that being your personal failure because of the
advantage of this cross. This cross gives you a certain perspective. It says, “Aha,
I’m not the only one who messes up. I’m not the only one where things go wrong.”
They get to see it. Most 1/3s never notice when their parents mess up in the sense
of struggling with something, failing at something. But if you come in on this kind of
cross—and there are other variations—you immediately see it. “Aha, it’s not just
me.” So it‟s less painful in that sense.
Everything about being an awake Contagion is the recognition that nothing we think
is trustworthy beyond the moment. They know it. What fascinates me about the
abstract process is the 30th gate and the 46th gate. They are so odd; they really are.
It‟s almost as if they don‟t belong there, and yet they are there. The 30th gate is the
most logical gate of all in the most illogical place, because the 30th gate says to you

very straight forward, “Hey, it’s never what you think. It’s never what you think
because the patterns are endless. It’s never what you think because it can end up
being this or that, and don’t ever expect that it’s ever going to be what you think it’s
going to be which is not what the abstract is about.”
The abstract is: Jump in there and even if you die it‟s worth it. Jump in there be-
cause afterwards, even if it‟s your biographer afterwards, it‟s useful. And there‟s the
30 saying, “Look, please understand, yeah, it’s nice that you think there’s this way.
But come on, try another way; there are so many ways. Check them all out. Don’t
get stuck on this. Don’t think that this is the answer.” And everything about the
abstract person is to get to that place of answer—the answer that‟s there in the 35th
gate that says, “Hey, you made it baby, progress. You’ve managed to get through
the experience, you’ve survived, now you can reflect; everything is wonderful.”

The 1/4
RAC Contagion 1
The 1/4s are deeply influential. But then the whole thing about the nature of the 1/4
is it will always warn you about one thing. It‟ll only get in your way over one thing.
It‟s very fixed, obviously. It can be very, very, very influential. For example, you
have 1/4 who never had the chance to finish school and had a reasonably successful
life. And they think that anybody who thinks that going to school is useful is an
idiot. This is their one thing; they‟re fixed on it. They become the instrument of
contagion to pull you away from that process, that one thing. They can be so power-
ful. That‟s the power.
When you‟re dealing with a 4, how impactful that is on the circle around it and how
influential that can be. So, Uncle Johnny or Aunt Jane is one of these 1/4s who are
self-made. And you‟re all excited because you love your school and this and that,
and there they are saying to you, “Well, it‟s not the most important thing in the
world. There are other things in life; there are other ways to go in this life. There
are other things that you can discover. There are other ways that you can learn.”
It‟s taken away.
Buried within the Cross of Contagion is the 14th gate. Remember that the 14th gate
suffers from some of the deepest frustrations of the Sacral—the working hard and
not getting ahead. When it comes to contagion and to somebody getting in your
way, remember this is how this cross works: They get your way even though they‟re
in their own trip. Remember that. It‟s not like they‟re transpersonal. It‟s just they
get in the way. At the moment they get in the way, what they‟re going to bring to
you is so powerful. It goes right deep underneath this 4th line stuff. The 4th line is
the essence of contagion. You get the disease. The moment you get the disease,
they‟re going to move you away from that.
I‟ve put that all in a negative context. Let‟s look at the positive side of that for a
moment. Here you are, that child who shouldn‟t be in school. There‟s something
else for you to do. There‟s something more important for you to do. That‟s the

moment, when you meet somebody like that, they can be the perfect ally for you, to
give you an example that there is another way. You don‟t have to work hard for
nothing, and you will be able to make your contribution if you could only say “yes” to
the right thing.
I‟m just using keynotes from this cross. Then the tragedy of the 30—it‟s emotional;
it‟s abstract emotional. There‟s more pain and hope in this gate than anywhere in
Design. The only thing that comes close is the 11 and the 11 is mental. It‟s not the
same pressure and it‟s not the same power. There is so much hope and pain in the
30th gate. This is how contagion works. Contagion works through hope or pain.
If the 1/4 is in pain, then what they‟re going to show you is that the way you‟re on
will bring you pain. Depending on where they are in their emotional wave is the way
in which they‟re going to bring their interference in your process. We have people
who incarnate only to interfere and that interfering is not a negative, it‟s a role. It
means we need it; don‟t ever forget it. We need contagion. We need these forces
that pull us away from what we think is the way.
Obviously, there is a lot of not-self contagion which means that a lot of people can
be pulled away from good things into bad and bad things into worse. There are all
kinds of variations on that theme in the not-self realm. And by and large, when
you‟re looking at contagion people, you will see that there are many people in their
life who don‟t really enjoy having had them in their life. You can end up with real
Jonahs with this kind of configuration; fates that get in your way and send you down
a track that just puts you in the belly of the whale, the wrong road entirely. There is
a lot of that.

The 2/4
RAC Contagion 1
The 2/4, the missionary. What‟s so devastating about them is that it‟s not obvious
that they want to be your interference. You actually call it on yourself. That‟s the
joke about 2/4s. It‟s what makes them so powerful. These are not beings, from the
Personality perspective, who seem to care about living out that potential. It‟s not
like they run around trying to convince you of anything. As a matter of fact, their
Personality really doesn‟t want to have much to do with you. It‟s a hermit Personali-
ty. “Leave me alone,” it says. “Leave me alone. I don’t want to be the instrument
of fate for you.”
These are the kind of people, the 2/4 contagion, where other people look in their
window and say, “Oh, you could be my answer. You could change my life.” Right.
Whenever you deal with a cross, you‟re going to get what you get anyway. If you
deal with contagion, you get it anyway. You just do. After all, that‟s what they‟re
here for; they do get in the way. They do bring that interference. They do change
your plan, your direction, whatever the case may be; that‟s what they do.

Nothing is more powerful than a 2/4 being called to interfere in your life. Think
about it. You knock on the door of a 2/4 and you say, “Please, redirect me.” Whack,
whack, whack, ok, you‟ll get it. So the whole thing about 2/4s is they‟re very power-
ful because rather than trying to put that contagion on someone—they don‟t—they
wait for the other to come.
Of course, the only people who come to the 2/4 Cross of Contagion are those people
who know the 2/4 Cross of Contagion or know somebody who knows the 2/4 Cross
of Contagion because it only works through the opportunity, the opportunity to inter-
fere in somebody‟s life. I consider the Cross of Contagion to be deeply exalted. By
the way, I could say that of any cross. But what I mean by that is when you look at
that from the awake side—if you look at any of these cross configurations from the
not-self, all of them messy—the moment you see them as the fulfillment of purpose
and correctness, then you begin to see their value.
It‟s very, very important for humanity to travel many roads. Of course, that‟s all the
30th gate is really saying. The 30th gate is saying, “In order for us to really triumph
in terms of our species, not only do we have to have similar experience so we have
verification of similar experience that is essential, but in order for us to be wise, we
need to collect the vast possibilities of experience and codify it.”
Everything about the 30th gate is about bringing us to a point in which the experien-
tial depth of humanity is enormous. In the last 30 years there has been a movement
towards automatic autobiographies. Just about everyone who has lived longer than
30 years and had their name in the newspaper once is writing a book about their
lives. It really is an example of what the fates bring. This is what contagion brings.
The fact is that people revealing their lives is a huge market because we‟re all inter-
ested.
One of the things about the experiential way is that not all of us can experience eve-
rything, obviously. And yet, at the same time, we have this vast, intellectual curiosi-
ty about the possibilities of life. So it‟s interesting for us to read about certain lives
and what has been accomplished in certain lives, and there we get the net result of
the fates getting in the way.
If you have that tribe and it‟s locked into its tribal whatever, it‟s only the one that
runs away and comes back 30 years later who really is the one that brings some-
thing special to the tribe. You know, the contagion, the results of taking another
road, of being able to bring back the wisdom of another insight, another perspective,
another whatever. Whether it is as mundane as bringing back something new to
eat—Marco Polo, whatever it is—really understand that contagion is everything and
that this is a gate in which the “gods” are most present in Design.
Here you can truly feel the presence of the gods. What I mean by that is—I‟m not
talking about the great, overall deity whether it‟s Brahma or Allah, whatever name
you want to give to that, not this all-encompassing universal Godhead. But the
gods, the forces that we have always been wary of, the forces we‟ve always known
that have been around us. It‟s these gods that are alive here in the 30th gate, stick-
ing their finger in the pie, messing around with where life is going to go for you. So,

it‟s not just a matter that contagion is going to bring you the fates, but also to see
that all of us, according to our profile, have ways in which we can deal with the
fates. [See page 62 for the Profile keynotes for the 30th Gate Fates.]

The 2/5
RAC Contagion 1
When we get to the 2/5, you get to this deep reluctance to interfere, because if you
don‟t interfere in a way that turns out to be of value, you become the victim. Cross
of Contagion people are very valuable for redirecting. That‟s their worth. When you
meet a 2/5, it‟s like, “This is the one. This person is going to make a difference in
my life.” And when you smell that 5 at the unconscious level, it‟s like, “Wow, this
person is really going to make a difference in my life.”
As it turns out, that 2/5 may be into macrobiotics. And the reality is that if that
person who thinks they‟re the answer—and remember, if you‟re going to interfere
with somebody‟s life doesn‟t mean it‟s direct. It doesn‟t mean you shout at them. It
doesn‟t mean you grab them. That person comes in the 2/5s environment and the
2/5 is there eating 72 times a day because that‟s what you have to do on macrobio-
tics, you never stop eating so you‟d better rich, and that person coming in there, it‟s
like, “Hey this is really cool and tastes good and I‟m going to try this.” Then they‟re
one of these people, if you put that kind of diet in their body, slowly they begin to
die because it isn‟t good for them, whatever the case may be.
In other words, one of the things to understand about the 2/5 is that when they
interfere in your life, if what they bring you doesn‟t bring fruition for you right away,
then you‟re going to blame them. You‟re going to punish them, “It‟s your fault, it‟s
all because of you; you did this. If it weren‟t for you I never would have tried this
and look at me now, I walk with a limp,” whatever the case may be.
Again, what you get with 2/5s and 5/2s is that there is a deep reticence to tell any-
body anything, to integrate with anyone in any way, and the 2/5 particularly because
its Personality would truly just like to be left alone. It doesn‟t want to interfere with
your life. One of those things you‟ll hear coming of 2/5s mouths is, “I’m not here to
interfere.” The 2/5 doesn‟t want to interfere. It doesn‟t want to interfere, not be-
cause it doesn‟t think it can be of value, not because of the fate that it brings me, in
fact, and positively instrumental for the other, it doesn‟t want to take the risk that
the other can‟t follow through and they‟ll end up being blamed. “Yes, I could help
you, but I don’t think you have it,” is what goes on in their heads. “I could show you
that there is another way, but I don’t think you’ll make it, and then you’re going to
blame me.” That‟s the paranoia of the 5. It‟s like, “Ah, it’s not going to be worth it
because if I tell them this, it doesn’t mean anything other than me being in trouble
because I’ll be blamed.”
You tell somebody that they should go to India to meet an Atman guru and they die
of bubonic plague. What to do. And their family blames you—you sent our Johnny
to his death. You can‟t imagine how many times Cross of Contagion people get

blamed, just blamed. Most of the time they don‟t know what you‟re talking about.
Remember, it‟s only when you‟re awake, it‟s only when you‟re participating in your
process that you begin to recognize what you‟re here for. The vast majority of Cross
of Contagions don‟t realize what they‟re doing. It‟s not like they‟re walking around
saying, “I‟m here as an instrument of the fates and I‟m going to change people‟s
lives.” That‟s not what they think.
Then end up being called bad things, “Stop interfering in my life.” “I didn’t do any-
thing,” they say. They don‟t even know that it‟s going on. Then somebody comes
up to them screaming, “It‟s all your fault.” “What did I do?” “What do you mean,
what did you do? You‟re the one who sent me down that track.” “Me? Aren’t you an
adult, didn’t you make up your own mind,” and on and on and on. So keep that in

with a 3/5 Contagion getting in your way. You hopefully are going to get them when
they‟re mature and awake. Because, after all, these are 3/5s who don‟t particularly
suffer themselves, if you understand. These are 3/5s who can bring great suffering
into your life, putting you on a trial and error track. They‟re going to put you on that
track, and they don‟t care. Off you go down that track. There are a lot of problems
down there.
Most 3/5s get into the most trouble materially. “It‟s because of you I gave up my
job and tried to do that. And now I don‟t have what I need, it‟s all your fault.”
Three-fives fund the managers. Imagine you have a 3/5 fund manager. He‟s going
to say to you, “Look, look, I think we should take what you have and all these secure
bonds and I really think that we should go in this direction because this is really
going to make a difference in your material future.” And the client is going, the 5th
line unconscious, “This is the best broker I‟ve ever had. This is a broker who is really
going to change my life.” It‟s called bankruptcy and poverty. There is absolutely no
guarantee. This is the fates just playing with you.
Now, it can sound awful. For the not-self it really is. But in fact, it‟s part of the
game. You see, there are a lot of tracks in terms of interference where you don‟t
really know where it‟s going. You don‟t. There are just possibilities. “I didn’t prom-
ise you that we were going to make more money. I just said this is going to be a
much more interesting,” blah, blah, blah.
When you‟re a 3/5, nobody disappoints people more. One of the things that 3/5s
bring to anyone who is on any path is that their interference is a negative interfe-
rence. Again, this is not about whether this is good or bad. This is not so much
about people who are going to redirect you to something as much as they‟re going
to redirect you away from something. “Oh, is that what you do? How disgusting;

The Clinging Fire
oh, I’m sorry.” Enough said; the contagion is in. That‟s the kind of thing that ends
up happening.
When 3/5s do have their moment of influence, of impact, the thing to recognize is
that because the way they offer it is not safe, they‟re bound to get into trouble and
they will be blamed. The real victims of contagion are the 3/5s. They really get
blamed. It‟s their fault. What happens to them ultimately is because it‟s a 3rd line
theme, they eventually begin to assume it‟s true. “I’m bad luck.” This is the place
where you get the language of “bad luck.”
Remember something about the 30th gate that you get to see at a deeper, biological
level: The 30th gate is about sweet and sour. One of the main themes of the 30th
gate is sugar. This is the diabetes gate just as the 18th gate is about salt. So, one of
the things to recognize about the whole emotional process is that it is a sweet and
sour process. And yet, both of them are viable. There are times we all enjoy the
sweet. There are times we all enjoy the sour. Again, it‟s not about a good or bad
thing. But it‟s really about understanding the inherent quality here.
So, when you meet a 3/5 Contagion, it‟s often a sour interference. It‟s not a sweet
interference. It‟s sour. And of course, that brings out a totally different kind—one
sours on something rather than being attracted to the sweetness of something. In
other words, contagion works in two ways. You can pull people away from some-
thing, or you can push them towards something. One is to fill them with sourness;
the other is to tantalize them with sweetness.
When a 3/5 is in their Kironian phase and awake, they‟re the most useful beings we
can have. They‟re really good. They are able to discern truly what doesn‟t work and
they‟re able to universalize it to the benefit of others. They make fabulous scien-
tists; they make great researchers. They are very, very important to us. Yet, the
vast majority of them are quite disturbed. They‟re disturbed because of the conse-
quences of that projection on a trial and error process. How much easier and how
different their life can be when they come to grips with what it is to be 3rd line and
recognize the intrinsic beauty of the 3rd line process.

The 3/6
RAC Contagion 1
In looking at the 3/6 or the 6/3, always recognize because of the presence of the 6th
line, there is something different in the way they operate. It‟s only within the 6th line
context that what they want is to interfere in their own life. I don‟t have any other
way to phrase that. You go through the subjective in which everybody interferes in
your life, so it seems. Again, speaking in the context of this configuration, you go
through the roof phase in which you interfere in other people‟s lives only to realize
that that brings a double-edge sword. And finally you get to your Kironian phase in
which the only thing you want is to be an instrument, to live the instrument‟s life
and, in that sense, find what your true direction is.

This is a codon chemical thing. We have one codon that contains the 8 and the 14.
We have another codon that contains the 2 and the 1. This is all about this move-
ment through the center. Everything about
contagion is getting to the place where there is
direction and vision. It‟s all about that. The
power is there. The thing to recognize is that
when people who are carrying the Cross of Con-
tagion are suffering within themselves, it‟s a
horror because they get stuck on that not-
getting-anywhere treadmill.
Their gift is that they can empower others. That
empowerment begins in the 14th gate to really
work towards a direction, a mysterious direction
that isn‟t there. The contagion isn‟t about get-
ting there, it‟s about going there. It‟s about
shifting the focus. It‟s about shifting the move-
ment. The 6th line wants to be there. It doesn‟t
want to get there. The Right Angle is trying to get there. The Left Angle is trying to
tell you how you get there. But the 6th line just wants to be there.

The 4/6
RAC Contagion 1
Whenever you come to the closing, to the bookend of the Right Angle, what you
have to see is the preparation for the transpersonal phase. The 4/6 is a witness.
They are great viewers; they are great watchers. This is their gift. Their gift is to be
a role model within a closed community who doesn‟t integrate directly into the com-
munity, but is simply there and accepted as an aspect of the community.
When you have a 4/6 on the Cross of Contagion, all they‟re interested in is influen-
cing others with their example. Their example is always what the fates brought
them. These are the kind of people who always tell you, “If it weren’t for me catch-
ing my foot in the door, I never would have met her.” There‟s always this, “This is
how it happened for me. I stepped into a taxicab and Jesus was sitting beside me.
This is how it happened.”
In other words, they want you to see their example of being transformed by fate.
They‟re the first ones who will point out to you how fate is changing your life because
they can see it. “What a difference that job has made for you, Johnny. You look
much happier.” It‟s a typical 4/6 Contagion view. “Oh, it’s good that you changed
your direction.”
Because it‟s a 4/6 and we‟re going to have a 4/3 stage, you also have to see that
there are no guarantees that we‟re going to get to the wisdom of all of that. There
are no guarantees that you‟re going to be with the right people in which you see the
hand of fate is positive. You may see the hand of fate as terribly negative, that your

best friend goes out on a date that she‟s always wanted to go on and there‟s a car
accident and she‟s dead. These are things that are right there to shatter everything.
Contagion has this quality of making what you thought was your direction totally
dissolve. It‟s like the bridge immediately drops and gets burnt. The 4/6 is there to
show you that even when the bridge falls, there is a way. You find out that if you
walk along the coast, it‟s really beautiful, and eventually you find a place where you
cross over and you don‟t need the bridge.

Busy, busy, busy—busy can be very healthy because busy is the great distraction. If

The Clinging Fire
One of the things about the nature of the fates is that they open up the opportunity
for being busy in a productive way. In order to be busy in a productive way, you
have to find many different things in order to support the ever-expanding population.
As an example, when you look at the nature of modern commerce, you can see that
not all of us together could come up with the names of all the things that people
make money with today. There are so many ways to make a living. Yes, there are
the obvious ones. We have specific archetypes. Just as without the fates we would
have our six specific processes. There are basic jobs that in this life.
But the reality is that out of that, there are millions of variations. In understanding
that this is the initiating process of coming into form, industriousness is very impor-
tant. Take advantage of the fates. It‟s one of my favorite expressions: Good news,
bad news; who knows. It‟s an old Chinese saying. It‟s wonderful.
The whole point of industriousness is take advantage of the fates. That‟s the real
heresy. The real heresy is, “Hey, listen, don’t worry that it isn’t what you thought it
was going to be, take advantage of what you see now.” And if you take advantage
of that, then you‟re going to be able to affect a lot of other people. Every time there
is a new trend, I watch. About a year ago there was some guy in the States who did
some kind of workout therapy that was with punching—Tae Bo.
That‟s industriousness, right? You come up with this, there it is, and all of a sudden
the fates. He was doing a boxing exercise, a woman watches him and says, “Gee,
that looks like fun; can I try that, too?” The fates get in the way. The moment the
fates get there, all of a sudden that turns into the flavor of the month. Then you
have television coverage of all these people who are doing this. This is the ultimate
transpersonal—to take advantage of the fates and turn it into a business, which is
what he did. The guy made a lot of money. I‟m sure there‟ll be Tae Bo until it dies
out. Hopefully, he didn‟t spend it all. But it‟s the way it works.
It‟s something to understand about us. If you‟re going to be on the human experien-
tial way, you‟d better make a living. That‟s part of the experiential way. We need to
have our material resources. We need to be able to survive. We need it; it‟s essen-
tial. One of the great things about the Cross of Industry is that it has made it possi-
ble for us to develop into more than just basic, barter, survival commerce. What we
have today are so many different kinds of services and products that we can actually
support the vast diversity of humanity. Not only that, the fates can actually get in
the way and even make you rich from something totally obscure simply because
humanity, as you can tell, is open to it.
So, this busy, busy, busy is something very important. This is the heresy. The he-
resy is that the Right Angle comes to the Left Angle and the Right Angle says, “I was
going to have this kind of career. And it turns out my eyes aren‟t very good and I
can‟t. I‟m really lost and messed up and I‟m suffering and I don‟t know what to do
with my life.” It‟s a responsibility of this Left Angle to say, “Yes, but take advantage
of this over here. Don’t give up just because of that. This is telling you there is
something to do. We need a lot of good blind people,” whatever it is.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1

The reality is that it‟s the job of the transpersonal, in this sense, to show you that
whatever the fates have offered you is an opportunity. This is something that I have
to stress over and over again to really understand about the fates. When the fates
step in your way, they‟re not there to hurt you. They are not punishing you. It‟s not
like they‟re saying, “Ok, this one has been a real jerk.” It doesn‟t work that way.
This is the opening up of the continuing expansion of the human experiential poten-
tial. Anything a human being can experience is something they can sell. It‟s true.
It‟s amazing.
So, in the context of the 5/1, basically what you have is the potential to turn the
arrival of the fates into a practical application. Of course, this is the 5th line nature:
See the practical advantages of another path. When I want to do something and
something gets in the way, my very 5th line nature will automatically let go of fight-
ing the barrier and look to see what it‟s showing me. This is what this is all about.
Obviously, at the true self level, this is something that can be very beautiful in the
sense that it can show anyone, regardless of the circumstances, that life always
presents bounty, that there is always a way. Yet, for the not-self, the 20/34 is a
devastating activation if you‟re not aware. It‟s exhausting. It‟s something that can
really just simply burn you right out.
So here, when we‟re dealing with the 5/1, you also have to see that we‟re dealing
with the ability to handle other people‟s paranoia. Some crosses‟ purpose is only
fulfilled by what they can do, in effect, in relationship to the other. This whole confi-
guration of the Sun in the 30th gate is all about impacting others. You can see in the
5 that the potential is somebody comes to the 5 because they don‟t feel like they‟re
on the right track and they assume that the 5 is going to give them the answer.
“Here’s what you can be busy about.” You‟d better be right, if you‟re a 5. That‟s
why the practical is there. Take the practical advantage of the fates. That‟s really
the teaching of the 5/1 in this configuration.

5/2s are by their very nature industrious on this cross. It actually saves them. They
are industrious. They‟re very busy; they‟re really into their thing. And like every-
thing having to do with the 2/5 or the 5/2, they don‟t really want to give it to you.
They don‟t particularly want you to have access to it because they don‟t want to be
blamed. All emotional gates carry blame. But some more than others, and if you‟re
dealing with configurations that affect the outside, then you have to see that if you
have an emotional gate and you‟re impacting others, there are going to be conse-
quences.

The Clinging Fire
The thing about the 5/2 is that they are always ok when they are industrious on their
own—the hermit unconscious. There‟s nothing worse than having a mundane job,
you‟re working in a factory, and there are all kinds of people who have to do certain
things, that it all works in a flow. And then you have one of these creatures come in.
They‟re a 20/34, they‟re just zoom, zoom, zoom. They get in there and they get
faster and faster and they just keep on doing it and everybody else gets really an-
noyed. The fact is, what they don‟t want is for the boss to see that because then the
contagion will be at work. This becomes the instrument of interference for all of the
others because this becomes the example that the boss points to. “Why can‟t you be
as industrious as Joe?” Joe gets beaten up in the shower afterwards. Slow down,
Joe.
So one of the things about the 5/2, particularly on this cross, is that this is a place
where on their own, they‟re very industrious and very capable of taking advantage of
turns in road, but they‟re not going to universalize that to others. That‟s not their
intent. I have yet to meet an awake 5/2, so I don‟t know what that really looks like.
My assumption is that an awake 5/2 is of enormous value to those who can call it, if
you can call it.
Remember how different that is from a 5/1. If I had a 2nd line Personality, I wouldn‟t
be in this business. I wouldn‟t care. It wouldn‟t drag me out. But 1st lines have to
prove things; they have to, they‟re forced to. Second lines don‟t have to prove any-
thing. That‟s why if you have a 5/1 Buddha and you have a 5/2 Buddha, the 5/2
Buddha is always in trouble because it really doesn‟t care about proving anything. It
doesn‟t have to; it doesn‟t want to; it doesn‟t need to.
So, it‟s really something to understand about the difference between 5/1s and 5/2s.
The 5/1 has to demonstrate to you, prove to you, that taking advantage of fate will
lead to profit. And that industriousness is good for humanity because it ends up
looking after everybody. The 5/2 isn‟t going to do that. It sees no reason to do
that. Not only that, it‟s paranoid that it doesn‟t have the ability to be able to de-
scribe it because it‟s a natural. It doesn‟t really know how it takes advantage of the
fates. It‟s just everybody else‟s presumption that they do.
Fives, for example, are always the ones who are, unfortunately, profiteers in times of
war. You have a terrible war scene, there are all these people who are dying and
everything thing else. There‟s your local 5th line selling apples for $10 apiece. There
is always somebody who‟s going to take advantage of the fates. There is always
somebody who is going to be industrious and take advantage of the fates. Some-
body had to make the gas for the gas chambers. Somebody does the job. Some-
body takes advantage of the fates.

The 6/2
LAC Industry 1
That brings us to the 6/2. The Right Angle wants to interfere—when I say „wants,‟
it‟s designed to interfere with the other. The Left Angle would rather not and ends
up having to. Everything about the 6th line is understanding that as you go through
life, when you move from the pessimism to the optimism, when you move from the
subjective to the objective, in the end what you get to recognize is that neither is the
whole story. It‟s not like the subjective was it, but it‟s also not like the objective is
it. There is more than just the perception. There is no more than just either inter-
preting from this side or interpreting from that side.
As a matter of fact, the thing that‟s more is the thing that‟s less. In other words,
you‟re not this or that; you‟re never this or that. Now, the whole thing about a 6/2
is that rather than being an instrument of the fates in the classic sense of the Right
Angle, or being driven by the fates as is the example of the Left Angle, the moment
you get to that 6th line, it says, “Well, if the fates get in my way and I go down that
track, it does not mean that the track I go down, because of the interference, is
going to bring a benefit to my life.” It is 3rd line knowing.
The 6th line says, “I can hope that when the fates get in my way, that road that I go
down could be the road of promise. I could hope that, but I know that it doesn’t
necessarily matter.” Then you get to Buddhahood. The 6th line always carries within
it the potential of true transition. The true transition is: I don’t care if there are fates
or not. It doesn’t really make any difference. It’s just life. It’s not about life is
changed because of this or that. It’s just the way in which we give a name to a
signpost on the road. But the road is a smooth road and away we go. What do I
care about the fates? I’m going to worry about them. I’m going to help you worry
about them. I’m going to praise them. I don’t do any of that. It doesn’t matter
whether they’re there or not there, or they affect me or they don’t affect me, or they
affect you or don’t affect you.
The only thing that matters is, live correctly as yourself, that’s a role model, and if
the fates come into my life, so what? If I look back, I will notice that nothing
changed, in the sense that it’s still the same straight line. It’s not like they really
changed my direction. What kind of bullshit is that? You think I made a right turn
there. I didn’t make a right turn there. It’s just the illusion of—this is the exalted 6th
line awareness. It doesn’t matter. I can embody the fact that life has no guaran-
tees.
The 6/2 on the Cross of Industriousness is busy being. That‟s all. They‟re just busy
being—being alive, being in the world, being whoever they are. Again, that is an
exalted representation of that. Everything about the development of 6th line beings
goes back to the importance of how well they handle their first 30 years. Most 6th
line beings will have a very fulfilling life if they can have a healthy withdrawal from
their first Saturnian cycle. Almost universally, 6th line beings would be healthier if

they had a healthy 30 years, because after all, that sets the framework. If anything
is going to go wrong, that‟s when it does go wrong. Depending on the way they‟re
raised, depending on the influences in their life, depending on whether or not they‟re
beaten down for their 3rd line fiascos in those years, and how hard they are on them-
selves, and so forth, the only hope for any 6th line/3rd line being is what happens to
them in those years. How important it is for us to focus on that.
The fates bring you an expanded opportunity. The tribe, for example, had very few
jobs. You could look after the animals, you could make clothes, you could raise
children and you could be the defender. But there wasn‟t a hell of a lot going on. It
wasn‟t like there were a lot of services. Today, we have a very different game. The
thing to understand in this progression is when you get to the 30th gate, you get to
this forking of the paths and the forking of the potential for the experiential way
being self supporting. To know how things work and have principles is fine, but you
have to eat. You have to make a living; you have to have a life, all of those things.
So you have the 30th gate.
When you get to the 30th gate and you realize that you have this experiential path
and there are all these opportunities for industriousness and that the gods are going
to help out and show you different ways, what you realize is that this isn‟t enough
unless you have the right spirit, unless you have talent. That brings us immediately
to the next transition as we move into the 55th gate.

The 6/3
LAC Industry 1
My point is to always see that 6/3s are always dangling. There is always the part of
them that‟s in their process and the other part of them that is saying, “What is this
sprit? What is it? I can’t smell it? What’s it like?” It‟s looking for something else.
The moment that it‟s looking for something else, it‟s not complete.
When I look at profile structure, I look at the 1/3 at the beginning, I look at the 6/3
at the end and it tells me the same story over and over again: How wonderful life is.
It‟s never fixed. It‟s always, always, always mutative. What makes us so successful
is our deep, mutative capacity, that we can go within a couple of millennium from
basically being cave people to being this. Our level of mutative capacity is amazing.
By the time the 6s are in their roof phase, they all have an opportunity to do well
materially because that‟s the best time for 6s. It really is their opportunity in life.
Sixes on the Cross of Industry are not going to have a bad time with money unless
they really, really get a terrible conditioning or happen to be in an environment
where it‟s very difficult. There are natural skills and they do have that natural cha-
risma and busyness that‟s inherent in their configuration.

But the 6/3 will never pay attention to the values of industriousness because it‟s only
interested in spirit. Every time something goes wrong, their assumption is it‟s be-
cause there is this lack of whatever this thing is that we call spirit. It‟s so interest-
ing. I have great respect for 6/3s. I understand that not being this and not being
that isn‟t easy. But they are essential bridges. They make it possible to move from
one process to the next and to integrate one process with the next. And again, the
only way they can really live out the potential of their gift of transition is they have

We kill off 6th line beings very quickly if they‟re not correct. If you‟re a 6th line being
and you‟re not correct and you get into your Kiron phase, then your chances of sur-
vival are much less than any other profile. It‟s just the way it is. Nature is cruel to
mutation. When it comes to mutation, it‟s very cruel. If you‟re not a viable muta-
tion, then nature doesn‟t want to have anything to do with you, and it‟s as simple as
that and they kill you off.

Introduction
I guess in the mythologies of interest relative to Human Design, the 55th gate has
taken on a certain, special value because it is the gate that‟s most deeply associated
with the transition that‟s going to take place in 2027 in the mutation of the Solar
Plexus system. So, when we‟re dealing with the 55th gate we‟re dealing with some-
thing unique.
Understand the 49th and the 55th gates belong to the same codon
called Histidine. One of the things about this codon, for me par-
ticularly, is that this is the heart of this mutative process that is
going to take place in 2027. In other words, it is this chemistry
that is under the most mutative pressure. That mutative pressure
is at work with the 49.
When the mutation takes hold the channel
that we know of as the channel 19/49, the channel of Synthe-
sis, this channel will actually break. The 19 will no longer
connect to the 49. This is part of the way in which the Rave
child will change its emotional field. The whole emotional
system is hooked into that particular breaking of that connec-
tion.
It is the breaking of the connection to humanness. It‟s also
the breaking of the connection to animal-ness. In other
words, it is through the relationship we have with mammals. So we have three ways
human connects with mammals. Mammals have the potential
of the 19th gate, but not the 49. They have the potential of
the 62, but not the 17 and they have the potential of the 12,
but not the 22. So, one of the things to recognize about the
19/49 is that this is the deepest connection between mammals
and humans because this is our interdependency.
We need animals as a resource. And not simply as we see
them today, which is a resource for food, but to recognize the
resource for transportation, the resource for many things.
Today many animals are simply a pleasure resource for human
beings, whether they are dogs, cats or horses, or whatever the
case may be.
But one of the things to be clear about is that autism, which is
rooted in the 19/49, is about a frequency problem in this channel because this chan-
nel is under pressure, under mutative pressure and it‟s changing. One of the things
about autistic children is that they have difficulty assimilating the emotional realm.
It‟s very, very difficult. For example, an autistic child cannot tell by the expression
on your face whether you‟re happy or you‟re angry because they cannot pick up the
wave.

So, one of the things about Rave children is to recognize there is going to be a break
here. They are really not going to be human. They‟re going to be Rave; they‟re
going to be quite different in the context that this is another evolutionary step and
we‟re going to have a different emotional system.
When we come here to the 55th gate, I want you to keep this in mind as a perspec-
tive. The initiation of this process, which is really only a process that will bring us
the change when there is that break between the 19 and the 49, begins in the 55.
Because it is the same chemistry, they are the same codon,
this is the movement of the information within that similar
chemistry. So, what takes place in the 55 is going to have a
residual impact on the 49 and this is going to be like a domino
setting things in motion.
If you look at global cycles, you‟ll see that they are rooted in
the 90-degree movement, not 88 degrees. When you look at
global cycles and at the precession of the equinox, and when
you look at the way in which I teach how we look at previous
cycles, you‟ll see that they are measured by Right Angle
crosses. It‟s very important to grasp. The larger program is not mutative. I hope
you can get that. That larger program is stable. It is in here that you have a con-
trolled, mutative process. If the mutation is successful, then it will be able to spread
and expand. But there is a protection, in that sense.
When you look at the 55th gate, this is the trigger for the mutation. We are going to
enter into a 6th line phase. If we were looking at incarnation crosses, we would say
that‟s a Left Angle—Personality Sun—but we‟re not talking about the Personality Sun
when we‟re talking about global changes. We‟re talking about the precession of the
equinox which is a different thing. The precession of the equinox is going to go into
a 6th line theme of this gate. It‟s all about the 55.
The mystery of the 55 is not in the mundane application—if you could call incarnation
crosses mundane—of how you live out that cross personally, which I‟ll describe to
you. The mystery is in the name that‟s given to the Right Angle Cross because it‟s a
representation of what it means when the equinox reaches the 55th gate. This is the
Sleeping Phoenix. What a funny name.
It is one thing to say that this is the Cross of the Phoenix, but it‟s not. It‟s the Cross
of the Sleeping Phoenix. Solomon‟s line, there honestly isn‟t anything new. If you
go back far enough into the matrix, you will see that there is a seed that has always
been there. It‟s not like AIDS suddenly emerged out of nowhere. It simply is not
possible; otherwise, we would not have such a wonderful reception to it. The reality
is that everything‟s been there. It‟s like that photographer who photographed but-
terfly wings and ended up with the entire English alphabet. The alphabet was on
butterfly wings 200 million years before there were humans.

One of the things to understand about the Sleeping Phoenix is that it has been sleep-
ing a long time. It has always been there ready, but ready not to rise—understand,
Sleeping Phoenix. When the phoenix wakes up, the phoenix has to die before it can
fly. Do you understand? This is not the cross of the phoenix; it‟s the Cross of the
Sleeping Phoenix. It‟s very different.
The moment you grasp that difference is the moment you can see that 2027 brings
quite a double-edged sword. It brings the death of something. And out of that
death, rising out of the ashes of that death, comes something new. Guess what‟s
dying? You. It‟s a very, very spooky gate. Basically, what you‟re looking at is the
release of a momentum building evolutionary change that will lead to the extinction
of Homo sapiens sapiens. That‟s what it is. We‟re not going to live long enough—
and I mean the species—to actually be able to get to the point as modern man did
with Cro-Magna that you actually get to walk into a valley and say, “Hey, they‟re
really all dead.” It‟s not like Rave children are going to wander around going, “Hey,
the last one just went.” We won‟t get to that.
But what I want you to understand is that this is signaling an end of the vitality and
potential of our own species. I have mentioned it many times, but after 2027 we are
going into a dark age. We‟re going to go into a dark age because the darkness is
setting in around us. Our time is coming to an end. The age of truth ends in 2027.
Inner truth will no longer be something that can be found. All these people think
we‟re going to get more and more and more and more and more technologically
sophisticated as we go along, moment by moment by moment, until 2027. It‟s not
like it will stop on a dime. Nothing does. Mutation takes time. But it‟s going to
bring to an end the vitality of our species to be able to keep on penetrating the void.
It just will. It‟s going to cut our legs out. We are going to burn up in flames and die.
Now, as I said, we won‟t get to that point—well, we will in a sense, but I don‟t want
to get into that story.
So, it‟s very important to see what that name really means. Think about what that
means for somebody who is carrying this as a cross. First, they have to wake up.
And they wake up to die, to be reborn. Ah, listen. One of the catch phrases of the
late 20th century is being „reborn.‟ There are so many born-again this and that‟s.
This is a 55th gate symptom hovering in the air: Wake up, die and be reborn. That‟s
what it‟s about.
Think about what it means to carry this cross. You meet Human Design and they tell
you to follow your Strategy. You follow your Strategy and you get to that point, and
the moment you get to that point, everything in your life falls apart; everything. It‟s
like being rich and famous and you get to the end of seven years and nobody knows
you and you don‟t have a buck. You have to wake up and die and then you can be
reborn. It‟s quite interesting.

The 1/3  59  20
When you‟re looking at this configuration, there‟s always something to keep in mind.
You‟re dealing with the 20/34. Anybody who is on this cross is mindlessly moving
through life. And I don‟t mean that to be an insult to anybody. There‟s a lot of
mindless movement through life.
But what I do mean is that on this cross, there‟s very little opportunity for these
people to wake up. Now, there‟s very little opportunity, in some senses, for anybody
to wake up other than that opportunity that presents itself. But I‟m trying to put this
into a kind of unique position in which—we have a cross called the Cross of the Un-
expected. And the Cross of the Unexpected is an extraordinary thing. Quite literally,
on that cross was discovered Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, all kinds of scientific discove-
ries, the Unexpected. When that‟s
somebody‟s cross, like this cross,
you don‟t know about them. You
just don‟t know. On the Cross of the
Unexpected you get a sense of it

because that 28 is there. You get a
sense that there is something in
these people that could take the kind

of risk that would surprise you. You
somehow smell it.
But when you‟re looking at this, the
Sleeping Phoenix is just like that. In

talking about emotional waves, when
you‟re dealing with the tribal wave,
there is this ratcheting up that takes

place over time. So the tribal emo-
tional wave builds up over time and
then suddenly explodes. You have
the dramatic building of the abstract
wave waiting for its crash. But when
you‟re talking about emotional individuals, they rarely are seen as emotional. It‟s
because they plane. When you‟re looking at a Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix, what
you‟re looking at is a planing, sleeping, busy, zombie.
There are so many descriptions in the world that float around. You want zombie?
This is zombie. This is the living dead. Again, I don‟t mean it as an insult; I don‟t
mean to say that if you meet them, you walk away saying, zombie. You don‟t at all.
As a matter of fact, they look so charismatic. They look powerful; they‟re busy;
they‟re occupied in their life; they‟re roaring around. You don‟t think of them as

being zombies. You think of them being the exact opposite. But they‟re sleepwalk-
ers. It‟s all being done asleep. And not just in the normal sense that the average
not-self is asleep; they‟re asleep. The truth of who they are is hidden from them. It
just is. And they‟re so busy that they don‟t get a chance to make contact with it.
It doesn‟t matter what the configuration is, the moment you‟re dealing with a 3rd line
you‟re dealing with things that can go wrong. You‟re dealing with things that will fall
apart. You‟re dealing with rules that can collapse. You‟re dealing with all of those
things because with any loophole, the 3rd line is going to fall in it. And hopefully they
don‟t break their leg. Any loophole; they‟re going to find the cracks. It just happens
to them. They have no choice.
One of the things to understand about the Sleeping Phoenix is that when you start
off with the 1/3, what you‟re looking at is that there is always the possibility of
breakthrough. Breakthrough for 1/3 phoenixes is often violence. The whole thing
about the 3rd line is that it has things bang into it, literally bang into it. These are
people who need a real shake. You really have to see that this name, this sleeping,
they look like they‟re so active and alive and yet you need to whack them to even
get them to take a breath to be able to see that there is something going on that‟s
far beyond what they think.
The 1/3 always has that opportunity. Because the reality is that if you‟re a 1/3 on
this cross, you‟re very, very busy trying to figure out how you become certain. This
is the main theme of the 55th gate: How do I become certain? This is the main fear,
that I will never be certain. This is the gate of fickleness. This is an emotional gate
in which the cup is half-full and the cup half-empty and it just depends on your pers-
pective. This is the moodiest gate of all the gates, emotionally moody, melancholic,
creative, and romantic. This is the gate of the most severe food problems, either up
or down on the scale. This is the gate where you suffer, you take pleasure some-
where else. So you‟re suffering in your life, so you take pleasure in sex. You‟re
suffering in your life, so you take pleasure in food. All of that is in the 55th gate.
So, you can imagine what the world of the sleeper is: Busy with food, busy with sex,
busy, busy, busy, as if those things are what really matter, and truly being in a situ-
ation of never being certain. Again, this is this unexpected quality. Individuality is
so unlike the collective in the way decisions occur. When I‟m speaking of decision,
I‟m not talking about inner authority and what we know as the decision making
process. I‟m talking about the way the not-self mind deals with decision making.
If you are an abstract person and somebody is putting you under pressure to make a
decision, what you do is look at past experience; it‟s the abstract way. You look
back and try to find something that was similar. You look back and try to figure out
how you felt going through that, and based on the past, you decide. “Well, I did that
before, it wasn‟t so bad; let‟s try this.” If you‟re a logical person and somebody is
putting you under pressure to make a decision, you have a pattern that you can
stretch out in front of you. So you create this logical pattern, “If I do this, then this
will happen and that will happen, and then I‟ll get that.” And based on the way you
see the pattern going into the future, you will make a decision.

But individuality has neither experience nor a pattern. It only has spontaneous
knowing or not. And most of the time it‟s not. This is the pulse that‟s inherent in
the format of individuality. When you look at the 55th gate, always think about the
blooming of your first love and you have a daisy in your hand: He loves me, he loves
me not; she loves, she loves me not. You do not know, it‟s just pulling petals, you
don‟t know.
The whole thing about individuality is that when it‟s under pressure to make a deci-
sion is when it‟s most uncomfortable and unstable. Remember the force of condi-
tioning. The force of conditioning is that the collective insists that the individual
behave like the collective: What do you mean you can‟t make a decision? What do
you mean you don‟t know? Think of what this might be for you. Think about what it
was.
They don‟t work that way. So, when you‟re dealing with a 55th gate, you‟re dealing
with unknowing. This is an archetypal gate of unknowing. “I don’t know. I don’t
know.” The other side of this example would be the 43rd gate. The 43rd gate is the
archetypal gate of saying “I know.” It‟s always saying, “I know. I know, I know, I
know, I know. I‟m a 43, I know, I know, I know, I know. I‟m always telling you I
know, I know, I know. You tell me it‟s a nice day, I go, I know.” It‟s the most au-
tomatic thing in the world.
If you‟re a 55, the most automatic thing in the world is not that you speak it, be-
cause it‟s in your emotional system, it‟s that you do not know. “I don’t know, I don’t
know, I don’t know, I don’t know.” “Do you love me?” “I don’t, know, I don’t know,
I don’t know.” “Well, when are you going to know?” It‟s the most incredible ques-
tion to give to individuals, “When are you going to know?” “I don’t know.” “Oh, are
you in trouble. What do you mean you don‟t know?” “I don’t know when I’m going
know because I don’t know what I know; I don’t know.” It drives them all crazy.
So, you can think what it‟s like to be a 55. You don‟t know. You don‟t even know
that you don‟t know that you‟re a Sleeping Phoenix. You have no idea; you don‟t
know. I don‟t know. So, you can see the dilemma that‟s built into this cross. It is a
„handicap.‟
If you have a cross that has the 49 in it, or you have a cross that has the 55 in it,
then you have to see that there are many elements of these crosses that simply are
beginning to deteriorate, because the reality is that this cross will have a different
name one day. This is the Homo sapiens sapiens version of this cross. In many
ways, one of the things to grasp about people who incarnate on this cross is that
their job is to be the consciousness of a form that enters into its stage of extinction.
In other words, they‟re here to experience the end of a life process. Remember,
they‟re here to wake up to die. That doesn‟t have to be literal. I had a mystical
death, I didn‟t die. It doesn‟t have to be literal. But you really have to see that this
is what this is all about. If these beings don‟t get to that intensity of an experience,
they just don‟t know. It‟s not made easy for them to know.
The irony of all of this is that this Right Angle cross gives you exactly the image of
what humanity is going to look like until its end—busy, and I don‟t know—right to its

end. They‟ll just be busy. One of the things about extinction is that the extinction of
Homo sapiens will take a very long time. We don‟t have a very long time. Raves will
never, ever dominate in the population; it won‟t be possible. We‟re not going to get
to a place where we have a transition from the dominance of one to another. We‟re
not going to witness the extinction of humanity.
What we‟ll witness is infertility at an extraordinary level in humanity and we‟ll begin
to see the deterioration of human reproductivity. We will also, because of the age
that we‟ll live in, remember that the global themes will change in 2027. We‟re not
going to live with the themes we‟re living with now. The themes we‟re living with
now are driving our technology, curiosity, materially oriented phase that‟s been
going on since we began this cycle in 1615. This is a major transition.
It‟s important also to grasp that the whole fate of our species is symbolized, if you
will. Now, remember something, we can as a species die and wake up. That‟s also
the magic of this. And we can, even though our form is on the way out, ride in those
forms awake, and participate, because the Rave will not have a chance without
awake humans. When these children come in 2027, if there are not enough people
who know about this, if there is not enough sensitivity and awareness out there,
early generations of these children will barely see the light of day. After all, remem-
ber what we do with children who appear to be like that now. We institutionalize
them. These are not going to be communicative children. These are not going to be
children who seem to function in any way we would consider to be normal, healthy,
viable, all of that stuff.
Here in the 55th gate, when you‟re dealing with somebody who comes in on this
cross, please don‟t begin your conversation with “poor you.” I don‟t want you to
take from my description of this that you should really pat them on the back. What
it really requires is a great deal of sensitivity on your part to see that you need to
give a much greater effort in trying to kick them into gear than you do with just
about anybody else you‟re going to meet, and the rewards are great. In other
words, it‟s very important for us that these beings wake up. They wake up to the
death because otherwise nobody is going to tell humanity. Do you understand?
They‟re the ones who can wake up and recognize what‟s really happening. They‟re
the ones who will be able to tell us. The generations that are being born every year
who come in on these crosses are the ones where there is a real opportunity to pre-
pare. The moment we really can understand and accept that we are terminal as a
species—after all, in any human being‟s individual lifetime that doesn‟t really matter.
It‟s not like if you told all of humanity that‟s alive today that they‟re the last ones
who are ever going to live, that there would be this enormous psychological trauma.
There wouldn‟t be, because we‟re very selfish about our unique lives, and in our
times; that‟s the way the not-self works.
The moment it becomes a romance, the ultimate romance—the ultimate romance is
to fall in love with what is totally different from you and to protect it and to nurture
it. When these beings on this cross can wake up, they‟re the ones who can lay the
foundation for helping those who follow us. They‟re the ones who will be so deeply
sensitive to these children coming into the world. You can see in my describing it

that way we have a real problem because these are 20/34s and they‟re busy, busy,
busy, busy and they may not have time to find out that there‟s something else going
on in life. They may not have time to wake up and die. They may not have time for
any of that because they are so damn busy.
The one thing about the 1/3 is that yes, it‟s so damn busy, but the advantage is that
the truth just might slam into it. It‟s the whole thing about 1/3s. It‟s particularly
the case here when you‟re dealing with this kind of definition in which you know it‟s
very hard to get people‟s attention. It‟s a very, very individual design. It‟s hard to
get more individual than a cross like this. It‟s a freak, an emotional freak cross. It
doesn‟t know. “I don’t know and I’m not going to think about it, I’m just going to be
busy. I don’t know, so I’m just going to be busy.” This is the story of their life.

The 1/4 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 1
When you‟re dealing with a 1/4 or a 4/1 on this cross, you know that busyness is it.
You don‟t even have the possibility that the 3rd line unconscious has where there can
be a shattering. This is simply it. It‟s often very difficult when dealing with both of
these transitions phenomena, the 1/4 and the 4/1. This is a very difficult harmony.
It is so fixed. Everything about beings who are fixed is dependent on how they were
conditioned in the first place. It‟s very difficult to transform somebody in their adult-
hood who is on a fixed cross.
What are you going to do with the 1/4? The 1/4 says, “All I know is I don’t know, so
I’m just going to be busy with my life.” That‟s it. Not only is that it, that‟s what they
tell their friends. Their friends say, “Let‟s have an intellectual conversation,” and the
1/4 says, “No, let’s talk about my job. I’m busy now, I have to go, and I have things
to do.” It‟s very difficult.
The only thing that can help, as is always true with 1s, is there is always the poten-
tial in them through their natural tendency to investigate, the introspective, that
they will discover there‟s more than just being busy. Again, it will depend on what
that cross is as a characteristic. Whether it is a Manifestor, a Generator, a Manifest-
ing Generator [this cross is a Manifesting Generator], a Projector or Reflector; you
know what I mean. There are all kinds of variations of how that‟s going to operate.
But the thing that‟s so important to see about this is that these beings, when you
come across their cross, you have to try to do something to kick them, that‟s all.

and profitability of their busyness. So, if you have a 2/4 who‟s on this cross, one of
the things about them is that they can be called to great missionary work; get eve-
rybody working, get everybody busy. These are the kind of people who are too busy
to worry about the larger questions. “I’ll leave the larger questions to somebody
else; I have a life to live here.”
What‟s so interesting about 2/4s, the chain smoker who becomes the super clean
missionary of non-pollution, or the alcoholic who becomes not only a teetotaler, but
somebody who lectures others on their bad habits. 2/4s can really do that whole
jump around. These 2/4s in each configuration, there always lies a potential that
you can break through these people. You can shatter them so they can die, they can
die to the life they had, they can die to the way they look at the world.
The danger always with 4s is that if you shatter a 4, there‟s no guarantee they‟ll
come back together again. It‟s very, very difficult for them once a foundation has
been shattered. Remember, all of their power comes from their relationship to their
community. Theirs is a community of bonds of friendship. The moment they‟re seen
to be a fool in that context, that they were wrong, or that they lied or they did this or
that, whatever the case may be, it‟s very, very difficult for them to live with it.
It‟s not like it‟s easy for them to just get up and go. They have a fixed aspect in
their nature. So, when you take somebody who is a 4th line and you shatter one of
their main principles, you really do enormous damage. Now, sometimes damage is
positive. The shattering of this kind of busyness can be very positive. Yet, at the
same time, you have to see that they have to be called to that. It‟s not like they‟re
going to embrace it. The only ones who can call them are those who really know
them.
These are not people where you assume they need you. Again, that‟s one of the
things about the Sleeping Phoenix. In the early years when people would say to me,
“Can you tell what somebody is by meeting them, their type, this or that?” I used to
say, “No, of course not. All I meet is the not-self, and all I meet is transits, and if
somebody is pumping Ego at me, they may be Ego or they may not be. I have no
idea.”
One of the things about these people is that you would never guess that what I‟m
describing to you is what you‟re meeting when you meet them, because they‟re not
like that at all. They seem to be very powerful, very even. They have this smooth
emotional glaze to them. There‟s that romantic twinkle in their eye, they‟re charis-
matic, they have all this power to do stuff and for Manifesting Generators, this is the

this is the only pure connection between the Sacral Center and the Throat. So you
talk about busy, this is uncontrollable busy that misses things. It‟s such a classic.
The theme of the Manifesting Generator is that because they can manifest, that is,
after they generate, it means they can jump into things very quickly and take off.
What happens is they miss things. Their frustrations are the humiliation of having to
go back and make up and find those things that they skipped over. That‟s why I tell

that problem. Immediately it‟s going to get rid of it. When you‟re looking at this
being, you can see not only it is the cross of “I don‟t know, I don‟t know,” but it‟s “I
missed it, too, and I don’t want to go back.” When you meet them, off they are
trucking away having a nice life.

The 2/5 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 1
The 2/5s are perfect. You meet a 2/5 Sleeping Phoenix and you‟d better take a pic-
ture so we have proof that they exist because it‟s not going to happen. They‟re so
busy you don‟t see them. They‟re real heretics, in that sense. They won‟t have
anything to do with anything other than their trip. And of course, they don‟t know
what that is; they‟re just busy. With the traditional 2/5 paranoia and annoyance
with people projecting on them, and so forth, these are the ones who are just like,
“I’m busy and I’m busy in my own environment” and nobody sees it. Of course,
that‟s natural for 5s.
In the West, the technological advantages of computers and, like me working in my
home, this is a perfect place for 5 because they‟re protected and sheltered. They
can run around and do their stuff and nobody bothers them. One of the things about
2/5s is they don‟t want anybody looking at them; they‟re so tired of it. They don‟t
want a projection; they don‟t want anything. Their response is always the same to
“Do you want to go out tonight?” “I don’t know.” “When are you going to know?” “I
don’t know.” After awhile people don‟t call you up.

The 3/5
RAC Sleeping Phoenix 1
They can be so unaware on this cross. This is, “I don’t know and I missed it; and
look out because I’m coming through.” Boy, do they pour through because here you
have the 3rd line in the Personality so you know they‟re busy with their trial and error
process. One of the things about these beings is that the 3/5 on this cross is subject
to deep, deep depression.
Remember, the 55th gate is the moodiest of gates. In looking at a cross we do not
know, other than the 20/34 definition the cross brings, the relationship, for example,
in an individual as to whether their emotional system is going to be defined or not,
whether that 55 is going to be a consistent principle or not is something to keep in
mind. When you look at crosses, you have to see how they operate within the cha-
racteristics of the design.
But the thing to be clear about is that when you get to the 3/5, you get to somebody
who is totally preoccupied with the mistakes that are made in the busyness. Totally
preoccupied with “I don’t know why it happened,” totally preoccupied with “I miss

that it happened.” These are the kinds of beings who really do not have an easy
time in the workforce because you have the projection of those who work with them
on their 5 at the unconscious level: They‟re going to be the ones who are going to
bring the productivity—the 20/34 busyness; they‟re going to be the answer; they‟re
the solution.
These are people who are quickly hired and quickly fired because of their trial and
error process. I‟m a very unusual employer. I have people who directly work for
me. I am their employer. I provide their salary and their livelihood. I have two
people on my payroll who are 1/3s. They‟ve caused me a lot of problems, no joke. I
used to have three, but one of them is dead. They caused me a lot of problems.
They‟ve caused me enormous delays—everybody waiting for the free rave chart ser-
vice. They have their problems. However, I have learned, because I understand
them, if you give them enough time, if you treat them with respect through their
failures, what you end up is incredible competency. This is the magic of the 3. Ulti-
mately, the 3rd line way is just another way of efficiency. If things don‟t work, even-
tually the solution is a way in which things are made more efficient. It‟s the way in
which we work.
So, when you‟re dealing with the 3/5 on this cross, when I say „quick to be hired and
quick to fired,‟ nobody will give them that chance long enough because it could be
devastating. And if you don‟t understand it, you have a problem. When a 1/3 says
to me, “I will get it done and it will be done, and don’t worry,” I don‟t pay any atten-
tion. I simply assume that they‟ll get where they have to get to at some point.
Sometimes it‟s quick. They surprise me. Sometimes it‟s not quick.
The more respect we give to the 3rd line process, the more successful all of us are
going to be. And 3/5s really have a hard time. For me, as a 5, in my empathy and
resonance to the 3/5, I understand the dilemma of the 5, but I don‟t have a 3 in my
profile. I have a 1; it‟s very different. My process is not a trial and error process. I
don‟t have to constantly meet failure and breakdown; that‟s not my trip; that‟s not
how I‟m here to learn. So when I look at my friends and colleagues over the years
who have been 3/5s, I really have a great deal of empathy for their process.
The 5 at the unconscious level, like for the 2/5 which is reclusive and wants to be left
alone, it‟s so uncomfortable to have the 5 unconsciously. I know at the Personality
level that you have an expectation about me. I feel it; it‟s conscious. So, I can feel
the projection field. I can feel when somebody needs to ask me something. I can
feel the projection. So you get used to it in your life; you get used to that feeling,
whatever you want to call that. But when you have it unconscious, you don‟t. You
don‟t identify it; you don‟t think of it as being yourself. It‟s easy for me to see that I
can be seductive in my 5th line Personality. But I‟m aware of it. I can‟t imagine what
it‟s like to have that unconsciously and not be aware of it and how much trouble that
gets you into.
I know how much trouble my conscious seduction gets me into. Imagine when you
have no control over it, when it‟s totally unconscious. And there‟s your unconscious
going, “Hey, come on over here; let me show you how I make a mistake.” And the

pitch is, “I‟m perfect, I‟m perfect, I‟m perfect.” And what you get is, “Oh, God, Oh,
God.” And 3/5s are always dealing with that reaction. It‟s difficult.
All 3s have to live with expectations, but it‟s generally theirs. When 3s fall down,
one of the beautiful things about them, it‟s not like they look around and see who
they‟re going to blame. They‟re really good at that, they just blame themselves.
But when it‟s a 5, everybody else is going to blame you. And you didn‟t do anything,
and they‟re still going to blame you. They‟re going to consider you guilty, and even
if you‟re proven innocent, they don‟t care. As a matter of fact, they prefer thinking
that you‟re still guilty. It‟s just the way it is.
So, think about the 3/5 on this cross. “I don’t know, I missed something, I’m very
busy and I’m making mistakes.” Any 3/5 on this cross, you just heard that descrip-
tion, poor thing. And yet, to understand something, the not-self, how devastating I
can make my interpretation and description of any cross. I‟m the Cross of the Cla-
rion. That‟s really the cross of shooting off your mouth, and if you don‟t know what
you‟re shooting off your mouth about, you‟re really an asshole. It can be a horrible
life. If you‟re a Manifestor who shoots off your mouth and you don‟t know what
you‟re talking about, people beat you to death. Any cross, the moment you put that
into nothing but characteristics, the cross doesn‟t get an opportunity to be the defin-
ing element of your purpose. You just end up with all of those messy characteristics.
Yes, it‟s difficult, but it doesn‟t mean they can‟t wake up. The fact is that some of
them must wake up. This is us waking up to our future. They‟re the ones who have
to let us know. They‟re the ones, somewhere down the road, who will be the forces
that show us what to do with being terminal—be busy. What else to do? What are
you doing to do, hold your hands up in the air? Somebody said the Sun is going to
die in three weeks, what are you going to do? Move? Be busy, go about your busi-
ness. I guarantee that most of the world would just keep on going about its busi-
ness. People have to eat. You might make love a little more often. There might be
someone squirrelly who figures they should do things they never thought they‟d be
allowed to do. But basically, what do you do? The band was still playing on the
Titanic. What are you going to do?
This is part of the whole awakening process of humanity. It will be good for humani-
ty to discover that they‟re really terminal. It‟s a good wakeup call. It says, “Hey,
you might have something here to consider that you might like to work on.” And
remember something about us. It fascinates me; everything about the intelligence
of humans is about becoming God. It‟s always about becoming God. And we‟re
getting very God-like in our ability to be able to manipulate and create life. Sterility
won‟t stop humans from reproducing. Extinction is not something that we will legi-
timately ever have to face. But the fact is we will not be able to transform the way
in which we operate until we accept we are terminal so that we can devise a clever
way to get around it. That‟s us.
Human beings were put here, this spirit of consciousness was placed on this planet
to get to a point in which it can replace itself, and it will. It‟s one of the complica-
tions in the soup when it comes to the emergence of Rave children. Human beings

The 3/6 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 1
If you‟re going to live through a 6th line system of a life in which you go through the
cycles, we‟ve already seen and will see it over and over again with 3/6s and 6/3s the
complications of the first 30 years. The first 30 years can be deeply disturbing. By
the way, when I say things like that, always recognize that I‟m talking within the
context of the not-self. I am convinced, though I don‟t know if I‟ll ever really under-
stand it, that the 3/3 combination is very special. I think it provides certain oppor-
tunities given that somebody is young enough with that kind of configuration that
you can work with them and open them up to their nature. I think there is some
kind of resource that is possible through that 3/3 combination that leads to a totally
different kind of view or perspective when these beings get on the roof.
It‟s not like a 3rd line person where there is only one aspect of their nature that is
resonating to the 3rd line process so you have this basic conflict between the Perso-
nality and the unconscious. Think about it. Only 3/6s and 6/3s get to experience
this unique resonance between Personality and unconscious. Now, it‟s an artificial
resonance. After all, they‟re not 3s in that sense—3/6 is not really ever a 3/3, they
simply experience that dynamic. But what that leads to in my logical thinking is that
there is a resonance that‟s very deep. There‟s a shared experience through both
crystals of the same trial and error phenomena. My assumption is that if they‟re
entering into the right things that go wrong, then the results, the insights, whatever
we want to call that, whatever can be derived from that, can be extraordinary.
One of the things I see very clearly about the way in which the gods work is that the
more spectacular the potential of an aspect, the more difficult it is to get there. If
you‟re going to be a 3/6 on this cross, the trial and error busyness of your life is
overwhelming. You have a ladder stapled to your hip and you‟re going up and down,
off the roof all the time and it can exceedingly difficult to be able to make any deeper
sense out of this life. Remember, these are sleepers. One of the things about them
is they‟re very productive sleepers. These are people we would admire—not-self
admiration. It‟s very odd.

the quality of their life is determined by who is in their circle. Who you know makes
your life.
One of the things about the 4/6 in this particular configuration is that they‟re so busy
watching that there‟s nothing else to do. They‟re just busy watching. They‟re busy
being the voyeur; they‟re busy looking at everything and seeing nothing. They‟re
just busy with things. I live by the coast and you can see people sit there with bino-
culars; they‟re busy seeing and they see nothing. They‟re not looking at anything.
The Right Angle of this cross, and again given the nature of Right Angle geometry
where you have Personality destiny, it‟s deeply self-absorbed and on their own it is
not possible for the Right Angle to wake up. There is no spontaneous wakeup for
them. There is no transit that will wake them up. They can be woken up by others.
They just can. One of the forces that can wake them up is anyone who carries a
strong 49. It‟s just the relationship between the 49 and the 55. It‟s very, very diffi-
cult.
Remember, these are beings who are really, really absorbed in their process.
They‟re very busy; they don‟t really know so it‟s very difficult to reach them. You try
to explain something to them and there‟s a part of them that can very quickly and
very easily say, “I don’t know. It sounds interesting, I don’t know.” And then they
go back to being busy, and just busy with whatever their process happens to be and
they‟re not going to pay any attention to it. It‟s not easy to reach them.

When we move to Juxtaposition, one of the things you‟ll notice in most cases is the
name of a Juxtaposition cross is taken from an attribute of the gate that the Sun is in
because it‟s fixed. So, the 55th gate is a gate of moodiness, a gate of moods, so
here you have the Juxtaposition Cross of Moods.
This is a real shift, and you see the real shift because the 20/34 disappears. What
you get in its place is the 16 and the 9. We live in a phase now where the 16 and
the 9, which are part of the Cross of Planning, the 40, 37, 16 and the 9. This is the
thematic we have been living with since 1615. This is what‟s going away. All of our
development of societies, nation states, institutions, education, science, all of these
things have been community plans endowed with creative skills and deep focus and
concentration.

keep busy is a real healing experience. If you have a problem and you can be busy,
the busyness helps you avoid the problem. The reality is that the old wives‟ tale
about if your fingers are busy then your mind is quiet so keep on knitting—knit one,
purl two, and away you go.
One of the things to understand about what happens here in the 55th gate is that the
moment you move away from the 20/34, no longer can you escape the “I don‟t
know,” and the moodiness of the 55. So, those 4/1s who come in on this cross—
about 1% of the population—are minuscule. We go down into percentages of per-
centages.
What you‟re seeing is that the whole
accent is on the nature of the 55th
gate. Now, because the opposition

to the 55 is the 59, which has to do
with intimacy and our sexuality, this
is a very difficult social cross in this

configuration. First of all, the 4 al-
ways has social problems at one
level. Though the 4 has the capacity
of integrating with others well, inti-
macy is always difficult. For all 4s,

intimacy is difficult. You have to
wait until you go through those
 phases of friendship in order to get
to that point where you can actually
achieve intimacy.
We have romance in this 55th gate.
There‟s a great deal of creative po-
tential in this gate. After all, moodiness is simply another word for the presence of
the muse. So, the reality is this can be deeply creative, particularly with the 16 in
this configuration which is part of the channel of Talent. So there is a potential in
this cross to be able to get out of the anguish of not knowing, that anguish being the
55th gate aspect of the Sleeping Phoenix. With any cross that holds the 55, art and
creativity are a possibility. In most cases, these are just depressive people. They‟re
easily uncomfortable with life. Not knowing for them interferes with their whole
social interaction and they tend to be people who have problems in their sex life.
They tend to be people who have problems finding a reliable partner. It can be very
difficult.
By the way, anybody who lives with a 4/1 has to have a certain kind of uniqueness
to them, because if you have a 4/1 partner and you disagree with them, it isn‟t going
to do you any good to fight with them. It‟s not like you‟re going to change anything.
So you have to be very accepting of what they are in order to be able to embrace
them.
I know many 4/1s; they don‟t have it easy. They‟re really like hermaphrodites—
they‟re not this, they‟re not that. They‟re not Right Angle, they‟re not Left Angle;

they‟re something else. And in this you can see that the potential here, if there is
any potential at all, is to wake up to their creative capacity. Not wake up to die,
because that‟s a Sleeping Phoenix trait, but they can wake up to their creative ca-
pacity, and perhaps through art are able to realize a greater truth. Perhaps great art
can do that.
The Left Angle Cross of Spirit 1  55  9
 59  16
The 5/1
Remember that Left Angle is the publicity of the Right Angle‟s marketing department.
The burden of Right Angle‟s marketing department is placed on the 5/1. This is the
Left Angle Cross of Spirit. This is all about the potential to sell creative spirit. It‟s
basically what it is. There are certain configurations in the wheel that represent the
way in which the program demands
that part of the way we‟re informed
as a species is through what we‟ve
come to call „arts.‟ It‟s one thing for
 me to express concepts in this way,
yet there are other things that can
be learned by just listening to a
piece of Brahms, or standing in

front of a great painting, or whatev-
er the case may be. The way we
are informed as a whole has many
different venues in which we move
down. There is great teaching in

not just receiving in this way, the
presence of art and the importance
 of our lives as another way of com-
municating with us.
Here in this Left Angle aspect, basi-
cally this is about the future much
more than now or the past. It‟s
almost a clarion call in itself to draw people to the spirit of humankind to awaken, if
you will, the spirit of humankind. For many years here on the island when the earth
would go into the 55th in the middle of the summer, they would have an international
drumming festival, this opening up the spirit of humanity.
So, this is a deeply creative configuration. The way in which you get to somebody‟s
spirit can be very different. Almost all of it is based on knowing how to provoke—the
39 on the other side of the 55. This is a very provocative cross. It‟s provocative in
the sense that you are provoked the moment you are instilled with the right spirit,

let‟s put it that way. So, in that sense, this can be deeply creative. But of course,
one of the things that must be so obvious to you is that the moment you‟re talking
about individuality, which carries the creative potential, the mutative potential, and
the moment you make that emotional, then you know you have somebody who be-
gins life with the potential of emotionalized melancholy.
When you‟re dealing with a not-self and a 55th gate that doesn‟t operate with clarity
and is undergoing chemical change, the potential for real artistic development in this
configuration is slim. Rather than getting that, you get a lot of very depressed
people who whine about how depressing life is, that life is a nowhere street and
there‟s nowhere to go. I guarantee you, you meet somebody on the Cross of Spirit
and they‟ll be selling euthanasia, because they don‟t know because they have this
Sleeping Phoenix Sun, regardless that it‟s the Left Angle.
Remember, the gate is changing. The chemistry of that hexagram is changing. And
it impacts not simply the Right Angle, it impacts wherever that 55 is sitting. So,
when you come to the 5/1, you don‟t really know what you‟re going to get. You may
get spirit heresy. Yes, if you don’t want to live, you should have the right to die—
spirit heresy. Good for the spirit of the person who wants to die; it‟s all relative. On
the other hand, you can end up with a very powerful representative as a creative
force with a combination that lies here; this is a real potential for that.
Again, whenever you‟re dealing with the Juxtaposition or the Left Angle, you have to
keep in mind that there are going to be difficulties when it comes to intimacy. But of
course, here you‟re dealing with seduction, you‟re dealing with a 5th line theme, and
you‟re dealing with the fickleness. While the seduction is going on, the fickleness
isn‟t even certain that it knows why it is seducing, let alone whether it wants what it
seduced in the first place.
By the time you‟ve pulled somebody close enough to you that you have contact,
you‟re ready to throw them away because you don‟t know. This is the great gate of
the roots of unrequited love. No problems. And you can fantasize what you like, no
interference, no problems, everything is perfect. It‟s a classic 55 trait.

The 5/2
LAC Spirit 1
One thing that is interesting about 5/2s who have this cross is that they convince
you that spirit exists, even though you don‟t get access to the spirit they have.
When you look at the 2nd line, it has nothing to prove; it wouldn‟t know how. It‟s like
the math teachers who always know you‟re cheating because you get a sophisticated
equation and you just write down the answer. That‟s what a 2 would like to do. It
doesn‟t want to write all the steps of that equation. That‟s proving it; that‟s the 1s
job.
When you have the 5/2 and this heretical, seductive, universalizing Personality, you
have an unconscious that says, “Why should I tell them? I have nothing to prove.

Abundance
What’s the big deal? I have to prove to them that I have spirit or that there is spirit
in the world? No, they can go do that themselves. Find somebody else. Go see a
spiritual teacher.” It‟s typical of the 5/2.
The 2 is always under pressure because there‟s a certain level of fear in them. The
fear is that they don‟t really know anything. Naturals are like that. They‟re not here
to explain it. You get a 2nd line teacher trying to teach you the basics of something
and you have a problem. They can instill in you the beauty of whatever the thing is.
It‟s great to see a natural talent. It‟s wonderful to meet natural talent. It‟s clean,
it‟s pure, it hasn‟t been manipulated, and it‟s just there. That‟s why it‟s so charming
to us. It‟s like the way we love the innocent paintings of our children. They‟re awful,
but they‟re not. I have so many awful pictures in the house. And yet, at the same
time, there is this magic of that innocence. It‟s that natural innocence that‟s so
beautiful.
So, the natural of something is very different. When you take a 5/2 and the 5 knows
that everybody is expecting it to deliver, it doesn‟t want to deliver. Not because it
doesn‟t think that giving it to people would be a good idea or that they need it. It
has nothing to do with that. It‟s the deep fear at the unconscious level that says,
“How am I going to do this? I don’t know how. I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t
know, I don’t know.” This is: I don‟t know. “And if I’m going to try to know and I
don’t know, I’m going to get really upset and I’m emotional and I can spike down
into a deep depression and never get out, so leave me alone.”
There are artists, that the moment they‟re recognized, their careers are over.
They‟re over instantly. That artist who was magic in a room with 25 people, the
moment they‟re discovered, it‟s over, it‟s over. You can smell all that here, and you
get that with the 5/2s. You get that with any 2 who‟s being placed under pressure to
be able to get somebody else to either understand or be able to do what they do or
understand. It‟s impossible.
Yes, you have variations where it can work, like a 2/4. The beauty of the 2/4 is that
what does all the work is the 4. The 2 is a barrier always standing there, “No, no, no
I don’t want to tell you how I did it,” because they don‟t know how they did it.
That‟s why they make great missionaries, because they don‟t have to explain how
they did it. They can just say that God did it. “Jesus came to me; it’s ok now.” And
away they go and they can deliver their goods and influence those people around
them.
But 5/2s with all that paranoia, with all that projection, it‟s like poof, they say, “No I
don’t want to have anything to do with that. Leave it to the 5/1s, they’re the suck-
ers. They’re the ones who have to prove this stuff. They have to prove that there is
spirit, they have to prove that there is great value in art,” and so forth and so on.
These are great cooks. Great natural sexual beings who rarely get to have sex.

The 6/2
LAC Spirit 1
I‟ve never met either a 6/2 or a 6/3, as example, on this cross. One of the things
that is so interesting for me is to get to a point where it‟s possible to begin to meet
many, many variations that are beginning to operate correctly as themselves. After
all, we‟re all keys, in that sense; every single one of these is a key.
If I were to do a positive analysis of the 6/2, here is the potential of really a special
archetype. This can be a truly, deeply, creative role model. Again, this is a configu-
ration that with the 55, with the presence of the 59, with the 16, you basically have
three gates that are deeply connected to the creative process, deeply connected to
the creative process.
So, this is the potential for a very creative expression in life. But again, as much as
it‟s nice to say that this could be an extraordinary, creative role model as a being,
the reality is that for the not-self point of view with this kind of configuration, with
the nature of the emotional system as it is, with the difficulty of individuality in not
knowing, with all of those things added up, with the not-self and the various charac-
teristics that that being will have, chances are they will have periods in their life that
will show that creative potential. But the likelihood is that they have emotional,
sexual, food problems. The likelihood is that they are not healthy, particularly since
they‟re going to go through a 3rd line phase at the beginning of their process.
The 55th gate, whether you‟re looking at it just naturally in somebody‟s design or in
relationship to any kind of cross configuration in which the 55th gate is present, see
that there is this aspect of the Sleeping Phoenix that infects everything the 55 is
associated with, which means that those crosses that carry this attribute, it is more
difficult to break through and it is more difficult to shatter.
The extreme of that is in the Right Angle of the cross itself. But understand that the
presence of the 55th gate brings that quality into somebody‟s nature. That‟s why it‟s
very difficult today to really get a grasp on individual emotionality. It‟s very easy for
us to relate to both tribal and abstract/collective emotionality. But individual emo-
tionally, since the advent of the nine-centered Rave in the 1780‟s, basically it‟s not
an emotional system that operates consistently or in a way that it did prior to that.
The whole individual, emotional process is being affected by the way in which this
55th gate is mutating. It also means that the nature of romance has changed and is
changing radically. If you look at the difference between the way in which romance
works today than what it did prior to the 1780‟s, you will see that there has been an
enormous transformation in the way in which romance operates. The way in which
we mate and bond and all of that, part of that is the direct result of the deterioration
of the chemistry of the 55 and its impact on the 49, which is in charge of marriage
and divorce in our social integration with each other in community.

The 6/3
LAC Spirit 1
When we come to the 6/3, again, the one thing to remember is that they have their
foot on one side of the garden and the other crossing the fence. They‟re always in
some kind of bizarre, balancing act between this side and that side.
When you get to the 37th gate, you get to something very basic. All of this is about
family. In the end, everything about being a species is about family. It is about the
bond that is created in community. Remember when you change the emotional sys-
tem, you change everything that operates out of the emotional system. It will
change the nature of marriage, the nature of bonding with somebody, and you can
see that these changes are already taking place. They have a law in Canada that
says a homosexual relationship is marriage. Twenty years ago that would have been
impossible.
There are enormous differences in the way we look at relationships, at bonds. The
marriage institution has gone through enormous stress over the last 20 or 30 years.
All of this is part of this chemistry and this energy that is out there. So, we‟re going
to have a change that‟s going to take place in the 37. We are now in the last, great
37 sequence. We have been since 1615—the family of man. That‟s the movie of the
37/40, it has done a very, very good job, thank you very much. It brings that into
life.
What you have to see is that the individual in the 55 longs for love, longs for intima-
cy—it‟s in the cross—longs for those things. And yet, that is not something that‟s
easy to find. Yet, the 6/3 stands of the roof of their bachelor pad and looks across
and sees families and sees the love of parents and child and husband, and so forth
and so on. It‟s already looking and saying, “Aha, that’s the way.” If you‟re an indi-
vidual and you‟re attracted to tribal life, you‟re caught between this and that. It‟s a
real this and that.
6/3s on this cross are busy, but they‟re not busy working. They‟re busy being fertile.
The 6/3 on this cross and this profile will be the last human being to be fertile. The
answer to the spirit, the answer to the threat of extinction is to make more. Well, if
we‟re going to die out, there‟s only one thing to do, just make more. If we make
more, we won‟t die out. It‟s simple. Simple math, let‟s make more. This is the
ultimate 59—I‟m ready, I‟m willing, I‟m able, let‟s do it. The only problem with 6/3s
is that they don‟t really know if the person they‟re making love to is really the one
they want to stay with. They end up staying with the children.
It‟s just something to note. There are these oddities—that‟s an oddity—there are
certain profile-cross configurations which really represent a very bizarre archetype.
This is one of them. When you get to the end of the line, this is the end of the fertili-
ty business. This obviously, is an enormously fertile place and has always been.
With the 6/3, there‟s nothing more potentially promiscuous than a 6/3 combination.

In the 59, the 6th line is the one-night stand, the 3 is all about the trial and error,
bonds made and broken. The 6/3 configuration here with the 59 and the 55 pump-
ing away, all you get is they‟re looking to the other hexagram. Hey, that looks good;
I want some.
A 6/3 friend of mine never gives up on the idea that it would really be a good idea to
have children. He‟s going to be saying that when he‟s 90. This is one of those 6/3
things. It could be that, it could be that. And here is the archetype of it. The arche-
type of it, “The hell with all this, I’m going to have a family. I’m going to have child-
ren.” And you get this movement, this transition out of this individual creative tor-
ment of spirit and not knowing, and we go directly into the mundane. You go right
to the heart of the family; you go right into the 37.

Introduction
We come to the 37th gate, to The Family. When you‟re looking at the configuration
here of both the Right Angle and the Left Angle, a definition is formed by the cross
itself. Whenever you have a definition, it becomes the central thematic. There is no
escaping that. Whether the Personality Sun is involved or
not, it becomes the central dynamic because it is bringing a
consistent aspect of that cross into activation in the per-
son‟s life.
So here we‟re dealing in both cases and with the Juxtaposi-
tion, the presence of the 37/40. We are living in the Cross
of Planning cycle. The four arms of this Cross of Planning
cycle, which was initiated in 1615, are the most synthetic
way for you to be able to understand what we have been
going through as a species over the last 400 years. Basi-
cally, what you‟re looking at is the fundamental theme has been community, and is
all about the expansion of community resources.
What is essential to understand about the 40/37 is that it is the thing that makes the
principles work. Ultimately, it is the thing that feeds the wealth of the rulership of
the tribe. Without the 40/37, there is no successful building of communities. It is
what it takes. This is the channel of Community, it is the channel of the bargain, but
more than that, the 37th gate is the mouth and the 40th gate is the stomach. You‟re
dealing with something very basic here. You‟re dealing with the demands of life
itself. There‟s something else as well about this—the presence of the 40/37 themati-
cally over the last 400 years has also changed the nature of our sexuality and the
way in which sexuality operates on the planet.
One of the things to understand about tribal sexuality is that because the tribal bond
is rooted in reproduction, it is only tribal sexuality that is concerned with protection.
Think about that. The 40/37 is there to raise a family, but you don‟t want to have to
keep on having kids until the poor woman is dead, 24 of them, 25 of them, 26 of
them, 27 of them; the insanity of all of that.
Basically, what that means is if you‟re looking for the beginnings of birth control, that
birth control is something that began in the 40/37. It‟s a natural birth control.
Louise said to Harry, “No more; I don’t want any more. We have to stop.” Of
course, for most of our history, stopping could really be a problem. Males are not
good at stopping. So, one of the things about the 40/37 is that it‟s about affection
and cuddling and this is really the channel of foreplay. In other words, it‟s through
the 40/37 that other ways that weren‟t reproductive came about of bringing sexual
pleasure to your partner.
So this is very important to understand about the 40/37 coming into our lives.
Those of us who are part of western civilization are the by-product of that strategy.
We are no longer interested in families of 25. We‟ve worked very hard at finding

The Family
ways in which we can give each other pleasure without becoming pregnant. All of
this has been a development; it‟s part of it. All of that is being carried by this ener-
gy. It‟s the complete opposite of the Kama Sutra, if you can grasp that. It has noth-
ing to do, in the end, with reproduction; it has everything to do with the bargain of
pleasure.
So, if you look at the last 400 years, we have been working very hard to master the
pleasure principle. So much of our achievement in society, wealthy society, western
society, certain other societies—when I say „West‟ I don‟t only mean the West, there
are many places in the East, obviously, that have very high standards of living that
have been able to get to a place in which pleasure is something that is affordable
and available to the lowest common denominator.
You can see how important pleasure is to us. It‟s enormously important. One of the
things to understand about the 40/37 is that part of the bargain is the Ego. The Ego
says, “You want me to work. Ok, but you treat me really nice and you tell me I’m
wonderful. You also give me time off and leave me alone with all this pressure so I
can just enjoy the benefits of my work.” So, the pleasure principle is built into the
community. The community demands that it has its festivals, that it has its parties,
that it has its celebrations. We now demand we have the right to entertainment,
that we have our films and music and this and that. It‟s the pleasure principle.
So, when I talk about the Cross of Planning, I only bring this up to not make it dull,
because the Cross of Planning is also deeply bureaucratic. It‟s as bureaucratic as
you can get. It‟s the way, for example, that the Catholic Church would like you to
protect yourself from becoming pregnant. You have to become the ultimate bureau-
cratic. A thermometer in one hand and a pen in the other, and make sure you write
down all the details and keep the charts and protect yourself at all costs.
The Cross of Planning has brought us all of what we could call the benefits of our
modern life. It has also brought us all the detriments of it, obviously. But this is the
phase we‟re in. Recognize that it‟s coming to an end. We‟re not at the beginning of
this. We‟re not going to the Globe Theater and watching Shakespeare. This process
began 400 years ago. You can see that beginning 400 years ago and in this cycle
the advent of the nine-centered being, that this cycle has been very, very important
to us because this is the cycle that brings us to the door where we can fulfill our
promise. And our promise is to understand. That‟s what we‟re here for.
So, the Cross of Planning has been very successful in many ways. It‟s been able to
organize communities of focus—9th gate. You have in this cross the 40/37, so you
have the community and the demands of the community and the organization of the
bargain of the community and the pleasure principle, and so forth and so on. But
look at the other two arms—the 9th gate, the potential to focus and concentrate, to
be focused and concentrated on the establishment of community. If you extend
community, you get into the nation state; you get into all of the bureaucracies that
go with it, and on and on and on and on.
In other words, what you‟re looking at is that there is deep, deep focus. That focus
also means that the infrastructure that‟s necessary for the community is also some-

thing it‟s focused on. By the time we get into the 1600‟s, we have the beginning of
urban architects who are actually able to design cities that have plumbing. You build
sewer systems and you begin to take the dirt away from people‟s day-to-day lives
and you begin to extend their health.
But more than that, the focus through community allowed us to be able to explore in
ways we‟ve never explored before. It is not a world in which you have a couple of
Galileo‟s floating around, or Copernicus‟ or whatever the case may be. We have
research factories now. We have huge bureaucratic, industrial research factories.
There are more scientists alive today than have ever existed on earth. As a matter
of fact, there are more scientists alive today as a population than all the people who
lived on earth up until the 19th century. We have a lot of scientists. This is a by-
product.
There was a great science fiction written by John Bruner many years ago, maybe 30
years ago. It was about a young boy who had the gift of being able to take people
into his fantasy. It was a great story. There are moments where I‟d love to be able
to take you into my fantasy so you can see this headlong rush towards the truth.
Not only is it a rush towards the truth, but it‟s not a rush in the way you see an ar-
row coming together as a head, it‟s a rush like this. It‟s like a reverse arrowhead
flying out there growing exponentially. The amount of knowledge that we‟re accu-
mulating with every breath that I speak, right now, this moment, is absolutely in-
credible. If you could really just see this movement of the expansion of our know-
ledge relative to the population expansion, relative to the movement over these 400
years, you‟d see what I see, this magical race towards inner truth.
What‟s so fascinating is when you think about this, it is nearly the end of the 61.1.
We‟re in the 1st line phase of this cycle. We‟re in the 61.1. The 61.1 is here for us.
This is the last chance we get to get the truth. We are good; after all, this exponen-
tial movement and all this vast intellectual development, the web as a by-product of
all this, this huge movement outwards. We‟ve gotten very, very close to closing the
door on knowing this and knowing this and knowing this and knowing this, and this is
our job. The window closes 2027; closes.
These people who come in on this cross now, they‟re in their glory; they fit right in,
perfect. This is their time. I know so many of them. You meet a lot of Cross of
Planning people. It‟s an opposition in the wheel. You meet them. There are all
these Cross of Planning people wandering around. The 40/37, like the 43/23 and the
20/34, is very common.
So, the Cross of Planning part of our planning is to plan for the end, to plan for a
new beginning, to plan for what‟s going to happen. We have an enormous number
of people on this planet who make a living planning for disaster, people who plan for
what‟s going to happen when a hurricane comes, or an earthquake comes. We have
all kinds of planning for disaster as much as we have planning for no disaster; it‟s all
there. And we‟re very talented at it. This has been the era of skills—16th gate. Four
hundred years of the development of skills. It‟s coming to an end.

It‟s like those odd, science fiction movies where some deconditioned, bombed-back-
to-the-Stone Age yo-yo, after 400 generations, finds some piece of 20th century
technology. We all live in a world that truly we don‟t know. Most people don‟t even
know how the electricity comes on and why. And their whole lives depend on it and
they have no idea. What do you think is going to happen when the lights get turned
off? What do you think happens when the intellectual grasp of things is no longer a
universal motive? It‟s very different.
We have no idea how most of the things work. If all of the computer technicians die,
I hope I didn‟t buy a lemon. What am I going to do with this box? Get out my knife
and my scissors? What am I going to do? It‟s one of the things about the nature of
what this cycle has done to us. It has given us a world where we truly do not under-
stand or control. We don‟t know how it all works, and we‟re totally dependent on it.
It‟s very funny. Well, I guess it‟s only funny to me.

If you‟re a 1/3 on the Cross of Plan-
ning, the plan is very important to
you, but all plans mess up in the

end. This is basically the essential
value of the 1/3. The 1/3, if it‟s
correct, if it understands its own
basic principles, the 1/3 is here to 
show us what plans don‟t work and
to be able to take that out of the
recipe mix so other people don‟t get
lost going down that road. Again, 
this is the essential aspect of the
1/3. Because they‟re so personal,
because it‟s all lower trigram, be-

cause of the personal destiny, be-
cause of the pessimism, because of
the nature of the not-self, they tend
to suffer rather than see the advan-
tages. They tend to accuse them-
selves of failure rather than seeing that the plan was the thing that was the failure,
rather than seeing that the plan needs to be adjusted or destroyed one way or
another.

Like all of the descriptions between the not-self and the true self, it‟s really a radial
difference. When you‟re dealing with a 1/3 on the Cross of Planning who really
knows what‟s going on, they‟re of enormous value. They‟re going to be able to tell
you that this is a waste of energy because this is no longer talking about the person-
al waste of energy, it‟s talking about communal waste of energy and that the re-
sources of the community are being wasted. This is their capacity.

The 1/4
RAC Planning 1
When you‟re dealing with a 1/4, whenever you‟re dealing with the tribe and you‟re
dealing with 4th line, you have to recognize that these are the strongest advocates of
the tribe even when they see the tribe is a problem. Everybody who carries a 4th line
needs the close circle in order to be able to succeed, needs to have their connections
with community. Otherwise, their potential is deeply limited. The tribe is a natural
environment for 4th line beings. To have a 4th line in a tribal circuit is where it‟s
going to resonate because the quality that is so satisfying to the 4 is that opportuni-
ties will arise out of that tribal mix.
When you‟re dealing with the 1/4 child, if it not raised any differently, it will simply
accept whatever the plan is. It‟ll simply accept it and it will propagandize it out of its
unconscious. In other words, it will try to influence others into seeing that this is the
plan and stay with the plan. So this is the child who‟s yelling at the other child to get
back into line because that‟s not the plan. Keep with the plan, don‟t change the
plan. Also, children get nervous when you‟re going to change the plan. Nothing
makes the 1/4 or 4/1 more nervous than the fact that you‟re deciding to move. It‟s
like, “Oh, my God, absolutely everything is going to change.”
For children who have a 4th line in their profile, to move anywhere can be very
threatening to them. One of the things you have to do if you‟re moving and dealing
with a 4th line child is to really make sure that you make an effort when you land to
immediately bring them into contact with some kind of milieu, with some kind of
community so they can have a sense of place.
Remember, they need to be introduced to people. One of the most important things
in respecting the 4th line nature is to make sure that if you introduce a 4th line per-
son, if you have somebody with you who‟s a stranger to them, that you make an
effort to introduce them. If you don‟t introduce them, they‟re never going to make a
connection with that person. Again, this is going back to the nature of the 4th line.
So, when you‟re dealing with the 1/4, this whole business of the bargain and the
community, the 1/4 has taken the line, “This is the deal and I’m going to do my
work.” They can be deeply disappointed in life seeing that others don‟t take their
responsibility as well.

The 2/4
RAC Planning 1
With the 2/4 on the Cross of Planning, you‟re dealing with the ultimate tribal person.
You‟re dealing with somebody who loves being within the tribe. The 4th line uncons-
cious, but more than that, you‟re dealing with a 2nd line hermit Personality. Being a
hermit doesn‟t mean you have to hide behind the doors of your cave. It means you
can hide behind the gates of the village. In other words, the whole thing for the
hermit is that they‟re in a safe, protected environment. Remember that the tribe is
nothing more than the extension of your family. There‟s nothing a 2/4 likes better
than their family because their family is their resource. Remember, the 2/4 wants to
keep the house. They want to stay in the village. They don‟t want to leave the
community.
If you ask any 4 if they want to go somewhere, no matter what the answer, the truth
is “no.” The truth is, “I’m safe here; I have my contacts here, I’m secure now. I
don’t want to go because if I go, what am I going to do? I’m really lost.” So for the
2/4 it‟s very important for them to have that security. Remember, if you‟re a 2/4,
you can only be a hermit in a community. You can‟t be a hermit in the wilderness.
A 2/5 can do that; not a 2/4. A 2/4 has to be a hermit within something—within the
community, within the circle, within the access.
The other thing is that a 2/4 is always the potential missionary. The 2/4 can receive
the call and in receiving the call, they can begin their process of externalizing. These
are the ones who can help implement the plan. These are the ones who can get
things going. But you have to arouse them to get it going.

The 2/5
RAC Planning 1
The 2/5, as always, is another story. There is a real burden on these crosses. Any-
one who carries the 40/37 knows this, that the moment you carry the 40/37 you are
stuck with communities in your life, and their needs and their demands and their
concerns. The moment they meet your aura, they think you are there to support
them because that is the nature of tribal circuitry; its keynote is support. They‟re
looking for, expecting support. There is a real burden here.
Because we are living in this age, we live in the age of the contract; we live in the
age of the bargain. We are living in the age of the prenuptial agreement. We live in
the age of lawyers. We live in the age in which all of the bargains are laid out there,
whether they‟re social bargains or romantic bargains. So, there is an enormous
pressure on these beings who carry this cross to continue this process of maintaining
and evolving community.

It doesn‟t matter whether the communities are new or not. When I first started
doing charts in Ibiza, a lot of my friends were sannyasins, followers of Osho. I kept
on seeing this 40/37. It was like a plague. There were all these 40/37‟s and here
was this new kind of community, and here was this new bargain. But it was still the
same thematic. If you look at the way in which that evolved, you can see it evolved
the same way—the building of a village, an ashram; the building of the structure, all
of those things you get with this phase of our development.
So, when you‟re looking at 40/37s, they‟re all carrying this built-in responsibility in
this time because it‟s in resonance to the cycle we‟re in that they‟re responsible, that
they have to help build and maintain the communities, that it‟s part of their bargain
with life. And they do; and it is. It‟s just a matter of whether it is correct or not.
The 2/5 does not have a natural taste for the community; it‟s not a 2/4. It can have
a heretical separation from the bargain. It can reject the plan. It can refuse to par-
ticipate in the plan. We need anti-planners. For every neutrino we need an anti-
neutrino. It‟s the nature of the business. We need these polarities. However, one
of the things about 2/5s and 5/2s is that they could be the answer. They‟re always
like that. They always carry within them the potential that they can be called to
universalize, that they can bring a great heretical, practical truth into the world. It‟s
always possible, always.
So it doesn‟t mean that it‟s a lost cause, or whatever. But one of the things to rec-
ognize about the 2/5 and the 5/2 is that there is this deep reticence because of the
way in which they relate with people. That other people make life difficult for them.
That they feel the expectation projection field. That they had been punished for
disappointment from the moment they came into the world. So, they are not excited
about it.
More than that, the recognition that when you‟re dealing with a 2nd line, you‟re deal-
ing with the natural; they have nothing to prove. The gift of the 1/3 is the potential
when you find a plan that doesn‟t work that through your 1 capacity, you can prove
why it doesn‟t work. That gives the 1/3 its enormous value as a potential. But if
you‟re a 2/5 and you have the answer, you can‟t explain to anybody how you got
there. You don‟t know how you know the answer, in that sense. And more than
that, you‟re quite concerned about the fact whether you can even explain what you
know as an answer to others. You can often see that as a teacher of children in a
classroom where a child will anxiously put up its hand when, in fact, it doesn‟t know.
But again, as not-self, certain profiles are going to be more difficult than others. It‟s
just simply true. The reality is that if you are going to be a 2/5 on the Cross of Plan-
ning, there are very few plans that you‟re going to live by in your life, and there are
very few plans that you‟re ever going to offer to anybody else. And you‟re going to
be very wary of any bargain that you will ever make because you‟re going to be
basically paranoid about the outcome of that bargain.

This leads to the dilemma of the 40/37 and the fact that the bargain is emotional.
It‟s one of the things I‟ve noticed in my dealings—I‟m a 40, I don‟t have the 37—with
40/37‟s over the years. When you establish a bargain with a 40/37, there is no cer-
tainty that the bargain is perceived later in the way in which it was achieved at first
because the emotional system moves and the perception of the arrangement moves.
Everything about a bargain isn‟t about what the bargain is, but is about the spirit of
the bargain involved. And the spirit of the bargain is the nature of loyalty.
Everything about 40/37‟s is that the most important thing for them is loyalty. Loyal-
ty can be translated into many things—into fairness, into respect, into genuine affec-
tion and all of these other things that are possible in the 40/37. But it can be very,
very confusing for people who do not have these aspects to deal with 40/37‟s and
their bargains, because their bargains are emotional. The not-self emotional bar-
gain-maker is going to make a bargain about a plan that may not, in fact, turn out to
be the way it was intended to be in the first place.
I‟ve had situations of having clear bargains, at least from my perspective, with
40/37‟s only to discover that they claim that was not what they thought the bargain
was. There is nothing you can do about that. It is the emotional system, and the
emotional system moves. One of my things about the Cross of Planning is the rec-
ognition that planning over time is the true self version. It is about time, it is about
the respect of the emotional system. This is not a question of whether somebody on
this cross is emotional or not; everybody on this cross is emotional. And they‟re Ego
emotional.
If you meet somebody with a defined Ego and you ask them how they are, they will
tell you they‟re fine. It doesn‟t matter how they are, they‟ll just tell you they‟re fine.
And when you have an emotional Ego that‟s controlling the plan and the bargain, this
is the last, great emotional stage. We‟ve had 400 years of emotions, 400 years of
bargains that break. Whether those bargains are between countries—you know how
many treaties have been broken in the last 400 years between nations, let alone the
minor, mundane bargains. The reality is that as much as planning has brought us
what we call progress, it has also brought us a great deal of misunderstanding.
Sometimes 2/5s just won‟t clear it up. They just withdraw because it‟s not worth the
trouble.

The 3/5
RAC Planning 1
The 3/5 on the Cross of Planning, you could basically just sort of think of them as
politicians. If you think of them as a politician, what you get is, “We have this great
plan, vote for me.” When they get into power and they try to actualize that great
plan, every politician breaks their bargain with the people. We all know that. We
know it so well that we don‟t blame them. We just put it as part of their character.
This is humanity understanding the vagaries of the emotional bargain. Just because
they promise you a chicken in every pot, doesn‟t mean you get one.

We have gotten to the point where we‟re more interested in whether they can
present a plan than they can fulfill one. I love this, in the United States now they
have the build up to the next president election. It seems in America they‟re always
voting, but anyway, they have this run up and they have 85,000 democrats who are
lined up. The one thing that matters is can you present a plan. It doesn‟t matter
whether you‟ll ever be able to actualize that plan. As a matter of fact, in most cases
nobody cares. What they really care about is, “Do you know how to plan?” This is
the key. And all these politicians stand up there and say, “If you vote for me, this is
the plan.”
Anyway, 3/5 on the Cross of Planning says, “Hey, great plan,” and you go for it.
They seduce you. This is one of those classic examples—this is so tribal. “This plan
is for you. I care about you. I want your support; I’ll give you my support. This
plan is going to change your life,” and blah, blah, blah. And we all know what hap-
pens to 3/5s and their plan. The only reason anyone went along with your cock-
amamie idea was that you seduced them. They thought you were going to be the
best plan-maker ever. And it was going to be the best plan ever and they were
going to get wonderful things out of their bargain. It‟s like these people who sell you
some kind of an investment and the plan is that you‟re going to make 800% an hour.
And everything you gave these people, they spend on their next car. It‟s like, well, it
didn‟t work.
People get fooled all the time. It‟s so easy to get fooled by a natural planner. When
you meet somebody, you meet their cross; it‟s there. Somewhere inside of you
when you meet a planner, there‟s an assumption that they can come up with a good
bargain, they can be talented, they can be focused, this is going to be productive, it‟s
going to feed us. It‟s just natural to feel that. And then you have a 5th line uncons-
cious and it‟s like, “Oh, this one really knows.” Then that 3rd line Personality just
goes like this to your face.
Just like anything else, the magic of being awake and being a 3/5 planner is the
ability to universalize where not to go, what bargains not to make, what plans not to
make. As I said the other day, they make great researchers and scientists because
they‟re the ones, when they find something out, they tell everybody. The worst
thing is to find out that something doesn‟t work and you tell no one. For me, that‟s a
crime.
You find out that doing something is going to make somebody sick. It‟s like people
who buy over-the-counter medicine that‟s supposed to be safe and they have a reac-
tion to it. The chances are that nobody is really going to find out about that unless
there are a lot of people who drop dead from it. You do that to a 3/5 and they will
call the medical association. They will make trouble because this is awake.
The most incredible capacity about the 3/5—remember, everybody is conditioned to
only look for what works, which is why it‟s so messy. The reality is that a huge
chunk of humanity, literally half, in that sense, if you take the four 3rd line profiles
and you take the 6th line profiles that are separate from those that work in a 3rd line
phase, half of all profiles carry this 3rd line dynamic, and it‟s correct. In that sense,

half of us are here to try to figure out what works and half of us are here to try to
figure what doesn‟t work, and together we can be very efficient. That‟s the story.
And yet, all of those who are here to find out what doesn‟t work, instead of making
that contribution—and I‟m not saying all of them don‟t; obviously they do. If you
look at any complainer and you look at any website that‟s protecting consumers, you
look at any of these international bitching sites, you have 3rd line people in there
because they‟re the ones who find out. When you have 3rd line connected with 4th
line, then a community finds out. When you have it connected with 5th line, then it‟s
possible for strangers to find out.
So, the 3/5 carries this potential. But again, as we know, if the 5th line fails, its rep-
utation fails, it gets punished, it gets abused, and it runs away. So it never really
gets that chance. They get voted out of power. The people lose their attraction to
them. And none of that is comfortable. There‟s nothing worse in the tribe than los-
ing the support of the tribe. If you‟re a tribal person and you‟re ostracized or alie-
nated from the tribe, there‟s no greater punishment.

The 3/6
RAC Planning 1
These are people who have a plan every moment. There‟s always a plan. These are
people who invented contingency plans. If the normal 3rd line being has a more than
a passing relationship to chaos and failure, a 3/6 has an enormously connected rela-
tionship to failure and chaos; they just do. When you have a 3/6 on the Cross of
Planning, you‟re going to have not only a lot of chaos within the planning—planning
to do this and it doesn‟t work, and planning to do that and it doesn‟t work—but also
people who have real problems with the tribe itself.
They tend to see the tribe as the cause of most of the problems, that it‟s because of
the bargains that it doesn‟t work. They tend to get focused on the bargain as being
the place where it doesn‟t work if the bargains aren‟t right. In the political context,
as a metaphor, these are people who aren‟t interested in governance; these are
people who are interested in constitutions. They‟re interested in the letter of the law
rather than how to control people in an environment. They‟re much more interested
in, “There’s something wrong with the law.”
Remember that 3s get punished for their failure. They‟re the ones who can recog-
nize when something that is a plan, that some way in which the tribe is brought
together in an effort, they can recognize right away whether or not there is a prob-
lem with that. Yet, they may not be able to get out of the bargain. They‟re bargain
people; they get caught in the bargain.
One of the things about 3/6s is that in the modern world, the people who have the
most problems with contracts are 3/6s and 6/3s. They have enormous problems
with contracts. They‟re the kind of person where to actually sign a contract is a
long-term process. It has to be viewed from many different angles, from many dif-

ferent eyes, because the reality is that it‟s so easy for them to make a mistake, and
then to blame the contract. I can‟t tell you how many lawyers are supported by that
combination. “I want to reinterpret the contract now.” “Well, you can‟t, you signed
it already. “Yes, but it’s not fair. It’s not right. I didn’t think it was going to be like
this,” and on and on and on. This is a 3/6 phenomena.
The value of all of this is that when you look at the 6th line being, that transcendence
beyond the bargain is what it‟s all about. You have the subject problem with the
bargain going in; you have the objective problem of the bargain for others when
you‟re on the roof. But ultimately, it‟s the transcendence of the bargain. It‟s not
about what the deal is. Because when you get to this—this is why we‟re living in an
age where there is also a potential for great occult knowledge. This is not a bargain
we have with God. This is not a deal. I‟m not Job saying, “Hey, wait a minute it‟s
not fair. I thought that if I prayed and was good you‟d treat me nice.”
One of the things to understand about all our faiths is that they‟re bargain-based.
That‟s pretty close to bargain basement. They‟re bargain-based. It‟s all a bargain.
“If you‟re good, you will get this, you will get that.” It‟s all a bargain. The religious
glue that holds the tribe together, one of the basic demands for resources, the basic
principles that hold the tribe together, is its faith. Yet, the 40/37 is the mystical
bridge in mystical circuitry. This is where the sheep are that are waiting to be lead.
There is no sense in planning unless you have those who will follow the plan. One of
the most dangerous things about the unawake 40/37 is that they are easily sheep
simply being led to the slaughter and going along with it because that‟s the bargain.
And for all of us to recognize that this is the end of the bargain, the deal. We are not
chosen. We are not the chosen ones. We are not; that‟s not in the deal.
It is not guaranteed that we will wake up. It‟s not in the deal. It‟s not guaranteed
that we will even have a chance to know anything. It‟s not in the deal. There is no
contract. And we have no contract with God. It‟s all a lie. Hey, that‟s heavy stuff.
If you don‟t bow down four times a day, oh, God is going to punish you. This is part
of the bargain. Whenever you‟re dealing with 40/37‟s and you think you‟re only
dealing with this mundane bargain, hey, forget that. Underneath that mundane
bargain is this spiritual, judgmental, contractual business. It‟s always there.
3/6s, like 6/3s, will challenge the spirituality and the godliness of the bargain. And
they get into trouble within the tribe. Here you have what you might call secular
movement within the tribal process. Remember that the tribe has two ways to go.
When the tribe gets into the Ego, it can follow the 21/45 and live out the material
completion of the tribe as a whole. Or it can leave behind its tribal bond and go into
the 51/25 and be transformed as an individual. So, that potential in the bargain is to
also be able to break with the spirituality of the tribe. Here we come to the crux of
the emotional bargain: The emotional bargain can always be broken and all bargains
are emotional. So there is Moses, “I have this emotional contract for you. Thou
shalt not (sound)”—broken. This is the emotional bargain.
Something for us to really grasp is that hidden in this age of planning that‟s given us
all of our fast-paced, incredible technologies, well-being, blah, blah, blah, within all

of that is the dissolving of faith. It‟s also part of the plan. One of the things to rec-
ognize is that world religions as a whole—and I‟m not talking about aspects that
make that look untrue like the rise of fundamentalism—have taken a beating over
the last 400 years. The advent of modern science, all of those things, our ability to
penetrate into many things, it‟s very difficult to take the Old Testament and say,
“This is the truth now; the world started 5,420 years ago.” Well, yeah.
I love those fundamentalist Christians in the South in the States who claim that God
left dinosaur bones in order to test the faith of man. Isn‟t that wonderful? It was all
created 5,000 years ago, including the buried dinosaur bones. They‟re only there to
test your faith. That‟s all. Human beings, aren‟t they wonderful with what they do
with the bargain?
So, there is built into the fact that the bargain is never clear, that the bargain can
always be broken. That‟s what we get out of this vast Cross of Planning. If you
have a rigid plan, you have those who live by the plan and those who die by the
plan, and that‟s it. Those who die by the plan have no room. There‟s no room for
them within the plan.
But the moment you can break the bargain, the moment the bargain is emotional
and designed to be able to break, you can break it. So, all of a sudden a tribal group
within a larger plan moves out on its own. They break with the bond to live out their
own bond, and you‟ve seen this in every single religion on the planet. But that‟s
what happens. There‟s nothing you can do with it.
So, one of the things we have to accept about the nature of this planning is not to
see it as being rigid, which means at the personal level you have to be aware of what
you‟re dealing with when you‟re dealing with these people. The bargain that they
make with you is not rigid; it can easily crumple on the ground either way for them
or for you. You never really know what the rules are. Isn‟t it awful to play games
when you don‟t know the rules? It‟s awful. That‟s a 40/37. Here‟s this game; no
rules. “What do you mean no rules?” There are no rules. “But how do I know I
have a bargain?” That‟s the point. “Either you trust that I will support you emotion-
ally in this or not.” Ah, those bargains.

The 4/6

Remember that 4s need the tribe. So if you have a 4 in a tribal circuit, your tenden-
cy is to really go for whatever that tribe can be for you. 4/6s are very good at being
observers of how people get fucked up by the bargain. They‟re great at that. This is
the perfect place for the marriage counselor, this kind of thing. The 4/6 on this
cross—oh, I‟ve seen it all. Not only that, if you think going in that they are only
going to charge you 20 euros and their secretary gives you a bill for 62, there‟s
something in the bargain that just isn‟t quite right. But nonetheless, they‟ll help you
out about how your bargain broke down. They‟re great at that.

One of the advantages, the value of the 3rd line, is if you have a 4/6 in the 4/3 phase
in the beginning of their life and they know that making mistakes is healthy for them
and good for them because they learn things, they‟re going to be incredible in being
able to show you how the bargains aren‟t structured properly. Now, that‟s great if
you‟re going to be a lawyer, and so forth. But there are many other things that that
can be applied to at the most mundane level.
The bargains that are reached within a community are rarely, truly understood by
everyone in the community. It‟s like when human beings vote in so-called modern
democracies. It‟s not like they‟re really aware of the issues. Yes, you have a minori-
ty in the population that is issue-oriented and concerned about certain issues, but in
the end, it becomes an emotional bargain program. People vote with their feelings.
They don‟t really vote with their heads.
Arnie yesterday [Arnold Schwarzenegger]—here‟s a guy, who if he weren‟t a famous
actor would have probably been given a criminal sex record for sexual harassment,
fondling women who didn‟t want it, and so on. Forty-seven percent of the women
who voted yesterday in California voted for him [October 2003]. They didn‟t care
about the details in that bargain. It‟s so interesting about human beings. And the
expectation is that he‟s going to be a good Governor. That‟s what they expect in
their bargain.
If you‟re a 4/6 on this cross, there are real advantages for you. Remember the story
of the 6th line being, the fool on the hill, the 19.6, somebody who is always going to
be a focus point for the concerns of the community. This is somebody who may be
able to solve their problems; this is somebody who has an overview; this somebody
who is separate from them, aloof from them. And because of that aloofness, they
can be the wise one who can look and see how things work.
4/6s within this configuration—because this is the end of planning, it‟s a Right Angle
phase—are really the keys in that sense to the success of the planning process be-
cause they really are the ones who can be, to a certain extent given the center
phase of their life, very objective about whether the plans or bargains are working or
not. And obviously for us in this phase, it is very important.
One of the most difficult things to do, for example in modern science, is to cut off
somebody‟s funding. You have a scientific group and they‟re involved in doing re-
search in a certain area and somebody says, “This is a lousy bargain because what
they’re doing is not going to profitable or productive and they’re going down the
wrong lane.” To cut off that funding and end that bargain and people‟s livelihoods
and everything else, one of the things to understand is that we do not need wasted
energy in the last moments of this cycle.
Since the beginning of the 1960s, we‟ve been a 1st line phase. We know that 1st
lines are foundations. We know this is the place to investigate, so this is the best
time for us to find out what patterns work and don‟t work. For me, the fall of com-
munism is not about anything other than this is the time in which we get to see that
human bargains don‟t work, and slowly but surely, human bargains that don‟t work
will break down.

One of the reasons for the success of the fundamentalism in Islam is that because of
the fact that most of those countries have been run by kleptocracies in which you
have rulers who do nothing but enrich themselves. Most of the underclass in third
world Islamic countries are fed and looked after in a social network that‟s run by
fundamentalists.
This is a basic tribal rule. If you have somebody who‟s looking after you, you give
them your support. They‟re the only ones who are really feeding these people;
they‟re the only ones who are really giving them what they hope for in the bargain,
and because of that, that‟s what they support. It‟s not necessarily they support
either the religious extremism or the ideology; they support the fact that it‟s a feel-
good. They give me food to eat; they look after my family, and so on.
What we have to see is that the 4/6 brings, as a thematic for all that we‟ve been
looking at on this cross, the possibility of refinement and recognition of what doesn‟t
work. Remember, their 3rd line phase as they begin their process as a bargain for
the development of community. We have seen that democracy is failing. That ex-
ample yesterday in California for me is the end of American democracy. It‟s clear to
me that even the concept of democracy is an enormous problem in America. No
matter what this man may have been as a politician, the reality is the moment
somebody with money can have somebody who is elected by the people thrown out
of office, all of sudden you don‟t have a democracy any more. You really don‟t.
That‟s not a knock on America. This is just about understanding the symptoms of
our times, about seeing that all of these institutions and plans about how we‟re going
to be able to live together are breaking down. The idea that we can live together in
cities was great when a city was never bigger than 40,000 people. But by the time
you got to one million, two million and now 25 and 30 million, what are you going to
do?
Our systems of the way we involved people in the way communities operate, all of
that is under pressure. It‟s why we have so many utopian movements. It‟s why
since 1960 how many ashrams and all of these things have sprung up all over the
world, experimental communities, retreats where people are trying to live the old
way, along with people like Osama [bin Laden] who is 12th century retro who likes
living in caves in Afghanistan, a rich boy gone native which is exactly what he was.
I understand that is in the air. When you get to the end of a cycle, in the beginning
of the 1600s everything was about, wow, this is great. Can you image what it‟s like
when you finally built the first institutionalized school for your children—babysitting
services. A whole change in society, give your children away to get trained in an
institution. We had all this excitement about progress in the state and all of this
stuff has been moving forward. And now it‟s coming to the other side of the cycle.
Now the whole thing is beginning to close down.

begin to see that planning is quite something, that we can plan to be the devil‟s in-
carnate and we‟ve lived that all out.
That‟s not a moral thing for me; I don‟t care one way or another. It‟s just that the
reality of this Cycle of Planning and building of institutions can also lead to an
enormous coldness. It can lead to institutionalized genocide, and it can lead to insti-
tutionalized warfare. You can have someone like Bush who goes to war that has
nothing to do with the people‟s needs and the people‟s desires and the people‟s con-
cerns. Institutions take over.
One of the things you really have to see about the Cross of Planning—yes it‟s been
very interesting, thank you very much, and it‟s been very nice—but it‟s coming to an
end. All it has done is given us the opportunity to sit here in this environment and
have some answers because that‟s what it‟s really all about. To get to the truth, to
find out how everything works, because it‟s your last chance. After 2027, it‟s word
of mouth. There is no first-hand evidence. I hope my DVD‟s will still function in
machines, that there are still idiots who know how to make them, know how to plug
them in and know how to use them.
You can see how all of it is coming to an end; we have no place to go. Everything
about the development of the plan was that the only way the plan could really work
is that you start to plan in a new place. America, for example, was a place that was
discovered by religious fanatics who were basically trying to set up ashrams, because
that‟s what they wanted. They didn‟t fit in their home society so they went out into
the world and they migrated.
The whole thing about the Cross of Migration, this is what it‟s all about. It‟s that
wonderful scene in the first Matrix where Agent Smith, the bad guy, is interrogating
the good guy and he says to the good guy, “I finally figured out what human beings
are; they‟re a virus. Wherever you go you settle in, you take everything you can,
you take all the resources and then you move on.” Well, yes, that‟s true. You can
see it right here because the Cross of Migration is, “Hey, wait a minute; I don’t like
the plan here.” Remember, the emotional bargain can always break down. There is
always some 3rd line creature who says, “Hey, this doesn‟t work.” And there‟s al-
ways another valley. Well, sort of.
You can really see we‟ve come to the end. The fantasy will keep on being able to
migrate because we‟re going to go to Mars or Zevon, or whatever. We can‟t even
put somebody in space without their bones falling apart for a couple of months.
Have you ever seen these guys when they come back from space? They‟re carried
around like my grandmother. They can‟t even walk. It‟s not like we‟re going to go
living out there, this whole myth that this is the last migration.
No, there‟s no place to go. Oh, are we in trouble. You can really see this is the end.
Where are you going to go? Now we go to places we‟ve already been. We have no
place to go. One of the biggest and most productive industries in the world is offer-
ing people places to go they haven‟t been to so they have a sense of they‟re still
migrating; Ibiza—2½ million people a year. Come over here, migrate.

There‟s no place to go and it‟s getting worse. It‟s like Jacques Tati movie, there‟s the
same McDonald‟s over there that is over here. And you land in the airport and the
airport looks exactly the same as the airport you left and you wonder if you really
went anywhere. It all looks the same, it all smells the same. I‟d like to have clips of
all the anti-globalization people fighting globalization people because this is the
whole world we‟re living in. You can see the whole thing is falling apart. Anti-
globalization people are the people who are taking energy from the fact that the plan
is breaking down and there is nowhere to go.
In the old days, the poor had somewhere to go. When the famine nearly destroyed
the Irish, they got on boat and went to America; they became politicians. They had
somewhere to go. Now, you have nowhere to go because if you‟re some poor bas-
tard down there across the sea and you try to come across on a boat, there are not
people waiting for you with open arms saying, “Hey, come on.” The borders are
closing; there‟s no place to go. There‟s no real wilderness anymore. There is no
pioneering any more. It‟s over; it‟s over.
One of the things about people on the Cross of Migration is that there‟s a part of
them that knows it‟s over. But it‟s always people who are always on the move. And
these are people who migrate with communities, or to communities. It‟s not like
they migrate on their own. This is the kind of person where their best friend moves
to another city, they move. It‟s an unspoken kind of, all right, this is where the flow
is going. It‟s almost a herding phenomenon.

The 5/1
LAC Migration 1
When you get to the 5/1, you get to the clarion of migration, “Hey, come on let’s
go.” Now it‟s the tourist business. It‟s one of my great jokes about Spain. I love
Spain. Spain fell behind all of its great European neighbors by finding gold in South
America. They brought back all this gold. They were rich and they didn‟t have to
develop infrastructures so they didn‟t have a great industry that developed. It all
came late. They were way behind England and its industrial revolution, or France or
Germany or whatever.
But the joke now is that people come here and give money to Spain for its sun and
its beaches. And they‟re so good at being, “Hey, come over here and migrate. I’m a
migrant here. I know the movie. I know what it’s like when you have to leave your
valley and go to the next valley.” One of the biggest industries in the world is tour-
ism. Right here, Cross of Migration, keep on moving. Of course 5/1s are great at
that except if you have a 5/1 travel agent on this cross, if you think you‟re going to
have the best vacation you‟ve ever had, beware. Bargains always break down.
Fives are very seductive and can be blamed for things very easily.

The 5/2
LAC Migration 1
If you‟re a 5/2, your migration is very interesting. Your migration is inward. These
are the kind of people who want to retire early. These are the kind of people who
take advantage of the modern technology where they can do their job in isolation.
They‟re the ones who migrate into an inner world. These are people who can be lost
in books, in film, in all kinds of things that take them into an inner world in which
they don‟t have to deal with the pressure of the outer world.
If you‟re a 5/2 on this cross, everybody expected you know where to go, that you
know where to take them. You do something and somebody follows you and you get
blamed because it doesn‟t work for them. But we‟re dealing with huge themes here
with the Sun in the 37th gate because these are themes we are leaving behind and
you really have to see how important it is. The bargain is breaking down. There is
no more place for us to migrate.
These are very powerful themes to grasp that are working on the larger level, that
are going to manifest in the individual and microcosm; it‟s there. So they‟re going to
have trouble because the bargain seems to be breaking down around them, and
they‟re going to feel like there is nowhere to go and desperately seek out somewhere
to go.

The 6/2
LAC Migration 1
When you get to the 6/2, you get to the potential of the role model example of what
migration really is. Migration is something that is here to be called and you can only
be correct in that migration if it is called. Now, of course this is a 6 theme. Whether
they‟re called to movement in the outer world or whether they‟re called to movement
to the inner world isn‟t the point. The point is that for them, that‟s the essence of it,
and to be open to that call. It‟s very difficult for 6s, particularly when they‟re on the
roof, because at their objective point they have a certain kind stubbornness, if you
will, to their perspective. It can often be difficult for them to see that it‟s time to
move on.
When you think about migration and trying to explain it to others within the context
now, rather than the larger global context, it‟s really about this moving on. Are you
ready to move on to the next job? Are you ready to move on to the next partner?
Are you ready to move on to the next city? It‟s always about that kind of move-
ment. All of those moments require the breaking of the bargain. It‟s like people on
this cross can‟t afford to sign a lease that doesn‟t give them an out. If I give you a
month‟s notice, I can leave. If they don‟t have an out, they‟re in trouble because

sooner or later, these are people who deal with those situations where it‟s time to
move on and they‟re trapped by the bargain.
So, you also have people in their 3/2 phase who can really get trapped into bargains
that are so unhealthy. I have met people in marriages—this cross, this profile—who
really got trapped very young. And they‟ve always wanted to move on and they
have not been able to, trapped in their bargain. Of course, those traps are more
than a piece of paper, as we well know, however that works on the not-self, the
characteristics, whatever. But it‟s a thematic that‟s there.
The role model immigrant, the role model migratory, is somebody who leads by ex-
ample. If you‟re standing in the forest at the beginning of the season and there are
no does wandering around that are open to be fertilized by males, you know that
there are not going to be good hunting grounds there and you‟d better move on. In
other words, the bargain can breakdown naturally. It doesn‟t have to be artificial.
In other words, circumstances; and the role model is able to respond to the call and
move on when it‟s correct without that being a question of, “Am I breaking the bar-
gain or not.” If you‟re absolutely correct as a 6/2, your moment of needing to move
on is the moment the bargain doesn‟t matter anymore, anyway. And as an example,
you will show the invalidity of that bargain to the other. Whether they like it or not
depends on their awareness.

The 6/3
LAC Migration 1
When we get to the 6/3, we‟re looking at transition. One of the things to recognize
about the breaking down of the bargain and the family and that whole community
not having any other place to go any more is that all of this coming to an end is what
brings us to doubts. It brings us to larger questions.
There are three gates that bring us the questions: The 63, the 61, the 64—the three
Head Center gates. These are gates that have a question. When you get to the 63rd
gate, because of how we understand the nature of logic, the
recognition that logic is the backbone of life, the logical ques-
tion that arises in the 63 is a question that must be answered.
Both the 63 and the 64 ask questions that must be answered;
must be answered. Remember, it‟s collective—there‟s nothing
new under the sun. There is an answer. It‟s either in the logi-
cal pattern or it‟s in the abstract experience, but there is an
answer.
If you‟re dealing with the shadiness of an emotional Ego bar-
gain, and the emotional Ego bargain is breaking down all around you, what you want
is certainty. What you want is an answer to the larger question. Well, if this isn’t
what it’s about, what is it about? And obviously the 6/3, it‟s all going to fall apart.

The Family
They‟re going to live that out. They‟re going to know that the bargains don‟t work
and the trouble they get into when they have to break their bargains.
The reality is if they think that if they move on, things will be better. And it turns
out it‟s just worse. Only a 6/3, a natural migrating 6/3, will migrate from the frying
pan into the fire. They find all that. So there‟s a point where they go, “Ah, I would
really like to have an answer, ok? The hell with all of this, never mind your bargains,
I want an answer. I don’t want promises, I don’t want any more of this Ego stuff; I
want a nice, clean, useful, realistic answer.”
You can imagine what 6/3s on this cross are like. They‟re constantly moving on;
they‟re constantly watching things dissolve. And they‟re always, always at the same
time wondering, “What does it mean?” When you carry the 40/37 inside of you and
you ask what it means, you‟re really asking about spirituality, you‟re really asking
about whether there is purpose, whether there is God, whether there are all of those
things. It‟s a very, very profound question. And when you look at crosses that carry
the 40/37, remember something, they‟re meant to destabilize us enough that we will
seek a spiritual answer. That‟s why the 40/37 is the mystical bridge. It will tweak
us so that we will ask that larger question.

Introduction
I want to look, particularly now, at what we‟ve come to, the 63rd gate. This is the
mind realm. This is the ultimate mind gate. There is nothing mindier
that yang/yin, yang/yin, yang/yin. It‟s all mind. Ask any 63, they will
tell you. One of my favorite jokes about humanity is that only 29% of
humanity has a defined Head Center, which means that 71% of human-
ity thinks about things that don‟t matter. It‟s why I have a great deal
of respect for the definition of the Head Center. There is a
huge tension in the pressure of having to discover the ques-
tions. Answers are easy. You can get answers without even
having a question. You can get an answer without even
knowing that a question was involved.
We all have within us through our base the need for the right
question. Zen was built on this. The concept that you can
ask a question that will result in satori. What is the sound of
one hand clapping? Whatever you want you call any of those
things. The reality is that it is all about this mental whoosh, because if you have the
right question, you don‟t need an answer. Does that make any sense? Every ques-
tion contains the answer. If you have the perfect question, there is no answer; none
necessary, none required. Now, that is a transcendent state of awareness. You
grasp that, you really understand something, because this is the magic. The magic
is that the perfect question is the answer, and we all have one, and they‟re not the
same.
Somebody can have a 5th base like me, but they‟re not going to have the same
“who.” The only way I am going to be able to come to grips with my question is first
of all, I have to have an answer. The answer is how I become myself. In other
words, only when you can become yourself does the question as an illusion stop
being important. When you are yourself, there are no questions like that. What am
I going to do? Where am I going to go? Who am I? What’s going on in my life?
When it all ends, when will it all begin? On and on and on. These are the questions
of the mundane application of this gate in the wheel.
The preparation for the true question is all the many, many, many questions that can
be out there. All of them are training us for answers that don‟t matter. Well, what
to do. Again, the recognition is that most of the things we think about have nothing
to do with our needs on a moment-by-moment basis of staying alive. Most of the
things we‟re curious about don‟t change our lives; most of the things we want an
answer to aren‟t big deals. It‟s just the way we are. We‟re a curious lot. We like to
have answers to things. As a matter of fact, we‟ll take bullshit as answer just be-
cause answers are ok.

We begin to think that question and answer is a natural relationship. Only when you
understand the evolutionary process do you realize that answers have never needed
questions. It‟s just the evidence of experience. Experience provides answers before
the question is even there. And even if the question is there, nobody cares because
the answers are emerging all the time. But a good question is everything.
One of my favorite questions to somebody is very not-self; it‟s a not-self question. I
like good not-self questions. You walk up to the not-self and you say, “Have you
ever made a mistake?” It‟s an incredible question, it‟s a wonderful question because
the answer is “no.” But to really grasp that answer, that‟s the kind of question that
can change your life in the sense that that‟s what it‟s all about. The question is not
about the importance of the answer. The perfect question is transformation; it‟s
where it leads, far beyond the answer. The answer doesn‟t even matter. It‟s just a
way of opening a door to something.
That‟s why this is the inspiration center, the Head Center, the lights are on, big,
yellow glow, that‟s what it‟s all about. So the whole thing is the beauty, at the high-
est level, of what a question is. This is something that is so magical. The Socratic
Method is brilliant from that perspective in the sense that one of the most important
trainings for humans is the question and answer training. It‟s like the most impor-
tant thing for a Generator to enter into is question and response. This is one of the
basic things about us. It‟s an absolute essential. But in the end, what matters is the
question without answer. And the question without answer that is precisely yours.

Let‟s get to the Cross of Consciousness and we get to the 63rd gate. When we‟re
speaking about this in terms of Design, we are dealing with, as we will see in the
extreme of the Juxtaposition, doubt, logical doubt. Basically, what we‟re looking at
is the ability to discern problems in patterns. It‟s all pattern-based.
Remember that the goal of the 63 is ultimately to be able to express the perfect
question. That‟s where it‟s pointed. Wherever you see the 63rd gate, please under-
stand that, because otherwise you can‟t bear all those questions—the buildup, the
training process of the 63 going through this why and where and how and who and
when, and on and on and on.

The 1/3
RAC Consciousness 1
You can see by now that from my perspective, the fundamental essence of any hex-
agram and its related structures are going to be rooted in the foundation, whether
it‟s the foundation line or it‟s the foundation cross. One of the things about the 1/3
Cross of Consciousness is it‟s desperately trying to find the perfect question, which
means something totally different
than one would expect. It‟s called
silence. The perfect question doesn‟t
even start brain activity.

The perfect question is not about a
search for something. It isn‟t. It‟s
like my expression, “What to do,”
there is no question mark at the

end. It is a question. For most
people what to do is a question. For
me, there‟s no question mark. What

to do. It‟s not a question.
It‟s one of these magical things
about the nature of the Cross of

Consciousness. What happens in
the 1/3 is that the standard ques-
tions, the 1st line foundation ques-
tions that you learn about, you have
to have answers—How old are you,
Johnny? It‟s very important. If you‟re on the Cross of Consciousness and somebody
asks you how old you are and you don‟t know, it‟s a real problem; it‟s really going to
upset you. You‟re going to make sure you know. You‟re going to make sure you can
provide that answer. You‟re going to make sure you satisfy that. It‟s really impor-
tant.
Of course, what happens is when the questions turn out to lead nowhere, when the
answers are a mess, there is the glory of the 1/3. And the glory of the 1/3 is: What
do you really want to find out? My base says I want to find out “who.” So through-
out my existence I am always pointed at “who.” I don‟t care about the when, the
where, the why, and the how. I might in my characteristics, but not my base. My
base has a question: Who? But the thing is that “who” is more just than a question,
how do I get to the “who” that I want? It‟s not about just saying, “Who are you?” I
don‟t want to know any more just “who are you,” I want to know what cross you‟re
on, what profile you have, what characteristics you have.
In other words, there is this discernment movement in which you get rid of the ques-
tions that are generalized; you keep on looking for that—it‟s like questionnaires that

people develop. How do you get rid of the junk questions that don‟t tell you any-
thing? Every answer tells you something. You take a psychological test, they ask
you 800 questions, by the time you get to the end, they have a profile of you, and
they have a profile based on all of those answers. The more you refine your ques-
tion, the more you‟ll get the answers you want, after all. At least the answer about
what you want.
This is the distilling process of the Cross of Consciousness: Get rid of the questions
that don‟t get you to the core answer you‟re looking for. But yet, while you‟re doing
that, you gain all that experience. While you‟re doing that, you‟re finding out a lot of
things as well. Cross of Consciousness people are just full of it. You can take that
any way you want, but they are. There‟s all this stuff that‟s there. It‟s incredible.
For so many of them, because you‟re dealing with the 63-64, you‟re dealing with this
almost impossible balancing act between the abstract and the logical processes of
questioning because they‟re so different. Yet, at the same time, Cross of Conscious-
ness people, because they have both aspects, are the only ones who can actually ask
the question. They have both the experience and the experimental pattern possibili-
ty. And in both cases they‟re refining. In both cases, they‟re trying to get down to
the question that matters.
At an exalted level, at an awake level, this is a great gift. Easily the best questions
I‟ve ever been asked, I‟m a natural 4, have come from 63s. This is their gift. How-
ever, for most 63s it‟s an on-and-off gate, because if you‟re not living out your na-
ture and you‟re not aware, this is an enormous burden on your mind because it nev-
er stops. That‟s why I talk about silence.
The perfect question that has no answer gives you nowhere to go. If you think about
that, questions are like the starter in your car. But if you have a question that has
no answer, then there is nowhere to go and all of a sudden there is silence. It‟s like
me as a knower. I was driven in my life to know. And not knowing could seem like
such a threat to me as I was developing. I didn‟t want to risk my position as being
archetypal smartass. And today, not knowing brings silence. Before I had all this, if
I didn‟t know something it would really bother me—I should know that. Now, it‟s
like, ok, I don‟t know and there‟s silence. There‟s no pull.
The magic that lies within the questioner is that they are here finally to fall into si-
lence because there‟s nothing to ask. That‟s why, when you look at evolutionary
steps it‟s way at the end; there is all this noise that‟s running up all the way. One of
the real tragedies for Cross of Consciousness is how often they‟re cut off either from
the Throat or to the Throat. So they end up with all of this stuff locked inside their
heads rattling around. In that not-self dilemma, how painful it is. Yet in my work,
the Crosses of Consciousness I‟ve had to deal with have earned my respect for their
intellectual grasp and depth. And they love Design because you get all the cubby-
holes, you get all the places where you can put things and you can organize. There
are all kinds of Cross of Consciousness people, deep, deep, deep, deep down into
this knowledge.

What they‟re doing is getting rid of their primary need. Every time they can get an
answer to a question, they get closer and closer to the question that has no answer.
That‟s their drive in life—get rid of it all, nothing new under the Sun. It‟s not like
more questions grow every day. They don‟t. It‟s finite. Each cross with each pers-
pective and its way of seeing has a finite list it has to go through.
Now, not everyone gets through their list. But the moment you get through that
list—and it doesn‟t mean you have to go through every question. When I say „go
through the list,‟ there are simply moments where all kinds of things are made clear
in flash and you can scratch off 316 items on the list in one moment. And the next
one may be only one thing and it drags on for years. That is the process. But it‟s so
important to see what they‟re all about and how selfish it is, which is why people like
me who are 70% of population that have an open Head Center are pissed with all
that—you‟re supposed to work out all that list. Don‟t give me your list.
So, when you‟re dealing with a 1/3, one thing that happens is that they discover
very early in life that they‟re not getting the answers they need. The Cross of Con-
sciousness 1/3s are beings who are going to look for something. They‟re going to
find out that the answers to the basics questions aren‟t important. Not only are they
not important, but most of the time they‟re a lie. And they have this question and
the answer they get—and remember you don‟t have to ask the question to get the
answer, but every 63 has the question ready to match with any answer it hears.
And then they just scratch it off the list.
If they hear an answer that‟s full of it, it‟s like, “This wasn’t an important question.”
And that question may be a whole family of questions. It‟s like the first time as a
1/3 Cross of Consciousness that you discover religion isn‟t all it‟s made up to be. It
can be shattering. A whole bunch of questions can just disappear in a moment. I
don‟t have to worry about that. I don‟t have to worry about the virgin birth. I don‟t
have to worry about that. I don‟t have to worry about this. I don‟t have to think
about that. All of that is just whoosh, it‟s gone.
Of course, the moment something is gone is the moment that inspiration tries to
replace it. The moment something is gone the next question is, “Well, then, what is
there?” and a new search for the answer. Remember, inspiration, the answers come
and they don‟t come through questions. They get matched with questions.
When you‟re dealing with a 63, it‟s rare that you ask them something. It‟s like me
with a 63, my 4 isn‟t looking for them to give me a question. But the moment I say
something, they‟ll have a question for me because the moment I say something
that‟s an answer, they have to find their own question for. Not that they ask the
question, but they have to have the question that matches that answer. And if they
don‟t, it leads to a question.
Grasp how it works. It‟s magic. It‟s very, very beautiful. Yet, at the same time, if
you‟re unaware it‟s a torment. If you‟re a 1/3, there‟s the disappointment that
comes when you see that a whole category of questions is nonsense. It doesn‟t
matter to get the answer to that, even though getting the answer to that is some-
thing you collect. Unless you end up in life understanding that as a Cross of Con-

sciousness, at some point your outer authority is what you can process consciously
and how important it‟s going to be on the mental plane for others.
But if you don‟t grasp that, it seems like all of those collected answers that you‟re
matching all the time to questions is driving you nuts. Most people who have this
think it‟s the other way around. They think they‟re being driven by the question.
They‟re not; they‟re being driven by the answers. All they care about is that there is
a question for every answer until they can cut out through the whole list.

The 1/4
RAC Consciousness 1
From 1/3s to 1/4s, you always have the same dilemma. Whereas the 1/3 is going to
represent the mutative principle, the 1/3 is going to be able to see that the question
is something that‟s faulty, the 1/4 doesn‟t do that. The 1/4 Cross of Consciousness
is very fixed. And usually these are the people who always ask you the same ques-
tion. It‟s like my mother. “Do you still have a job?” She‟s never going to stop ask-
ing me if I still have a job. Somewhere inside of her—she‟s a 63—is this same ques-
tion. It will never go away. They can drive you nuts.
They assume it‟s the same question that‟s going to give them the answer. These are
people who keep on trying to find the answer to that same question and every time
they find answers that don‟t work, they don‟t give up. They just keep on looking for
an answer that will fit. Eventually you‟ll get, well, “God put the dinosaurs here to
test our faith.” Eventually you come up with your answer. It‟s like, “All right, I’ve
had enough now, let’s make something up. I don’t want to give up my question.”
They don‟t.
70% of humanity is conditioned by that. Look, the question is, “Do you believe?”
Hey, that isn‟t my question. But if you‟re fixed and that‟s your trip, that‟s the ques-
tion—do you believe? And God forbid you don‟t say yes. Then there is this, “Well,
why not?” As soon as you get the answer you don‟t want, there‟s a question. It‟s
always that way. So they can be very, very fixed. And not only fixed, but please
understand something about the 1/4, that introspection, study, whatever, they‟re so
good at building a false foundation if they need one. They can lay the bricks of a flat
world so good. Of course, when you‟re dealing with this and with what is going to be
what we think about, this cross generates most of what humanity thinks about.
If you meet enough of these people, sometimes you go, “Oh, boy, what a mess. I
have to think about all that stuff. Wow, that‟s a lot of stuff to process. Why do I
have to come up with the answer?” “Why me?” is what the open Head Center al-
ways says. “Why do I have to think about this, why can‟t you figure it out and let us
know? Send us an email. Tell us what the answer is. I don‟t want to think about
it.” And yet, of course, this is the movie. We all come in with a base that has a
question. And we‟re all here to be trained in answering. It‟s human. It‟s why we
have this illusion that if we have the right answer, we have the right life, which is
such a joke.

The 2/4
RAC Consciousness 1
If you‟re a 2/4, this is not your favorite place to be. It really isn‟t, because remem-
ber, certain aspects of any cross are going to work better with certain profiles than
others. And again, not to get into—we know better by now—better/worse situations
with that. Simply that it‟s different. Some resonate more, some don‟t. There can
be real dissonance in the way in which it works.
Think about the 2/4, that is, the 2/4 being a natural doesn‟t want to figure out what
the ultimate question is. It‟s the last thing they care about. That‟s work. It‟s real
work. You have to process things; you have to figure out how they work. Two‟s
don‟t like that. If you knock on their door and you know them—the classic 2/4 mis-
sionary-hermit-opportunist—the chances are they might stimulate you. You say
something, they automatically have to match it with a question and out of that can
come something. Think about how they work. That‟s what so brilliant about the way
the Head Center operates. They hear something, and everything they hear is an
answer. It‟s why they have such busy minds. Everything they hear is an answer.
When you have people who have very serious psychoses—a lot of very odd, mental
psychoses in everything they hear the answer—we think they‟re nuts. But this is
classic 63-64. The answers are out of everybody‟s mouth. The moment that some-
body says something, a 63-64 is already going to be placing with its appropriate
question; answer first, question after. And out of that comes something else. That‟s
the power.
If you‟re a Cross of Consciousness, rather than being the interrogator, you‟re better
off being the therapist. The key for you is the moment somebody says something,
you know what the question was. They don‟t, because they don‟t think they‟re giv-
ing you an answer. They just think they‟re talking. It‟s why the Cross of Conscious-
ness is so special. It‟s why they grasp the mental formulas. It‟s why they‟re so good
at being able to see chaos at work in somebody‟s mind because they know that with-
in themselves. They know this process of, there‟s an answer, where‟s the question?
They‟re running inside saying, “Where‟s the pressure? How do I fit that together?
Why did they say that?” And they don‟t even have to ask themselves that question;
they‟re automatically putting a question on that that they could have asked that
person to get the same answer. It‟s quite a process.
So, the 2/4 doesn‟t like this process. The 2/4 doesn‟t want to figure out what the
great question is. The 2/4 isn‟t interested in you, after all. This is, “Leave me alone,
don’t bother me, don’t move the furniture, and don’t get in my way here.” All of a
sudden you have this kind of activation where it‟s pulled out of them.
Again, like all 2/4s, they can be transforming agents the moment they‟re truly called
and that opportunity arises and away they go. In most cases, the Cross of Con-
sciousness 2/4s are the people who create contagious thought systems. What I

mean by that is they give us the answer flavor of the month. It‟s like “drinking a
glass of wine is going to keep you healthy,” and somebody says that‟s the answer.
This is a typical 2/4 capacity in which the opportunity is to get other people to as-
sume that that‟s the right answer for them as well.
Remember, something about the mental plane. The greatest ally the not-self has is
the Cross of Consciousness. What to say. What I mean by that is, without the Cross
of Consciousness, we don‟t have this vast mental plane at work. And this vast men-
tal plane is what‟s so difficult for a human being to let go of as authority because it
does seem to have all these answers, and how misleading they are. Your mind gives
you an answer, your mind makes a decision for you. There‟s an assumption then
that mind is going to be the authority. So, one of the by-products of consciousness
is that unawake, unaware Cross of Consciousness people are the ones who set eve-
rybody off on that not-self track. They‟re the ones who tell you the answers in your
mind. They‟re the ones who tell you how to make up your mind, how to find the
right answer.
Again, you get to see the binary nature of any of these. I know at a personal level
that the Cross of Consciousness, when it‟s pointed in the right direction, is absolutely
invaluable because they will explore the intellectual panorama of anything they‟re
given. It‟s something like Human Design that‟s an essential aspect, to have people
who can grasp intellectually the very deep level how each and every one of these
concepts we work with, they can see that that is an answer to a question which
makes them great allies for the knowledge whether they‟re abstract or logical. Just
because Human Design is logical it still means abstract beings have to see its value
and recognize that it works. Only the Cross of Consciousness can deliver that.
So, there is a tremendous value in the way in which their minds operate. Yet, at the
same time, see how devastating they are for the not-self. They‟re creating this
whole world of mental thought systems in which answers are possible, viable and
available, and will give you what you need.

RAC Consciousness 1
Whenever you‟re dealing with consciousness and you come to a heretical line, you
know there is enormous potential here for disturbance. The collective can‟t stand
anything that is individual until it has been absorbed into the collective and then it‟s
ok. After all, we have mutation all the time and things are new. The moment after
they‟re new, they‟re collective, if you know what I mean. They stop being new, they
stop being unique, they are absorbed in the collective field.
If you want to torture a Cross of Consciousness, then you would talk about things
they can find no question to. It would drive them crazy. If they hear you say some-
thing and they can‟t find the parallel, the system, in their questioning, that‟s some-
thing that makes them very disturbed. And in that very disturbance can be both the

positive and the negative: The shattering and the possibility of a transforming an-
swer, or at the same time, just serious confusion.
Everything about the 5 is that it can take a heretical approach, a heretical approach
to what the question is, a heretical approach to what the answer should be derived
from the question, and so on. 2/5s can get into a great deal of trouble. The projec-
tion is on them, and so forth.
The only thing that stands in the way of that, 2/5s and 5/2s as we‟ve seen are not
very visible, they‟re not necessarily going to rush out. My term for them is always
self-motivated. Basically, these are people who have to turn themselves on and not
everybody can. Not all 2/5s or 5/2s have that capacity to motivate themselves. It
can be very difficult for them. So, even calling them isn‟t necessarily going to bring
that out of them because that 5th line unconscious is so suspicious, is so paranoid,
much more so than the Personality simply because it‟s so uncomfortable that it‟s
there.

The 3/5
RAC Consciousness 1
Here is an example where the 3/5 is exalted. When you‟re dealing with the Cross of
Consciousness, the 1/3, the 3/5 and the 3/6 are primary instruments because of the
nature of the 3. What we‟re looking for is that the old saying about “there are as
many ways as there are beings,” the real role in consciousness is to codify the ques-
tions into categories that eventually get reduced into smaller and smaller and smaller
pockets, basically until they get reduced to the point that they disappear. That‟s
really what it is. It‟s like going back to source.
Of course, that‟s why it comes out of your base. You have a source question. And
that source question is at the root of all the others. So once you can get through
that and you move down that, and through there you can finally get to it. You can
see the way it works in our society because after all, consciousness has an enormous
impact on our mental plane—70% open minds—the Consciousness Cross being so
clearly associated with the Head Center and inspiration. What you have to see is
that our whole planet is given more answers than questions that are of value. It‟s
true.
There are so many answers that are available that have no value to the individual.
It may have value to that person or to that subgroup or whatever the case may be.
In other words, what you‟re seeing is that as we expand, we also have to put out
every single one of those questions and answers, every single one of them, whether
they are of any value or not because only when we have all of them out there are we
finally going to be able to reduce them to nothing. It‟s the way that it works.
So when you‟re dealing with the 3s, because they do not accept the standard be-
cause they find the flaws and because they‟re willing through their trial and error to
go in a different direction, they will look for an answer elsewhere. They will find

within themselves a question that matches an answer that they never assumed they
would have seen as a correlation; in other words, a whole new way of perceiving
because that‟s part of the potential of this consciousness.
You can‟t do that without the 3. Remember, I‟ve spoken about 3/5s in the context of
science and the context of research because they‟re the ones who can go through
and see that it doesn‟t work and let everybody know but also keep on probing.
There‟s nothing more important in research than what you don‟t need to find out.
When you‟re doing a piece of research, there are so many things you don‟t need to
find out. But you can‟t get there until all of the things you could find out are availa-
ble, otherwise, how do you know?
Cross of Consciousness people, on the mundane level as the not-self, have such a
hard time in this life because they have a lot of stuff in their head. They know that
it‟s useless in terms of themselves, as a value to them just because they know all
that stuff, unless they‟re lucky in their life that they get an environment or a career
that allows them to take advantage of all of that processing, and that‟s not the case
for most. Then it‟s a real burden to have all of that stuff in your head because
what‟s it there for? You don‟t think about yourself and your cosmic responsibilities to
make sure that that vast collection of answers and questions are out there.
So, 3/5s are wonderful in this context. You just don‟t want to listen to their answer,
necessarily, or your own answer after their question because you really know what‟s
coming in all of that because it‟s all a trial and error process. But these are the be-
ings who can say to you, “You’re not asking yourself the right question. There’s
another question you could ask.” The heresy of, “Hey, that’s not the way. This an-
swer that you have, does it work?” It‟s like people who go to any kind of spiritual
encounter, gathering, and when it‟s over there‟s only one question to ask: Did it
work?
So, this is one of the things about the importance of what it means to lay out all of
these things, and yet for the Cross the Consciousness, how difficult it is for them.
This is Right Angle; they‟re not transpersonal, yet this is an enormous transpersonal
contribution to society, to our species. They‟re the ones who least benefit from it—
not-self—because they‟re confused most of the time.
They don‟t know where that begins and ends. They don‟t know where their question
is, where their answer is. They don‟t, because that‟s not what they‟re designed for.
This is the not the cross of personal individual consciousness. This is the cross of
collective consciousness; it‟s very collective. They are here to share their conscious-
ness, which doesn‟t mean that they benefit from it. It‟s like all the jokes in the way
the program lays out the game.

The 3/6
RAC Consciousness 1
What‟s interesting about the 3/6 is how many answers they‟ll try. They‟ll try so
many answers. They‟ll start their life with subjective answers, they‟ll go to objective
answers, and they will go with everything they can. It’s the wrong question, there
must be another way, and there must be something else. I have to figure it out.
They are absolutely driven. By the way, nobody makes more money from confusion
than a 3/6 on the Cross the Consciousness. They are really good at that. They are
really, really, really, really, really good at that. They‟re good at saying, “Here’s an
answer. No guarantees, but here’s an answer. It’s only $25 today, it’s on sale.”
They‟re very good at all of that.
One of the difficulties of the 3/6 on this cross is that the only answers that actually
interest them are material. The 1/3 and the 3/5 ultimately on this cross can make
money from their mind, and it‟s natural. It‟s a by-product. As a matter of fact, most
of them don‟t start off thinking their mind will make them money, it just seems to
make them trouble.
But when you get to the 3/6 on this cross, they‟re very aware of the fact that they
can use their mind to make money. So, their pursuit of answers is very different.
These are the kinds of beings, their impact on you in terms of inspiration is much
more about where you‟re going to go on a financial track, or what they can sell you
as a concept than anything else.

The 4/6
RAC Consciousness 1
We were talking earlier, because we had a number of tribal activations, about how
comfortable the 4 is in a tribal situation, and how uncomfortable the 4 is in a collec-
tive situation. Now, it isn‟t as uncomfortable as the 4 is in an individual configura-
tion. But the 4 in the collective doesn‟t have the same security. After all, the whole
thing about the 4 is that the 4 knows it has a chance with those it knows. So, if
you‟re a 4 on the Cross of Consciousness, then you really have a chance to influence
mentally the conceptualizing of those people around you, those people you know.
But the moment you step into the collective, there are going to be many people in
the collective who don‟t know you, yet are still part of that collective circle and you
don‟t have influence over them. For the 4s, that‟s always difficult. They‟re cut off
from the possibilities of success the moment they are aligned to the collective.
The tribe doesn‟t mind the individual because the individual brings mutation. And
individuals are more likely to be pulled into the tribe than the tribe into the individu-
al. But when the tribe has to deal with the collective, it‟s very difficult. Everything
about the 4th line is rooted in a bonded community. It‟s not the same as calling it

„tribal‟ as we do in differentiation in the chart. But the net result looks the same. In
other words, they need that close-knit community around them; they need a fair
number of people they know because otherwise they‟re not going to have their op-
portunities.
The whole thing about the nature of the 4/6 is that they can get the opportunity to
express the answer as an example. Again, this is where we‟re getting closer to the
truth of what this process is going to lead to. In other words, what this process
leads to is that the question and the answer is not an intellectual thing. The truth is
the life. And the life transcends question and answer when there‟s nothing but the
existential reality of the unknowable. You‟re right there, there‟s nothing else,
whether you‟re this or that, you have no idea about what‟s about to happen and you
don‟t care.
It‟s one of the things about the mystical experience. People over the years have
asked me silly questions. And one of those silly questions is: “Why do you think it
was you? Why did the Voice choose you?” It‟s quite frankly something that I have
never, ever, ever, ever even conceived of asking. It‟s one of the old mystical jokes,
if you say “why me?” nothing is ever going to come to you ever again because you‟re
just obviously stupid. It‟s clear; there‟s no other way to look at it. I never asked
“why me?”
The 4/6 is not about why. The whole thing about the destiny of the 4/6 is simply to
be it. Again, this is the whole story of the 6th line. Everything about the nature of
the 6th line, particularly the 6th line profile, the mutative nature of the profile, we
know that these three phases are so obvious in what they‟re saying.
You have a first phase where it‟s subjective: You dig in, you suffer, and you find out,
you see what doesn‟t work. You have a second stage when you move away from
that: You become objective, you watch it, in watching it you gain wisdom about the
processes themselves. But in the end it‟s not about subjective/objective. It‟s not
about being on this side or that side. It‟s the quantum. It‟s the recognition that
you‟re both and all. It‟s the recognition that is not about whether there is a question
and an answer. It‟s only that there is “is-ness.”
Once you‟ve accepted that choicelessness, then the questions go away. They do.
Again, when I speak like that I‟m really speaking about questions at another level.
I‟m not talking about the fact that I still have the occasional question, “What‟s for
dinner?” There are still questions for me that are left in the mundane body of this
life. But when it comes to the questions about the substance and quality of your
process, the 6th line is here to stop being subjective, stop being objective, just be.
Forget about the perspective, just be; that‟s the point.
For all of us, the answer is ourselves. In the end, that‟s the deepest answer. The
deepest answer is—because quite frankly, being differentiated, being unique, you are
the only answer to yourself, which is why we all have this unique question that needs
to be resolved in the end.

That brings us to the Juxtaposition. Here we have this fixed Juxtaposition Cross of
Doubts. These are the great doubters and very, very fixed. Unlike the Cross of
Consciousness that is always matching their inner question to the answers they hear
in anything that‟s said, this is a very different process. They‟re not matching ques-
tions. That‟s not what they‟re interested in.
They‟re measuring the quality of the expression and they‟re looking for flaws. That‟s
what they do. So, the great doubting Thomas‟, this is the cross of the doubting
Thomas. They‟re going to doubt you
as a first principle. Remember,
they‟re not interested in finding the
matching questions. This is not
 Cross of Consciousness anymore.
Yet, it is still the 63rd gate. Collec-
tive logic is the bitchiest, most criti-
cal, judgmental of all circuitry. It
has to be. If we are not absolutely

fastidious, absolutely rigid in testing
our logic patterns systems, then
we‟re in big trouble.

One of the things that emerges once
you get past consciousness, you get
past the 63 being absorbed in

matching question with statement—
it‟s actually not an answer that
people give it, just statements they
make matching the questions—you
get into this realm of immediate
criticism. In that immediate criticism comes the, “That’s not a very good answer.”
Oh, boy, do we get a lot of that.
Everybody is worried about giving the right answer. You‟re sitting there with a police
officer and they‟re asking you questions, you‟d better give the right answer. You‟re
waiting there trying to get a job and you‟re in an interview, you‟d better give the
right answer. And of course, these are the ones who specialize in that right answer.
Very fixed; I love it. Charles Schultz, he‟s dead now, he created Peanuts, the car-
toon. Sally, who is one of my favorite beings that ever existed in flesh or not, loves
to experiment with answers that are universal. So, every time somebody asks her a
question, she says, “Never mind. How are you today?” Never mind.

This is the fixedness of the answer that‟s going to save you. It will get rid of all of
your doubts. That‟s what they‟re looking for, this doubt-free answer. Can you really
do the job? Oh, yes, I can really do the job. Good answer; eliminate the doubts;
good answer. The fact that you have an undefined Ego and you‟re a Manifesting
Generator that‟s been smacked all your life and you miss things, still that‟s the right
answer, and as good as that will take you, as long as it will take you.
Again, there is this material thing about the Cross of Consciousness, the material
thing about the 63. It‟s one of those things about the patterns in life, if we don‟t
have successful patterns, we don‟t have the material we need, and so on. The Cross
of Doubts is very good at helping people give the right answers, even though those
right answers are lies.
Take advantage of doubt. You can fool some of the people some of the time, you
just can‟t fool all of the people all of the time. And only a 63 not only knows that
but, laughs about it. The cruelest laugh is the 63s laugh. They know that game.
They know that there are so many answers that you can bamboozle anybody. And
4/1s are great at that. “Oh, I’ll give you the perfect answer.” So, when you ask
them something, you never get what they know. You get what they want to give
you.

The Left Angle Cross of Dominion; I have a nickname for this cross. I call it the
cross of usurping. To usurp means that you grab, take and take over. Usurpers are
like that. The usurper to the throne; you kill your brother, your mother, your aunt,
your uncle, any heir. What was that wonderful English movie years ago with Alec
Guinness—Kind Hearts and Coronets. He‟s on his way to kill 75 people in line to the
throne so he can get there, wiping them off one after the other. I‟m number 14
today.
When you look at the Cross of Dominion, you‟re looking at one of the most uncom-
fortable combinations of four arms you imagine: The 45, the 26 and then on top of
that the 63 and the 64. You know why they have to be in charge because nobody
could survive with them otherwise. They could not tolerate anyone. And you cannot
keep these people down. They will crawl right in. This thing about „give someone an
inch and they take a yard.‟ You give them your pinkie and they swallow your wallet.
Oh, how ugly this Left Angle can be in the hands of the not-self. They give you pre-
cisely the answer you need to fool you so they can take what‟s yours and make it
theirs. Now, you would think that‟s an evil description. But it‟s not. It‟s one of
those ingredients in life that‟s absolutely essential. But the beauty of this is two
things. First of all, the 45th gate is the head of the tribe. It is the true font of the
tribe. If you‟re a 45 and you‟re the head of the tribe, you have a responsibility and
your responsibility is to educate. If you‟re running a tribe and you educate the

people in your tribe, they‟re going to make more money, you‟re going to get more
taxes. You really have to understand that; it‟s a very simple formula. It‟s good for
everybody in the tribe, but it‟s good for the rulers, too. It‟s what it‟s all about. Edu-
cation leads to more revenue and more success. The tribe has a better sense of self.
The 26th gate is a lot of selling, a lot of marketing, and a lot of boasting. And then
you have the 63 and 64. Think about what these people really do. They educate
you the way they want in order to
create the advantage they need.
Think about what it was like to be a
student in the Soviet Union 30
 years ago. Anybody who grew up
under communism—I have so many
friends who grew up under com-
munism—when Stalin decided that
Russia needed to build things, eve-

There are so many Russian engi-

lievable. It‟s almost everybody you
meet my age in Russia are engi-
neers. And you‟re educated a cer-
tain way.

This is the most devious transfor-
mation of humanity done through
education. How we educate our
children is how we gain dominion
over them as adults. The Cross of Dominion is a heavy trip; yet, at the same time I
want to take advantage of that cross. You know my pitch: Let‟s teach our children
Human Design, this is the future. You really have to see the double-edged sword of
everything and how it‟s used.
This is a necessary instrument; otherwise, all of that question/answer stuff doesn‟t
go anywhere. This is a progression. Remember that the Cross of Consciousness is
the research of this propaganda. You get over here to the Cross of Dominion saying,
“Ok, let’s take advantage of these questions. Let’s give them these answers. If we
give them these answers we’re going to have dominion over them. I’m the only one
who can give you the sacrament. I’m the chosen priest of God. What are you going
to do? And not only am I going to tell you, but I’m going to teach your children that
and I’m going to stay in power a long time. Not only that, I’m going to make my son
the next priest so he can take over.”
So, one of the things to recognize is that the way we gain dominion over others is
through ideas and concepts. And we manipulate ideas and concepts in order to gain
dominion over the other. How do you think you get a promotion in most jobs? You
come up with a concept or an idea that others end up having to follow that gives you
dominion over them. That‟s how it works.

So, this cross is very, very, very powerful. The Left Angle is not something anyone
should be fooled by. Because the Left Angle has a transpersonal connection to the
other, it is often misunderstood how rattling they are in terms of the way they con-
trol how everything operates. In other words, this is not the research end. This is
the practical—5th line—application role model end. If your role model turns out to be
a fraud, and the fraud has dominion over you—it‟s like being a Nigerian. You‟re sit-
ting on one of the largest oil reserves in the world, you have one of the riches coun-
tries in the world in natural resources, and you have 15 million people dying of star-
vation and AIDS.
So, the dominion and the rule of the mind, here in this cross you really get to see it.
You really get to see the way in which we are organized and fooled. And we‟re
fooled by the collection of answers and questions that we‟re given through the edu-
cation we receive. We were all most deeply conditioned by our early education, the
limitations of the potential of what we could be. Somebody like me in a classroom is
pointless. I was smarter than most of my teachers. There was nothing for me. Yet,
I was under the dominion of that rule. The dominion of that rule was really a hor-
rendous monotony. It gave me a deep, deep, deep distaste for educational institu-
tions.
The reality is that all of us are deeply conditioned by this cross. We just are. So, in
all of these things, you can see the productive values, the qualities that are positive,
but in the not-self, that can be devastating and has been throughout our process.
We have really been misled by these forces. But then again, no choice, what to do;
it is what it is.

Again, that may be correct; let‟s give them the benefit of the doubt. But in most
cases, it is a very, very clever seduction.
I‟m very interested in having well-trained Cross of Dominion people working on be-

Make sure they‟re on your team and don‟t give them the car keys; you‟ll never see
them again. Don‟t give them a key to the house because they‟ll open up the house
and have the locks changed and leave you outside. It‟s my house now.

The 5/2
LAC Dominion 1
You remember there was this crazy guy in the States where everybody was waiting
for a space ship and they all took poison together and died waiting for the spaceship.
I think his name was Applewhite. In this configuration, this is where you get the
cult. This is a cult archetype. Of course, the whole thing about the 5/2 on this cross
is that they take advantage of being a 5/2.
It‟s one of the very few places where the 5/2 actually feels at home because it can
manipulate the projection field. It knows that the 5 Personality is getting the projec-
tion. It knows the other sees something in it that may be of value to them. They‟re
much more open to the possibility that that being is going to be able to deliver the
whatever. And because they have the gift of this Left Angle variation, the gift of
being able to manipulate education in order to create a position of power, 5/2s are
very, very good at pulling people into their environment, bringing them into their
hermit‟s environment and then totally ruling them in a heretical environment. Yet,
nobody on the outside knows.
This is where the 5/2 doesn‟t want to be alone. Here is where the 5/2 simply wants
to have a completely controlled environment that they have dominion over. And yet,
at the same time can exercise their power of dominion and get their reward. The 45
is always saying, “Where’s my cut; I want my cut. I’m expecting my share. Where’s
my share?”
So, the 5/2s are interesting. This 5/2 is the kind of person you see in the office
every day, very nice, normal, good mask, and go through the thing. When they go
home at night, they have four or five people who show up at their house and they all
get dressed up in black and start sacrificing cats and God knows what else. In other
words, they have this power of having that kind of dominion over the other to bring
them together in a hidden environment; these are hidden cabals. So, there are end-
less conspiracy theories whether it‟s the Jews running the world or it‟s the military
industrial complex or it‟s all of these various mysterious cabals. Here you have mys-
terious cabals.
This is secretive dominion. It‟s why we‟re always nervous about who‟s really in
charge, what‟s really going on, are we being fooled. The Cross of Dominion is a very
strange cross. When you‟re looking at the 5/2, this is one of those cases where you

can say, “Hey, this 5/2 is active. They‟re easily motivated to live out their potential.”
Again, it doesn‟t mean they will.
Most 5/2s on this cross, from the very moment they were a disappointment to their
parents, are already just simply happy to have dominion over themselves. But it‟s
difficult because of the tribal quality inherent in this cross. That 45 and 26 makes
enormous demands on somebody to contribute and be involved in their community;
and if you‟re a 5/2, only on your terms, and only when it‟s satisfying that it‟s on your
terms; and only when you can have dominion, and you can only have dominion over
controlling the education, the need to know.
This is the whole thing about the Cross of Dominion. These are people who decide
who should know what and when, or if, at all. Of course, when you look at the 26th
gate you‟ll see things like the omission of things in history, leaving things out, fooling
people, manipulating them. All of that is built into this cross. I‟m not a moralist. So
when I can look at this side or that side of any configuration, I just see what‟s there.
But I also recognize how important these beings are because if they‟re correct, then
they can be very helpful in guiding others, in that sense, but still with them in power.
You can‟t get over that power trip if you come in on the Cross of Dominion. You
assume you should be in power. That‟s the whole thing about Cross of Dominion.
For you the answer is, “If I’m in power, everything is ok.”

The 6/2
LAC Dominion 1
With the 6/2, we‟re getting to the role model of this. This is the one Cross of Domi-
nion I like. It‟s the one, fortunately, I have to deal with. I like it for the sense that
being a role model carries such enormous pressure. It‟s very, very hard. This is the
kind of person who wants to gain dominion in the beginning—6th line theme, 3rd line
beginning—because it gives it safety and money, only to turn out to be a really nice
being. It‟s like you only want to become king because you want to have the control
and you turn out to be the best king the people ever had, and the very act of becom-
ing the controlling agent transforms you into a positive agent despite the fact of your
early motivations.
In other words, being a role model is very powerful. It‟s like, “Ah, shit, I’ve been
ripping them off, and I’d better do something good for them. After all, they’re all
doing what I say.” There is this pressure on, “Well, ok, I really should be an exam-
ple.” I‟m just playing around with the way I express that. The way it happens is in
the objectivity, the roof phase. When they‟re in the beginning of that dealing with
the 3/2, what you‟re really getting is this drive to be in dominion particularly because
of the 3—trial and error things, mess up, you don‟t want things to mess up and you
really want to be in charge of things. You immediately see that people don‟t know
how to run things, they don‟t know how to do things, you could do a better job, they
didn‟t learn how to do their job properly, you could figure it out better; all this pres-
sure at the very beginning because of the 3rd line activity.

But the moment you get to the objectivity and you‟re looking at it from a different
perspective, it‟s no longer that the reward is you‟re in control and if anything goes
wrong it‟s your own fault. Suddenly the pressure is on eliminating those problems
for the other, otherwise you can‟t maintain dominion. You can only maintain domi-
nion over somebody if they accept your answer. If they don‟t accept your answer,
you get no dominion. Remember that the answer can be coerced. It‟s not like after
50 years of communism that the average person under communism was saying, “I
want to keep this.” But they also knew that if they opened up their mouth, they‟d be
in a lot of trouble, so they let dominion rule.
The moment the 6/2 gets into the roof stage, we have this transition, this movement
away from, “It‟s only about power so I have to do something. I have to do some-
thing for the people.” Of course, they devised all kinds of ways. So the Soviets
would say, yes, yes, but you have free health care, you have this or that. Even now,
today, when you look at people in the former communist countries, almost all of
them bitch universally about how tough and ugly capitalism is, how it was great
when they had free education and free health care and free this and free that.

The 6/3
LAC Dominion 1
What you‟re looking for by the time you get to the role model phase, particularly
when you get off the roof in the end, is the perfect act of dominion. What is the
perfect act of dominion? The perfect act of dominion is the road to grace. If you‟re
going to rule, the only grace is to listen to those you rule. That‟s the 22nd gate,
that‟s down the road. The 6/3 of this cross is going to look over its shoulder and
there is the 22nd gate. How do you turn ugly dominion into grace? It‟s like these
African dictators who run for reelection. You‟ve killed all your enemies. But still,
let‟s have some grace now. Let‟s give the people a chance to say we love you and
thank you for your direction.
The 6/3; that‟s such a place to be—to have one foot in dominion and the other one in
grace is really tough. It‟s like, “But how can I be the dominant ruling force and listen
to what people want at the same time? How do you do that? What if they actually
say something that leads to a truth that I have to change? I’m in trouble.” There‟s
this real dilemma in the 6/3. Even though dominion hasn‟t worked well for you,
again with all of those 3s, you‟ve learned how to usurp, you‟ve learned how to get
what you need materially because 6/3s know how to do that.
But at the same time there‟s something missing. What‟s missing is grace; you don‟t
want to be just the ruler. You want to be the righteous ruler. You want to be the
philosopher/king. You had this movement in the 17th, 18th century where kings were
kings because they came out of the right loins; they wanted to show that they were
really there for the people. They were going to show how much they cared about
the people. They were going to show how much they loved the people. Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

Out of that movement from the 6/3 of this cross to the 1/3 of the next cross is our
whole movement from dictatorship to democracy. It‟s right there. You can have
dominion in the beginning based on seduction. You can maintain dominion for a
while as a role model, but eventually, human beings will rebel against dominion.
They will if they see, ultimately, that dominion is selfish; they will rebel against it.
Of course, that immediately leads to grace. What grace leads to is, you have to
listen to them until finally they say, “You have no right to be king. Just because your
father was king doesn‟t mean you‟re any good at being king. Hell, your grandfather
was an absolute idiot.” Then everything begins to change.
It‟s so interesting to see in the cycle of things how these very, very powerful forces
are never allowed to stay that way. They come up, they have their peak, and they
drop off. There‟s nothing more powerful in this hexagram than the 5/2. Wow, is
that ever powerful. They don‟t care about grace. They have the blinds closed. They
don‟t even know that grace lives next door, or Alice or Jane; but nonetheless, they
don‟t know that grace lives next door. They don‟t. They don‟t care about grace next
door. As a matter of fact, they don‟t want grace to look in; they just want to have
their dominion, their control.
In Milton‟s Paradise Lost, this wonderful expression of “I‟d rather be a big fish in a
small pond.” This is the 5/2—big fish, small pond; complete control. By the time
you get to the 6/3 what‟s happening is that you‟re a small fish in a big pond. That‟s
the transition that‟s coming.
All Aspects are Within Us
So, we‟re always protected within the context of the program. When you look at the
genetic material and the way that it runs, remember something interesting: We all
have a dominion gene in us. It‟s there. All of these aspects are within us; every
single one of them. The only reason we resonate to them as explanation as we go
through is because we know them all.
When you see the archetype of somebody who comes in on a cross like this, it‟s
really about—I have people close to me who have the Cross of Dominion. My thing
with the Cross of Dominion is, be the best damn Cross of Dominion you can be.
That‟s the point, after all. Be correct, be that thing; that‟s what you‟re going to be,
do your job. You‟re here to have dominion; you‟re here to gain dominion. It‟s the
essence of it. But be correct; otherwise, it‟s messy. Otherwise it simply does not
work.

Introduction
When you come to the 22nd gate, you come to the Cross
of Rulership. It‟s always interesting whenever you‟re
looking at any kind of cross configuration to take a look
at the four gates that are here. The rulership is not poss-
ible without a very powerful Ego. Rulership is not possi-
ble without a certain amount of hyperbole or bullshit—the
26th gate. In order to be able to mold the people, the
people have to often be told what they want to hear ra-
ther than what they should hear. That is one of the most
ancient credos in all kinds of politics whether it is dicta-
torship or democracy. And this is rooted in the 26th gate.
So, it‟s one of the aspects of rulership.
If you look on the other side, you have the natural ruler,
the 45th gate. That is ,the natural ruler of the tribe.
Whenever you see the 45th gate in somebody‟s chart,
somewhere inside of them is the sense of entitlement.
Something inside of them says, “I deserve this.” De-
pending on the characteristics, sometimes that comes out
very loudly. When you consider most of the world is
deprived, there‟s an awful lot of really annoyed 45s who haven‟t been able to get
what they deserve, which can also be equated to the amount of anger and revolution
in the world.
Rulership Based on the Past
Ok, so the 45 is the natural ruler. Here is initiation, here is the beginning the
process, here is the beginning of the purpose fulfilled through mind and the essential
ingredient for rulership is the 22-47. Think about that. That‟s the essential ingre-
dient. You would think, given that we are logical, given that we are all on the 5/15
process, given that the 31/7 is the road of collective leadership, it‟s interesting to
note that the 47, which is the abstract answer, is the most important tool for ruler-
ship. In other words, rulership is based on the past, not on the future.
One of the things you see, for example, about all of what‟s left over of traditional
rulerships, if you look at the English constitutional monarchy, you will see that the
society is still permeated with the historical festivals, rights, and ceremonies that are
part of the experience of the past. The past is kept alive that way. Rulership is here
to ensure continuity. The continuity is secured from the past, not towards the fu-
ture. It‟s not about “We‟re going to get closer together in the future,” it‟s “We’re
here because we’ve been closer together ever since the past.” In other words, eve-
rything is put into that framework of the 47.

Grace
The 47 is a gate of oppression. One of the things about rulership is that by its very
nature is oppressive, whether it is a good ruler or not. All rulers are only good rulers
for some of the people and not all of the people. It‟s always like that. It‟s the na-
ture of the binary. It‟s the nature of the way the world works.
Remember, we‟re not talking about democracy here. We‟re not just talking about
politics. We‟re talking about ruling other people. These are people who need to rule
other people. They need to rule the roost. They need to be the ones who control
the family, control the job, and control whatever. There‟s an enormous pressure on
them to rule. Everything about rulership requires a certain amount of oppression.
So we have oppression and we have exaggeration and we have entitlement. You
begin to get a flavor of what kind of people these are.
Grace
And then they fool you because of grace. Grace is really sweet; they fool you. You
actually believe they‟re listening to you. It‟s one of the most extraordinary things
about listening. If you have a splenic ruler, they‟re going to hear you in the now.
“I‟m hungry, my family‟s hungry, we need food.” “Ok, Harry, give them some food.”
This isn‟t. This is the emotional left ear. It hears what it wants to hear depending
on its mood, and it doesn‟t hear everything until time has elapsed. So you go to
your emotional listening ruler and you say, “Look, I‟m hungry, my kids are hungry,”
and the ruler says to you, “Yes, we’re working on a poverty program. Go down to
that agency and you file your application.” And you can‟t eat the application.
So, there is something about the quality of this listening that has to be understood.
When you‟re telling a 22 about something, you have to recognize that they‟re not
hearing all of it. If you‟re in a bad mood and somebody tells you something, the only
thing that you hear is what makes your mood worse. You don‟t hear anything else.
They could have told you during that conversation that you‟re wonderful, they love
you and they‟re going to give you eight jillion dollars and you don‟t hear it. Maybe
the next day there‟s, oh, oh, they said something else.
But if you‟re in a bad mood, that‟s what you hear. If you‟re in a good mood and the
person on the other end is telling you that your Uncle Louie just got hit by a truck,
it‟s like, well, you hear the good side. There‟s going to be a reading of the will. You
don‟t get into “poor Louie is dead.” You do the next day. The wave moves. All of
sudden you feel bad about Louie. You really have to see that the left ear is very odd
in the way it hears.
So, when you‟re looking at what rulership is, see very clearly what kind of a force
this is. Those who are given power to rule us, you give them a lot of power, and
they will hold you under your thumb. Of course, all the poor human beings who
have this cross listening to this are going to get deeply depressed and I don‟t want to
depress them. Somebody has to rule.

When you look at the nature of the not-self—this is one of the most basic philosophi-
cal things for me—it‟s clear that the not-self needs to be lead by chains through the
rings in their noses. They have no idea what the hell is going on. The only thing you
can offer them is some kind of semi-reliable maia pattern that convinces them this is
the best they can have. The reality is that there is no individual freedom on this
planet. It doesn‟t exist in the illusion of democracies and it doesn‟t exist anywhere
else. It‟s just not there. The not-self is not free of anything. The not-self is a
trapped beast in a cage.
So the moment you take concepts like this—rulership—you see that in its application
in the larger world of the not-self, it‟s precisely what‟s necessary. They need to be
coerced; they do. Look at what happens. We have a classic example of that. We
have seen over the last several years what the fall of communism did to the former
Yugoslavia. While you had an oppressive rulership that was rooted in holding you
together, that was going to punish you severely if you stepped out of line—after all,
they spoke Serbo-Croatian, they actually spoke a language artificially created to
eliminate the ethnic hatreds, they were all forced to learn it and live together and
they had no ethnic crime; they had none of those problems.
Then the wall comes down. The old historical lines of rulership come to the surface—
the bogeymen that will throw you in jail if you even curse the name of the favored
leader. All those bogeymen are gone and all of a sudden you have chaos and mur-
der and horrors. You have the same thing in Iraq now. Saddam Hussein buried
people every day who didn‟t like him. Because of that, everybody was quiet and
peaceful. They put up with whatever they put with. There weren‟t any protesters in
the street.
This is the power of rulership. And look at what happens to the not-self when you
take it away—beasts, crazy, wild, the freedom to revenge. The not-self is the killer
monkey; not very clever and easily twisted. I‟m grateful for that. You cannot im-
agine, none of us can imagine, it‟s not possible for any of us to really imagine what
would happen to us in our societies if you took away the rulership forces that control
us. Take them away, and you see how quickly you want them back. I wouldn‟t want
to live on this island without any police around, I tell you. There would be absolute
chaos here. The island would be looted overnight, like the old days. The pirates
come and take everything away. They‟d take it all away.
So, one of the things to recognize about this is that, like everything else, it has its
place. What this gives you is a very depressing insight into the nature of humanity,
which is what it‟s all about. I don‟t want to depress you, but it‟s true. You really see
what it takes to hold us together. And you see all it takes to hold us together is
somebody to pretend they‟re listening; it‟s all it takes.
All it takes is somebody; if we‟re not satisfied with that, they will oppress us. In
order to keep us in line, they will bullshit us about what‟s possible and what‟s going
to happen and what we‟re going to get and who we are, the mother of all nations;
the crap that societies will swallow, the utter, unbelievable crap. What a wonderful
mechanism. When you think about it, it‟s spooky. Every time I turn on CNN it‟s like

One of the whole things about rulership is the recognition that it‟s Right Angle. Ru-
lership is about somebody‟s personal destiny. You come into the world and you‟re
here to rule. Whether it‟s, as I said,
ruling your mother or your father or
your brother or your sister, whatever
the circumstances of rulership you
want to look at, all of the strata, all 
of the permutations are here.
With the 1/3 we start with some-
thing very basic. Everything about
1s is that their first response in life is 
to check out what‟s established. It‟s

not like the 1/3 is a born revolutio-
nary; they become one. The
anarchy is unconscious. It‟s not like
they have access to it. And they
come into the world with a 1st line

Personality that assumes that the
world is solid, that their mother
loves them, that their father is
strong, on and on and on. They
come in with all these basic assump-
tions about what the foundation is supposed to be, that life is fair, that God is just.
Whatever those things are, they come in on that 1st line and they‟re ready to take it
all and accept it.
As a matter of fact, that‟s their cosmic dream of their Personality. The Personality
gets stuck with a fucked up vehicle. It‟s like the Personality saying, “Ah, come on
now.” It‟s like saying, “Look, I don’t want to drive your nose any more. Why do I
have to have another 3 vehicle? Is it really necessary that I have to suffer in anoth-
er 3 vehicle?” This is the whole thing about the 1. The 1 is saying, “Hey, look, all I
want is a smooth ride. The bridges are never down, the lights are always green.”
This is the 1; this is the way it should work. Here‟s the foundation, here are all the
bases.

So, when you come to the Cross of Rulership, that 1 is investigating all of the ways
of rulership. The 26 looks at the 44 and learns how to manipulate. The 45 looks at
the 21 and learns how to control. The 22 looks at the 12 and learns how to articu-
late. Whenever you‟re looking across from a gate to its harmonic, you can see the
pressure on it, the thing it wants to be.
So you can see the direction that the 1 child will go in. It will look at all of these
variations, trying to see what rulership is and trying to master it themselves to be a
ruler. But a 3rd line comes in. You cannot imagine how fast a baby on this cross
finds out it can rule its mother. It‟s amazing how fast this baby figures that out. It‟s
so fast. And after that, you have a relationship that‟s totally different forever. This
is their thing.
The moment the 1/3 sees that you‟re not really the ruler, you‟re finished. Anarchy is
a great thing. I‟m not talking about the way in which it‟s popularly understood. The
whole point of anarchy, strictly as a philosophy, is when you find something that
doesn‟t work, you tear it down. It doesn‟t mean you replace it. It‟s the most impor-
tant thing to understand about the anarchist. The 1/3 isn‟t necessarily going to
know what a better solution is. They simply know this is a shitty ruler. They know
right away. This is not correct.
The moment that it‟s not correct for the 1/3, the moment it‟s not a solid foundation,
they can never trust the authority of that parent again, ever. Think about that.
They will never trust their authority. Ten years later the mother is stomping in the
kitchen, “I‟m the boss,” and the child has a smirk on his face. “You‟re not the boss
of me.”
So you have to see when you‟re thinking about crosses, as I taught you when we
were dealing with just looking at somebody‟s design, always see them as a child.
When you‟re looking at a cross, always see it as an infant. Understand the force that
grows there; it‟s quite a force.

The 1/4
RAC Rulership 1
We know right away what the 1/4 is going to do. The 1/4 is going to try to compen-
sate for the 1/3. That‟s basically what it does. You have the 1/3 and the 1/4, and
the 1/3 discovers that the rulership is not perfect. That may not be a catastrophe, if
you know what I mean. It doesn‟t mean that if your mother loses authority with you
in a certain situation she‟s lost all of her authority. But remember, to the 1/3 it does
mean that. To the 1/4 that‟s kind of silly because they can‟t afford for a moment to
think that she‟s lost all of her authority. So the 1/4 is going to be the embodiment of
the same style of rulership.
When I was a teacher of young children 12-13 years old, when I would hear their
interaction with each other, I could simply tell the style of rulership they dealt with.
You can; they take it directly from their parents—little boys that are standing there

with their hands on their hips staring down. It‟s hilarious. You can just see their
father standing there. It‟s the same thing.
So when you‟re dealing with the 1/4, you have a carbon copy rulership style. One of
the things about Crosses of Rulership, when they come into the world, they align
themselves to who they see is the stronger force. If you‟re coming into a standard
Penta, if you‟re coming into a stable environment, mother and father, the infant
decides very, very early where the power is. That‟s what they align themselves to.
So when you‟re dealing with a 1/4, what you‟re going to see is if the mother is
stronger than the father, then the 1/4 will take on the rulership mannerisms of the
mother. They will deal with the father exactly the same way the mother deals with
the father, which pisses the father off to no end. But nonetheless, what are you
going to do. You have one of these, you deserve them. It‟s true of all of us.

The 2/4
RAC Rulership 1
It is very rare that 2/4s will rule on the outside. There is always a dilemma with a
4th line about its reach. You can see that in modern politics. If you have a politician
who has a 4th line in their Profile, you know that this is a politician who has a close
circle around them that is the filtering point to the outside. Their influence is in that
closed circle, and if they have a good close circle, it can become the manifested in-
fluence on the outside, but they don‟t have this direct power to the outside because
the 4 is always limitation. The 4 is about who you know. It‟s about being able to
influence those who are in your circle. It‟s about people who have direct contact
with you.
However, there is something that‟s very specific about the 2/4 and it has to do with
one of the basic things about their nature. They are homebodies. They love their
homes. When I say they “love their homes,” they love the stable environment of a
home. They have a hermit Personality. The home is a place where they can get
shelter in which they really feel secure and the forces on the outside don‟t impinge
on them.
At the same time, being a 2/4, being the hermit/opportunist having a place that‟s
stable also means that it‟s a place where others, over time, recognize that you‟re
there. It becomes that hub for you of people coming in. I‟ve made jokes about
2/4s, that if you have one as a child you‟d better start saving money because they‟re
not going to leave home, that they will inherent the house and they‟ll stay there
forever. One of my favorite jokes about the 2/4 is that if you do manage to fall in
love with one and you break down their barriers, and of course you have to live in
their house, don‟t move the furniture. Don‟t move anything. Don‟t change the place
of anything because nothing will annoy them more than the destabilization of that
inner environment.

Now, when you have a 2/4 on the Cross of Rulership, that can become quite obses-
sive. These are the ones who are really, “I rule here in this house. This is my
house, and you follow my rules in this house.” It‟s always so difficult because any
time you measure anything, it‟s so easy to assume that it can be a positive or a neg-
ative, but this is not what this really is about; it‟s just different. The potential of the
2/4 here is very different.
It‟s going to be less interested in the call. It‟s going to be much more interested in
maintaining the rulership within the household; much more interested. If you have a
child like this, they are really going to be driven to take control of the house. The
greatest threat to a 2/4 rulership is to come into the kitchen in the morning and find
out your parents have put your house up for sale. This is one of those great shatter-
ing experiences, particularly in this configuration.
All 2/4s suffer when there is any kind of transition. But again, the whole thing about
2/4 transition is that if they still have a community they can bond to, then it‟s going
to be all right; but nonetheless, 2/4s being the hermits like their safe, secure envi-
ronment.

The 2/5
RAC Rulership 1
If you ever meet a 2/5 on the Cross of Rulership, the one thing you‟re going to no-
tice is this incredible temptation to tell them they should really go out and do some-
thing because they could be so helpful. It‟s like you can‟t help but have this feeling
that they could really be useful and that they seem so useless. It‟s like, “You could
really make a difference.”
Of course, the thing that everybody loves about this cross is the illusion that the 22
gives you that they‟re really hearing what you have to say. I‟m a 12. I‟ve dealt with
22s all my life, and with an open emotional system the impact of a 22, anything that
defines my emotional system is very strong. I‟ve been aware of them, I‟ve dealt
with them, and I‟ve had them as colleagues, as friends, as lovers. They really don‟t
hear very much. They‟re listening to something else.
I don‟t what they‟re listening to. It‟s not that they don‟t take you in; they do. And
they take you in with grace. If you‟re a 12 and you‟re talking to a 22 and you don‟t
know the game, you would assume they‟re enthralled by what you have to say.
They‟re right in there on your articulated movement. But you really don‟t know what
they‟re hearing. I‟ve had so many times that I thought I said something and it
just…maybe a day later, two days later, three days later, four days later, depending
on their mood, some of the rest of it will sort of percolate up to the top.
The thing that is actually going on is that the 22 is listening to your tone. It‟s listen-
ing to the music of your voice. 22s love my voice. They don‟t care what I say. They
just listen to my voice; it helps them go to sleep at night, whatever the case may be;
they like the tone. This is one of the things about the 22 and the assumption, be-

Grace
cause they‟re listening to your music, because it‟s really like that, it‟s very creative,
it‟s very romantic, it‟s all of that. You get this sense of, “Wow, they really care, and
they‟re really listening.” Well, they are sort of in their way, but not the facts, not the
details, but the quality of the tone.
When you‟re looking at circuitry, the „support‟ within the tribe as a keynote—support
is a keynote—is all rooted in the ability of the tribe to be able to touch each other. If
you can‟t touch somebody, you‟re never going to get their support. It‟s as simple as
that. This is the basis of the tribe. It is in touch. When you‟re looking at the collec-
tive, the collective shares things through sight, through vision, through what they
see. This is the collective medium. But the individual, it‟s all acoustic, and not
acoustic for the value of the by-product of the noise. It‟s just for the beauty of the
noise. So the 12/22 can be a poet, can be a musician, can be somebody who just
loves the sounds.
It‟s the 12th gate that articulates. It‟s the 12th gate that‟s here to master the art of
the poetry of communication, to turn speaking into something that‟s beautiful, to
turn language into something that is music. That‟s what the glory of the 12 can be.
That‟s why we get the 12.4, we get the prophet, and we get this incredible ability
within the voice itself to having this enormous influence and power over the other.
Remember, this is the only channel in which the individual can reach out beyond its
freak realm, to make contact with a stranger, to bring mutation to others. And the
mutation isn‟t in what‟s said. It‟s in the music. You don‟t have to understand what
somebody‟s saying to know whether you like them or not, whether you trust them or
not as an impression, because we are deeply acoustic, all of us. We‟ve taken in so
much information from the tonal quality. We know that. You can say to somebody,
“I don‟t like you.” You can also say, “I don’t like you,” and on and on and on and on.
You change tone; you can do all of these things. Underneath any word are a million
gestures. It‟s in the tone.
So the magic of the 22 is that it reads the tone; it‟s not focused on what‟s precisely
being said. I‟ve had this throughout my career. I‟ve had so many people who say to
me, “I just like to listen to your voice,” which they assume is a compliment. It‟s not.
But nonetheless, I understand. I understand because that‟s the nature of the 22.
But don‟t be fooled by it. Don‟t be fooled by 22s when they look at you gaga and
they‟re taking in your rap. Because it doesn‟t mean at the end of it when you say
“so” that they have an answer for you. As a matter of fact, they may say, “About
what? Did you ask me a question? Was there a question in that?” Yes, there was a
question. “I didn‟t hear it. Are you sure you asked me a question?”
Anyway, if you‟re a 2/5, the assumption is that you‟re going to be the one who‟s
going to be in control. Now think about not just simply understanding profiles and
their relationship to crosses have subtleties, but think about this configuration. Im-
agine that you‟re a 2/5 and you‟re a Manifestor. You‟re a 2/5 Manifestor on this
Cross of Rulership. And everybody there is assuming that you should be in control.
But when you‟re a baby and you come into the world, you have the double whammy.
The first whammy is you come out of the womb and the mother says, “Oh, my God,

there‟s trouble coming.” This is the first thing, the Manifestor aura. This is a child
who‟s going to have to be controlled, this is a child who‟s going to be a problem, and
this is a child who‟s going to have to be punished. And then you have a child who
happens to be a 2/5 on the Cross of Rulership and the next thing you smell is this
child controlling you.
Of course, one of the ways the 22 operates in children as they‟re developing is they
pretend they‟re listening very intently to what you‟re telling them to do. While
you‟re doing that, you assume that it‟s all going to be fine after that. But this is the
Cross of Rulership. They know precisely how to listen, they know precisely what to
say, they know precisely what bullshit to put out, they know precisely what
precedent to pull from the past, and they know precisely what their sense of entitle-
ment gives them. If you‟re a non-energy type and you‟re a 2/5 on the Cross of Ru-
lership, there‟s less pressure.
One of the things about the nature of the 2/5 is that what‟s so important is self-
motivation. Nobody can call out a 2/5 to a role of rulership. You can only call them
to call themselves. It‟s one of the keys of understanding 2/5s and 5/2s; they must
call themselves. If they don‟t call themselves, it does not work. This is the classic
configuration of you can only help those who want to help themselves. You can tell a
2/5 everything they need to know, but unless they want to do it, they‟re not going to
do it.
Of course, we know from the not-self that they‟re held back from doing the very
things that would be healthy for them. So, it‟s a difficult situation and it‟s subject to
a great deal of projection. Again, one of the things that‟s common about 2/5s and
5/2s is their need for the security of their hermitage, their place where they can
isolated.
Often what you will get in the case of a 2/5 on this cross is somebody who ends up
being very difficult to ever be anything other than somebody who lives alone. And
only in being alone are they the ruler without having to motivate themselves to rule.
If they have an open emotional system with that 22, it would be terribly uncomforta-
ble for them to have to deal with rulership situations in which they would be cranked
up emotionally. And they would rather avoid that confrontation and whatever truth
would be a part of it.

The 3/5
RAC Rulership 1
On this cross, 3/5s are designed to rule. The projection is that they will. Of course,
they‟re going to try to, and they‟re going to have problems with rulership. They‟re
going to get into trouble. This is a classic problem place for the 3/5 because in deal-
ing with rulership, you‟re always dealing with the oppression of something or some-
one. You‟re always dealing with the challenge of confronting the other and control-
ling the other, which is not an easy thing to do. Of course, if you‟re a 3/5 and you‟re

going to make mistakes, then you‟re going to pay a price for that because it‟s not a
mistake that you alone are making for yourself.
Again, not being transpersonal means that you‟re not even really sensitive to the
consequences of the failed rulership for the other. You don‟t mind that your ruler-
ship fails. You‟re a 3, after all, you‟ll pick yourself up, and you‟ll go do something
else. It‟s ok. You don‟t mind. But the victims of your rulership and its failures mind
a lot. Of course, all of this is about what is going to be their reaction to the 5th line
unconscious.
Remember that the whole thing about the 5th line is that, in this context, if you can-
not provide practical rulership that‟s going to be beneficial, and if you can‟t provide
rulership at the right time that‟s going to be beneficial, then you are going to be
blamed. Your reputation is going to be destroyed and your opportunity to be a ruler
is going to be stripped away from you.
Obviously, 3/5s have an authority problem. They do. In this context they have a
big authority problem. If you‟re a 3/5 kid, there‟s always somebody in your life who
says to you, “What do you think that you should have my job?” And the 3/5 on this
cross is nodding their head saying, “Yes, I do.” “Well, all right, let‟s see what you
can do with it.” Hold your breath after that moment because of the nature of what it
is to be a 3.
On a positive side, if you look at this from the perspective of being awake, then you
can begin to see that herein lies the possibility for transformation of rulership. That
is, to be able to see what kinds of rulership fails; and not to give up rulership, but
just to make rulership more efficient. Remember, it‟s within the context of the cross.
So, if you‟re a 3/5 and you‟re running a repressive regime and you have certain
problems, you may learn how to get rid of those problems by being even more re-
pressive. There‟s no guarantee it‟s going to make you a better person.
So in dealing with the 3/5 in this configuration, what you‟re going to get is this trial
and error of rulership. Remember, it‟s going to start very young—the child who tries
to gain authority. It tries to grab it. Not only does it try to grab it, because that‟s
much more a dominion feeling, the whole thing about rulership is this sense of en-
titlement. “Nobody has the right to rule me. I was put on earth to rule,” which ac-
tually is true. But nonetheless, it‟s kind of obnoxious dealing with that in a five-year-
old.

The 3/6
RAC Rulership 1
With 3/6s and 6/3s, there is an enormous experimentation, experiential process that
they must go through in their first Saturn cycle. For a 3/6 who comes in on this
cross, depending on their Type, they‟re going to be an expression of the thematic of
their Type. They‟re going to be very angry as Manifestors, or very frustrated or very
bitter or very disappointed because it‟s going to pull it out of them.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
The one thing where the 3/6 and the 6/3 are most uncomfortable is with things that
demand they be stable and fixed. So whenever you see the 3/6 or the 6/3 on a
mutative cross, you see them at their best where they can jump into the plan or
change this or change this—these kinds of things where they‟ve had that opportuni-
ty. But the moment you see the 3/6 or the 6/3—I‟m not talking about all 3s now,
I‟m just talking about the 3/6 and the 6/3—on something that‟s very rigid, like ruler-
ship, you know what‟s going to happen to them both consciously and unconsciously.
They are going to meet anarchy within themselves in regards to rulership. They‟re
going to be deeply, deeply pessimistic, not only about rulers, but about ever even
having a potential to rule. And yet, they are being driven by their cross to see eve-
rything within the context of rulership.
Remember, your purpose focuses you in life. It took me a very long time in my life
to find out that I was a clarion, but my life was preparing me for that the whole way.
It was always there. I just didn‟t have any access to it, but it was always there; it‟s
always there for everyone. If you come in on the Cross of Rulership, every breath of
yours is a focus on rulership regardless of whether or not it reaches any level of
perception. It‟s there as a driving force. It is where you‟re supposed to be going.
So when you‟re a 3/6 or a 6/3 and you have to go through that constant instability,
it can be an enormous problem. At the best level, 3/6s and 6/3s can be very good at
advising rulers. And in that sense, gaining rulership that way. They really under-
stand the pitfalls of rulership, and they can be very good at figuring out the trial and
error of what works. In other words, what 26 do you deliver to the tribe? How much
manipulation do you make? Do you tell them that Saddam Hussein can deliver an
atomic bomb to your neighborhood in 12 minutes? Or do you tell them that there
are 300,000 people who have been executed and it‟s about time to clean up the
regime?
Where are you going to put the pitch? This is a perfect 3/6, 6/3 thing. They can
smell propaganda that won‟t work, that won‟t manipulate the society because
they‟ve been there. They‟re great suckers at first. Give me a 3/3 and I will get
them to do anything, honestly. I exaggerate; they would really have certain connec-
tions to me, but any 3/3 is open to the ultimate folly of trial and error.
Fortunately, you don‟t have to be awake to be intelligent enough not to be a fool. A
lot of 3s are blessed with good intelligence and it often saves them from the ultimate
foolishness. But still, if you‟re a 3/3 it is natural for you to blunder and to blunder
big time because you have to deal with both the Design and Personality combination.
So they‟re really good at smelling it out. They know what kind of listening is impor-
tant in order to control others. They know what stories from the past to use, to
inspire others because they have found out which stories don‟t inspire.
“Oh, I hate that story about great-great-grandfather, George,” whatever the case
may be. “Let’s upgrade this, and let’s have a new pitch.” In other words, they can
be very, very good at understanding what doesn‟t work in rulership. Given that it‟s
in their characteristics, if you take a 6/3 Projector who wakes up to the recognition of
what they are as a Projector—their power of guidance, their gift of recognition, their

ability to be recognized—here‟s a classic place for one. They can then become
guides of how to—the Machiavelli‟s of the world. They‟re the ones who can write the
story, write the hidden rules of rulership for the ruler, be the power behind the
throne, but actually be the throne itself—the power of rulership.
Remember something: Rulers are very, very interested in what the people don‟t like.
Don‟t ever think they‟re not. They measure it all the time. Nobody pays more atten-
tion to polls than politicians. They are measuring all the time. What they are really
measuring and looking for are breaking points. You get a poll that says 11% of the
population doesn‟t like the destruction of the national forest, whatever. That‟s not
enough to get anybody to even think about doing something about it.
So that gets listening level number four. And you need a manager to tell you how to
listen to these various levels. If you have something where 80% are screaming
about something, you‟d better have your immediate listening agenda that you im-
mediately will do something about it. The immediate 26 tells the tribe you‟re out
there, “Yes, we’re going to fix it, we’re going to do it right away. The President or
the Prime Minister is going to fly down and take care of it personally.”
It‟s all about the trial and error process of rulership. The people who should be
frightening to all of you are not the natural rulers who come into the world and are
just here to naturally rule; it‟s all these tricky bastards who teach them how to do it
even better. And not only teach them how to do it better, but actually make it all
more oppressive and horrible for the rest of us. Oh well, what to do.
You have to recognize, and I try to make that clear, whenever you‟re dealing with
the not-self—and that‟s most human beings—if these things are going to look bad,
they will. You‟re always going to see the ugly part of this. Again, the only difference
is that it‟s either going to be terribly ugly or just minor ugly, but it‟s the not-self,
after all. And a 3/6 on this Cross of Rulership, in most cases will never get to the
potential of being a guide of rulers.
In most cases, they‟ll end up in jail. When I say things, I have to be careful; there
are all kinds of jails in life. You can fight authority so much that the authorities will
control you. There are all kinds of prisons that get imposed on us. If you go
through that kind of trial and error process, there is often very little redemption wait-
ing for you because the sins of the first 30 years are often sins that you can never
stop paying for, particularly in rulership. There are people who get very, very, very
angry with mistakes in rulership. And I mean that on the most mundane level—two
or three kids going to do something, one of them gets them into it and it doesn‟t
work out, boy that kid has trouble. It‟s just the way these things work.

The 4/6
RAC Rulership 1
We come to the end of the Right Angle to the 4/6. All 4s have the ability to rule
their friends. They do naturally because they‟re naturally influential to their friends.

They‟re naturally influential to their community. The moment you bring together the
rulership and the 4 Personality particularly, you have somebody who has a natural
quality of rulership and they‟re not offensive.
One of the nice things about the 4/6 voyeur configuration is that though they exert
rulership power, they do so from the fringes. It‟s not like they want to get pulled
into being the real ruler. Yet, at the same time, they have the advantage of being
seen as somebody who has the potential of being a role model leader. The whole
nature of the 6th line is ultimately about leadership, trust. This is the line of wisdom,
this is the transition, and this is the role model.
So when you‟re dealing with an opportunistic role model on the Cross of Rulership
then you know what you‟re going to get. What you have is somebody who, with the
right opportunity, could be a role model ruler. Again, not to always take this in any
sense of being political or a big stage for this kind of performance. See that this
rulership quality—the child, for example, in the family where everybody is influenced
by that child even though the child is not given a natural rulership role, but in a mo-
ment of crisis or need within the family, they will turn to that child. The opportunity
will be there for that child to take on the role model role.
4/6s in large families, no matter where they are in that family chain, other than be-
ing the very, very youngest, they often take that de facto role of being the substitute
parent when the parents aren‟t there. That‟s what this is all about. This is the
voyeur on the outside looking at the way things are done, and again the value of the
4/6 as the voyeur is their 6th line process. You go through that Saturn cycle of see-
ing what doesn‟t work, you go up on the roof and you get your objectivity, that‟s the
moment on the roof where a 4/6 has a natural potential to be influential and on this
cross to be an influential ruler.
But becoming a ruler is as difficult as having sex for a 4th line being in the sense that
it‟s not just, “Hi, there, let‟s do it,” and it can never be. Rulership is not something
that can come out of nowhere as an opportunity for the 4/6 on this cross. In other
words, they would have to be inside already in that process long before that would
be consummated as them being finally given that role itself.
If you have a club and the club is in crisis, maybe it can‟t raise enough money or
whatever the case may be, you wouldn‟t bring this 4/6 in from the outside to try to
fix that. It would never work; it would never happen. But if they were there from
the beginning, and being what they are from the outside having their influence, oth-
ers would talk to them about things. In the end, everybody has a sense of them as
being an important cog in that whole structure even though they wouldn‟t be directly
involved in the day-to-day operations of how that club works.
But the moment that club would have a problem, the present head of the club,
people have problems with them, the person has to move or step down, the natural
person that everyone would look at is this 4/6. So these are the opportunities that
are always there for the 4/6. It‟s why the basic credo of the 4th line always remains
the same: Don’t make love to strangers, don’t allow anybody to come into your life
unless they’ve been introduced to you. Don’t leave your lover until you have another

Grace
lover, don’t leave your job until you have another job, and don’t leave your house
until you have another one to go to. These are the basic rules of the 4th line.
So, as a 4th line being in this context, the 4/6 on this cross, sooner or later, based on
your community, you‟ll be given a chance to rule it, sooner or later. And whether
you‟re going to be the ruler of two people or a thousand people or the leader of good
guys or bad guys or whatever the case may be, your opportunity will arise. It
doesn‟t mean you take it, characteristics being what they are, the not-self being
what it is. But, you‟re not given a cross and then told you have no opportunity to
experience it. Everybody gets their shot; it‟s there in your life.
So for this being, that opportunity will always arise out of something it has been a
part of. The 4th line always needs foreplay. No foreplay, no action. The same thing
is true for the 4/6 in terms of rulership; no jumping. Aside from that, it‟s Right An-
gle. The moment you‟re dealing with Right Angle, you‟re dealing with rulership that
is about the ruler. It‟s about the ruler‟s trip; it‟s not about the people.

The 4/1
When we get to the Juxtaposition we have the Juxtaposition Cross of Grace. The
moment you get to the Juxtaposition, something very, very interesting happens
because when you look at the Design shift, what comes in is the 11 and the 12. Now
the 11 and 12 are already a magical
polarity. It‟s in the 12th gate—I‟ve
mentioned this before because of
the 22 dealing with the 12th gate,
 dealing with the gate of articula-
tion—but also to recognize that the
transformation of the human larynx,
the mutation of the human larynx,
this is a 12th gate phenomena. It
 gave us the ability to be able to
articulate with the complexity that

we have.
You can tell the difference. There
are still tribes in Africa that commu-
nicate through clicks. This goes

back to our original language skills.
They just make clicks. It‟s actually
quite amazing how complex that
language is, these clicking sounds.

But that‟s the limitation. What happened to us was we had this enormous expansion
of the vocal chamber itself with the dropping of the larynx. What this allowed for is
much more flexibility in the frequencies that would come out of our mouth when we
were making sounds. Ultimately, this would lead to our ability to be able to manipu-
late sounds into very, very complex packages—articulation. But if you look at the
other side—remember whenever you‟re looking at the wheel, at these chops, when-
ever you‟re looking at the hexagram exactly opposite,
you‟re always looking at the chop of the hexagram simply
being the inverse of it; it‟s the opposite of it.
So, the mutation in the 12 has a deep impact on the 11 and
the 11 is the ultimate gate of teaching. We know it is
Gate 12 Gate 11
Peace, the gate of ideas. But if you look at the 12.4 and the
11.4, there you see the magic. The 12.4 is the prophet. The 11.4 is the most im-
portant line of teaching which has three attributes: The teacher, the guru, the sage.
So this relationship between the 11 and 12, the ability to be able to articulate and
raise people up, and on the other end, the capacity through ideas to be able to instill
in others and teach in others and transform others through information.
The moment you get into this Juxtaposition, you really make quite a jump. You
come into a configuration in which there is a definition. You
can see that the 12/22 is defined, and in the defining of that
12/22 you come up with something very different as a be-
ing. This is a real jump.
Whenever we‟re dealing with Juxtaposition, we are dealing
with a fixedness of the 4/1. Grace—it is the joke and it is
what I love most of all of being an individual, about being a
freak. If you come into the world like me and you‟re a real
freak, all you really want is for others to leave you alone.
So what you learn very early in life is not to judge them,
either. I have never judged anyone. If you want to be a
freak or a nut or a weirdo or a killer or a maimer or this or
that, hey, the moment I decide that doesn‟t have a place in the world is the moment
I know I have no place in this world.
One of the things to recognize at the deepest level of what it is to be an individual is
that they bring to all of what we call “tolerance.” If it weren‟t for individuality, there
would be no tolerance. The collective is not tolerant. It operates according to the
majority. The majority is not tolerant of the minority. It is the way it is. Tribes are
not tolerant. Tribes will never feel comfortable with other tribes. They are not natu-
rally tolerant. They are naturally defensive.
Only individuality carries with it tolerance. That isn‟t to glorify it, by the way. It‟s
for its own self-preservation. It‟s tolerant of others because it wants others to be
tolerant of it. I didn‟t want to ever interfere with anybody‟s life because I‟d be
damned if I was going let anybody interfere with mine. It‟s something the individual
learns because if they don‟t learn it are they ever going to suffer at the hands of the
tribe and the collective because they don‟t fit in.

GATE 22
Grace
So when you‟re looking at the Cross of Grace—it has a beautiful name, it‟s a really
delightful channel—these are beings who are so concerned about being left out that
all they do is allow everybody else to take them in. Now, think about that. This is
just the pure 12/22 at work. Remember, the 12/22 is the only possibility for the
individual to mutate the other. It‟s the only place where the individual is designed to
meet the stranger, to impact the stranger, to transform the stranger. Yet, the deep-
est concern of the individual is that they are not treated as a freak and an outsider,
that they‟re given their space, that they‟re allowed to go their way without being
controlled by the collective or tribal forces. And yet, the collective and tribal forces
control everything.
On the Cross of Grace, what you get is the deepest and most subversive of human
beings because they will not rock any boat. They won‟t. The 12/22 in that situation,
in order not to be ostracized, in order to live out its pure nature which is to be open
to mutating the other, they will simply listen, gracefully take in, even repeat precise-
ly what‟s around them at any given time in the social context. Now, that doesn‟t
mean they don‟t go home as an emotional Manifestor and smack their fist into the
wall, because they do, but not in public.
12/22s can take in anything. When you see them, their assumption is that they are
one with the other; they never are. They‟re freaks, after all. This is a real individu-
al. In the very anger of having to pretend to be part of the social environment to
protect themselves, whenever you see these people, they try to cover themselves
with a sense of normalcy. When you capture them when they‟re really in their own
world, only then do you have a chance to see what they really are.
Usually, the only way you get to meet these people is through their creative process
because they‟re naturally creative. Whether that creative process is that they have
an extraordinary collection of music they listen to, or they‟re musicians or artists or
whatever—and when I say that I don‟t mean they have to make a living from it, it‟s
just that that‟s the movement and spirit in their lives—that‟s where you can get a
sense of what these beings really feel.
When I talk about romance in Human Design Sexuality and we look at the 12/22, the
first thing I talk about with the 12/22 is unrequited love. I talk about the capacity
within the 12/22 to love things it cannot have and to glorify that love. And one of
the things about the 12/22 is that it will put up with any social circumstance. That‟s
its grace. It will put up with any, any social circumstance.
So in many ways, these are beings you never get to read. They‟re really difficult to
access. Again, given somebody‟s design, we‟re only looking at the four arms of the
cross, we‟re not looking at somebody‟s characteristics. We don‟t see how that emo-
tional system to the Throat is going to be integrated with the rest of the design, and
so forth and so on. We‟re always going to have variables because of characteristics.
But in the end, when you come to a 4/1 on this cross, they will simply follow their
root. Every time you see them go into the outside world, the stranger world, what
you get to see is their deep, social capacity to make people believe that they‟re not
only listening, but caring about what they‟re listening about. It‟s an amazing trait.

I‟ve had a number of 12/22s in my life and I was always astonished at the transition
I watched them go through with others and what they were like with me and how
different they were as a being, and the kinds of comments that came out of them
you‟d never imagined were brewing in them while they were in that social environ-
ment taking in all that nice listening.
Again, you have to recognize something about the 12/22—like the 2nd line of the 22,
Charm School—you really have to see that this all is a seduction. There‟s this wave
over the top, because it‟s very hard for freaks to sell themselves to the outside. If I
didn‟t have the 12th gate, I would really have a lot of trouble. It‟s very difficult for
freaks to be able to reach out beyond themselves without that kind of tool. And
that‟s what the 12/22 does. It gives individuality its only chance to seem to be
harmless. And then do you get whacked. That‟s the whole thing. The 12/22 lays
over this chimera of grace and concern and listening and warmth. It‟s all great, but
they‟re mutating you at the same time.
This is the way the individual gets it across. They get across because they are able
to use this facility to fool the other into not thinking that this is really going to make
a difference. In the same way that the 22 doesn‟t really hear you, you don‟t really
recognize that you‟re open to deep mutation the moment you‟re dealing with them.
This is the trick; this is how they get into the doorway and change you.

The 5/1
We get to the Left Angle Cross of Informing and right away things go off in your
head because we know this is the basic strategy of the adult Manifestor. So if you‟re
an adult Manifestor in this cross, you‟re cooking! You really are. Informing is very
important because it is the natural by-product of finding out the problems in ruler-
ship.
In other words, the Right Angle is research and the Left Angle is propaganda. And
the Left Angle can take advantage of what‟s been learned by the Right Angle. So I‟m
a 5/1, my Personality learns from my unconscious. My unconscious is connected to
the Right Angle experience; my Personality is connected to the transpersonal Left
Angle experience. There are all these communication tracks working in us.
So, when you‟re looking at this hexagram and how grace is applied, how that listen-
ing capacity—because again remember, it goes back to the way in which the 22 lis-
tens and the way in which it fools you in its capacity to listen. We go through the
Right Angle configuration in which basically we get through a process of investigating

Grace
what rulership is and how to rule. That is not the same as getting into the Left Angle
where you take advantage of that knowledge and you add something else.
What you add is the informing. The informing is not directly related to rulership
because you can inform against the ruler. After all, when you look at the word “in-
form” this is something to understand about the nature of manifesting. The adult
Manifestor is to inform. Informing means is you simply give others notice. But it
doesn‟t tell you that you give everyone notice. It is about giving notice.
So, think about informing. On this Cross of Informing, all of this is an extension of
everything that started with the presence of the 45 in the Right Angle. Remember
that the whole thing about the 45
was education. If you‟re going to
rule the tribe, you have to educate
the tribe in order that everybody
 benefits and the tribe stays togeth-
er. Yet, the moment we go to the
Left Angle, we actually get the
teacher; we actually get the articu-
lation. We actually get all of that.

What we get is that rulership at the

transpersonal level can never be
absolute. If you‟re Right Angle,
your personal destiny rulership can
be absolute. But if you‟re Left An-
gle, it‟s not possible because you‟re

built in to have transpersonal con-
siderations. Those transpersonal
considerations change the nature of
the game. They don‟t eliminate
rulership, but informing is the prin-
ciple is that everyone has the right to know. These beings embody that. This is the
expression of mutation to everyone articulated as a teacher that everyone has the
right to know.
For example, in our sophisticated western, constitutional democracies, the citizen
has the right to know what the government is doing. The citizen has the right to
know, even to see the secrets of the government delayed over time, but we still
have a right to information. That right to information is built into this Left Angle
cross. But more than that, informing has many values. It also includes tattletaling—
informing on someone.
All of this is connected to power, rulership, and dominion, all of these themes we‟ve
been moving through in this stage through the wheel. Informing is a way to control
those in power. In the modern context we don‟t call it informing, we call it leaks.
These are leaky people. You find out, because you‟re on the inside, that the gov-
ernment has an assassination squad. You don‟t want to end government rule be-

cause you know the killer monkeys will all go bananas, but you also don‟t want the
government to become just a bigger killer money.
On this cross you inform. On this cross you leak it. You tell some journalist that you
know the government is paying for a hit squad. The moment you do that, rulership
has to compensate. You have all of those things, all of the dynamics that go on.
This is teaching. And it‟s teaching people not to be gullible. Nobody can teach you
about gullibility better than the 22, nobody. Gullibility is actually in the 16. It‟s
there. Part of one of the great skills we have is to fool people. If you don‟t fool
people, the not-self, you often don‟t get anything done. So, this is all a balancing
act.
Here when you‟re looking at this configuration, what you really have to see is when
you have a 5/1 Manifestor on this cross, oh boy, they‟re going to be screaming all
over the place. It‟s great for them, “I want to inform you that…” Now, if you‟re a
child and you come in on this cross and you‟re not-self, you‟re going to be resented.
“Johnny took the chocolate again.” They end up in a lot of trouble, and nothing is
worse than a 5/1. The 5/1 screams out that Johnny took the chocolate and the 5/1
ends up with so much trouble for that. And a bad reputation for the rest of his
school life—he‟s a snitch. All he or she can say when they go home is, “Can we
change schools? Can we move? Can we find another place?”
The other thing about the 5/1 is they are really the best informers in the sense that
they have a deep foundation so they can really inform you about things in detail.
Remember, this is very much a teaching cross. These are beings who are really here
to let you know what‟s actually going on. Remember, that informing is really about
telling you things you don‟t know.
That‟s one of the most important things about his cross. After all, it‟s mutative; it‟s
individual. It‟s about telling you what‟s new. If there is a mutation within the gov-
ernment and suddenly it‟s going in the wrong direction, it‟s going to tell you what‟s
new; it‟s going to inform you that the mutation is taking place. It‟s going to inform
you to prepare you. It‟s not going to tell you about anything that‟s old. The whole
point of this cross is that it‟s really is here to let everyone know about something
that‟s changed that people don‟t know about.
All of us are impacted by movements, whether they‟re clothing movements, music
movements, all kinds of things. How do we know? How do you suddenly know that
something is in? It‟s always amazing. You pick up magazines and they say what‟s in
this week, and they give you a list. Underneath they tell you what‟s out, and they
give you a list. Who knows what‟s in? How does a garage band buried in the back
woods of Ohio suddenly become in.
This is all about informers. They‟re not sales people. Nothing sells something better
than somebody‟s testimonial. You can have the most beautiful pitch person saying,
“This is the greatest product ever.” But you get some scraggly old guy hanging on
the back porch saying, “You know, I have this and it‟s just wonderful,” and every-
body loves them.

We need to be informed; we need informers. They‟re the ones who keep us in
what‟s new. Remember, the moment that something is new it belongs to the collec-
tive. So the job of informing is to put things into the collective. I started my work in
Human Design with the 12/22. It‟s great to have a 22 to my 12. Suddenly, the new
is there in the collective, and this is the magic of informing. You take a mutation and
you put it into the collective, it‟s no longer the outsider, it‟s no longer the freak and it
will change everybody. Tune in, turn out, and drop out. It goes right through the
whole society. Somebody informs you, you have the message, something new is in
the air and everybody grabs it.
So the moment you can be an informer—imagine how powerful these beings are.
Not because they seem powerful in life, simply because when they say things it has
that effect. They tell you things that have that effect because that‟s what they‟re
here for.

The 5/2
LAC Informing 1
When you‟re dealing with a 5/2, they are going to have to be self-motivated to do
that. Otherwise, they‟re not; there‟s just no chance that they‟re going to do that.
They keep themselves informed. They‟re the ones who have an antenna for that
transition and actually know it‟s going to take place. They don‟t even have the de-
sire to tell you, “I told you so.” They don‟t inform you at all. And if, five years later
and you‟re having a conversation with them, it suddenly occurs to you that they
actually knew that that thing was going to happen beforehand and they never told
you, you want to kill them on the spot. If they don‟t motivate themselves, they‟re
not going to tell you, they‟re not going to inform.
There‟s nothing worse than being a 5/2 or a 2/5 Manifestor. You really have to want
to inform to inform. It‟s not easy. Then “why bother.” I know that myself as a 5
when I inform people doesn‟t mean I actually do anything other than live as myself.
Because the result of that is they‟re still going to project on what I‟m telling them.
It‟s not like I get to say it and it‟s all done and everybody goes, “Thank you very
much.” I inform and the only reward is I am myself, because I‟m still going to get all
kinds of crap. A 5/2 knows that. A 5/2 says, “Hey, I have nothing to prove. I don’t
have to go through that nonsense; I don’t want to do that.”
It‟s amazing how many 5/2s know things that nobody knows about. They can be
such extraordinary beings. The biggest joke is that many of them don‟t even know
that they know; really, because they‟re naturals. Naturals don‟t often understand
how talented they are, how clever they are, how beautiful they are. They really
don‟t. It‟s like: “Me? No, I’m not going to inform anybody.” It‟s part of their game.

The 6/2
LAC Informing 1
This is a classic position for a 6/2. Sixes are here to be the ultimate authority for the
tribe and the ultimate authority for the collective. They‟re even here to be accepted
as authorities for individuals as long as they attain that place of wisdom. It is their
role to be the role model. Because that‟s their role, they‟re given the trial of having
to go through the three cycles in life. Those three cycles are intended to be able to
development them to that point. They go through the subjective, they learn the
objective, they go from pessimism to optimism and ultimately they transcend the
binary and live as a whole example of whatever they happen to be an example of.
In the 6/2 configuration, this is one of the great crosses of teaching. A 6/2 on the
Cross of Informing can be of enormous value to their communities and their socie-
ties. Not only that, but deeply creative in their ability to be able to teach. It doesn‟t
mean they will get there because, again, they are a 2nd line at the unconscious level;
they do not want to study. They don‟t see the necessity of study.
Where they tend to be teachers of that level is not in the formal sense of the teacher
as we think of, but rather the experiential sage, rather than the didactic teacher.
The experiential sage is something that is really important here in the 6/2 configura-
tion. This is a role model who can really make a difference. This is somebody who
will have the courage to speak out when others don‟t and without an agenda. It‟s
not like they‟re speaking out for something.
If you‟re like me, a 5/1, you speak out for a reason. You‟re driven to prove your 1.
If you‟re a 6/2, you do not speak out for a reason. You speak out because that‟s
what happens as a role model. Somebody says to you, “Is this ugly?” And you say
“Yes.” And the moment you say “yes,” there‟s no agenda to that, but it may end up
having enormous impact on the society.
So, these can be very important teachers in life. All of it is dependent on how well
you prepare a child for the 3rd line nature: What it means to deal with 3rd line
themes, how to understand that this is not failure, that this is just a process you‟re
here to learn, this is your way of learning, you‟re always going to be able to get up
again, you learn that, you get to see that.
Every child who‟s a 3, once they‟re told that, gets to recognize that they really are
tough, that being knocked down doesn‟t bother them and they do get back up. If
they see that this is not something to be concerned about, they don‟t get frustrated
over it; they don‟t suffer over it. Of course, if you have a very wise 6/2 on this cross
who‟s going to be able to be a natural guide for us, then you cannot have that with-
out having somebody who has learned to see the beauty of trial and error, and is the
by-product of that trial and error.

When you‟re dealing with a 6/3, one of the things to understand is that you can in-
form people, but the moment you inform people of the truth, what do you get? Cri-
sis. So the 6/3 is up there saying, “Yes, they really need to be told.” On the other
side they say, “Ah, the shit’s going to hit the fan.” One foot on one side, one foot on
the other, what are you going to do?
There are so many things for a 6/3 that they could inform. They know so many
things that don‟t work. They know so many things that don‟t work that nobody
knows about. They know that there is a certain poison being dumped into the at-
mosphere in a village somewhere. They know; nobody else knows that—but if I tell
them, ah, the chaos.
This is the whole thing about dealing with the not-self killer monkey. You want to
treat it with respect. You want it to have a nice cage, be well fed. You want to treat
it with respect. So much respect that you‟re even willing to give it information it
doesn‟t really need to know in order to make it feel like it‟s a part of a fairer society.
You really want to treat them well. And then you tell them. And what do you get?
Trouble. What to do.

Introduction
All of us think about the 36th gate in isolation from its crosses; that‟s been our train-
ing, so you think about the gate of Crisis, you think
about the channel of Transitoriness, you think about all
of that collective process, the sexuality that is there, the
emotional crisis system that is there, all of that stuff
that‟s built in the 36 that we all think about when we
see 36. Not only that it‟s the Darkening of the Light, it‟s
the gate of crisis. It carries all of these qualities.
And yet, if you look at the Right Angle cross you can see
the sublime beauty that‟s structured here on the 36,
which is Eden. When you look at this what you see is
that the 6 and the 36 are paired with the 11 and the 12.
This is all about teaching. It‟s all about learning and
teaching. Crisis is one of the best teachers we have.
If you im-
agine that
the channel 35/36 is about the attain-
ment of experience—that‟s what it is, it‟s
about attaining experience—then you will
see that what the 36th gate represents is
inexperience. And the 35th gate
represents experience, the progress.
When you move from inexperience to
experience, you‟re always going to have
crisis. But crisis doesn‟t have to be a
dirty word.
There are certain gates, certain attributes
that have this quality in which we take
them in, they‟re already prejudiced.
Crisis is already a bad word, and it‟s not.
It is inexperience seeking experience.
And inexperience will make mistakes;
inexperience will have its problems on
the road to experience. And those prob-
lems on the road we call a crisis. But it
helps you to understand with more sensi-
tivity that somebody who carries the 36th
gate, inherent in that gate is that this is a valuable process, an essential learning, a
teaching process.

The 1/3
The Right Angle Cross of Eden is such a nice name. Being in the naming business is
a funny trip. This is a really nice name because it‟s so perfect for this cross. Basical-
ly, once you‟ve been informed you can be free. I inform you about the nature of
Design and mechanics and your Strategy. Once you‟re properly informed, you can
be free. It‟s one of the things to recognize.
But freedom is the right to have a crisis. It‟s built into it. As a matter of fact, that‟s
one of the most exciting things about being free because you really, honestly don‟t
know what‟s going to happen. That‟s the ultimate freedom. The ultimate freedom is
you have no idea what‟s going to happen, and that‟s the ultimate inexperience. I
consider myself to be a real innocent. I have no idea what‟s going to happen, none
whatsoever. Life has shown me over
and over again that I have no idea
what‟s going to happen. It just hap-
pens. This is the magic of freedom.
The magic of freedom is like the 
insect, there‟s no tomorrow.
So the moment you‟re informed is
the moment you have a problem.
That‟s why this is so wonderful. If

you could imagine that the informing

is God and the Cross of Eden is Adam
and Eve, and there is God saying,
“Here‟s the story, now, piss off, go
your way, do your trip, let‟s see how
you do.” Step on the road to free-
dom. So everybody who comes in 
on the Cross of Eden, there is some-
thing for them to be thrown out of.
Whether they‟re thrown out of their
family or thrown out of school or
thrown out of their job, whether they lose everything—children who grow up in the
middle class and there‟s a crisis in the economy and they end up in a welfare
house—all of these kinds of things where the informing shatters the security. There
you are, out on your own in the world.
I like Cross of Eden people. They‟re very interesting. They all have such great sto-
ries to tell about their fall from grace. Do you get it? Isn‟t that wonderful? You
move from the 22 and you come into such a gorgeous cliché, the fall from grace. It
is. By Western mythology, the moment we put on these costumes, we fell from

grace—making love and eating made us bad. Then we have to go through the whole
redemption story and the whole movie.
The End of the First Half of the Quarter of Initiation
So, when you‟re looking at Eden, you‟re looking at a certain kind of being. This is
the end of the first half of this Quarter. Everything about the Quarter of Initiation
mystically is that this is where we
come into form. This is our place of
return as a witness. We are the
witness returning in this Quarter.
What we‟re looking at in that confi-
guration of the first eight hexa-
grams, or in the first house, if you
will, are the foundations of the mind
process. We complete it with the 36
which is the tradition of the garden,
and we are given the beginnings of
knowledge to begin the mental jour-
ney. The true mental journey is
going to be expressed in the next
eight hexagrams. That‟s the next
side of it.
So here in the 36, we have some-
thing very special. It‟s not about
just having the preparations and the
tools of mind. It‟s about the appli-
cation of mind to initiate others, which is why, when we get into the next eight hexa-
grams, we get to the core of this Quarter which is the 25 and the 51 because this
Quarter is named after them. In other words, we have this initiation field that is in
the middle of this structure.
So, this is a very important point. This is a point that says the mind thing has a
group quality. This is what we‟ve seen in the first eight hexagrams, but in the end,
you‟re the witness on your own. You‟re going to have to deal with all of this all by
yourself, on your own. It‟s one of the things to recognize about the mind. The mind
is the most isolated part of us. It‟s not like our skin. It‟s really isolated; it‟s really
locked in its own trip, its own thing, and its own world.
So, the Cross of Eden is: Go out there and do two things. Multiply, the 36th gate is
the gate, sexually, of just pure penetration, it‟s penetration for the sake of penetra-
tion, it‟s penetration for the experience, to get away from inexperience, go forth and
multiple, Cross of Eden. But more than multiply; go forth and become wise. Seek
knowledge.

You come in on this cross, that‟s where you have to go. If you‟re a 1/3 on the Cross
of Eden, anything that will bring a fall from grace will come. You‟re the perfect se-
tup. There‟s nothing better than a 1/3 Cross of Eden. They love that freedom, once
they‟re clear, the freedom to make a mistake, the freedom to change the rules, the
freedom to remove what is useless. There‟s nothing better for a 1/3 than to be on

ready for them.
The other thing about the Cross of Eden is that it is an indication of how difficult life
can be. This is really about getting into the world, being the world, being everything
in the world, filling in all the nooks and crannies of experience in the world. Go out
there and do it. So people who come in on this cross want to go out there and do it,
and they do. Not because they‟re consciousness is saying, “I want to go out there
and do it,” it‟s that they‟re pushed out. Cross of Eden people are always being
pushed out of something. They‟re just pushed out. “No, you can‟t ride on this one;
you go make your own way.” And 1/3s are equipped for it. They can stand up and
say, “Well, your way was shitty anyway and it didn’t work.”
They‟re fine; they‟re the natural victims of being thrown out of paradise. They‟re
perfect. Not only that, they think they deserved it. The not-self 1/3 on the Cross of
Eden—their family loses all its wealth and suddenly they‟re poor. They assume it‟s
their fault because this is what they desire. This is what they got.
If you ever have the opportunity to hire a Cross of Eden, do so. These beings are
trying to get back to paradise their way. They‟re hard-working. They can deal with
anything that‟s there in the world. The only thing is they carry this chip on their
shoulder. This chip on their shoulder that it could have been so much easier; it could
have been so much smoother. It could have been so much better. And they never
get rid of this “could have and so much,” because they lost it and they‟re always
trying to get it back.
You can‟t ever get paradise back anymore than you can crawl back into the womb;
it‟s a one-way street. This is the law of the Einstein dimensions. Time is unidirec-
tional; we travel in one direction. It‟s a one-way street; there is no going back. And
when you fall from grace, you only land when you die. You‟re always falling from
that grace. But then, after all, we are here to see the world for what it is. This is
rooted out of informing. We‟re here to live the world as it is, for what it is, the ugli-
ness, the beauty, the all of it. If we weren‟t pushed out of things, there would be
very few things for us to find. So, these creatures, they‟re pushed out.

The 1/4

When you throw the 1/4 out of paradise, they cry their whole life. You take away
from them what was good for them—and remember it doesn‟t have to be so dramat-
ic. Just moving your house, for a 1/4 on this cross, it‟s spooky; everything is lost.
And for the rest of their life, they‟ll talk about how good they felt in that house. If

they‟re really obsessed, they‟ll even try to buy it at some point, only to discover it‟s
now a rundown neighborhood full of crack dealers, but nonetheless.
All the 1/4s that I‟ve met—I have a 1/4 who‟s still in my life who does work for me
many years now, and it‟s just so obvious how difficult it can be for them if they‟re
not aware, how rigid their world is. If you‟re a 1/4 and you‟re sent out of paradise,
you just keep moving. You keep on trying to get back to that place and the only
thing that keeps you moving is that you keep on trying to get back to that place.
It doesn‟t have to be the physical environment. The most common thing, because
there‟s a lot of it—crosses are spread out through the population—is divorce. What
divorce does to a child who‟s on this cross, regardless of what the psychological im-
pact of the specific is, they‟re always going to assume that that was the paradise.
You forget that they screamed at each other all the time or that it really wasn‟t that
nice. If you were objective, you‟d see that it really was ok, that it was the right
thing for them to do, but you don‟t get that movie. The movie you get is that you
were thrown out of paradise, that it‟s gone.
So, you can end up in your life looking for that paradise, looking for a marriage that
will never break up, looking for those kinds of things that were taken away from you.
Remember, for somebody on the Cross of Eden, what‟s been taken away from you
doesn‟t have to be the obvious I‟m giving you. That they lost the love of someone is
just as devastating. Then that can become the theme for them in their life.
But it is always there for them. One of the few consistent truths of awakenness is
surrender, is letting go. If that‟s your role in the movie, that‟s your role in the mov-
ie. And paradise isn‟t something you lose. It‟s all an illusion. The life that lies in
front of you is not distorted by the way in which it started. It doesn‟t have to be.
It‟s all about being awake and being correct. Otherwise, all of these things are a
horror.

We know that 2/4s don‟t want to leave their family home. We know that 2/4s need
that kind of hermit security. This is the Cross of Eden, so this is the place where
2/4s are deeply uncomfortable. They‟re just deeply uncomfortable. What happens
to them is the letting go that they have to learn.
Everything about people on the Cross of Eden is that‟s what they‟re here to learn.
Remember, they‟re teachers. They‟re here to teach us that if you‟re free in the world
and you can‟t let go, it‟s a torment. If you spend your life lamenting your past, you
have no future. It‟s a torment. It‟s not just about they‟re here to be a victim of
something; they‟re not. Their process is to recognize surrender. They‟re here to get
to surrender. Of course, the not-self doesn‟t easily get to surrender, so what we

geance. There are all kinds of things tied up in this. You have two emotional gates
here, powerful emotional gates.
Obviously, if you‟re a 2/4 and you honor the law of the 4 and the laws of opportuni-
ty, that even being on the Cross of Eden doesn‟t have to be disturbing. If you re-
ceive the call and the call says that you have to move on, then that can all be fine.
Though it can be psychologically uncomfortable in terms of the shift itself because
they need the security, the fact is that once reestablished and resettled, they‟re fine.
But again, given the not-self, given that these children aren‟t going to be educated
that way, there are going to be a lot of problems associated with this configuration.

The 2/5
RAC Eden 1
When we get to the 2/5, you can‟t throw a 2/5 out of paradise. They just won‟t go.
“What do you mean? You can’t force me.” Remember, 2/5s and 5/2s are self-
motivated. Just because they‟re on the Cross of Eden and God says, “Get out of the
garden,” doesn‟t mean they‟re going to go. “I’ll go when I’m ready to go.” And
they‟d say it to God‟s face. “I’ll go when I’m ready to go. Why are you pushing me?
I’ll go when I’m ready.”
When they‟re ready to go is the moment of true crisis. This is the nature of the 5.
The 5 is at its best in times of crisis. The moment there is a time of crisis, every 5
has a chance to make a lot of money helping out in the crisis. It‟s the crisis only that
can bring them their opportunity.
So, here is the 2/5 in the Garden of Eden and God says that you have to go. “Come
on, you have to go.” And the 2/5 says, “No, I’m not ready; I’ll go when I’m ready.”
Basically what God does it take away all the fruit trees, poison the well, make the
sheep die. In that moment, the 2/5 says to itself, “I think it’s time for me to go out
into the world.” It has nothing to do with answering God. It‟s like, “All right, when
the crisis is there I’ll go.” And that‟s when they‟re at their best.
So, the family has declared that they have sold the house. You have a 2/5 kid say-
ing, “I’m not going.” The family is in crisis because the child is giving them a hard
time. And the movers come and they‟re moving everything out. And the kid is sit-
ting in his chair in his room. “I’m not going anywhere.” And slowly things disap-
pear—their toys, food disappears out of the refrigerator, and there‟s finally this mo-
ment of crisis. Even in that moment of crisis, it‟s not because of the pressure of
those who are pushing them out. It‟s the circumstance—where are they going to get
their food, they have nothing to play with. This is a real crisis. And then they go.
They motivate themselves and they go.
It‟s just one of those things to understand about them. It can be exasperating. If
you‟re God and you‟re trying to throw them out, you have this incredible arrogance
that comes back. Remember that 5s are projected on. 2/5s can give you the im-
pression that they own the world because there is this, “Well, I’ll do it when I want

The 3/5
RAC Eden 1
This is such a great place to be a 3/5. There‟s nothing like it. You can go bananas
out there. It‟s such a relief to be thrown out. Do you know what it‟s like to be a 3/5
teenager? It‟s an awful experience. Often it‟s a lot easier to leave home when
you‟re thrown out than when you just go away. It‟s like being thrown out is kind of
perfect; you don‟t have to come back. If you go yourself, there‟s always this touch
of guilt. I loved it when my father threw me out of the house. It was so perfect.
I‟m unemotional; as not-self I could have carried so much guilt of just going. But
being thrown out was like, “Yes, good!”
So imagine what it‟s like to be a 3/5. You‟re already in trouble. You‟ve been in
trouble ever since you reached puberty. You were actually in trouble before that, but
it‟s gotten worse. You have this projection of your parents on you that you‟re use-
less and dangerous. You always mess up. They don‟t trust you. They don‟t assume
you‟re going to do particularly well in life and they have their fingers crossed all the
time.
But if you‟re on the Cross of Eden, you don‟t have to deal with that too long because
they throw you out. Get out of the house. Ah, such a joy to be a 3/5 on the Cross
of Eden and no false nostalgia. They‟re not going to be the 1/4 saying, “Oh, I wish I
could go back and be at home with mommy and daddy looking after me.” The 3/5
says, “That was awful. I have a life to live here. I’m going to go do my thing.”
If you‟re a 3/5 on the Cross of Eden, your whole life is that. It‟s not just the first
door you get thrown out of. As a 3/5 you‟re always subjected to, because of the trial
and error, the projection that you have failed somebody else because of their projec-
tion on you. 3/5s are always running away because of their reputation. They always
want to start some place fresh where people don‟t have that trip about them. But if
you‟re a 3/5 on the Cross of Eden, you don‟t care. You don‟t care; it always feels
right. Every time somebody throws you out it‟s, “Oh, thanks.” It‟s not, “Ah, I blew it
again.” It‟s this constant movement. All of it, of course, is a learning process that
ultimately can be universalized.
Remember, there is the deepest teaching possible on this cross. These beings really
have something significant that they can share. When you go out there in the illu-
sion of your freedom in the world, that trial and error process is the beginning of
essential knowledge for everybody else; we‟re all thrown out of Eden. We‟re all
thrown out of the embrace of the womb. We‟re all thrown out into the cruelty of
breathing oxygen, those moments when you have to go out into the world and look
after yourself. It‟s built into us, these kinds of processes. Here you just simply have
archetypes of it.

The 3/6
RAC Eden 1
When you‟re dealing with the 3/6 on this cross, they don‟t know whether to go for-
ward or backward. You get thrown out of Eden and you go running along and then
you turn around and go back. Can we try again? And then you go running out again
and then you come back. After awhile you have to sneak in.
If you‟re a 3/6 or a 6/3 on the Cross of Eden, it feels like this life is a mistake, that
you shouldn‟t even have come in because there isn‟t going to be anything for you
that you can hold on to. 3/6s are born with their own armor. If you come into the
world with a 3/6 profile, that description doesn‟t really mean anything to you be-
cause that‟s you. You‟ll be able to deal with it. You‟re born to deal with it. You‟re
born to deal with trial and error; you‟re born to deal with all of those things. You‟re
born to be a constantly changing role model because of the very nature of being a
3/6. It‟s built into you.
And yet, when you‟re a 3/6 on the Cross of Eden, when your instability is matched
by the way the world treats you, it‟s very difficult. It‟s like there isn‟t even a hope
that somehow you can find solid ground. For them, life is paradise lost. And not the
life they started with, but the life they never had, the life they fantasize about, the
life that they dream might have been, could have been, and might be possible for
them.
From the objective point of view of the program, 3/6s provide the best opportunity
for totally subjective experience. After all, the lower trigram, the Right Angle profile
is all about the gathering of information; it‟s all about research. So the 3/6 has this
incredible capacity to blunder into all kinds of avenues after leaving Eden. By the
way, because of the 3/3 phase in the first part of their life, being thrown out of Eden
is usually rather dramatic, much more dramatic than any of the other Eden crosses.

The 4/6
RAC Eden 1
That brings us to the 4/6. As human beings, everything we do has to be transcribed
into a great book, and that‟s a metaphor. One of the most important things we do
as humans is codify our experience and make it available to others. This is a great
teaching cross. Remember that. This is an 11-12 teaching cross.
With the 4/6, you‟re dealing with a deep capacity to be able to experience the trials
and tribulations of freedom, the trials and tribulations of enduring the fall from
grace. And at the same time, being able to establish a role model identity in how
you deal with all of that. Not only to be able to establish that role model identity,
but to be able to have the power as an educator, whether that‟s formal or not, to be

able to influence your friends, to be able to influence your community through that
4th line capacity.
Those who fall from grace can make it easier for others to live. They can show them
by the very nature of their experience and the way they can live as a role model that
it doesn‟t matter, that it‟s not the point. The real grace in this life comes from being
yourself. When you‟re yourself, you don‟t really know, not for awhile anyway, what
really does belong to you, what life is here to give you in terms of love and wealth
and all of these various things that we seem to be concerned about when we‟re
thrown out of Eden, only to discover that it doesn‟t really matter.
Everything about all 4/6s is deeply, deeply, deeply dependent on who is in their life
when they‟re young. There is no more important thing to notice about a 4/6, any
4/6, particularly 4/6s who are being born and you have an opportunity to deal with
their families, how important it is that their friendships are watched.
All 4/6s rise or fall in this life on who they connect to in their first 14-15 years of life.
It is a very basis of where their future is going to be. One of the things to under-
stand about the 4 is that their only power in this life, their only ability to succeed in
this life is how big and how qualified the circle of their associations are. If you know
the right people, the right things happen. If you know the wrong people, the wrong
things happen. All 4/6s, this is the trip. You can‟t imagine how deeply they‟re condi-
tioned.
Sixes have their process; we know that. We know they all go through a trial and
error. But only the 4/6 doesn‟t go through the specific trial and error, it goes
through the trial-error after and through its associations with others. It‟s the other,
it‟s their community, and it‟s their friends who are going to bring what they have to
deal with in this life. They‟re the ones who are going to bring the opportunities.
So, if you have the wrong friends on the Cross of Eden, then you‟re not going to
know how to make it out there. You‟re not going to see the positives of the process.
You‟re not going to learn to recognize that surrender is the only way. You‟re not
going to become a role model of leaving Eden. You just won‟t. No regrets; you just
go. Life is like that. It is the way it is. We are on our own in the maia; we must
take care of business in the maia. Remember, this is a Quarter in which purpose is
fulfilled through mind. This is the learning process. We cannot live in the world—all
of us have fallen from grace—unless we learn from each other‟s experiences. Oth-
erwise, we will never survive.
That is the lesson of this. The lesson of this is we must share with each other. The
36th gate is collective; it shares. We must share with each other the collective expe-
rience of crisis. We must share with each other the trauma of freedom. We must
share with each other the difficulty of unique responsibility in the world. If we do
that, then it‟s going to be easier for the next generation and the next generation and
the next generation, and so forth. So, the Cross of Eden is something that is very
significant.

When you get to the 4/1 Juxtaposition Cross of Crisis, I guess it speaks for itself. I
don‟t know how many 4/1 Juxtaposition Crosses of Crisis there are; I don‟t know
how many people I‟m really going to annoy with the next things I say. But I assume
that living in the world right now, there may be 300 of them, something like that.
Most of them don‟t have access to modern technology, so I think I‟m safe, if you
know what I mean.
So, in the case of this Juxtaposition, the whole thing about inexperience is that this
is the archetype of inexperience and this is one of the worst places to have a Juxta-
position cross because Juxtaposition is so fixed. This is fixed fate; this is a fixed line.
There‟s nothing fixed about being thrown out of Eden. This is not fixed; this is the
antithesis of fixed.
Remember that we are no longer in a domain in which the capacity to learn lessons
from this is there. We lost the 11 and 12 the moment we went into this Juxtaposi-
tion. It‟s gone. So, it‟s not like this Right Angle cross is learning anything of value
for any of us. It isn‟t. What comes in are the 15 and the 10. So, what you see is
that all kinds of extremes of beha-
vior come in. It‟s all you‟re going to
get, extreme variations of behavior
depending on the fixedness and the

concerned with that aspect of it.
So, when you have a 4/1 on this cross, crisis is everywhere. But it‟s not that there
are endless crises; this is not a 3/6. There is one endless damn crisis. It‟s just one
long crisis. And because it‟s one long crisis, you get to see certain, specific types of
behavior that you wouldn‟t see otherwise. What to do. After all, this is the code.
It‟s just all these things are there and they show up.
So, I can look at that and say, wow, that‟s really interesting. We develop all these
really extreme forms of behavior built on lifelong crisis of rejection; isn‟t that fasci-
nating? Don‟t we really love these people for making that contribution, thank you
very much. And thank you that that is not me; I‟m really pleased. What to do. But
if they‟re living that out correctly, there isn‟t anything to say that it‟s a bad trip for
them. Truly, there isn‟t. As a matter of fact, they may love it—10th gate, you never
know. They may love the fact that they live in extreme in their freedom, even if that
extreme brings them difficulties. So what! They have fixed fate. It‟s their life. And
you‟re not going to break them. Once you set them on their way with that initiating
crisis, there isn‟t anything that‟s going to fix that. “Let‟s go back and talk about your
childhood.” This is not going to do any good with them. You just let them go their
way. And if you have binoculars watch, it‟s interesting.

one of the great gates of light and
spirit, the 25, the priesthood and
God; because if you‟re on the Cross

of the Plane there is one thing deep
inside of you that moves you.
Remember, you have two gates of
the Vessel. The Cross of the Plane
has two gates of the Vessel of Love. What it doesn‟t have is the 46, the body, and
the 25, the spirit. It has the aura and the life. Everything about the Cross of the
Plane is what it means to move through the maia. They see it. This is their whole
thing. They get to experience the plane. You cannot protect these children. What
to do.
This is the closing of this grouping of hexagrams. It‟s a period, a punctuation point.
It‟s that punctuation point that says, look, by the time we get to be able to expe-
rience the freedom of the illusion of the maia, we will learn to see that we are not
equipped, that the witnesses of the plane, the ones who watch, see very clearly that
we are generally unaware, not awake, and that we have terrible problems. Those
who operate on the Cross of the Plane bring us to the potential of what can save us—
the light, the spirit, the awakening, the enlightenment; whatever you want to label
it. The opportunity to see that there is something more than the plane.
Had I been a born-again whatever, I never would have been able to reach out to my
daughter. I never could have had a connection to her by providing her with a belief
system because the Cross of the Plane isn‟t, in itself, spiritual at all. When you look
at the Cross of the Vessel of Love, there are only two gates that carry its spirituali-
ty—the 25 and the 46—universal love and the holiness of the vessel, the body.
That‟s where the real spirituality is. The rest of it is other things.

These beings are not here to be spiritually awakened, yet they lead to it. They lead
to it because they keep on letting you know how dumb you are, how messy the
world is. They keep letting you know that the solutions that are out there do not
work. You can‟t touch these people spiritually. They don‟t want to go back to the
garden. They want the plane to be full of light. They want to transform their world.
They need to transform their world.
So, you can imagine for the 5/1 that the Cross of the Plane can be very, very uncom-
fortable because of the paranoia involved. Fives are paranoid; they suffer from the
projection of others. All 5 personalities are wondering what you want the moment
you come near them. So, life itself can create a deep, deep, deep paranoia; the fear
of the uncertainties, the chaos, the conflicts, the difficulties, all of those things.
“Don’t tell me that going from this to that is going to be free of pain, I know it’s not.”
Cross of the Plane; they know that.
The real heresy, the real heretic here is the denial and the rejection of God. It‟s one
of the jokes. Until you reject God, you cannot find God. It‟s just a basic formula.
Unless you‟ve rejected the spirit, you cannot find the spirit. It‟s just one of those
things. It‟s one of the most basic things in commonalities in the history of spiritual
teaching that the vast majority of those teachers were the anathema; they were the
other side of spirituality. They couldn‟t care less. Like me; good, powerful, nasty
atheists.
It‟s one of the most common things that unbelievers are the ones who get touched
because it‟s the way it is. It‟s just another formula. So one of the things to recog-
nize about the 5/1 on the Cross of the Plane is because they see the horror of the
world and because the world is not filtered from their eyes, that one of the first
things they do is deny spiritual value in life. In most cases for people it‟s their reli-
gion because most people have that as a framework. But if you‟re a new ager, or
whatever, you can translate that into another language—spirituality, mysticism, or
whatever it is. It‟s practically impossible to get these people to see that there‟s
something more than just birth, life and death because all they get to see is birth,
life and death.
So the heresy of the 5/1 is to say, “No, there’s nothing else but this. And this is
really shitty and it’s just what it is, let’s make the best of it.” That‟s it. Of course,
they‟re often considered to be a real threat to society because we all operate on the
plane. For me, personally, it was really my assumption for the first 30 odd years of
my life that this was just a chaotic piece of nonsense. And given that perspective,
the only thing to do in life was just to get it over with. You live it, and hell with the
consequences, you just live it. So, one of the things to see about the Cross of the
Plane is you just live it, the hell with the consequences, you just live it. You cannot
expect that some greater force is going to intercede.
Remember, with the 36 you‟re looking at rejection of spirituality. It‟s one of the
things to recognize about it. This is a real rejection of spirituality that begins with
God rejecting them. Remember, the Cross of Eden people feel like God has rejected
them when their luck turns, when things go wrong, when things go bad. That‟s the
force you blame.

Darkening of the Light
By the time you get to the Left Angle here, there is no God anymore. There‟s just
the gritty world of rise and fall. These are people who say, “What do you mean you
believe in a God? Look at how many babies suffer in pain and die every day in the
world. What kind of God is it that allows that to go on?” And whatever your rebuttal
to that argument might be, because there are these ways we deal with this stuff and
rationalize our belief systems, the fact is that for the Cross of the Plane it‟s obvious
there‟s no God. At least it‟s obvious that there‟s no God that‟s a God of mercy. It‟s
obvious there‟s no God that personally cares about what happens to you at any given
moment.
The moment you take spirituality out of somebody‟s design, you have a pure expe-
riential being and that‟s what these beings are. That‟s their heresy. They‟re often
accused of being amoral. They‟re often accused of having lost their compass be-
cause they‟re extremists.

The 5/2
LAC Plane 1
With a 5/2 on the Cross of the Plane, you‟re dealing with the ultimate, hermit
movement. They look out and see the horror of the world; they just don‟t want to
have anything to do with it. It takes a hell of a lot for them to motivate themselves
to go out into that world without any expectation.
One of the things that the Cross of the Plane does to you is strip away your hope. It
just does. It just strips it away. Of course, when you live your life without hope,
only the material is satisfying. Remember that this is part of our process. We need
the material to survive; we‟re material informed.
You really have to understand this transition in the 36th gate brings a crisis of faith.
At the same time, it allows us to separate ourselves from God as babysitter. It‟s
part of our movement. We can let go of our training wheels and we can finally ride
on our own. And yes, it‟s messy. By the time we‟ve been riding along enough on
our own, we have forgotten that God got us going. It‟s like it‟s gone now; it‟s just us
on the bike. And you can see in our program that all of us carry this inside.
If there isn‟t a part of you that rejects spiritually, then you‟re never going to get any.
We are binaries. We must go through the binaries. It doesn‟t mean they have to be
balanced. But it does mean that we are built to recognize truth only by having a
connection to both sides.

The 6/2
LAC Plane 1
With 6/2, you get to the classic, cool role model of living in the world as a natural.
There‟s nothing easier than to be on the Cross of the Plane as a 2. It‟s perfect. You
have your extreme, unique behavior; you don‟t have to explain that to anybody. All
you have to do is survive yourself. In surviving yourself in the vagaries of the world,
you become a role model of stability for others. Look at Harry, look at Jane; they
always know how to get through. It doesn‟t seem to bother them. They‟re just slid-
ing through. 6/2s can be incredible at that. After all, one of their real deep, deep
potentials is that when you really get to the heart of the 6/2, you simply get to the
embodiment of something, the embodiment of the Cross of the Plane. Yes, they
were victims in their first 30 years. On the Cross of the Plane you really become
aloof on the roof stage. Then finally it‟s just the acceptance of the process. The fact
is that they don‟t have to wake up to their spirituality, but they do need to wake up
to the mechanics. That‟s the magic of mechanics.
If you‟re a fuzzy, teddy bear kind of person, you can always turn mechanics into
spirituality, if you need to. But if you‟re not designed to be fuzzy, then the mechan-
ics by themselves are enough. To understand this is the way you get to see the
movie, don‟t feel guilty that you don‟t have these deep spiritual needs. These are
not people who are going to run into mystical experiences. This is the Cross of the
Plane.
This is life on mother earth; tough, heavy, dirty, mean, nasty. It is. Speaking of
dirty, it‟s amazing about money. I watched a little feature the other night on televi-
sion where somebody had taken paper money from eight different countries in Asia
and had the paper money analyzed in a laboratory. On one Chinese bill were
178,000 bacteria. On the average bill there were 14,000 bacteria. That‟s amazing.

That brings us to the 6/3. This is an exalted position for this profile. Remember with
Juxtaposition people or 6/3 people, you‟re looking at bridge people. They make
bridges. They make bridges from one thing to the next. The bridge of the 6/3 is
always the bridge to the next hexagram. It‟s always the bridge to the next 1/3 that
starts a new process.
When you‟re going from the 36 to the 25, you‟re going away from the emotional
abstract system, and you‟re going into the identity; you‟re going into a gate of the
Vessel of Love. You‟re going into the vessel of love. You‟re going into the gate of

the sacrament. You‟re going into the gate of the priest and the priestess; you‟re
going into the core of the initiating center of this Quarter.
So there‟s the 6/3. On one side is the plane, the gritty, nasty, heartless, cruel plane
of the world. And on the other side are these glimpses of something else. Fortu-
nately, 6/3s are designed to be unstable. They will rock. But the thing to recognize
is that without them, we don‟t have this magical step from the first eight to the next
eight. This is a bridge. And with this bridge is this recognition that what we‟re mov-
ing towards is a mutative spirituality—gate 25—individual mutative process.
In other words, it‟s not about the old God. It‟s not about old ideas of spirituality, it‟s
not about the past, and it‟s not about going back to the garden and sucking up to
whatever threw you out. It‟s about finding your unique, individual spirituality. For
somebody carrying the Cross of the Plane, it is so collective. Everything about the
Cross of the Plane is the witness of the world as it is without spiritual content, which
means no individual content—the victim you see in the world that‟s just part of a
statistics of victims; it‟s not really a person. Do you know what I mean? It is about
seeing the plane.
So, the only way you can break through these people is if you make it personal. You
make it personal when you take this step into the 25. It begins with the possibility
that initiation can transform the way in which the plane is experienced; not the way
the plane is, but the way the plane is experienced.
So, this is a great place to be a 6/3. This is the kind of life, where after they have
triumphed—after all, 6/3s and 3/6s are really good at succeeding in the world be-
cause they have this ability to bounce back. If it doesn‟t kill them they‟ll survive, if
you know what I mean. It‟s wonderful for them after they go through this process of
finding their way on the plane that there is always potential for this deep break-
through that says, “Wait a minute, there is something else, there is something
beyond that.” They‟re the ones who carry a taste of it, and where they can expe-
rience that is in their Kiron phase as themselves because in that moment, there are
no longer any parameters or limitations to their ability to be able to awaken.

Introduction
We‟ve come to the 25 and we‟ve come to Innocence. One of the most magical
things about gates is that the longer you‟re involved in Human Design education, the
more you see that every gate carries many layers and levels of keynoting and infor-
mation. The 25th gate is really at the core of our mystical
process. It‟s the core of our ability to be able to find our cen-
ter, to be able to find the nature of what it is that we are.
When you come to the 25th gate and you come to the Right
Angle, you come to the Cross of the Vessel of Love.
Though it‟s old hat, keep in mind that the vessel has four
components. The 46th gate represents the vessel itself, the
body. The 15th gate represents the aura, the outer shell of
the vessel. When you‟re looking at the 10th gate it‟s the
mouth of the vessel; it‟s out of the 10th gate that the life flows. But what fills the
vessel is the 25th gate, the gate of blood. And the blood is the life. This is the gate
of sacrament. If you have the 25th gate and you don‟t see blood in your life, I don‟t
think you have the 25th gate. Because if you have the 25th gate, you‟re going to see
blood, you‟re going to see this symbol of the 25.
When we speak about the nature of love in terms of the vessel, we have these very
basic formulas. The 10th gate is the potential to love oneself. The 15th gate is the
potential to love humanity. The 46th gate is the potential to love the body. And the
25th gate is the potential of universal love. When you‟re looking at this transforma-
tion from the crisis of life on the plane and the cold, atheistic burden of what appears
to be the pointlessness of so much of life that‟s witnessed on the plane, the first
transition is not to personal love. The only real movement is towards universal love.
Remember that the 25 is the coolest of all loves. You‟re never going to meet a coo-
ler love than in the 25. It‟s cool. The best way to understand that coolness is that I
love my guitar as much as I‟ll ever love you. For some people, that‟s insulting, if you
know what I mean. I love the sunrise as much as I‟m going to love you, and so
forth.
What you‟re looking at within the context of the 25 is that everything is worthy of
love, all things are worthy of love. That‟s why the 25 embodies the priest and the
priestess. These are these forces that welcome you into the world of love where
everything is love and all things can be love. It sounds really nice, eh?
The Vessel of Love
Remember, something about the nature of love is that love is direction. Whenever
you‟re dealing with the Magnetic Monopole, whenever you‟re dealing with the G Cen-
ter, you‟re dealing with a direction. Love is a direction. If you‟re into love of human-
ity, it‟s going to take you in a certain direction. It‟s one of my things about eating.

Innocence
If you‟re a vegetarian, you shop in different places than meat-eaters. So already it
has changed your life. It‟s one of those things to grasp about it. The Vessel of
Love—the kind of love you‟re attuned to. Whenever we‟re looking at any of these
crosses, it‟s the Personality Sun that defines them.
Here‟s the first variation of the Vessel of Love. It‟s the first variation because it‟s in
the first Quarter. This first variation, the direction it moves you is towards universal
love. In other words, in the beginning was Pantheism, not Monotheism. The very
first recognition on the mundane plane is not of a huge, wonderful, superior, giant
deity. Remember way back that deity threw you out. And you have long forgotten
that the deity threw you out and you don‟t care about it; you don‟t believe in such
things.
However, the first thing you‟re going to meet is the forces. And you‟re going to meet
the forces in many, many different ways. You‟re going to meet the minor deities, in
that sense—the Mars, the Mercurys, Venus‟, Plutos and whatever the case may be.
The first thing you deal with in the 25th gate is luck. This is a magical word. What
the hell is luck? The 46th gate says being lucky is being in the right place at the right
time. That‟s the definition of luck.
But when you‟re looking at the 25th gate, when you‟re looking at the Vessel of Love,
when you‟re looking at the phenomena of life on the plane—two people are walking
down the street, one of them slips on a banana peel and breaks their leg. The other
one giggles and keeps on walking. Now, you don‟t have to thank God. As a matter
of fact, you won‟t. What you‟ll do is say, “Shit, I’m lucky and they’re unlucky,” and
this is the beginning of spirituality because at some point there‟s a deep question
that suddenly arises: “Why are they luckier than me? Or why am I luckier than
them?” And luck is the first step into spirituality.
It‟s a funny thing when you think about it. There is no other explanation for the
atheist. You have to have something that replaces God for those situations. It‟s like
those contracts you sign where they say, “In the event of an act of God, we‟re not
libel.” You can never get rid of that in the contract. You buy a new refrigerator, and
it gets hit by lightening, they will not give you another one. They‟re not responsible;
this was an act of God. So you‟re out of it. You have to buy another refrigerator.
So, how do you explain it? If it‟s not God, what is it? Oh, I could go on forever and
talk about the great replacement for God. It‟s called “it.” Have you ever noticed? It
is raining. Now, excuse me, what does that mean? What it? The “it” is raining?
How does the “it” rain? We say it is a nice day. What it? How does that work? I
don‟t get that. It‟s all it. We do that all the time. We say it is love. We also say it
is hate. It‟s good, it‟s bad; it‟s right, it‟s wrong. It; it‟s the “it.” It‟s the funniest
pronoun ever. Ulysses S. Grant said human beings were a verb. You want to look
for the Gods, they‟re a pronoun. It. It‟s the answer. It‟s all it: it-ness.
And it-ness is the 25th gate. It‟s all it, it, it. I love it. It is us. What it? What does
that mean? I don‟t get it. It‟s there all the time. You cannot escape it. You can‟t
get away from it. It is everywhere. Now, I know that‟s a real wonderful word game,
but please understand something, that‟s the 25th gate. What happened? It hap-

pened. I didn‟t do it. It did me. It‟s just it-ness. And with it-ness comes luck. It
just shows up as a substitute for God.
So, the first thing to recognize about 25 people is that when you deal with the not-
self 25 person, they say very clearly that they‟re not getting the good end of the luck
story; bad luck. “I have a lot of bad luck.” 25s are full of bad luck. “Oh, it was bad
luck.” What‟s so funny about them is that the luck is part of the “it-ness.” It doesn‟t
mean anything. It‟s just bad luck.
It‟s not like they get into a huge, heavy trip about how awful it is to be the victim of
luck, it was bad luck, and it‟s the way they write it off. There‟s luck and there‟s bad
luck. This is the nature of the world. When you meet a 25, you have to understand
that about them. When you go to a 25 priest, the priest says, “Ah, good luck for
you.” And if you don‟t come, bad luck for you. It‟s all good luck/bad luck; all of it.
That‟s what priests are about right from the beginning.
The biggest business priests had for thousands and thousands of years was to sell
you amulets that they had blessed so you would have good luck from it. “This will
protect you so it will not get you; it will get you if you don’t wear this.” People are
hanging crosses, bear‟s teeth, ears, anything. You know how many of these things
they sold in the ancient world, and particularly in Mesopotamia because the whole
bloody place is just clay. They‟re just digging these amulets out of the ground—a
little carve; a little bake: You need this; Good luck from it. People who had no reli-
gious belief whatsoever were wearing all kinds of things. One day my mother comes
home with a copper bracelet. I said, “What‟s that?” She said it‟s going to protect
me from arthritis. Good luck, let‟s hope it works.
The 25 is hilarious. It‟s all about luck. Before I woke up—I‟m a 25—I walk around
and say, “How lucky.” I still say that. I‟m the luckiest guy in the world. It‟s been so
good. It‟s been good to me. I love it. Human beings are so funny. You can‟t take
somebody who lives on the plane and say to them that God‟s watching over us. You
don‟t that; it won‟t work. They don‟t believe you. But if you say to them, “Look,
some of us are luckier than others.” “Oh, that‟s true. “And I can help you to be
luckier than others.” That‟s an idea. That‟s the movie.
How do you think the priesthood works? Religion has always been based on giving
you luck against it. That‟s all it‟s ever been based on. It‟s always a con job, and yet,
a necessary one because it‟s very hard to get to spirituality unless you recognize that
some people have bad luck. How odd we are as creatures. The joke that we would
not know pleasure without pain; well, it‟s not a joke; it‟s true. It‟s just true. And the
good luck/bad luck, this is life. This is a universal principle. You can never escape
hierarchies. You can‟t. If we lived in an absolutely perfect world where everybody
was awake, Projectors would be at the top and Manifestors at the bottom, and you
could never get over that and whatever comes out of that. There are always those
who have more advantages; there are always those who have less. Because after
all, we‟re a whole; we have everything.
When you‟re looking at the scale of luck, it goes from the worst luck you could im-
agine to the most incredible luck. A guy in the States years ago won one of these

blockbuster lotteries—110 or 115 million bucks. Two weeks later, he won 35 million
more. And you think, “Shit, nobody has the right to that kind of luck.” It‟s the na-
ture of our life. It‟s the nature of the world until you realize that some get lucky and
some don‟t; you have nothing to pray for. It‟s the beginning of prayer: Please make
me lucky. That‟s what it is because you don‟t know any other way to deal with it.

The 1/3
Ok, so you have a 1/3. I have a 1/3 Vessel of Love child. What are you going to do.
Fortunately, he‟s a 10. It‟s a different movie, slightly. But what are you going to
do? You have a Vessel of Love, they
come into the world with their Sun in
25, they‟re a 1/3, the first thing they
get to see is somebody else has the
luck and it‟s not them. And it‟s not 
fair. There‟s nothing worse than a
1/3 Vessel of Love who‟s denied its
opportunity.
Remember something about the

Vessel of Love. It‟s a very nice 
name, but it‟s also the vessel of
hate. And it can turn on a dime,
nothing faster. I can absolutely
detest people because of their beha-
vior. I can go from being very loving
to detesting them for their behavior. 
The Vessel of Love, one side is like
(a sound) and the other side is really
nasty. The people who have a per-
verse 15 and who really hate hu-
manity are scary creatures. We sell the love side. Let‟s be lucky.
Anyway, you‟re a 1/3 Vessel of Love, what are you going to find out? The first thing
you‟re going to find out about life is that some people are lucky and some people
aren‟t. And you‟re going to try to figure out why. You‟re a 1 after all. And then the
3 comes in. Life deals you a lousy blow. You were expecting to do something and
something else happened that wouldn‟t allow you to do it—bad luck—and everybody
else had a great time and you had to miss it and you are really upset. Of course,
there begins the pessimism that you‟re never going to be the lucky one.

As a 25, I have never, ever, ever, ever even thought of buying a lottery ticket. And
you know why? Because I will lose the first time; I know that. And when I lose the
first time, it‟s really going to upset me. It‟s like you don‟t have any luck. I don‟t
want the evidence of how little luck I actually have. I‟d like to have those moments
where I really think things are going for me.
So, the moment the 1/3 child sees that the cards can be stacked against you, there‟s
where you see a deep anarchy rising up. How do I get past this? This is where the
quality of the spirituality of the 25 comes in. Remember something about the 25,
the 25 isn‟t specifically religious. That‟s just an attribute of it. It is specifically mys-
tical in the sense that it really is the only way to get to awakening. It‟s the only true
path to awakening. It‟s from the 25 to the 10; there isn‟t really any other way.
So, everything about the 25, buried inside of that 25 is that possibility of awakening
because of good luck/bad luck. That‟s why I always have that expression: Good
luck/bad luck, who knows. This is a great 25 mantra; it‟ll keep you healthy. That
way you can always convince yourself that the things that are bad that are happen-
ing to you are going to turn out to be positive. That‟s my philosophy in life.
My philosophy in life is that the moment I meet bad luck, my assumption is that I
don‟t really see that it‟s really good luck. It works. This is the transcendence out of
the game. It‟s like, “Who knows, I don’t know, maybe it is bad luck. I don’t know,
but I’m not going to get caught up in, I’ll wait and see. Maybe it turns out to be
good luck.”
So the whole thing about the 1/3 is that it starts a journey on this vessel that leads
to its Left Angle. The journey it starts is looking for “how do you get good luck all
the time and how can you give somebody bad luck all the time?” Hey, priest and
priestess‟s are not always on the good side. The control of good luck/bad luck—at
the same time somebody is selling you some trinket to wear on your body to protect
you from evil forces, there‟s somebody else creating an object that gives off those
forces. This has been going on forever. It goes on today, it just has different cos-
tumes. It‟s the same thing. It hasn‟t stopped; it‟s still going on.
The dilemma is how do you make sure you have good luck? That‟s the dilemma. So
the 1/3 goes deeply into that process. They‟re the ones who look and find all kinds
of odd possibilities of how to give yourself good luck. For example, superstitions—I
cannot help it that when I say something that means something of value to me in
the sense that it‟s good luck, or whatever, I can‟t help rapping my knuckles on wood.
This is 25.
Whether that actually works or not, I don‟t know. Some idiot put that inside of me a
long time ago and I‟m a 25. Why go against it? It‟s like athletes who go into a
playoff or a championship environment and they win a game and they refuse to
change their dirty socks until they‟ve won the whole thing and they reek and every-
body wishes they would do something. But everybody is after to tell them because
nobody wants to break the spell of good luck. We will assume that anything brings
us good luck if it appears that‟s a possibility—this is a 25 trait. So, all of the supers-
titions that were sold, they‟re all sold by 25s trying to get you to see that you can

get a handle on good luck and you can avoid bad luck. And 1/3s discover all kinds of
extraordinary ways on this cross to create good luck. Let your imaginations roll with
that one.
When you‟re looking at the 25th gate within Design, you‟re looking at something
quite separate. You‟re really looking at innocence; you‟re really looking at a poten-
tial for a different quality of love that can be initiating. But all the heavy stuff, all the
manipulative, tricky good luck/bad luck, all of this very devious pushing to get
people to a place of spiritual transcendence, you don‟t get to see.

The 1/4
RAC Vessel of Love 1
When you‟re dealing with the 1/4, there is only good luck or bad luck. They make a
lifetime out of either one. There isn‟t anything else. There is either good luck or
there is bad luck. It doesn‟t matter, even though they think everything is bad luck
and they‟re having a good life, it‟s still all bad luck. “It’s really bad luck that I had to
move to this town.” But George, you love this town. “That’s not the point. It was
bad luck that I had to move here.”
“Oh, it was such good luck that I got this cancer.” These people can be mad as a
hatter. “What wonderful luck that I’m sick like this. If I wasn’t sick like this, I never
would have realized how much a jerk you are; now, get out of my life.” A moment
of awakening. “It was so good luck that I’m suffering. If I didn’t lose my vision I
never would have been able to hear Mozart properly.”
Ogden Nash, an American poet, a very funny guy. He wrote a poem called A Man
with a Silver Lining. It‟s the story of this guy who is the ultimate optimist, no matter
what happens to him he‟s optimistic. And finally in a restaurant the waiter slips and
slams a silver tea tray down his throat. And there he is saying, “Hey, look, I‟m the
man with a silver lining.”
You really have to see how absurd the 1/4 Vessel can get. They can be so inspiring.
Remember, 1/4s and 4/1s. The 4/1 missionary and the pot boiling, boy are they
inspiring. They really are, so fixed. There‟s the good luck person on the way to the
gas chamber. And you think, don‟t tell me that, Ra, that‟s not true. “But yes, ah, at
least it’s over now. I’m so lucky it’s today; I couldn’t have taken another day. And
Harry goes with me and he’s such a prick.” Find something to see the good luck in it
all. It‟s amazing. And we consider that awe-inspiring. The bad luck person who
succeeds, we think they‟re humble. You meet these people all the time. “Ah, this
really didn’t work out.” “What do you mean? Look at all the wonderful things you‟ve
done.” “No, it was really bad luck.” And they‟d think, “Oh how humble. Here is
somebody truly free of arrogance.”
How easily we‟re fooled by the good luck/bad luck people. You want bad luck, live
out your not-self. I‟m doing the same thing. We can never leave the archetype of
our patterns. I‟m a 25, I will always be a 25. Very deep inside of me is this cross as

much as any other that carries this information. What good luck for you that you got
to discover this. It‟ll get rid of your bad luck because your bad luck is connected to
your not-self, and on and on and on. This is the way you try to wake up the sheep.
You start with good luck/bad luck. There is no other way. It‟s such a remarkable
thing because when we think of our spirituality, how complex spirituality has be-
come. When we see spirituality within its relationship to universal religions and all of
these other things, we forget very quickly what this is truly all about.
It‟s what was learned on the Cross of the Plane—life is cruel. It doesn‟t seem to
make sense why some have it easy and some have it hard. We truly do not know
why. We have no grasp over that. And simply by saying that “this is the law of
God” isn‟t something that satisfies anyone. It doesn‟t. All you can do is begin the
process of saying to them, “Well, isn’t it obvious that some people get a better trip
than others?” And out of that comes all the manipulation because out of that comes
all of those beings who will say to you, “I know how to protect you and give you
good luck. You do it this way. You honor this God, this system, this method, this
person, this food, this dream, this drug, this “this,” this “that,” on and on and on and
on because that‟s what the 25 does. It‟s universal after all.
There are as many ways to luck as there are stones on the beach. It‟s endless.
That‟s really the mystical truth, that in the end, we all have our own luck. It is the
nature of who we are. And out of that, we get to see that when you live without
resistance, there is no such thing as good luck/bad luck. There isn‟t; there‟s just the
mystery of what the next thing is and its beauty when it‟s revealed.

The 2/4
RAC Vessel of Love 1
2/4s are the kinds of people where everybody sees that they have something that
they want, or they have something that they think that person isn‟t aware of. “Don‟t
you understand that you‟re doing the wrong thing? This is going to send you down
the wrong road,” somebody says to a 2/4 because people look into the 2. “What
you‟re doing is really going to bring you bad karma, bad luck, bad “this,” bad “that.”
The other side is looking in at the 2/4 and seeing that they have a good life and
thinking they‟re lucky and wanting some of it. How did you get it to be like this?
Remember, the 2/4 is the classic missionary. 2/4s are great on this cross. They
really are.
If an archetype of bad luck calls them, they will be the missionary of bad luck. If the
archetypal good luck comes to them, they will be the missionary of good luck. They
can be transformed by that experience. If they go along not paying attention to the
fact that life is cruel and some people get this and others don‟t, they are going to
meet that awakening. That is what is going to call them. Good luck or bad luck is
going to call them in this life and it‟s going to provide them with that opportunity.
That opportunity, again, is a very powerful role because it has deep influence over
others. The 25/51 is so full of tribal juice that you can never see it as truly, purely

individual. It is designed to be the only outlet out of the Ego for the tribe that takes
them out of the lock of tribal support, where luck is in the hands of the ruler. “Let‟s
hope that King John‟s son is going to be sane instead of insane, so maybe our luck
will change as a people.”
So the 2/4 is in a natural position on this cross. Understand something as well in
terms of being, within this language, a missionary of good luck/bad luck. The whole
thing about good luck/bad luck people is that basically what they all end up doing is
trying to either get you to go from the bad luck to the good luck, or they‟re trying to
sell the good luck. Rarely is it that they want you to have bad luck. This was the
whole movement between the dark forces, black magic and white magic, so called,
the way in which you handle the information.
The other thing is it‟s secretive because it‟s personal. In other words, the only rea-
son the 25 will ever really make the effort to try to change your luck is when it has
the Ego 51 driving it because in and of itself, it won‟t. After all, this is a G Center;
it‟s not a power center.

The 2/5  46  15
RAC Vessel of Love 1
Both the 2/4 and the 2/5—particularly the 2/4 because it‟s the most natural in terms
of being called and having the right mechanism for responding—the possibility is
there to be called and it will bring you one or the other. That is always the question
for the 2nd line 25, you‟re called, wherever it appears, you‟re called. Is that call
going to bring you good luck or bad luck? That‟s the not-self process.
The call itself is never analyzed that way when the call comes. It‟s only after you‟ve
answered the call that you get to recognize whether it brings good luck or bad luck.
One of the things about both the 2/4 and the 2/5 on this cross is that the 2/5 is ter-
rified of that possibility of not knowing whether it‟s going to bring good luck or bad
luck. The 2/4, quite frankly, doesn‟t care. It‟s very different.
The 2/4 always has the security of their environment to protect them from bad luck;
always. No matter how the world is going to treat them on the plane, when they can
get in the house behind those closed doors in their secure environment, then they
can find their balance in this life. And the outside world is left behind.
The whole thing with the 2/5 is that the 5 is already paranoid about whether it‟s
going to bring good luck or bad luck. What that means is that 2/4s and 2/5s are
more reticent to answer the call on this cross. Of course, the moment you have a 2
that‟s less likely to answer the call, you have less opportunities in that lifetime. So
this is not a great configuration for the 2nd line Personality. It‟s slightly different
when we look at the transpersonal.
But I want you to see that, particularly with the 5th line in this situation, the 5th line
is really going to be concerned about whether or not they‟re being fooled, that this is

going to bring them the wrong things, that it‟s not going to work for them. If you
come into the world with a 2, you have to recognize how much you are conditioned
by the call. You have to have them.
The other thing about the 2/5, as we have seen, is that it‟s self-motivated. So, if its
paranoia creates uncertainty about what the outcome of the call is going to be, and
again it‟s on this cross, you know that inaction is what‟s going to happen. The para-
noia will just overwhelm it and hold it back. The only time you‟re really going to see
any action is if crisis drives them. Now, crisis is rarely good luck; the crisis of real
bad luck.
If you‟re a 25, you can never escape good luck/bad luck. It doesn‟t matter whether
you carry this cross or not. If you have a 25th gate, you‟re never going to escape
this equation of good luck/bad luck; it‟s always there. The trap is falling into it.
That‟s the trap because we don‟t know. It‟s like saying, “Oh, no Neptune is coming
to the…” whatever gate of yours. You don‟t know what that‟s really going to bring.
You have no idea. Even if it starts off looking like it may be lousy, you don‟t know.
It‟s very easy for me to say Neptune in the 19 has brought me bad luck. I could
easily say that. It has confused my territorial process. It has confused what I really
need. It‟s brought bad luck into my life. That‟s a classic 25 interpretation of any
environment, of any situation. Always, somewhere inside of 25s, they are dealing
with this equation of good luck/bad luck. And the thing they love to avoid is back
luck people, and the thing they love to be around are good luck people.
This expression “happy-go-lucky,” it‟s like for the 25 that‟s the whole story; you feel
lucky. Now, of course, if you take it to its highest level, you can feel that way with
absolutely nothing. You can feel that way regardless of the circumstances because
this is what universal love really means. That coming into form was good luck.
“How lucky that I get to experience this trip; aren’t I lucky.” In the end, that‟s what
it‟s all about—good luck/bad luck, who knows.

The 3/5
RAC Vessel of Love 1
They invented bad luck. They gave luck a bad name, let‟s put it that way. “Oh, I
was so close”—3/5s, man—“I was that close.” Yeah, yeah, yeah. Close only counts
in horseshoes, grenades and atomic bombs. Otherwise, close doesn‟t count. “And
because I was that close, and I didn’t quite get it, I lost my reputation, my wife left
me, my dog left me, the house left me, the world left me”—that close.
3/5s are always “that close.” “Oh, I was so unlucky. If I had stepped out of the
house two seconds earlier I could have met that bus. I was so unlucky this morning,
nothing seemed to work.” What a trip. 3/5s—“That close, and because of that I had
to move half way across the world to get away from the results of missing.” We love
those stories. Almost every movie has a just-missed aspect, just a little bad luck
that gives you problems. You‟re standing on the street and somebody who has been

lined up for a hit walks in front of you, ducks and you get the bullet in the head—bad
luck; life is such a joke.
Anyway, 3/5s—you really have to see what the 3/5 is going to go through. They
have an expression when gangs are running through the streets, firing weapons and
innocent people getting hit, they called them “mushrooms”—people who popped up
at the wrong time and ended up dead. That‟s the 3/5 on the Cross of the Vessel of
Love because it is so easy for them to meet bad luck.
I know it‟s cruel, but then again, life is what it is. If you get a string of bad luck,
chances are that you‟ll look to some hired force to help you. It‟s just the way it
goes. If you have a really good stream of good luck, there‟s a higher force you‟re
going to look to; it‟s just the way it goes. If you see people who have very bad luck,
or people who have very good luck, it‟s such a seed inside of you about the wonder
of it all, and maybe there is a way to avoid that bad luck, maybe there is a way to
have that good luck, and so on.
It‟s a ploy. It‟s a mechanical trip that sets us up for universal love. It‟s all it is. At a
personal level, it can really be a pain because we don‟t get to see it that way; we
don‟t get to see this larger movie. We don‟t get to see that at all. You do. And then
you can begin to understand what it‟s all about.
You see, I know as a 25 and with the knowledge that I have today, I know that there
is good luck and bad luck. It‟s obvious to me. What to do. It‟s clear. There are
designs, there‟s a program, there‟s conditioning, there are all of these things. If
you‟re not-self, it‟s so easy for you to do the wrong thing, to be incorrect and that‟s
going to bring bad luck. It‟s so obvious. But at least I have a language now that‟s
not a spiritual resolution to an ancient dilemma. Only the not-self suffers from good
luck/bad luck. That‟s the whole point of waking up. You wake up to the true self.
You take off all of that “woe-is-me” stuff that the not-self carries and you pierce
through that to see the mechanism, and the mechanism liberates you. It just does.
I don‟t care whether or not I physically act out a superstition; I understand its me-
chanical root. It‟s just this mechanical root, this is what 25s do; it‟s just there. I
know that there is no good luck or bad luck for me. I know that. I already got long
past that. I‟m into “who knows” phase. It‟s like all this stuff that goes on in my life
now. None of it is upsetting to me in the sense that it is bad luck. It‟s like (sound)
it‟s been a very, very good learning process. I can see the advantages that come
out of the disadvantages. At the moment you get to the point where it‟s not about
the good luck or the bad luck, it‟s just about seeing, then all of it becomes so easy.
The 3/5 has its own dilemmas with all of this. The other thing is that 3/5s can sell
you luck better than anybody else. They‟re so good at it and they get into so much
trouble. These are the television preachers who commit every sin on earth when
they‟re not on screen—spend the money, have a good time—and you‟re out there
donating your last dollar to get a kiss from Jesus. You really have to see that 3/5s
are really good at that. The only thing is that they‟re equipped to get out of town
fast, and they do.

You have to remember that with any 3/5, there‟s always this assumption that they‟re
going to be able to deliver the goods. Nobody needs to be more correct than the 3/5
because the assumption is always there that they‟re going to be able to deliver.
They‟re going to be able to deliver good luck. Or they‟re going to be able to deliver—
“I want you to put a curse on my husband.” “Ok, I’ll put a curse on your husband.”
They‟ll be able to deliver bad luck. Whatever the case may be, they can sell you
good luck/bad luck. They‟re very good at selling charms. Again, not just in the old-
fashioned sense of that, but in the modern sense of that—ward off evil.

The 3/6
RAC Vessel of Love 1
The ultimate beauty of the 3/6 is that they can say to you, “I’ve had good luck and
I’ve had bad luck.” In the end, that‟s what they understand about life, that some
things work and some things don‟t, that things you didn‟t think we‟re going to help
you do; things you thought were going to help you don‟t, and so forth.
The way in which they look at the nature of life is that, at their best as a role model
in the Kironian phase of their process, they can look and see that the good luck and
the bad luck is simply life and not good luck and bad luck. In other words, it‟s not
about the interpretation as a measurement, but it‟s simply just a movement.
After all, what I‟m discussing here is the heart of the 3rd line theme. Any 3rd line
being on the Vessel has this deep, deep opportunity to recognize that their trial and
error process isn‟t about good luck/bad luck. It isn‟t about they have to be better in
order to achieve it. It isn‟t about getting rid of the trial and error process. If you
don‟t have bad luck, there are so many things that you don‟t learn. If you don‟t
have good luck, there so many things you can‟t celebrate. And it goes on and on
and on and on. The story is the whole movie.
In the same way that we try to teach 3rd line beings to appreciate their trial and
error process and to recognize its value in their life, you have to see that here in that
kind of configuration with the 3/6, they‟re going to see over and over again that it‟s
just there always. There‟s always good luck, there‟s always bad luck, there‟s always
something. It‟s not about how well equipped you are.
When you think you have protection, it doesn‟t mean that you do. That favorite
story of mine of the king who is told by its wizard that it‟s going to die, that it‟s going
to be murdered. The king says, “Is there anything I can do?” And the wizard says,
“No, get ready to die.” The king doesn‟t believe it, so the king dresses up as a pea-
sant and goes running out into the woods and eventually, late at night, finds an
abandoned hut and it goes into that abandoned hut and goes to sleep. In the middle
of the night, there‟s a lightning storm. Lightning strikes the tree beside the hut; the
tree falls down and smashes the brains of the king and he‟s dead. Good luck/bad
luck, who knows.

You‟re not going to escape what life is. It isn‟t a question of “can I use my know-
ledge to change bad luck into good luck” because it isn‟t the point. The measure-
ment is only important to the not-self. It doesn‟t mean anything to the true self;
nothing. All of that is a joke. There‟s just it-ness. It‟s ok, and it‟s this and it‟s that.
And there‟s nothing else to do. It is what the world is. It is what life is. This is it;
we live on the plane and on the plane there‟s this and that. People rise, people fall,
people come, people come, and people go.
If you‟re going to sit back and say that all of this is about good luck/bad luck, you‟re
in trouble because in the end you can‟t figure out how everybody gets measured for
good luck and bad luck. It‟s insane in the end. In the end you can only come to one
conclusion. It isn‟t about that. This is where you get into the deepest levels of the
potential of initiation and mysticism. This is where the real transcendence is.

The 4/6
RAC Vessel of Love 1
I guess on this cross they really codify for everyone the way. As voyeurs, they get
to see very clearly the up and down through their 6th line process and their 4th line
Personality. They also get to see what seems to work and what doesn‟t seem to
work. One of the things to understand about trying to bring people to the formula of
good luck/bad luck is that when you‟re going, it comes in many, many guises. There
are many ways in which you can take on the costume of trying to guide people out.
This priest/priestess business, whether that‟s teacher/friend, whatever it may be,
this 25 acting as that force that is going to establish for you your way of getting to
good luck, that‟s what initiation is. Initiation is all about changing your luck, change
your life.
The 4 has so much influence; the 4/6 Vessel has so much influence. Because they
are a role model, what they will live out are the advantages of their good luck/bad
luck. They‟ll be the role model embodiment of the good luck/bad luck and they will
have a direct connection to you and influence you directly. Why do you think we
have little churches in little towns? It‟s because the whole theme of spirituality is
dependent of 4th line activism. You can see how difficult it is for the collective to
create a universal religion. It just doesn‟t work.
But if the priest knows you, knows your family, knows the boy who‟s trying to get
into your pants, and on and on and on, that‟s a totally different power source. One
of the things to recognize about the real power of the priesthood is that it‟s rooted in
the 4th line. With a 4/6 Vessel, you‟re dealing with a very powerful, influential force
that, as a role model, can influence those people around them in an enclosed com-
munity.

These tend to be very powerful spiritual forces who can really mold people. Whether
it‟s from the extreme, like a cult, or whether it‟s at its simple level a bunch of kids
who hang out together and one of them is the 4 priest, however that works out, they
have and maintain their power through their ability to both influence you and to be
your friend, to know you, to know about your concerns, to know about your rela-
tions, and at the same time live out their example.
You can see what brought me good luck. It‟s like these people who run AA‟s—
Alcoholics Anonymous programs—and they‟re all ex-drunks. After all, they‟re all ex-
drunks; otherwise, they wouldn‟t be any good for that job. They know the bad luck
of alcohol. They come in to give you the good luck of alcohol. But it‟s the good luck
of alcohol, their way. And if they‟re a 4/6, they‟re really going to show you how they
live that and how they have derived benefits from that. They don‟t have to tell you
about it, you can feel it because they‟re the role model. At the same time, they
know you. They know when you‟re cheating, they know when you‟re lying, and they
know when you‟re slipping. They have such power over you because of that. As an
example, they can really put a lot of pressure on you.

This brings us to the Left Angle. The moment you accept that life has good luck and

Cross of Healing—I‟ve met a few
people who have this cross; they‟re
so proud of the name. Remember,
this is not the Vessel of Love any
 more. If you look at the configura-
tion where you have the 58 and the
52 replacing the 10 and the 15, you
have something very different.
The 58th gate is the energy to cor-

 rect. Not only is it the energy to
correct, but it is the pressure to
correct. When you understand that
that is what the 58th gate is, you can
recognize that nothing is free of
correction, that everything can be

corrected eternally, endlessly, infi-
nitely, that nothing is ever really
fixed, particularly humans because
we all know we‟re going to die. In
the ultimate sense of the word, you
can‟t fix humans. You can‟t make them perfect survivors.
The whole thing about the nature of the 52nd gate is that it tells you something very
important. It also shows you how all healing has been influenced by this cross. This
is Keeping Still Mountain. You‟ll notice something about the healing process. Almost
universally the healing process demands that the victim is still. Have you ever no-
ticed that? When you‟re sick, you don‟t go running. There‟s no reason why you
shouldn‟t go running, theoretically. The reality is that the way in which we‟re condi-
tioned on the Cross of Healing is that healing begins with stillness.

So, the first thing that happens to us the moment that anything is really wrong with
us is that they strap us into a hospital bed, or a mother or a father puts us into bed—
“Stay in bed, you have a cold, stay in bed. You have to rest. You won‟t heal unless
you rest.” I don‟t want to debunk that; it‟s obviously there. It‟s obviously a part of
healing. But I want to tell you why it‟s there: If you‟re out running, your witch doc-
tor doesn‟t control you. Isn‟t that cute?
One of the requirements of healing is that the healer has control from the healer‟s
point of view. One of the things that healing immediately does is restrict you. Bad
luck, you have to be in bed. It restricts you—bad luck, no screwing for the next
three months; bad luck, no more butter for the rest of your life; bad luck. And they
fix you. They make you stay still. There are all these people dying in hospitals, and
they‟re not allowed to go for a walk in the park even though it could be their last
day. “You have to stay still. If you don’t stay still you’re going to die.” “I know I‟m
going to die, idiot, I want to walk in the park. You just told me I going to die; what
does this have to do with healing?”
When you‟re looking at the 25th gate, you‟re not looking at anything other than a
way in which we are controlled to get to places of well-being spirituality, and we‟re
fooled. We‟re fooled because the not-self is a killer monkey idiot. There isn‟t any-
thing else to do with them. You fool them; otherwise, they don‟t know what the hell
to do. Unfortunately, they‟re being fooled to do things that aren‟t right. But what to
do, we live in a not-self world.
But don‟t be mislead—the Cross of Healing. It‟s not the next cross, which is the
Cross of Service. It‟s not about that. It‟s not about being here for the benefit of
humanity. This is the benefit of the healer. It doesn‟t mean that the healer can‟t
heal. It doesn‟t mean that healers aren‟t worthy. But the healer, like the priest,
needs to control you in order to transform you. They just do. They have to control
you. They‟re not going to let go of you.
So, the first thing to recognize about this cross is to understand that the first law of
healing is control the patient; immobilize them. And even better, drug them so they
don‟t even have to think about being immobilized; make them very still. The mo-
ment you have them very still, then you can use all the energy for correction.
Now, the 52-58 within this context is legitimate, understand that. In most cases,
stillness is a requirement of healing for the not-self. The true self does not require
that. They don‟t get sick in the same way. Oh, they get ill; everything is designed
to get ill, otherwise there‟s no mutation. But it doesn‟t mean the first criterion is
that they become immobilized so they can be controlled in their healing process.
And how are they healed? What is healed here is the spirit in the body. Supposed-
ly—25-46; heal the body. So how do you heal the body? You heal the body by
keeping it still and then you put your energy into correcting it. How do you heal the
spirit? You keep it still. You fix it. You keep it still. And then you use your energy
to change it.

Think about what happens when you send your kid to Sunday school. Just think
about that. What‟s happening in that environment is the way healing works. You
keep them still, you pump them full of corrective information, and you let them know
that it will bring them good luck. “Make sure you say your prayers tonight, Johnny,
before you go to bed because you’re going to have a wonderful day tomorrow if you
do that.” This is not about the cross of physical healing, necessarily. It‟s healing at
every level you can think about healing.
When you‟re dealing with the 5/1, you‟re dealing with a seductive force. This is one
of the most manipulative positions that the 5/1 can be in. It‟s very, very, very ma-
nipulative. This is the 5/1 who says, “I can heal you.” And before they can even say
it, you know it. “Oh, I know you can heal me. I know you‟re the person who can
change my life. I know you‟re the person who can fix me. I know you‟re the person
who can make a difference.” They can be very powerful and they‟re very controlling.
Remember, they‟re naturally paranoid. They‟re very controlling of their patients.
Something else, too, I don‟t want to get stuck just with talking about patients be-
cause it makes it all sound so formal. Healing operates at every level. There are so-
called healing forces that operate without licenses and education and all of these
things. Anyone who thinks they have something that‟s going to benefit you and
make your life better is acting out on the archetype of being a healer. And all hea-
lers are trying to control things.
Remember something about the 25th gate. What the 25th gate yearns for is Ego
power. It‟s over there across that channel—that gall, that courage, that blind Ego
force. All healers seek that empowerment, that they initiate others into well-being,
that they initiate others into this and into that, so they can shine their star. A 5/1 on
this cross, if they are operating correctly, if they respond to people in times of crisis,
practical provisions in revolutionary times, they can provide precisely the correct
healing in that moment as long as they have control over the other. These are hea-
lers who are dissatisfied. It‟s something to understand about them. They‟re usually
dissatisfied with the people they have to work with because they see that they‟re not
doing what they can to help themselves.

The 5/2
LAC Healing 1
The 5/2s are the people who know how to heal themselves. That‟s their special gift.
They know how to heal themselves, and in many cases that creates problems for
them because other people know that and they find out somehow and they want it,
too. But the way in which the 5/2 does something for itself is not necessarily some-
thing you can do or explain to others; again, this whole problem of being a natural
and a natural under pressure.
But they are extraordinary. You get a 5/2 and she goes to the doctor and the doctor
says she has cancer. The doctor says, “If you don‟t take chemotherapy you have a
couple of months to survive. Other than that, you‟re a dead duck. When can I

check you into the hospital?” And the 5/2, like it would say to God, “When I’m
ready; I’m not ready.” They can go home and they have within them the ability; it
doesn‟t mean they will, so people are not given false expectations from this kind of a
statement, but you really have to recognize the incredible power of the 5/2. It can,
on this cross, heal itself.
How it heals itself, whether it heals itself by standing in the kitchen and experiment-
ing with concoctions, no matter what it is, it finds a way to heal itself. That is only
brought about by the crisis that it‟s in a phase in its life where if it doesn‟t heal itself
it has a big problem. And that‟s true for many things. It‟s a trait I‟ve seen in my life
in dogs. I can remember a dog of mine that had been shot by a farmer here on the
island. You would think that the dog would come home; but it doesn‟t. They go
somewhere, they dig a hole and they lie down and try to heal themselves, however
that works within their consciousness. It‟s just one of those things.
It‟s very important to see that 5/2s have this gift. They can go home, curl up and
heal themselves. It‟s possible for them. Now, obviously when you‟re dealing with
somebody who is operating correctly, who is deconditioned, who lives as themselves
and carries this, they have a very, very special gift—the gift of re-vitalization.
The 58th gate is the gate of vitality—juiciness. It‟s such a juicy gate. It‟s really not
appreciated because it‟s connected to the 18. It‟s such a juicy gate, it‟s so juicy. It‟s
the juice of life. No more beautiful line than the 1st line of the 58—The Love of Life.
It‟s the most beautiful line in the Rave I‟Ching—gorgeous, juicy, beautiful, wonderful.
Without the juice, there‟s no healing.
The magic for the 5/2 is that they can get access to this font of vitality within them-
selves. And obviously, if they‟re correct and so forth, this would be an extraordinary
gift if it could be translated to the benefit of others. Of course, 5/2s are always re-
sented because they don‟t do things for humanity. They just don‟t; once in a blue
moon.

The 6/2
LAC Healing 1
I have two 6/2 Cross of Healing people in my life. They really represent what we call
the holistic approach to healing. A 6/2 Cross of Healing is somebody who almost
naturally will have a holistic approach to well-being. What I mean by that is the
recognition that everything is the whole that‟s greater than the sum of its binary.
Everything is about that. You look at a human being‟s Personality in Design, but the
bodygraph, the whole integration, that‟s the whole that‟s greater than the sum of
binary. It‟s always there.
When you‟re looking at a 6/2, we know because of the 6 process that they‟re going
to go through the trial and error process of healing. Most 6/2s on the Cross of Heal-
ing may not survive a very unhealthy youth. Remember that 6s are very vulnerable
in the profile to diseases and accidents when they‟re young. They are fragile be-

cause they are mutative forces. The 6/2 is going to go through this false healing,
mistaken healing, healing that doesn‟t really work.
This is an attribute, by the way. If you have the 25th gate, one of the first things you
learn is a fear of doctors. You learn it very quickly. You know right away that heal-
ing can be destructive. 70,000 people die every year in hospitals because of mis-
takes in surgery. That‟s just in America. If you send 70,000 soldiers to their death,
you‟d have a revolution on your hands. If you killed off 70,000 soccer moms, you‟d
have a revolution on your hands. But when healers kill 70,000 people a year, it‟s
just: Oops. Every year 160 people—I love statistics—are sewn up with medical in-
struments inside their body that‟s been forgotten. Oh, bless them. Check the profile
of your doctor, please. If you have doctor who has less than two year‟s experience
and they‟re a 1/3, give them your dog instead.
So one of the things you get with a 6/2 is, obviously with a 3rd line process, they are
going to be the subject of healing when they‟re young. Remember, something about
the 6th line of the 25 is that it is the line of hypochondria [Note: Hypochondria is the
5th line detriment keynote. The 6th line keynote is Ignorance.] It‟s not just about
healing. It‟s the need to be healed by others; it‟s hypochondria; it‟s the belief that
there‟s always something wrong with you. Every twitch you get you have to go to
the internet to find out what disease it looks like.
One of the things about people on the Cross of Healing is that they begin their lives
desperately needing healing. That‟s how they get on the Cross of Healing. One of
the oldest psychological statistics about doctors is that their deepest fear is death.
So, you train all your life to try to fight death. One of the things about healing is
that if you come in on the Cross of Healing it means you‟re going to have to be
healed before you‟re healed. And you‟re going to learn from that experience. You‟re
going to learn that you make mistakes.
I had a doctor, I‟m a gate 25, who gave me a shot of penicillin when I was 12 years
old and it put me into a coma. He was a spare doctor because my doctor was on
vacation and didn‟t check my chart to see that I was allergic to penicillin. So he just
shot me up with penicillin; he nearly killed me. He didn‟t even get sued. The worst
he got was a tongue lashing from my father, you know, “You nearly killed my son.”
Yeah, you idiot. It‟s just one of the those things, that if you‟re going to be a 6/2 on
this cross, you‟re going to realize right away that you can very easily be a victim of
healers rather than a client, a successful patient, of somebody who really heals you.
So, for example a 6/2 who has a disease when they‟re young that they manage to
survive, in the roof stage they can become enormously valuable exponent of how to
deal that, or live with it, or all of that stuff. Remember that the 6th line being is only
a valuable person when they‟ve had valuable experience. That‟s why we need to
exalt a 3rd line phase, the 3rd line experience, generally speaking, to understand that
the material upon we build our wisdom is the experience itself. If you negate the
experience, if you‟re embarrassed by the experience, if you consider the experience
to be a failure, then you lose the value of what the experience could show you, what
it could bring, what you could with it, how you could help others with it, and so forth.

6/2s are great healers because they know what not to do for you. That‟s great.
They know what not to put you through. They‟re the kind ones who say, “Usually we
start off with this, but in your case…” they know what not to do. This tendency with-
in them—because they see both sides, they see the trial and error, and so forth—
they get a much more holistic view of what healing could be. These are the kind of
doctors who might start off training to be a formal doctor only to end up to be fasci-
nated with acupuncture, or with Reiki, or with God knows what else. So eventually
you have these kinds of doctors that we‟re beginning to meet now.
For me with my children, because I have a splenic child and a non-splenic child, I
want a holistic doctor. I want a doctor who understands both modern medicine and
the tool of modern medicine, and at the same time a doctor who understands holistic
approaches, non-evasive approaches. In other words, I want a doctor who‟s a real
healer. And for me a real healer is the binary.
When I meet somebody who is only a homeopath—and I have great respect for ho-
meopathy, not for myself as a splenic Manifestor, that doesn‟t work—but I have seen
how effective it is, for example, on my child who has an undefined spleen. I have
learned to see how immediate and effective homeopathy can be. But I do not trust a
pure homeopath because I also know circumstances in which people that I have
known and cared about in my life ended up waiting much too long to look after deep-
ly, serious problems that were not seen in their life by the homeopaths. On the
same hand, I do not trust somebody who only is interested in dispensing pills from a
medicine cabinet. Or somebody who absolutely insists that the only way to do any-
thing is to cut you open.
It may be true, but I don‟t want anyone who has just that perspective. This is the
most beautiful thing here. 5/1s are a trip on this cross. But 6/2s are interesting.
6/2s open up the potential in what we live with now because this is our evolutionary
development; in other words, we simply don‟t go for the 5 who says, “I‟ll heal you. I
give you the promise of healing.” What we go to is the real truth, the role model of
healing. And that role model of healing is that there are many ways to heal. There
are many ways to heal the body. There are many ways to heal the spirit. And there
are many combinations for healing the body and the spirit. So this is a very impor-
tant step.
Again, everything about any explanation I give that glorifies the value of an aspect of
a cross, you have to see that this is only going to be the result of correctness. Oth-
erwise, you‟re going to end up, like with all 6s, with dilemmas that arise when
they‟re young that they never, ever get out of. One of the things about healing and
good luck and bad luck is that most discoveries in healing are good luck/bad luck.
For all of those men who seem to be addicted to Viagra, they better thank the bad
luck that happened in the laboratory when they were trying to find something that
they didn‟t find and the good luck that they found something else. Whatever story
you want to go to about healing, one of those things is good luck/bad luck.

The other thing is that what afflicts you is what you chase after. So you come into
the world and you have some kind of syndrome or something that you manage to
keep under control, you can end up being a healer of that simply because it drives
you in your process to focus on that as something that has to be dealt with. In that,
you can become very valuable for others. Your child gets a disease; you become the
greatest authority on that disease. And you become an authority that does not get
restricted by your barriers of this or that. You‟ll look at anything. If baked dog shit
will wake up your kid, you‟ll try it. When your child is sick, you will search for and
accept any possible solution because it‟s so desperate.
Again, that‟s one of the things to see about the 6/2, depending on the circumstances
of the first part of the life, where luck will take them, or bad luck will take them,
however you want to look at that, that is where there is going to be a potential focus
on their healing.

The 6/3
LAC Healing 1
The 6/3 says, “Look, all this stuff about good luck and bad luck and being healthy
and not being healthy; this is all a real trip. All we have to do—this is my opinion—is
just organize everybody. If we organize everybody, it’s going to be so much easier.
We can organize them to be healthy. We’ll invent hospitals. We’ll organize them to
be religious. We’ll just organize it. And as long as everything is organized, we write
all the rules and regulations and we put everybody in the organizational chart, hey,
everything is so much easier.”
So there‟s the 6/3 hanging on the edge of living and dying almost every moment of
their life on this cross. They look over to the other side and they say, “Hey, what we
really need here is organization. We need to organize health care. We need to or-
ganize good luck.” Where do you think lotteries come from? You organize the po-
tential of good luck. And most people will run back to the lottery the day they‟ve lost
because somebody else won. “Did you see that? He won 125 million bucks. I want
shot at that.” It‟s not, “Oh, that bastard.” It‟s like, “It could be me.”
If we organize the sense that luck is available for everybody, everybody can feel like
they can get lucky. Oh, organizing is such a trick. 17s—I‟m a 62—I look at 17s and
think—oh, my God, are they really going to organize that? Is that really necessary?
They‟re going to organize it all? Basically what you get is a kind of 1984 where you
come in and they give you your luck ticket. It‟s so organized. You‟re going to have
six experiences of good luck; you‟re going to have four experiences of bad luck.
We‟ve organized the whole thing for you. It‟s all laid out.

How do you think healing works? If you don‟t organize healing, then the collective
never benefits. It never does. They just gave out the Nobel Prize in medicine to the
guys who invented MRIs, magnetic resonance imaging, the people who can look
inside of your body without basically disturbing it. Now everybody uses it. It‟s deep-
ly organized the way all of us are penetrated by these machines. It‟s just the way it
works. Healing without organization doesn‟t lead to a healthier society. It just
doesn‟t. Everything, ultimately, needs to be organized into one of my favorite
things, hierarchy.
When you get to the 17, what you get to notice is that you don‟t have good luck/bad
luck. You just have your place on the ladder. You can interpret that place on the
ladder as bad luck because you have all these people above you, or good luck be-
cause you have all these people below you. And the 17 has figured it all out. The
moment you can accept your place is the moment you can be healthy. Ah, the pro-
gram is such a delight.

Introduction
We come to the 17th gate. Remember that the movement of the 6/3 and the 25, the
realization that the only way to protect us from good luck or try to give us the poten-
tial for good luck is if we‟re organized. So there is all of this collective pressure to
organize us. We would not have developed into communities unless we were able to
organize our security, organize our defenses, and organize our resources, on and on
and on. The 17th gate, for me anyway—when I say the 17th
gate, I‟m really talking about the 17.5 because it expresses
the nature of what it is to be informed. It says there is no
end to hierarchies. This the line of no man, no woman, is an
island. There is no end to hierarchies.
One of the things about good luck/bad luck is that it‟s always
a subjective point of view. What appears to be good luck for
somebody else may not be. What appears to be bad luck
may not be. These are perspectives. One of the things to
recognize is that the moment you know your place, this whole business about good
luck and bad luck begins to change. The moment your place is secure, then that
stops being one of the major questions.
Everything about the 17th gate is about establishing, through organization, structure
of bringing humanity together, but bringing humanity together in hierarchical form.
That means from the beginning we have had the ins and the outs. We have had the
head men and the low ones. From the beginning, there has always been the struc-
ture whether it is the caste structure, the class structure, the capital structure, what-
ever the structure happens to be; if you‟re rich and you‟re at the high end, and poor
at the low end, that‟s just another example of the 17th gate.
So, one of the things to understand about the 17th gate is that it, by its very exis-
tence, insures that we have hierarchical structure, insures that there is always a
caste system, and you can never escape it. When you get to the pure beauty of a
whole planet living as themselves, operating out of the Strategy of their Type, all you
get is another caste system with Projectors at the top and Manifestors at the bottom.
You just would get another caste system because it is the way it is.
If we take away the negative of what we think of about hierarchy, the ladder, the
cubbyhole, all of those things, we begin to understand that genetically that‟s precise-
ly what we are anyway. It is all hierarchical. It‟s the same thing with your chart.
Those activations that form what is the essence of your differentiation lock you in a
hierarchical potential. They just do; they put you in your place.
Everybody‟s design puts them in their unique place. That‟s the whole point. If eve-
rybody accepts their unique place—get rid of the accouterment of thinking about it in
terms of class and sex and money and all of those things—your true place is wherev-
er you are in your life as yourself. The moment you‟re that, there‟s no comparison.
The moment there is no comparison, there is no resistance to the hierarchy. It

simply doesn‟t make sense. Of course, with that goes envy and jealously, and so
on; so, all the nice things we can think about.
However, the not-self in the 17th gate is a totally different thing. It tends to be the
recognition of hierarchy for the advantage of trying to raise yourself up in the hie-
rarchy. The not-self uses the 17 as a tool in order to try to find its place somewhere
else on the ladder. The only way you can know where to go on the ladder is if you
know what the ladder is about. If you know the structure, you can find your way
and try to get your way through that structure.

The Right Angle Cross of Service 1
 18  52
Now, here in this context we are looking at the Right Angle Cross of Service. Ob-
viously, when you look at this you see something right away. You see that it‟s a
definition. And you see the definition that we‟re dealing with, because we‟re carrying
over the 58 and the 52 from the Left Angle of the 25, from the Left Angle Cross of
Healing, and healing turns into ser-
vice. Now, because of the definition,
this Cross of Service, these people
are born to complain. They are born
to correct. They are born for that. 
This is what they are here for.
The thing is, the cross name—it‟s a
good thing I‟m not in charge of what
I say or think. It really is because I 
wouldn‟t have given it this name. I

would have not called this the Cross
of Service. It‟s like a really nice
shield in front of what this really is
because it doesn‟t feel like service.
This is not like these are beautiful

creatures on bended knee offering
you food and a massage. This is not
the kind of service they had in mind.
The service is to let you know that
the collective is dissatisfied with you. That‟s the service. It‟s not personal, which
makes it even more infuriating. It‟s the collective. If anyone saw you today—
speaking from their perspective—if you look awful, you have two left shoes on or
whatever, the comment isn‟t, “I think you look ridiculous.” Oh, no, the whole world
thinks you look ridiculous. Everybody is going to think you look like an idiot. It‟s
like the whole pressure of humanity is on you because you have the wrong sock on.
And it‟s not personal, which makes it very, very, very difficult to deal with.

This is the thing about the 17 that is really so disturbing if you don‟t have it. It‟s like
opinion is never my opinion, it‟s the assumption, it‟s the opinion of the entire planet.
So when they say, “I think you’re an idiot,” they‟re not saying that. “Everybody
thinks you’re an idiot,” is what they‟re saying. They bring in allies that you cannot
defeat. Who are these other people? Who are they that they know me that inti-
mately that they‟re a part of your opinion? It‟s really insane.
I‟m a pure individual. When I hear collective opinion, it‟s not that the opinion itself is
something I have a problem with, it‟s the way it comes. It‟s never, “This is my opi-
nion,” because if it‟s “my opinion” then I can fight with it. I can fight with you. But
when the whole world thinks I‟m idiot, I don‟t have a chance. If I defeat you, it‟s
only one of the six billion who think I have the wrong sock on. And I don‟t have
enough of a life to go out there and deal with all of them. You can never beat these
people because they never stand alone.
This is the joke of the 17.5. No man, no woman is an island; what I think everybody
thinks. It‟s amazing. Why do you think the collective is so powerful? When I was a
kid, if you had a problem with another kid and you were going to have a fight with
them or whatever, that was ok. But if the kid showed up with 17 other guys, you
run. You don‟t stay for that. You just get the hell out of there.
Every time you meet the forces of the 17-18, this is their advantage. They never
stand alone. I have heard them espouse things that are so absurd. Yet, in the mo-
ment they‟re saying them, you can feel that six billion people agree with them, and
you‟re the only one on the whole planet who doesn‟t get it. You can‟t do anything
with that. You can‟t knock it down; you can‟t do anything because they will walk
away and say, “Idiot, everybody else knows you’re a fool.” You can‟t win, ever.
So, what to do. We have the Right Angle Cross of Service, and without the Right
Angle Cross of Service we would never have the illusion that all of us agree about
certain things. It‟s just an illusion. Through that illusion, we all get along better
because we all think that we all believe the same stuff. It is amazing the game that
is played on us through the 17th gate.
The 17th and 11th gates control the maia. They control the maia because they‟re the
eyes. It‟s how we see. And everything about the maia is constructed on the world
we see because we make it up. We make up what we see. The only reason we all
see the same thing is because somebody with a 17th gate said, “It’s a tree, you idiot,
everybody knows it’s a tree.” And you go, “Ok, it‟s a tree. If everybody else knows
it‟s a tree, I‟ll go along with it.” And then everybody knows it‟s a tree. Even if there
are all kinds of people who truly don‟t know it‟s a tree, they agree anyway because
everybody else seems to think it‟s a tree.
Human beings—what it takes to organize the not-self—the realm of idiots. It‟s so
easy to fool them. Nothing fools you better than collective, logical lies. We had this
research done. The moment somebody says that, half the world is already ready to
agree with the results, immediately. They don‟t want to be left out.

Think about how many people have an undefined Ajna Center. It‟s mind-boggling.
And think about how many people have an undefined Head Center; it‟s mind-
boggling. These people don‟t have their own concepts. These people don‟t know
what to think about if you leave them alone. The moment you have a 17, all of them
are saying, “Hey, everybody says…; everybody thinks…,” and it‟s done.
It‟s why I got tired of Human Design. I enjoy the Global Incarnation Index because
at the personal level, once you really understand how the program works, most hu-
man beings are really silly. It‟s really hard to have space for that. We‟re deeply
manipulated. The not-self is deeply manipulated. It‟s not that this is bad. You know
my sense of humor; I like to have fun with these things. It‟s not that it‟s bad. It‟s
essential.
One of the advantages, at least of collective services, is that it‟s logical. So ultimate-
ly if it‟s a lie, it will be disproved. It may drag a lot of people along for the ride for a
while, but in the end it can be disproved and because it‟s logical when it is correct, it
is of value to humanity for all of us to try to find a way to agree on this and that.
We do need to be organized, not simply in the way we march together down the
street, but we do need to be organized from the mental plane. There‟s no question
about it. It would be chaotic otherwise. So the value is there, there‟s no question
about that. It‟s just the way in which humanity is manipulated, and to recognize the
power of an opinion, that somebody comes in on a Cross of Service and their opinion
has enormous impact because it‟s very difficult to defeat.
I‟m a 62, I know so many 17s, and you can never win. You can never win with
them. You can never win the argument with them, never, even when you defeat
them, you cannot win. Because when they‟re defeated, they assume that there is an
army standing behind them that will back them up. They just do; they just see
themselves as just one blade of grass going down when there‟s an enormous field
there. You can‟t beat them. This is the incredible power of the 17th gate and the
way it molds our maia. When you get to the 62nd gate, you get to the gate that
actually creates in our language our way of reinterpreting and discussing and expe-
riencing the maia, the language of the maia. The 17/62—what that does in terms of
controlling our lives is enormous. Most of it is simply to control the way in which the
mental plane operates. That‟s all.
So, when you say to a 17, “Hey, look, I‟ve had really bad luck,” they can very easily
say to you, “Look, that wasn’t bad luck; it wasn’t at all. It was just about you not
knowing what to do or where to be or how to do this.” And the person says, “No, it
was bad luck.” The other one says, “No it isn’t. I know thousands of people and
thousands of situations,” and they go on and on. They have this whole statistical
army behind them. And they‟re of service.

The 1/3
RAC Service 1
The 1/3 is a foundation profile; it sets the tone of this Right Angle cross. One of the
things about the nature of the 17, and particularly when you‟re dealing with the 1st
line, is that part of the study is how to control people. Of course, the 17th gate leads
to the 21, so I‟m setting you up for the transition, but just to see that.
It‟s one thing to intellectually establish a system, an organization, but there‟s anoth-
er thing to enforce; there‟s another thing to make sure that people comply with what
seems to be the thing everybody believes. It‟s not enough simply to organize things.
The moment you organize things and the moment you create a law, you have to hire
a policeman. This is just the nature of the world. Otherwise, there‟s nothing to en-
force the law. Not only do you have to hire a policeman, but you have to hire judges
and lawyers, and it goes on and on and on and on.
It‟s one of the things to understand about service: Service is the root of bureaucracy
and bureaucracy is the root of giving people work. The only thing that gets rid of
good luck/bad luck is food on the table. That really helps. One of the main roles of
the 17 is the recognition that organization of humanity is all about organizing hu-
manity so that humanity can be productive.
The 1 is going to investigate—remember that the 17 is a mirror to the 11. The ca-
pacity is to teach. The 1st line is a great line of teaching. In the context of the 17, it
is more personnel management. It‟s more about managing people, getting people to
understand where they belong.
So the 1/3 on this cross is going to begin that process by trying to figure out where
they belong, where others belong. This is part of it. And having opinions about
where they belong or where they don‟t belong. Obviously, when you‟re a 1 and you
come into the world and you‟re given your position in the hierarchy by your parents,
you immediately, as a 3 unconscious, are ready to challenge it. Is this really my
place? Know thy place.
So, one of the things about the 1/3 on this cross is that it will challenge organization,
which means that the 3s coming out of the 17th gate crosses are disadvantaged in
this configuration. Anarchy does not go well with organizing. They‟re not a good fit.
One of the problems with the 3rd line in this context is that the moment they see that
the organization or the hierarchical structure, in their opinion, isn‟t correct, they
really want to tear it down. This is where real political anarchy had its roots. Politi-
cal anarchy is not tribal. It‟s disgruntled collective. And it comes from the 17.
So the 1/3 is going to be anti-organizational. They‟re going to be very good at
showing that all of that is nonsense. If you wanted to look at the political possibili-
ties, a 1/3 is going to be moving deep to the left. The 1/4 is going to be straight out
there on the right. Again, you have this wonderful dichotomy between the 1/3 and

Following
the 1/4. The 1/3 says, “Organization? This is awful. I don’t want to be stuck here
in this position. In my opinion, and I know a lot of people think exactly the way I do,
my opinion is this all wrong. I’m going to do something about it. I’m going to break
this organization.” So, they‟re troublemakers.
This is one of the few cases where you really get to see something so interesting
about the 1/3 even though this is not a good place for it. It is still the foundation
profile. It‟s telling you something about organization. Organization always brings
problems. Collective organizing always brings problems because the majority is
different than the minority. If you organize collectively, all you want is critical mass.
If you have more than 50% you treat the other 49% like dogs. You just do. It is the
nature of it.
Somebody who is individual or tribal and is subject to collective structuring, there is
an immediate visceral negative reaction, “I don’t want to go along with the majority;
they’re idiots.” What happens immediately is that those who aren‟t part of the ma-
jority become anarchistic. Every democratic election that you ever see, there are
always those in the loser camp who want to shoot the winner. Fortunately, most of
the time they don‟t; but, the reality is that you can really get left out by the collec-
tive, left in the cold by the collective, and feel like nobody cares about you because
of the collective.
Remember, the collective doesn‟t have that kind of bond. It‟s not tribal where you
touch and smell each other. It‟s not individual and deeply personal. It‟s not. It‟s
collective. The great thing about the collective is that it‟s ultimately the planetary
glue. But to get there is quite a job. You can see that built into the 17 is a very
obvious understanding. If you look at the chart of
mammals, you see that they have the potential of the
62, but not the 17. We‟re the dogs. This is a gate
where you train dumb beasts. It‟s what the 17 does.
It trains dumb beasts. You put the can of dog food in
the electric can opener and the dog comes in salivat-
ing. This is the 17 organizing, the feeding time for
the dog. For the 17, everything is about dumb
beasts. “They’re dumb, they need to be organized,
they don’t know how to do it themselves, they’re fools
and if we let them go they’re going to kill us.” It‟s
quite a gate.
So, with the 1/3 and the 1/4, you have this polarity

where the 1/3 is going to very quickly in its life be
anti-disestablishment, anti-this, anti-that. They‟re
going to have a lot of social difficulties. By the way, they may end up being of
enormous service—Cross of Service—for those who are anti-establishment. They
could organize anti-globalization riots. They‟re going to be on the other side.
Organizing is not just about the good forces. Organizing is yin and yang; organizing
is good and bad. A 1/3 is more likely to organize a terrorist cell than they are to
organize looking after Aunt Patty. But I also don‟t want to give all the 1/3s on this

be anti-establishment.

The 1/4
RAC Service 1
The role of the 1/4 is to trumpet the establishment. I watched a wonderful English
movie last night called The Hunting Party. There is a scene in 1913 in England, and
it‟s a class thing, the upper class of servants, whatever, there‟s a scene where the
lord of the manor is talking to one of the workers who he likes and he has a son who
is talented. He says to this man, “You know, my offer still stands. I will pay for your
son to go to a public school,” which is an English private school. And the father says,
“No sense going above his class. No sense building pretensions beyond his class.
No sense learning more than is suitable to his class.”
This is what this is all about. It really is about understanding that the 1/4 will come
into the world and live by the organization given to it. And not only live by, but con-
tinue to influence those around it with whatever that structural theme is. One of the
things that is so important to understand about the collective organizing of humanity
in order to deal with the trauma of good luck/bad luck is that basically organizing
humanity into strata is actually designed to eliminate dreams. Get rid of the dream,
get rid of the hope. If you get rid of the dream and the hope, then you‟ll get rid of
the envy and the jealously; you‟ll get rid of the need for those to tear down what
they do not like, and on.
If you can satisfy humanity, which is a theme of this cross, then they are going to be
controllable. You can satisfy them by fitting them in the right place even though
they don‟t agree. It doesn‟t matter if they don‟t agree; after all, you‟re the collec-
tive. The whole collective, the majority agrees and therefore, that means everybody
agrees and it means you have to go along with it, otherwise you‟re out.

The 2/4
RAC Service 1
The 2/4 starts its life saying: “Leave me alone, I don’t want to be called into this
organizing game.” They will be very, very organized on the inside. But there is
nothing in them that wants to be, because after all, this cross is a threat to a 2nd
line. The collective says that we recognize you have this talent, now you put that
talent out there. It‟s an enormous pressure for a 2nd line.
So you get a very strong, hermit Personality on this cross. But obviously, if you
come into the world as a 2/4, your life is going to turn at some point. That call to
that opportunity is going to be there. One of the things about 2/4s is that they can
be very, very powerful merchants of organizing; they can be very, very powerful

Following
forces of organizing. Even in my nickname for the profile, which is the missionary,
you can really see that here the zealot is born. When they turn, they really turn.
When they‟re the ones who see that you must be organized or everything will fail,
there they go.
This is a place where you have a lot of enclosed societies where people try to estab-
lish organization. We don‟t see it as much anymore. It was really an empire-
building phenomena when more advanced, technological societies began to explore
new lands. This is the kind of being who would rise up to take the job of organizing
the Indians into a Christian prayer group. It‟s important for them to do that because
the collective says that their gods are not the right gods. And if you want to fit into
the way in which the world works, you‟re going to have to go along with the way in
which they organize life, and the rituals of life, and so forth.
The 17 is very, very, very powerful. So when you‟re dealing with a 2/4 and you‟re
dealing with that change around, they can be a very powerful force, particularly in
small units. If I was going to want somebody to establish a cell, both on the good
side or the bad side, to be able to demonstrate the power of an organizational con-
cept, it‟s a 2/4 who would be the strongest force. The ability they have through the
4th line to be able to be of influence within a closed environment, to be on this cross
with the power of the collective behind them, they‟re 18/58s. There is nothing—the
only equivalent is the 41/30, which is its parallel—like the capacity of this to dig into
someone. It‟s what it‟s about.
It‟s why it‟s very difficult at the personal level for anyone to carry the 18/58. I have
seen the 18/58 in so many configurations. I‟ve seen it in people who are totally
unaware, totally unawake. I have seen it through various stages of moving along.
It is very difficult to be an 18/58 because sometimes it would be nice to be wrong.
And they‟re not really ever wrong. This is the whole thing about having the collec-
tive stand behind you. There‟s an enormous pressure on them. It is not their fault
that they see, that they‟re dissatisfied, that they make comments, and that they try
to organize you. It‟s not their fault; it‟s the mechanism.
After all, their witness has to live with that. As we all know, if you do not understand
that the 18/58 is collective, it is often exceeding difficult to deal with it because it‟s
taken personally. It was always my joke about collective people telling me that I
shouldn‟t smoke. It was never about me; it was never personal; it was never about
why do you, or do you enjoy it? It never had anything to do with me. It simply had
to do with a collective position. And that collective position is that you shouldn‟t
smoke.
It doesn‟t matter whether I can have a reasonably intelligent discussion with this
person and try to bring them around to see that that may be so for many, but it is
not so for me. There‟s no chance. If I don‟t know that they‟re coming from that
collective energy, my assumption is when they‟re saying that to me, they are being
very personal. They‟re not saying, “Ra, you should stop smoking,” even though that
may be how it comes out. What they‟re saying is that nobody should smoke. It‟s
this huge, collective patina. Nobody should; and of course, that‟s what‟s so infuriat-
ing about them—if you‟re not them—and yet it is their power.

The 2/5
RAC Service 1
For me, the nicest Cross of Service is a 2/5 because you never have to deal with
them; it‟s terrific. They never try to organize you. They don‟t care. They know
damn well because of their 5 that you don‟t really want to be organized. They can
get into so much trouble. Where the 3 is a real problem in the Cross of Service, the
5 is really disturbing. If my only understanding of heresy came from the 2/5 or the
3/5 on this cross, I would be embarrassed to be a heretic. One of the things about
the 5 on this cross is that for them, the great heresy is to not be organized, and not
know your place. They can vicious in the way they apply that knowledge. They‟re so
powerful and so seductive. They can be very, very frightening forces.
I don‟t mean to paint all that black, but one of the things to recognize about the 5th
line is that because it‟s advantaged, it‟s advantaged because it has the projection
that it can take advantage of whatever. If you project on me that I can initiate you,
it gives me an advantage in initiating you. It‟s just the reality. Of course, 5s pay a
price if they can‟t. If you have the projection, “I will …” and I don‟t, then I‟m in big
trouble. But still, recognize the power of the 5.
When you‟re dealing with the 2/5, this is the classic Buddha where you meet them
on the road and you kill them because they don‟t do anything for anybody. When
you‟re meeting this 2/5, if they do motivate themselves, remember they have to give
themselves the call. When they go out into the world, wow, are they a devastating
force because unlike the 4 where they can organize the closed unit, the 5 can bring
organization to the transpersonal realm of strangers. In other words, it can reach
out to the collective itself.
Remember that the 4 has its greatest advantage when it‟s operating within tribal
circuitry. The 5 has its greatest advantage when it‟s operating collectively because it
has its deepest impact on that whole world of the outside, the collective soup that
has everything in it, all the little tribes mixed in. So the 2/5 has the power. Of
course, when you‟re dealing with the potential of the heresy, the heresy is that the
2/5 can say, “Look, retarded children, they’re costing us a fortune, let’s kill them and
let’s sterilize their parents.” Heresies work all kinds of ways. Genetically speaking—
other than the killing of them—the sterilizing, genetically speaking, collectively
speaking, looking at it logically, there‟s nothing wrong with that. It‟s not like they‟re
concerned about the people. The collective isn‟t personal.
If you call out a 2/5, beware on this cross because you really don‟t know what you‟re
going to get because their capacity to organize is heretical. They will take stances
that nobody else will take. They will try to organize things that nobody else would
dare organize. And rather than being open to being burnt at the stake themselves,
they will burn others. They will turn the sword on them; they‟re the heretics; burn
the witches. Do you want to know who organized the burning of witches? You‟ll find
yourselves a 2/5 on this cross. Burn the witches, turn it around, they‟re ruining our

organization. They‟re ruining the possibility of peace and security in the collective
realm. If somebody happens to be born on this cross and they have that profile, I
don‟t mean to suggest that you necessarily will turn out to be Torquemada, but you
know it‟s something to keep in mind.

The 3/5
RAC Service 1
Again, we‟re dealing with the 5 in this context, so you can see there is a tremendous
potential. The difficulty is that there is the 3 and they tend to balance each other
off. The potential strength of the 5 and the weakness of the 3 in this cross, when
you put the two of them together, you don‟t have a happy 3/5 because what you do
get out of this is a personal anarchy that turns into an attempt to seduce others into
anarchy.
One of the things that‟s so clear to me about the 3/5s I‟ve known on this island is
that they‟re all classic representatives of this kind of archetype in which they rebel
deeply against being organized. They are deeply anarchistic against the structure of
the society and the rules they come from.
Yet, at the same time, because they are a 5 and they are on this cross, when they
do run away—and 3/5s on this cross will run away from their first prison—there is a
need to organize their very vision of what they think it should be. It‟s there. One of
the beautiful things about the 18/58 is that it never stops trying to improve in the
sense of never stopping its process of challenging the pattern to make sure it can be
correct. It‟s fueled by the 58. This is a beautiful energy. This is the pressure to
correct and we need it.
Even when you‟re dealing with the anarchy of the 3/5 in this position, you still have
to see that this anarchist will still be somebody who needs to be part of and needs to
create organization. It‟s very funny because what happens is that you begin to dis-
cover—and 3/5s are the ones who teach us this—that whenever it comes to bringing
human beings together, there are certain, universal structures that are just there.
You can‟t do without them because to do without them is to bring chaos, just chaos.
It‟s one of those things that the 3/5 gets to find out. It runs away from the organi-
zation that it grows up in, thinking that whole collective—“Me and all of my genera-
tion think you’re crazy, that the way you do things, the way you live your life, the
way you think things are important, my generation is going to be different than your
generation”—typical 3/5 on this cross—“My generation is going to make a difference;
my generation is going to have a new structure.”
What you discover is it‟s the same damn structure. The moment you live together
with other people, you need rules. The moment you live together with other people
and you have children, you need environments and you need schools and it goes on
and on and on. No matter how much you rebelled against what you thought were
structures that were unfair—because you do see, you‟re a 3, after all—you see what

doesn‟t work in them. The collective doesn‟t care about things not working, other-
wise there would be nothing to correct.
The collective assumption is that life is a work in progress, which is correct. The
collective is born to be dissatisfied with the process that‟s in progress because it‟s
always in progress. So your value as a dissatisfied vehicle is great because we al-
ways have something to be dissatisfied about. So, even the rebels, when they go
away, if they‟re on this cross, there‟s no escaping your cross. You still end up having
to deal with organizing. The advantage with the 3/5 is perhaps what they get to and
what is important for all of us, is they get to simply the practical basis of organiza-
tion.
You can see that in the sense in the way, like the 10 commandants with “Thou shalt
not kill,” one of the first things that is organized is that you leave your neighbor
alone. If you can leave your neighbor alone, you can live with neighbors. Then you
go from there. And then you discover that all of that is not so easy. So, no matter
where you go on this Right Angle, you‟re going to end up in the organizing business
and you‟re not going to escape it.

The 3/6
RAC Service 1
The 3/6 is hilarious on this cross because unfortunately, 3s don‟t work here. If you
look at this Right Angle very carefully, you have a 1/3, a 3/5, a 3/6, and a 4/6. The
3/6 and the 4/6 are going to have three phases, as well as the fact that the 3/6 al-
ready has a 3. In other words, you have four profiles that are anti-establishment in
one way or another. Think about that; it‟s interesting.
So when you get to the 3/6, you have to see that this is somebody who is always
going to struggle with the order. Their capacity is to be deeply, deeply, deeply criti-
cal. Obviously, here all we get to see is the definition that‟s a result of the cross.
We don‟t know what their characteristics are. We know they‟re not a Reflector, but
aside from that, we don‟t know what their Type is. We don‟t know how they‟re going
to operate as a whole, but please see that all the 3/6 on this cross ever really gets to
see is what doesn‟t work in trying to organizing human beings.
Obviously, if they can be subject to a revision of what it means to be a 3 and under-
stand its value, and so forth, this is an enormously valuable trait. It stops being a
negative. After all, the 6 and the 3/6 says that at some point or another in the life
program, this person has the capacity and potential for wisdom, to be a trusted
force, and to be a leader, even if it‟s a leader of chaos, but it has that potential.
The real gift of the 3/6, if it wakes up on this cross, is that it can say to us, “Look, let
us be much more efficient. We can be much more efficient by recognizing that there
are certain things we can never, ever, ever organize in humanity and we shouldn’t
bother. Let’s not try to organize humanity’s sex life because you can’t. So why
bother?” Whatever it turns out to be, it‟s one of those things to really look at.

The 3/6 is there to say, “Hey, wait a second, there is no point in organizing this.
Look at all the resources we’ve wasted and look at what we get for it. It would be
much more efficient for us to try to organize this better over here because this is
something that, at least, is of service to humanity.” In the end, that‟s the purpose
on this cross, to be of service to the collective. The way in which you‟re of service to
the collective is that you do not allow the collective to waste its energy. What for?
It‟s just simply not productive. So a 3/6 can take you that place.

The 4/6
RAC Service 1
When I get to some profiles on some crosses, I can hear already what‟s beginning to
come out of me. There‟s a part of me that sort of wants to censor it and clean it up
and make it prettier, and fortunately, I really don‟t do that, but I also am very aware
that when I say something somewhere, someday, somebody who has this cross and
this profile is going to read that.
So, when I come to the 4/6, keep that in mind; the not-self can be a terrible thing.
And if you wake up it‟s a different movie. The 4/6 is one of those things that all of
us have seen because it‟s an archetype of organization, and depending on the quality
of the relationships in youth—remember nothing is more significant in terms of the
4/6 than their 4/3 phase, their first Saturn cycle where the risk is their friendships.
So, for example, if their 3rd line draws them to a weighted anarchy side in their first
30 years, then they‟re going to display an enormous amount of anti-establishment
behavior. They just will. They will be very powerful in that. They do have that
power through the influence of the 4, so this is a very powerful being in terms of
their associations with others. Because it‟s this cross, it‟s going to have a natural,
organizing, critical capacity that can be very valuable to defeating the establishment.
This is the kid who figures out how to blow up the teacher‟s seat and nobody gets
caught. You work it out, and you work it out with your friends—anti-establishment.
I love standup comedy. I love it, it‟s wonderful. To me it‟s one of the most incredi-
ble things to do in the arts. It takes enormous courage. It‟s like bullfighting; it‟s
quite a thing. There was this comedian I was watching—I watch Comedy Central
from the States and they have all of these standup comics and you get to see the
jokes of the day; I love the jokes of the day. But, there is a guy who stands up on
his birthday or something and says, “I want everybody who knew me before I was
30 to forget I ever existed.” And I thought, yeah, baby. I understand that because
when you are a 4/6 on this cross, by the time you get out of that Saturn cycle and
you go up onto the roof, you go from being long-haired hippy, radical, ant-
establishment boom-boom to being a short-cropped corporate wonder.

In other words, you go the extreme from one side of the establishment to the other
side of the establishment. Now, that‟s quite a movement. It really is. For the 4/6,
this would be its natural movement. You go from ant-establishment to establish-
ment. Basically, the anti-establishment phase teaches you how to play the estab-
lishment game. Once you go from the subjective where the anti-establishment
seems to be the meat of your life and you go the objective where the establishment
means the meat that you can eat, it‟s a totally different movie.
So, this is the classic movement here in the 4/6. This tells us something about the
organizational process, that old thing about “sow your oats while you‟re young.” We
are allowed to be anti-establishment when we‟re young. It‟s good for us. It‟s good
for us to rebel. I wouldn‟t want to have a child that never rebelled. It‟s boring. It‟s
like, come on, it‟s not all perfect, what do you think. And it‟s one of the things to see
that the 4/6 is there to teach us; this is real service. And the service, yeah, sow
your oats while you‟re young. Just don‟t burn out. Don‟t die doing it. There‟s the
other side of the coin coming.
Now, of course, what we do know is that not everyone who sows their wild oats
when they‟re young settles down 25 years later; they don‟t. You end up getting
caught on that side of the world. This is an archetypal description of the phenomena
of what it is for somebody to be overwhelmed by their conditioning. To be the not-
self and go through a 3rd line phase and not understand it. These are people who
can end up assuming that the establishment is horrible all their lives and fight it all
their lives from all kinds of perspectives instead of going over to the other side.
It‟s the archetype of the 3rd line process of the 6th line being. If you don‟t go through
those first 30 years clean, you go through knowing it‟s ok, it doesn‟t all have to work
now, I‟m learning things, and it‟s alright. If you can go through that way you‟re
going to get your wisdom on the other side, you‟re going to have the resources, the
right material to work with. So, the 4/6 on this cross is there to teach us that. It is
ok when you‟re young—not for everyone—4/3, remember, if you hook up with
friends who are anti-establishment, that will be your trip. But if you do, it‟s ok, just
don‟t get lost in that. Don‟t think that‟s your life; don‟t think that‟s everything be-
cause it isn‟t. It‟s going to pass.
Now, the real test is when you get to Kiron because you‟ll go from your anti-
establishment to establishment and all of a sudden you get successful and fat and
rich and all of that stuff, and you‟re laid back in your world with all of your goodies
and Kiron comes. Then you have to deal with both. It‟s no longer it‟s “this” or it‟s
“that.” What‟s what so special about being a role model is you don‟t need to be loyal
to “this or that.” A role model is only loyal to its nature; nothing more, nothing less.
So here in the 4/6, you really see something about the nature of organization, that
the collective, in its wisdom, leaves room for rebellion when you‟re young. We do
our best to control your rebellion, which we‟ll get to soon enough.

We come to the Juxtaposition Cross of Opinions. I'm glad there are very few of
these beings. My relationship with the 17th gate is one of the deep, deep, deep hu-
mor. And considering that it is a projected channel, it's full of bitterness. I‟ve dealt
with so many opinions and I'm a 62. I‟m Mr. Facts and when I hear opinions it‟s like,
hey. But when you're dealing with a 17/62, they bring their own facts to their own
opinions, and it's amazing—you can't do anything. Nothing, nothing.
One of the things that has taught me surrender mentally is dealing with 17s. More
than anything else, dealing with 17s has shown me don't push the river. It doesn't
work. And you deal with a 4/1 opinion maker, you think for a moment that any ar-
gument with them at any level, any
data, any facts is really going to make
a difference? No. This is as fixed as
you can be. Fortunately, they don't
normally get to a place where they can 
really impact broadly with that kind of

Where it gets interesting is when we
get to my favorite these days—the Left
Angle Cross of Upheaval. I like that.
What I so appreciate about the program is that it's not moralistic. You can tell right
away that God didn't make it up because if God made it up it would have been mora-
listic because it would have been made up by our moral design system. There is no
morality here. This is just derived from specific gates and lines in certain colors. It
has nothing to do with that being a principle that there's good and bad.
The first thing we see in the 17 when we‟re dealing with the Right Angle is that there
is a need to organize humanity and there is a need to organize humanity collectively,
which means to organize humanity by majority. The moment you have critical mass
then you can transform or hope to transform the rest of humanity and at the same

time by having all of that union, in that sense, that the society can move more easi-
ly.
But the moment you get to the Left Angle, and remember the Left Angle is the prop-
aganda of the research that the Left Angle says, “Organizations? They don't work;
they don't last.” No organizational system ever devised for humanity has ever really
been able to survive. At one point or another, it‟s going to be torn down and it's
going to be torn down for the same reason that that organization was created in the
first place.
Remember what organization was created for. It was to protect us from good
luck/bad luck, only to find out that there are organizations that bring good luck and
organizations that bring bad luck. When they bring bad luck, you get upheaval.
When some idiot organizes you and says to you that you can no longer own your
own property, sooner or later you're going to meet upheaval. You just will. Sooner
or later there‟s enough in the critical mass that says, “Hey, I want a piece of turf
that's my own.” You cannot rob people of the 19th gate. You can‟t. Sooner or later
they're going to want their own turf. And no matter how strong the opinion, no mat-
ter how powerful the collective, sooner or later you're going to have upheaval.
Built into the 17 is a serious problem with the 5; aside from the difficulties of the 3,
the serious problem of 5 just as we saw with the 2/5. So when you're looking at the
5/1 on the Cross of Upheaval—in Canada, where I grew up, if somebody was a
troublemaker they called them a shit-disturber. Now, I know it is crude, but this is
the profile of „you want upheaval, they will give you upheaval.‟ You organize every-
body into a factory, they start the union. You want upheaval, they will give you
upheaval. Everything that gets organized, there is a heretic who comes along and
creates trouble.
This whole business about Arnold Schwarzenegger in California, one person—I‟d love
to see his chart—a very rich Republican California State Senator, spent his own mon-
ey, only him, one person, spent his whole money to start the petition that would get
rid of the Governor that would lead to the election that would bring in Schwarzeneg-
ger. One man, nearly 2 million dollars out of his own pocket, one person; this is
California. If California was a country, it would be the 10th richest country in the
world. It's huge. All the lives of those people and all the politicians and all that
stuff, and everything that's gone on in that whole movie, one shit-disturber, one guy
with a thick wallet, whack. You want upheaval; I‟ll give you upheaval, and upheaval
they got. [Note: Arnold Schwarzenegger is a 5/1 Manifesting Generator on the Left
Angle Cross of the Alpha. He has the 18 and 17/62. Born July 30, 1947 at 04:10 in
Graz, Austria.]
5/1s on the Cross of Upheaval bring trouble. If they're going to get punished, they
will. The only thing that ever protects a 5/1 is their paranoia. The fact is that they
know if they make trouble in certain situations, they will not avoid punishment. They
know it; they can smell it. At the same time, it's hard not to live your purpose. If
you are 5/1, sooner or later you're going open up your big mouth, I know. Sooner
or later you're going to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. Or do the wrong
thing at the wrong time and display your heresy and deal with the consequences.

The 5/2
LAC Upheaval 1
The 5/2, because they have to be self-motivated, rarely create the same kind of
upheaval. What you tend to see in the 5/2 is upheaval in their own life. Everything
they touch seems to go bouncy. There are all kinds of breakdown in the way in
which the organizational flow of their life works. But rarely do you see them actually
have the universalizing impact that‟s possible.
Remember, the only truly transpersonal cross is the 5/1. It's the only one that really
fulfills the responsibility of trying to bring forward something that's derived out of the
Right Angle. The 5/2 is aware of it, but the 5/2 because of its configuration, doesn't
necessarily take on that mantle and go out there and do its universalizing job. It's
much more difficult to call the unconscious than it is to call the conscious. It‟s much
easier to call a 2/4 or a 2/5 than it is to call a 5/2 or a 6/2 because again, if you're
calling their Personality, they hear it. If you're calling their unconscious, the doorbell
doesn‟t work; they don‟t know. It‟s not like they hear you calling.

The 6/2
LAC Upheaval 1
This is a very nice 6/2. One of the advantages of the 6s is that because they do go
through that 3rd line phase, if they manage to keep their lives relatively together,
there is real wisdom that comes from experiencing both sides of the coin. It is one
of their essential values. It shows us something about the nature of the coming
mutation and this new life cycle we live in. Basically we‟re all designed to go through
a positive/negative process before we can get to a quantum, flowering process. The
6s bring us that archetype. The 4/6 of this Right Angle showed us that you can go
from anti-establishment to establishment. I did and still stayed a freak. But still, I
went from one side to the other. It's very clear, you can see these things. They are
archetypes in the world for us. It‟s made possible, it was allowed because it's built-
in.
When you're looking at the 6/2, what you're really getting at is not somebody who
resists. The 6/2 ultimately on this cross is not so much somebody who creates
upheaval, but is somebody by their very nature inspires upheaval. They just simply
inspire it. Now remember, upheaval is a very powerful word. It really means to turn
things upside down. I think the etymology goes back to farming and tilling and turn-
ing the soil.
This is really about turning things upside down. And that tells you something about
how wonderful this is for a 6/2 to be here. They are upside down people. They
know that; they know that process. They also know that going from—and by the
way, please understand, there are many people who will start establishment and go

anti-establishment. I don't want to leave them out. Wherever you have one side of
the coin, you have the other side of the coin, those things are there. The thing
about the 6/2 at the end of their process is that none of that really matters. There is
no point in identifying with the anti-establishment or with the establishment because
it's all the same thing. It‟s that we are part of an organizing force larger than the
human variations we see. We know that.
I have surrendered now for a very long time to the obvious. Everything is deeply,
deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply organized. We‟re not in charge of anything. It‟s in-
credibly organized. The ultimate philosophical statement is: It's not in my hands.
This is one of those classic expressions of the 6/2 on upheaval. “It's not in my hands
to bring it or not. It's not in my hands to guide you to one side or the other. It's not
in my hands; it’s in the hands of the Gods, whether it's up or down, or in or out, or it
works or not, it’s not in my hands.” However you translate that, whether it's in the
hands of God or the Gods or the forces or the program, whatever language we want
to use, this is the ultimate position when it comes to organization: To accept that we
are organized, that we all have our place, and that our place is perfect if we only
simply could see it.

We know right away what the 6/3 is going to think. The 6/3 sees upheaval every-
where, is part of upheaval everywhere, and recognizes that upheaval is a negative
force against organizing the benefits for humanity. And so where do they have their
foot? They have their foot in good old 21. They have their foot in that door that
doors says, “All right, you will do what I say, or else.”
The moment we bring in the 21, we bring in the tribe. We bring in tribal authority,
we bring in tribal power, we bring in the tough guys, we bring in the cops, we bring
in the controlling agents, we bring in the tax agencies, we bring in the investigators,
we bring in the whole circus, all of them—the spies, the snitches, you name it. Every
single possible variation of how you can control people is all there in the 21. And it's
not just controlling them in terms of keeping them organized, it‟s controlling them
far beyond that—control what they eat, control what they wear, control where they
live, control where they are educated, control what they do, control what they're
paid—control, control, control.

Introduction
Welcome to the 21 and one of my favorite crosses: The Right Angle Cross of Tension.
Nothing gets done without tension. It's a scientific principle. Tension is important.
It's necessary. If you truly want to understand the Cross of Tension, all you have to
do is look at the four harmonic gates [indicated in yellow] and you will see precisely
the role of the Cross of Tension. It‟s to provoke those four harmonic gates. The 21
is provoking the 45, always. “I'm in control; you do a better job” to the boss. It
provokes the 45 because the 21 is always telling the 45, “We need more money.”
This is the role of the 21 to the
45. The 21 says to the 45, “We
need more money, we need
better schools, we need this we
need that,” whatever the case
may be. But it's the 21 that
provokes the 45. Usually what
the 45 says is “Okay, let's raise
the taxes.” How nice of them.
But anyway, that's another way
of controlling people. In the
feudal system you were so
heavily taxed that there was
nothing that was yours; every-
thing belongs to the Lord and
its manor.
When you're looking at the 38th,
it provokes risk-taking [gate
28]. If there is no risk you
never have a chance for pur-
pose. If you‟re the 39th gate,
you‟re going to provoke the
spirit [gate 55]. Without the right spirit, you cannot accept your place. The 48 is
provoking skills [gate 16] with its depth. Every single one of these aspects, that's
what they‟re there for. The not-self on the Cross of Tension ends up taking all of this
provocative energy that they‟re supposed to be putting out to the other and they
take it in on themselves and they‟re at the chiropractor twice a week instead of
sending other people to the chiropractor twice a week, which is what their job is.
So, when you come to the Cross of Tension, what you're looking at is that nobody is
designed to like a 21. I don‟t mean to offend anybody who is a 21, but I mean
they're not made for that. They are going to control you, they‟re going to hire and
fire you, they‟re going to execute you, they‟re going to take your firstborn male,
they‟re going to take your firstborn female, they‟re going to empty your bank ac-
count, they‟re going to burn down your house, and they‟re going to jail your rela-
tives. You think that there's anything in them that is designed to be nice?

If you carry the 21 in your design—we all want to be sort of nice and want people to
like us and all of that stuff. One of the things you notice about people on the Cross
of Tension is that they bend over backwards to seem like they‟re nice people. Noth-
ing like the not-self Cross of Tension. These are pussycats, sweet pussycats who
suffer deeply inside. They‟re walking around like this, waiting for their next mas-
sage. That's not what they're here for.
The hardest thing about being an employer, the hardest thing about running an or-
ganization for me is those moments where something comes to an end. And I know,
an open emotional system, avoid confrontation and truth, my mind says “give them
another week,” but you have to do that; you have to be able to close the door. You
know they're not going to like it. You know for years they‟re going to curse your
name every time it comes up, and yet you go through that process and you realize
right away that you can't afford to be sensitive to that. You can‟t; otherwise, it
doesn't get done. Otherwise, you can't live with yourself; you can‟t wake up the
morning and look in a mirror.
So, one of the things about this cross is to understand its power in terms of this kind
configuration, particularly when the Personality Sun is in the 21st gate. You're deal-
ing with an enormously powerful force. This is the coordinating energy for all tribal
functions. Forget the 51. We‟ll see that's another movie. The tribe is intended to go
through the 21. It doesn't even like the 51. The 51 siphons off some of the best
members of the tribe and pulls them away from the control of the 21. This is the
state and all its power and it‟s done to support you. The thing that makes the 21 so
powerful is it's not collective, it's not impersonal, it's right in your face, it's right
there in front of you.
After all, the idea that there would be police would mean nothing if you didn't see
any. They're right there in your face. And you‟re concerned about them because
they‟re right there in your face and you know that any moment if you try to break in
that store window, you know that any moment there might be a patrol car coming
around a block. It‟s right in your face, which means you're dealing with controlling
agents being right there in your aura, touching you, smelling you, putting their
hands on you. Control is physical.

The 1/3
Let‟s look at the 1/3; you come in on the Cross of Tension. The most difficult thing
about the Cross of Tension is that this is one of those cases where you're looking at
the graphing and until you see it in the bodygraph, it's hard to figure out how this is
actually going to work. It's one of the dilemmas because of the nature the 21st gate.
Defined and undefined Egos are very, very different from each other in the way in

which they operate and control. If you‟re dealing with this 21st gate being activated
in an undefined Ego Center, you're dealing with the strategies of that undefined cen-
ter; you‟re dealing with somebody who always has to prove themselves. Their con-
trol will often be very cruel and brutal because they are trying to prove themselves.
These are ones who really will go overboard in their need for control. This is some-
thing that can be extremely dangerous. And, of course, they end up being very
frustrated in their life because that kind of control is always challenged, and control
does get challenged. Instead of the tension going out, the tension goes out but the
tension is also inside, the deep tension within themselves that they don't have the
willpower to really control. If you don't have willpower, you can‟t control people.
You can't. So one of the things about the 21 in this situation where it's in an open
center is that without the right allies in their processes, it‟s going to be very difficult
for them even to live out this proper control aspect of their nature.
However, if it's going to be in a defined Ego Center, Heart Center, then you really
have in the 1/3, as an example, somebody who will look deeply into control and what
control really is. Remember that the 1 has a real gift for exploring, penetrating,
going into things. Now, the whole thing about the 1/3 in this case is that they will
recognize right away who doesn't
have control. They will recognize
when its mother or father does not
have control. It'll recognize when it
takes control what kind of tension it 
creates in others. It will start going
through all of these things. But in
the end, its anarchy will come out.

The anarchy on this is that they do
not want to accept other people's
control. The assumption of everyone

born on this cross is that only they
can control things and as long as
they don't control things, they are
going to be very, very unhappy, and

the 1/3 will be deeply rebellious.
Their rebellion will be not to point
out that, for example, their mother
has lost control. Their rebellion will
be to control their mother as much
as possible, and in controlling their mother as much as possible, create tension in the
mother. If you meet a 1/3 on this cross and they‟re tense, they have a problem. If
you meet a 1/3 on this cross and their mother is tense, they‟re doing well because
the job of a 1/3 is to crank somebody else up.
The whole thing about control is that people have learned that when you control
people, that part of their anger at being controlled leads to performance, funny
enough. I'll show you, I can do that. When the 21 comes by and pats you on the

back, physical contact—that was good, really good. Wow, that feels good. I don't
mind being controlled.
It's one of the things—it‟s tribal. You have the tribal chief and he‟s sucking the blood
out of the tribe, sucking it dry, his servants and food. But he goes down there to the
lowliest worker on his morning stroll, he pats him on the back, he remembers his
name, he asks him how his little boy is; wow, tribe, powerful. And then when some-
body says, “You know, the chief is stealing from us,” there's all this, “Yeah, but he
does care about us.” “What do you mean? You're starving, you idiot.” “He asked
me about my little boy this morning.” One of the things about understanding power
in the tribe is it‟s never, never allowed to be separate from contact with the people.
You can't rule unless you can touch them, you can't rule unless you can directly im-
pact them—the Cross of Tension, crank them up, get them going, both positively and
negatively.
Wherever you look at the Cross of Tension, this is the one. The 21 is the key to this
whole configuration. It doesn't matter whether you‟re going to go to the next arm
and the next arm and the next arm and the next Quarters. It‟s really to understand
what tension is all about. Unless you‟re in control—and remember this is all illu-
sion—unless you're in control of your life, unless you're able to control others on this
cross, you're going to end up being sick, you‟re going to end up being full of tension
because that's what you're here to do. You‟re here to provoke others, you‟re here to
push others, you're here to drive others, and you‟re here to control others. Whether
it's only your dog or your lover, you still have to live that out. You must, and if you
don't, it‟s all inside.
I know a lot of Cross of Tension people. Whenever I meet them, I tell them the
same thing, “Look at those four gates and understand what you're here to do. If
you're pissing somebody, off you’re doing your job. If you're cranking somebody up,
you’re doing your job. If you're pushing somebody to go beyond where they think
they can go, you’re doing your job. If you can provoke somebody in defining their
spirit, you’re doing your job. If you can push them hard enough that they will make
more money for themselves and for you, you’re doing your job.” That‟s what the
Cross of Tension is all about. And this is a case where the not-self is devastating
because of the principle of tension. That 38-39 combination is so powerful. It's so
powerful and so provocative.

The 1/4 on the Cross of Tension can really make people sick, physically. They‟re
great carriers of bacteria; they‟re great carriers of infection. Some people can only
be transformed through illness. All of us need to catch colds. If we don't catch
colds, we don't keep up with the existential environment we live in which means that
we‟re at risk, so we need to be able to have that common basis.

Humanity needs to get sick to revitalize its vehicle. Every time you recover from an
illness in which the illness is part of what is the normal process, you come out of that
actually better equipped than a healthier human being. But it also means that your
body, when you're sick, has to do things it doesn't normally do. It has to work in
ways it doesn't normally work in order to combat whatever it is you're dealing with.
It‟s one of the principles of tension. One of the principles of tension is that some-
thing is put into you. This is the way other people control you. We know that
through conditioning, they put something in you. Everything about the Cross of
Tension is about getting people moving, get them going, get them involved, get
them out there, get them working on their skills, get them out there finding their
purpose, get them out there finding their spirit, get them out there getting richer.
These are the four themes. It's always being pushed. Fours, in and of themselves,
are influential and can always be the carrier.
When you're dealing with the not-self 1/4 on this cross, they spend their whole lives
physically suffering. They‟re the ones with all the tension instead of really getting all
of that out. So, when you‟re dealing with a 1/4, it's very difficult to change them in
this life. It's so important for them to understand why people react to them in cer-
tain ways. To understand it's not personal in the sense that it's not behavior they
have to change. For them to see that this is the way for them, that they will benefit
humanity this way, and they will have a productive life this way.
If you meet somebody on the Cross of Tension and they are awake, they are great
allies in this life. Those four themes for all of us are so important—to find a skill in
this life, to be ready to take the risk to find your purpose in this life, to find your
spirit in this life, and to do well materially. You can't ask for a better combination.
How tragic it can be to meet people on this cross and see how much they suffer
within themselves over those four themes instead of seeing that their role in this life
is to give that feeling to everybody else. What a difference it makes when they rec-
ognize that and they begin to see that the reaction of the other is not something
where they suddenly should feel bad. How different it is for them when they see
that their provoking is positive and not a negative trait, and so forth.

The Cross of Tension is a beautiful cross; it really is. When you really understand
what it's there to provoke, you see that it's there to provoke some of the most im-
portant things for us in this life, but also as an expression of what control brings us.
Do remember that. Control will bring you those four. If you allow somebody else to
control you, you will learn skills. If you allow somebody else to control you, you will
have your chance to take that risk that will bring you the purpose in your life. If you
allow somebody to control you, you will find your spirit. If you allow somebody to
control you, you will do better financially. That's the thematic of this cross.

And yet, when you meet this cross, 2/4 classic example, you meet a 2/4 Cross of
Tension, you don't meet them because they're at home lying in bed because they
have back pain. Or they‟re at home in bed depressed—38-39s, deeply melancholic,
deeply upset. They don't want to go out into the world; all they want to do is eat
Twinkies. So they sit there and they provoke everybody by just falling apart. They
do.
I mean people on the Cross of Tension also have, because of the 38-39, because of
the nature of this cross, the outlet in the 39 is food and sex. So, there are many
ways to try to release that tension. Many people on the Cross of Tension who don't
have enough sex suffer deeply and physically as a by-product of it. At the same
level, you can see that all of that can become very distorted, whether it's food, or
sex, whether it's this, whether it‟s that. When you're dealing with a 2/4 on the Cross
of Tension, what you know is they‟re at home and they‟re uncomfortable. They‟re
poor, they don't have purpose, and they‟re horny as hell. If you take that cross and
invert it and put them inside their house, you can see what they deal with. The real-
ity is that they're here to bring about this pressure—this is a great pressure cross,
again 38-39 are the root—for the rest of us to take advantage of being controlled.

This is one of those situations where the 2/5 often is called out. This a place where
because of the physical pain 2/5‟s get called out. They are so uncomfortable inside
that they go out. It's looking for a way to get rid of the tension. The way they try to
get rid of the tension by finding those who can fulfill that tension—somebody to have
sex with, have romance with, and have love with, somebody who‟s going to appre-
ciate their depth and teach them skills. They're out there looking for somebody who
is going to give them a better job. They‟re out there looking for somebody to give
them a sense of purpose.
With a 2/5, there is a moment where they‟ll be called out and if they get it, they will
universalize it. If the answer for them is sex, then the answer for everybody is sex—
get rid of your tension; make love. That‟s the answer. If you don‟t have enough
sex, you never get rid of your tension. But that isn‟t necessarily true for everyone.
Remember, we‟re dealing with collective positions here. Learn a skill—this is the
hobby culture, hobby culture all over the world—learn a skill. If you have a hobby,
you're not going to be horny. If you have a hobby, you‟re not going to be concerned
that you‟re poor.
If you take a 2/5 and suddenly call them to a hobby and the hobby makes them feel
good, they universalize the hobby. “Hey, everybody should do this as a pastime, it's
great. If you do this as a pastime, everything is going to feel better.” The classic
example is the moneymakers. It's the 2/5 on this cross who will sell you that. Have
you ever seen those ads—make $30,000 a month at home? And you wonder what
the hell they are talking about. All it takes is one 2/5 to pull it off. It‟s all it takes

pressure; earn all the money you need in your part time at home while you're in the
bathtub. There are all these people saying, “Yes, yes, that's the answer.” That a
classic 2/5 on this cross.

The 3/5
RAC Tension 1
What the 3/5 is very good for is when you come into town and you‟re sore and you
go to a 3/5 and say, “Do you know anybody who gives a good massage?” After they
have told you all the people who give terrible massages, charge too much money,
are really jerks and what their physical problems and mental problems are, if you are
lucky, they have found one that's good that passes their criteria. And then they'll
tell you, and they're really, really good at that.
The difficulty with the 3/5s is that they assume all the tension is their fault. This is a
3 business, this assumption that they‟re a failure because they're lacking in some-
thing, and the pessimism that it will never work and it's never going to get better
and all of that shit, so you end up with a 3/5 on this cross who assumes they can
never really get rid of tension. Even when they're telling you about the masseuse
who works, they're warning you that it may not work for you. There's this whole
thing is built in to it.
Again, the value of a 3/5 if they are awake on this cross, is enormous. Remember,
they‟re great researchers. They‟re great at seeing that the control in these four
areas—remember I've given you an enormous secret—in order to really understand
how to control other human beings, you have to master those four areas. That‟s
what the Cross of Tension is all about. The Cross of Tension is showing you how to
motivate and provoke people to comply with control and be happy doing it, and hap-
py in the sense that it's the fulfilling for them, that they get the resolution. It‟s why
you've always had prostitution and where societies to try to legalize it. This is one of
the tension gates. It‟s that hanging open 55—fill it up with something, or provide
people with enough food, enough restaurants, enough selection, enough good food in
the grocery stores and keep them busy; get rid of that tension.

The 3/6
RAC Tension 1
It's very unhealthy to be 3/6 or a 6/3 on this cross. One of the things you‟ll notice
about people on the Cross of Tension is that they really do have different kinds of
bodies. You can almost feel that in their aura because their bodies are designed to
take much more punishment. They're designed to actually deal with much more
pain in their life, physical pain. One thing you notice about Cross of Tension people

GATE 21
Biting Through
is that they suffer from physical pain. They have physical tensions and the physical
tensions range from migraines—they can have severe migraines as a group—they
can have a great deal of tension in terms of their body and the most important thing
to notice about the Cross of Tension people is how intense they are. You can feel
that.
When you're dealing with a 3/6 Cross of Tension and a double 3 phase in which the
not-self really masks the purpose and value of the cross and where the outcome of
the not-self is the internalization of that tension and the dilemmas that come from
those four things that can‟t go out and come back in, then you end up with people
who have real physical problems.
Now remember something about 6th line being. The 6th being is either the good who
die young or the unawake who died early. And when I say „die early,‟ die in their
50s or early 60s. If you‟re a 6th line being, the first 30 years and first seven-year
cycle after the Kironian phase are times when you're at your greatest risk physically.
So, if you‟re a 3/6 coming in on this cross, you have to recognize that your body is
going to be subject to a great deal of potential pain and discomfort when you're
young. It will. Nothing is more depressing; nothing creates deeper pessimism than
physical pain. And physical pain becomes a limitation on what you're able to do.
The whole thing about the pain within the body is you cannot control it—these con-
trol people.

The 4/6
RAC Tension 1
Four-sixes are the only ones in this personal process of the Right Angle who have a
sense of what they're here for. They catch glimpses of it. The one thing about the
4/6, because it's voyeuristic to begin with, is that it begins to recognize what it does
to other people. The 4 keeps it in contact with others. At the same time, it gets to
see that from the negative side, other people can feel this as being pushy. This is
somebody who drives you, somebody who moves you. In other words, they can
begin to glimpse what their real potential is as a Cross of Tension.
One of the things about the Cross of Tension, unlike many other Right Angle configu-
rations, is when you get to the end of this Right Angle configuration, you're still not
getting to a place where the propaganda division has anything really worthwhile to
transmit, because if you're not awake, if you're not yourself on this cross, it's really
masked. What you end up with on the other side is simply finger-pointing, rather
than solution, and that's really a problem.

The 4/1
When we get to this transition, we have a real change. The 54-53 come in. We
have a real change in the nature. We get rid of the 38 and the 39. We get rid of the
provocation, we get rid of the obstruction in opposition, and we get rid of that pushy,
pushy pressure. We get into something quite different. What we get into is the
beginning of ambition, the 53-54. The beginning of ambition is something in which,
if you are going to rise up in this life,
you‟d better be in control.
Now, you're on the cusp of the mun-
dane and the mystical. You‟re going

from the 21 to 51. You‟re going
from the demands of the tribe and
the material way to the demands of
the Spirit and the individual way.

Everything about this Juxtaposition is
about the way in which the organized
world tries to keep us from jumping

out—jumping out; staying in, staying
controllable, staying productive. So
what you have here is the beginnings
of personal ambition. What you

have here is the beginning of the
universalization of unique individual
potential that each of us—this is the
joke—that each of us can be the
marrying maiden who eventually
rises up to be queen. It's a myth in America that any child born in America can grow
up to be president, and theoretically that's true, theoretically. This is a wonderful
myth.
The moment you say to anybody that through your ambition you can rise up and you
can be in control, it is one way to keep them in the game. It‟s a very good way to
keep them in the game. This is a fixed variation of it. It's not so much that these
people come into the world and they‟re control freaks—they have to control every-
thing and whatever. These are people who come into the world with the Ego philos-
ophy that they can control their fate—free will. I can control my fate. I can control
destiny. I can control, I can control, and on and on.

I like this Left Angle Cross of Endeavor. Human beings are creatures in movement,
always have been. We‟re conquerors, travelers, invaders. We‟re never satisfied with
limited control; we‟re only satisfied with completed control. Instilled in everyone of
us is this possibility that we can be in control of our destiny—the illusion of free will,
the illusion that controlling doesn't
mean that if there's one person in
charge of the tribe doesn't mean
that you can‟t control an aspect of
 the tribe. And given the position of
control, you can reach your place of
fulfillment. And that the easiest way
to control something is to create
something and control it because

you created it. It‟s called the entre-
preneurial spirit.

Here in this Left Angle is the entre-
preneurial spirit, the Left Angle
Cross of Endeavor—go out there and
make something happen, invent

something, create something, then
you could be the boss. Make your
own way and you can be in control.
Just remember to pay the taxes to
the next control level, but nonethe-
less, go out there on that Cross of Endeavor. When you get the 5/1 on this cross, oh
boy, are they great for that, every man a king. “You can do it, too. Be the master
of your own home, be the king and boss of your own business, run your own life, be
in charge.” Wow.
Most of the heresies you will see in the 5/1 serve the establishment. After all, if we
don't have the Cross of Endeavor, we don't have enough people thinking that they're
in control of their lives in order for them to give up a little bit of control to the totality
to run their lives. It's wonderful, such a good trick. There is that 5/1 out there say-
ing, “Hey, we can have our own control,” but it serves the establishment, deeply.
You know the guy who walks into the boss's office and says, “Shove it, I’m going to
open up my own shop.” Now, from the boss‟ point of view, this is rebellion against
their personal control. But for the employee who‟s going to open up their own shop,
this is me taking control of my life. And for the government, it‟s a win-win; they
have a new tax generating operation at work. Wonderful.

After all, the only way we got from tribes to being really successful as civilizations
was that we had to create work, jobs. The more work we created, the more control
as an illusion we gave people, the easier it was for us to organize vast numbers of
humans. We have over 20 cities in the world today with over 25 million people living
in them. It‟s incredible. You couldn't do that if everybody had to be a farmer. It
doesn't work.
So the Cross of Endeavor sets the tone of the development of the collective society.
It says, “Yes, we have control, but we have hierarchies of control.” And every time
somebody plays the control game, they stay in the control game. You might be the
anarchist in your office and go out and open your own shop, but you‟re going to have
to play by the control rules from above. You cannot fight those because the IRS or
whatever is going to come and give you trouble. Ah, it‟s great. And yet you get to
live in the illusion that you're in charge of your own life.

RAC Endeavor 1
One of the things about the 5/2 in terms of Endeavor is that again, this is a place
where the 2/5 and the 5/2 do show up. Here you have what I might call the Howard
Hughes variety. You know, these people who have material success in the world but
you never see them. They‟re reclusive, they hide out, and you can't touch them.
There is this aspect of it in the 5/2. This is also in very, very powerful, controlling
hands that you don't see, forces behind the throne, whatever you want to call all
those things. One of the places where you see this most common is the adviser, the
personal adviser. The 5/2 on this cross can be the ultimate personal adviser, abso-
lutely invisible, and yet totally in control.

The 6/2
RAC Endeavor 1
What's nice about the potential of the 6th line is always this shedding of values in
comparison. It's a very beautiful process, this subjective-objective transcendent.
Because that's the nature of the 6th line, that's why ultimately the responsibility for
universal wisdom is in their hands in the end of this process. They are, in fact, the
only ones who are here to accumulate a proper perspective in this life.
If you don't come in with a 6th line, you're not going to have this bounce from one to
the other. You're not going to see the counterpoint as sharply and as clearly. All
you will see is through conditioning. It's not your life process to actually see and
experience those counterpoints. Here in Endeavor, the 3rd line experience has its
relationship going back to the beginning and the Right Angle. We know that the 3rd
line rebels against the organization, rebels against the authority, rebels against being
controlled only to become establishment, the 4/6.

One of things to recognize about a 6/2 is that they will go through being controlled;
they must. How they deal with that is going to demonstrate what they are like when
they take control. Yet when they take control, the recognition that that's not it; it's
not. Again, here in the 6th line moving towards the 51, moving towards initiation,
moving toward shock, it‟s already bubbling there when you're dealing with a 6th line
profile, the 6/2 and the 6/3 here, because both of them have this sense of control.
Who‟s in charge? Where is the hand that moves the hand that moves the hand that
moves the pond? Where is that? Who‟s in charge? The ultimate stage for the 6/2
on this cross is to simply let go, of not wanting to either control or be controlled, but
just to be. It‟s not easy to do.

The 6/3 RAC Endeavor 1
The 6/3 who carries the 21 is very, very, very dynamic. It's very dynamic because
when you look at the 21.6, you know why. This is utter Chaos. And that utter chaos
is the most important ingredient to be able to move the controlled, materialistic tribe
towards something greater. Unfortunately, because we are not-self and killer mon-
keys and so forth, and because of what we've already seen with the 25th gate, that
so often we substitute the control of the state for the control of the church; we don't
get the opportunities the 6/3 sets up. That genetic continuity, that bridging, and
that bridging from the Cross of Endeavor which is basically just a mad rush to try to
have a sense that you're in charge of your life. We know what kind of a disease that
is to think that you're in charge. I don‟t wear this hat for nothing. There is no
choice, never has been, never will be, in no way shape or form having to do with
anything in any way.
However, that's not the way the maia works. In the maia, when you get to the 21
you can see how everybody becomes worker ants, how everybody is being pushed
and motivated to take control and to do their thing and be part of the larger control
effort, and it goes on and on and on, layers and layers and layers and layers and
layers and layers and layers of control. And finally you get to the 6/3 and the whole
thing breaks down. I mean, it just breaks down. And it doesn't break down because
anything shows up and says “Hey, there is something different.” It just breaks
down.
It breaks down because the moment you try to figure out what you need to be in
control for, you meet a void; it‟s just a void. It's the void that people try to fill up
with belief systems. After all, human beings are so damn simple. The only way we
can even begin to give up the idea of being in control ourselves is if we give control
to something else. So we give control to God. We say God controls us. “It‟s in
God‟s hands. I'm not in charge, God‟s in charge.” It‟s just one of these ways we
sneakily try to wake up human beings.
So, when you come to the 6/3 on the Cross of Endeavor, what you know about
them—the word endeavor, one of the spaceships that the Americans uses, The En-
deavor, this name, The Endeavor, it really is about going out and really, in a sense,

exploring the new, opening up the new. But it's more than that, it is a responsibility.
Endeavor really carries a responsibility to open up a way. And of course, one of the
ways can lead to awakening, spirituality.
On that hard road there is always the possibility that something will intervene. In
the chaos that the 6/3 sees, and it is chaos because what it gets to see more than
anything else is that control doesn't really mean anything. It doesn't. Even when it
sees where it can be of service, it still sees it doesn't mean anything. It still sees
that it's arbitrary. It still sees that control is never objective. It still sees all of those
things, up and down and up and down and it has one foot on that very, very, very
foolish gate. There's nothing like being a fool; in foolishness lies incredible oppor-
tunities, and of course incredible failure. The nice thing about fools is that when they
fail, usually they die. So they don't have to hang around and have remorse.

Introduction
I don't think there's any more deceptive of a cross than the Cross of Penetration.
The 51st gate, first of all, is an Ego gate. It‟s a gate of enormous Ego power, but it is
not Ego power that has any purpose. It's not the Ego of the 26; that Ego is all about
transforming the community. It is not the Ego of the 40 that is there to both deny
and serve the demands of the tribal stomach. It's not the
Ego of the 21 that assumes its entitlement to control. It
isn't. It's just Ego. And because it's just Ego, it can be very
offensive.
When you hear people talk about the Ego as a pejorative,
they don't like it, they don‟t like Ego beings or whatever,
and basically all of that comes from the 51. If you don't like
the bullshitting of a 26, you don't really dislike them be-
cause you enjoy being bullshitted. There's an appreciation of the 26th charm and the
way it does things and you wish you could be that strong in the way you present
things. When you get to the 40, you get to see that the Ego, even if you don't like
it, can really do the job; it can get things done.
After all, the 40th gate is the great gate of providing; 40s provide. They provide for
their families and their communities. Even though they do it with their Ego, and you
may not like their Ego, you deeply appreciate what they bring, regardless. The same
thing with the Ego of the controlling 21. You may fight that control, but you respect
it, generally speaking. And you appreciate the fact that somebody has to go do that
job. It‟s those kinds of things.
What do you do with the 51? The 51 is just Ego. It doesn't know what its Ego is for.
This is the gate of Shock. The first person to get shocked in dealing with the 51 is
the 51. They‟re the first ones to get shocked. You read those lines and you'll see is
not a shocking of others. Everyone thinks it‟s about shocking others; yes, they do.
It is a by-product of the fact that all they've ever been going through is electrical
currents. They get shocked all the time. I didn't even get a chance to come out of
the birth channel. All of a sudden there is this knife that slits open the top and they
open it up and the light shines in and it‟s like wow, whoa, wait a minute, I didn‟t
even get a chance to see there‟s a light at the end of the tunnel. The whole sky just
opened up. And one month early, I hadn‟t even finished my vacation. We get the
shock.
It‟s the first thing to understand. The whole thing the Ego is there for is the shock;
nothing else. I‟m a 51.5, 5th line exalted. My exaltation is to survive shock, thank
you very much. It means all my life that's what I have to deal with. The only thing
my Ego is good for is that when the Voice smacks me, my Ego says, “Oh, ok.” It‟s
totally useless. It has absolutely no purpose, which is why initiation and the mystery
of awakening is a mystery. It‟s not like there is an inherent purpose there. It‟s not
like the 51 has a job to do in this life. It‟s not like you wake up in the morning and
say, “Let‟s initiate.” It's just not there.

The Arousing
When you look at the Cross of Penetration, it‟s not because the 51s are penetrating
out; yes, they do, we'll talk about that. It's everything penetrates in. When you
meet somebody on this cross, Right Angle, they have the most incredible armor you
have ever seen in your whole life. You cannot see that armor because rather than
wearing a shield on the outside, it is underneath the skin. It‟s like these cops who
wear hidden, bulletproof vests. They have a protection that they develop from pene-
tration that is so incredible that it's hard to even get air into their lungs; powerful,
powerful prevention.
If you meet a Cross of Penetration, you will know it, baby. They will go right into
you. They are so smooth. They‟re butter; they go right in, bang, just like that. And
you think, “Hey, they‟re penetrators.” The only reason they're going in is they don‟t
want you coming in. The best defense is a good offense. If you live your life being
penetrated, the one thing you want to do is stop it. The best way to do it is become
the penetrator. That's what they do; they‟re penetrators. And they penetrate you
with this configuration. When you're looking at this configuration, you have to un-
derstand something. They can make you so uncomfortable. The 57th gate has so
much going on, besides the fact that it is the only awareness of integration, and that
it operates in connection to three profound principles it meets.
But think about the name of the 57th gate, The Gentle. This is the gentle breeze that
you can barely feel, that the moment it touches you it penetrates you to the bone.
Penetration is inherent in the 57. It is penetrating awareness; it is penetrating intui-
tion. But it's splenic, it carries stuff. It goes deep inside of you and leaves things
off. After all, we‟re dealing with the source of initiation.
Penetrators don't initiate you, but they leave stuff behind. They seed you. You can't
find a more archetypal Arian gate than the 51st gate. This is the seed planting. This
is the place where seeds are planted. When this 51-57 combination on this cross
with the ambition, with the new beginnings, they can get right in. They never stay.
They‟re not meant for staying. They just penetrate. And in penetrating you, they
can walk away and be penetration-free. That‟s their movie. On a larger scale rec-
ognize something, they leave something behind. They leave behind what they are
because they are the initiator.

So, when you meet a 1/3 on this cross, they get penetrated brutally when they're
young. If you‟re a 1/3, 3s bang into you; all your life things bang into you. If you‟re
a 1/3 on this cross you suffer deeply at being vulnerable to shock. And you're going
to be shocked; you're going to be penetrated when you're young. That penetration
is going to be painful. Whether that penetration is psychological, physical, whatever
it may be, as a 1/3 you're going to meet it.

You're going to spend the rest of your life trying to understand why. Why, why did
this happen to me? Why was it like that? And the response to that is to never, ever,
ever allow that kind of penetration again. The way to do that is that through the
power of the 1, you develop deeply the capacity to penetrate others as a defense.
The whole thing about penetrators is you never, ever get to know them. You don‟t.
You don't get a chance. They don't
let you. They penetrate you so
quickly. They take over the game.

Remember, all of this is rooted out
of the control that comes before.
Penetration is a real sneaky way to
control you. Basically, this is all 
about protection. The 51st gate is a
gate of courage or stupidity. This is
a gate of the leaping into the void as
if God's going to save you. Well, 
Jesus, it doesn‟t mean he will. So
many people leap into the void and
crash at the bottom because the

laws of gravity apply.
The penetrator knows the cost.
They know the shock can kill. They
don't want the pain. Initiation is not
without pain. You‟re moving towards
the gate of blood. You cannot avoid pain. The transformation of a life cannot be
without pain. You cannot imagine for even a millisecond the level of pain that I ex-
perienced in my body when I met the Voice; unbelievable. But, you know, I have
the 5th line. My Ego goes, “Duh, it’s ok.” Egos, eh; doesn‟t know what the hell life is
for, but it‟s ok, it‟s all right, we‟ll survive. That‟s its movie.
So, the survival Ego, this Ego that is only an Ego because it can stay an Ego, it can
be dumb enough and still stay okay. This Ego, you put this Ego at this level in pene-
tration, this Ego is trying to protect itself from death. The thing that will frighten it
the most is that anyone that can penetrate them because that's what they expe-
rience as a 1/3 phenomena in their youth and it was so horrible. There‟s this
enormous resistance in the 51 to be penetrated. So, on the Cross of Penetration,
please understand that. It‟s not their fault. It's not their fault that they don't let you
in. It's not their fault that they will run the moment you look like you even want to
go there. It's not their fault.
On the same hand, the fact that they're the only ones of us—they have a great gift—
who can plant seeds in beings without them knowing and God bless them for it, away
they go. That's their job. But, at a personal level, if they don‟t wake up, if they
can't accept that within themselves, if they can't come to be themselves, then there
is always going to be a great deal of emptiness in their lives.

The Arousing
One of the things to understand the most about the 51 is that it is always aware of
the void. This is the gate of leaping into the void, and the void is just emptiness and
to see that emptiness can be both magnificent and can be absolutely horrifying. The
emptiness of not being able to really live the truth of one's life, that is deep. But
there is also the emptiness of never knowing what life can be and that that is part of
its mystery and its beauty, and that if you wait long enough in the emptiness, you
never know what‟s going to show up. There is the magic that's there. For us within
the program, we need them because they plant the seeds. But for them personally,
this is a difficult cross to have.

The 1/4
RAC Penetration 1
How different the 1/4 is from the 1/3, always. When you meet them and feel their
personalities, it's like they are so similar, but oh boy, that unconscious difference, it's
amazing how it transforms that being. When you get to the 1/4, you don't get to
that penetration that hurts you and smashes you and makes you afraid, that pene-
tration that can take you to the edge of your shock threshold. You don‟t. You want
a smoothie? The 1/4s are wonderful; they will spend their whole lives in the social
magic of penetrating others. You can‟t penetrate them; you can‟t. They won‟t let
you, they‟ll run the moment you penetrate them. The moment you're not willing to
stay on the surface with them, they will run. They will have nothing to do it.

The 2/4
RAC Penetration 1
There are two things in life about initiation and it is the basic difference between the
Right Angle and the Left Angle in the 51st gate. You have style and you have sub-
stance. Style is the Right Angle and Substance is the Left Angle. What I mean by
that is the penetration brings you a taste of something, a quality of something.
They're very good—for example, the 2/4s when they're called—they're wonderful at
being able to change lifestyles in people, influence them to go in different directions.
Penetration, after all, leaves something behind. It just doesn't go very deep, and it's
a one-way street. This is not collective; this is not tribal; this is individual. It's
deeply selfish, and in the lower trigram, deeply self-absorbed. These can be the
most astonishing missionaries in the sense of being able to convert you through
being able to penetrate you with their smoothness of penetration, that gentle breeze
that goes inside and leaves behind the information carried on that breeze. That can
have a real impact on you.
These beings appeared to be initiators; they initiate style. It‟s like these style gurus,
how to style your house to look like you're richer than you are, how to style yourself
so that you look better, and on and on and on and on. This is all styling; it‟s not
substance. But remember, you can't blame the 51; it‟s an idiot. I know. I know
how dumb the 51 is. It has no fixed purpose. It‟s just Ego. My favorite metaphor is
the charge of the light brigade. You have 150 guys, and on the other side are

85,000. And there they are going, “All right, let’s have a good one.” This is the
dumbness of a 51. Well, hell, into the breach, it‟s the last battle, who cares; dumb.
There's nothing that says to them in that moment, “Hey, this is really stupid. If we
do this for certain we‟re going to die, for certain. We‟re not going to make it,” right.
There‟s nobody that says, “Hey guys, come on let‟s go home, let‟s put up a white
flag, let‟s do the obvious, and we‟re outnumbered.” No, 51—“Hey, come on, it would
be fun. I’m going to get a few first. Let me die bravely.” Good, come back next
time; fodder for the fish. The 51, dumb as hell. They don't know anything about
what they're doing.
If you have an army and you're going to go into battle, you want them. That Ego
that doesn‟t know anything gives everybody else big Egos. “Yeah, right, let’s do it.”
It‟s amazing. Dumb Ego. So, when an Ego penetrates you like that and it has no
motive—people have told me over and over again in my process that they like the
innocence of my initiation. It seems it's without that kind—but that‟s the 51; it's too
dumb to be manipulative. It doesn't have that intelligence. It doesn't.
One of the most devastating things about 51s who don't understand who they are is
what they do to other people and don't know it. They have no idea what they‟re
doing to them, none whatsoever. You have somebody who has their hand on your
liver and they don‟t know it. Get your hand off my liver, and they don't know it.
And when you tell them to get their hand off your liver, they say, “My hand on your
liver? No, I don‟t do that. That‟s not me. I don‟t hurt people.” It‟s just the way it
works.

The 2/5
RAC Penetration 1
Anytime that you put together a dumb Ego and a 5th line, something is bound to
happen. There's nothing that Egos like better than heresy, particularly a dumb Ego
because it doesn't really matter. These are beings who will try to penetrate any-
thing. “I’m going to go and spend a year with the bats in a cave. I’ve been called to
penetrate the bat world.” That Ego of theirs is never sort of questioning all that.
What you get out of the 2/5, because you get heresies, is very unusual kinds of pe-
netrating. In times of crisis, these are people who can really get under your skin.
Every once in awhile they do and they can turn you on to a totally different trend.
The whole thing about initiation—I've watched that for years with my wife. She, like
me, has a 51/25, but she has it unconscious. She's unaware of that. She would be
sitting down with her friends and have some new yoga teacher and as a sidebar in a
conversation, not something like she dwelled on it where she was creating an ad for
it or whatever, as a comment she would say, “Oh, I started with a new yoga whatev-
er.” That might be a sentence that is only six words long and is gone afterwards and
is never the subject afterwards.
But within a week, two or three of those people have already gone to this place to
sign up for the course. She'll leave after week—she's a 28.5 and an 18/58—she‟ll

way will dump it, and the next day all her friends are there and she doesn't show up.
And they say, “What did you do to us.” And she goes, “I didn't tell you to go there, I
didn’t do that.” This is the whole thing about the nature of penetration dropping the
seed; they drop seeds. We know that the not-self does not bear great fruit. So,
those are the seeds you're going to get.

The 3/5
RAC Penetration 1
The 3/5 is the master of penetration. They‟re masters. Now, they're not as sophisti-
cated as the 1/3s, they‟re not, because 1/3s have this incredible depth. And without
even knowing it, they spend their whole lives researching how to penetrate to pro-
tect themselves. But when you‟re dealing with a 3/5 and you‟re dealing with the 3 at
the surface, they learn right away what's going on. They learn about the conse-
quences of their penetration. They get to become intelligent about the fact that they
are penetrating forces, and they begin to master it. If they're really good practically,
they know how to use it.
This is one of the cases in which 3/5s don't leave home, everybody else does. You
have your parents and they want to throw you out of the house and by the time
you're done with them, they leave you the house and they go live somewhere else.
They think that it was them who did that, who made up their minds. The most in-
credible thing to understand about initiators is that their greatest value to us is that
they don't really know what they're doing. But they are all leaving the seeds that
begin to work within us. When you get an awake initiator who knows what they're
doing, be careful. Be careful, because they know precisely how to manipulate you.
That's the whole thing about all this.

The 3/6
RAC Penetration 1
This is the only example in this cross where you have somebody who will constantly
be confronted with the fact that they don't let people in and this is their great crisis.
Three-sixes on this cross—it is also something that affects the 4/6 because of the
need of the 4/6 to have strong social connections. The tendency is to see penetra-
tors as being superficial, that's the tendency. There is a quality to penetration,
which is superficial, because it is sneaking in, and they, themselves, because they
don‟t allow you to go deep within them, there is this sense that your relationship
with them is only on the surface. It's one of the ways that they're protected.
But one of the difficulties with 3/6s is that they particularly suffer from this. Re-
member the 3-syndrome where you‟re going blame yourself, going to consider your-
self a social failure, and all that stuff. So, one of the things really to keep in mind
about these 3/6s is that they are the penetrators who really think they have a prob-
lem because they're not letting people in.

Here is one of these classic examples of what happens to you when the obvious
turns into a problem. They‟re not here to let other people in deeply. I may not be
Cross of Penetration, but I know how much armor I carry inside of me not to allow
people to penetrate me, and that armor is part of the baggage I have from carrying
the 51 in my life and the 57. It's part of the baggage. There is this armor inside
that protects me from being penetrated.
With the 3/6 there is a real self-consciousness about it, a lot of suffering about it.
And unfortunately, these are the kinds of people who will seek initiation, to be in-
itiated into a deeper understanding of themselves, to be initiated into why they don't
let others in deeply, and they end up with a lot of problems because of it. There‟s
nothing worse than somebody clinically trying to take you away from what you are,
instead of showing you what you are and allowing you to wake up to.
Again, the picture I have painted, like all pictures I paint of the not-self, they are not
pretty pictures. When you wake these aspects up, obviously it's a very different
phenomenon. We do need that seed planting. The value of penetrators is that they
initiate us without our permission. Now, for some people that's offensive; the idea
that you would be initiated without your permission. Yet, we already know that the
limitation of humanity is not even to expect that initiation is possible. And that often
without that seed being planted, we will never, could never meet the opportunities of
initiation. So there's great value in that technique.
But again, that's nice when you see it in the program. When you're living it out in
your personal life and you come in on this cross, there is always the dilemma for you
that somewhere inside of you, you know that you're not really letting any anybody
in. And of course, you busy yourself because it‟s a dumb Ego, you busy yourself
with simply penetrating others. And most of that penetration is to get others to feel
comfortable with you. Remember that this is connected with the 54. If you're a
good penetrator, you're going to do better in the world. It helps fulfill your ambition.
The more you can penetrate people and the less they can penetrate you, the more
you're going to make as money.

The 4/6
RAC Penetration 1
The moment you get to the 4/6 you get to the fulfillment of this. The 4/6 on this
cross, wow, to be a smooth, penetrating outsider who‟s always allowed to be part of
the movie, it‟s beautiful. All 1/3s on this cross dream of being 4/6s. They dream of
it because unfortunately for the 1/3, they're always hauled back into the deep per-
sonal. The 4/6 always has this way with its upper trigram lines to kind of skirt that.
It has the natural influence; it has that natural gift in the 4 to be able to really influ-
ence. So, when you combine influence with penetration, when you combine the 6th
line process you can see, wow.
Now, the only thing that can mess that up are the friends of the 4/6 in their first 30
years and the level of penetration they achieve. Remember that the greatest shock

to a Right Angle here is when somebody can go below the surface. The moment
somebody can hit them below the surface, they‟re shattered. This is where their
shock system has to work in. The most uncomfortable place for them is when some-
body gets inside the armor because that's the thing that conditioned them in the first
place.
My relationship with people on this cross is that as long as you stay on the surface
with them, everything is fine. It's wonderful. It's wonderful, but the moment you
kick a hole in their armor, everything collapses. And they absolutely refuse to be
penetrated deeply. They will give up children, wives, friends, parents, you name it;
they‟ll give up anybody who has any shot at truly penetrating them because they
don't like it. Initiators don't like being initiated. They don't like being penetrated.
They‟re Egos, after all, big Egos.

The 4/1
We come to the 4/1 Juxtaposition Cross of Shock. It‟s one of the things to keep in
mind about the 51st gate, if there's any place you can suffer a heart attack, it‟s here.
One of these to consider about the nature of the 51 is that I want you to understand
that shocking others is a by-product
of being shocked first. You really
have to see that 51s take in the
shock. You may end up having a
reading with me and be shocked by

what‟s revealed in your design, but it
started with me being shocked by
the Voice in the first place.

In other words, you really have to
see that 51s are always beginning
from a position of taking the shock in
 before the shock comes out. So, one
of the things about a 4/1 on this
cross is for you to really see that
they really get shocked in this life.

Now, if you have a 51st gate and you
have a defined Ego, you have a
much stronger and stable heart sys-
tem. But one of the things to recog-
nize is that shock can kill you. And
4/1s are very open to shock in their life. They come home and their mother is hang-
ing from the chandelier. I don‟t mean to set any kind of whatever, but nonetheless,
I‟m not responsible for what I say, so the examples that come through are spon-

sored by other sources. But I do want you to see that if you're a 4/1 and you come
in on this cross, you know that the one thing you really are going to meet in this life
is shock.
The interesting thing about it is that the Juxtaposition here, the influence that it has
on others is the result of them being shocked. In other words, you‟re shocked to
hear that Harry had a heart attack. And the fact that you‟re shocked to hear, be-
cause you're a friend of Harry's or Jane‟s, that they had a heart attack, for a moment
anyway, it initiates you into the possibility that if you don‟t look after yourself you‟re
going to die like them. Think about what that means as an initiation. The 4/1 does
not initiate in the sense that the 5/1 does, as you‟ve experienced with me. In other
words, that's not their way of initiating by shocking you. Their way of initiating you
is for you to experience their shock.
So one of things to see about the nature of the 4/1, what the 4/1 is really going to
experience in this life is that things that are shocking that happen to them may in-
itiate others. Now, of course, if you're a 4/1 on this cross and you hear this, it‟s not
exactly like that makes you feel better, the fact that the surprises you're going to
meet in this life will benefit others but they may not benefit you. But then again, if
you're built for it, it‟s different. It's the thing I always try to get across to people
when we talk about Reflectors. If you don't have every center open, you can't im-
agine what it's like to be born that way. You are born to deal with it.
When you come in on a cross, it's not like the cross is imposed on you. You can see
it‟s a part of your graph; you see it integrates into your whole system; you can see
that it‟s 70% of who you are. The reality is that it is deep inside of you and you‟re
designed to deal with its phenomena. So, if you're a 4/1 and you‟re going to be
shocked and that shock is going to influence others, you‟re designed to meet that
shock. In fact, many of the minor shocks that the 4/1 would receive that might in-
itiate others, doesn‟t even bother the 4/1. It‟s a dumb Ego, after all. It‟s like, “No,
that’s ok.” And everybody is saying, “Wow how did you do that? How did you get
through there? That‟s so impressive.” “I don’t know.”

Everything about them is to shock you. It's all because they were shocked, all be-

revenge. “I got it, you're going to get it, it’s good for you.” And every time you
meet this kind of initiating force,
what you meet is their revenge on
you. “You stupid bunny, I'm going

what's practical, you're going to get

smashed. I'm an archetype of
somebody who has always walked
the edge because I'm an Ego Mani-
festor 5/1 Clarion. My life has been
open to punishment from the get-go
for being a Manifestor, for being an Egoist, for being all of those things. I‟m not just
a 51, I‟m a 26, I‟m a 40. And to be a 5 on top of that and to be subject to the pro-
jection that comes with all of that, what you end up with is a real paranoia; yeah, I
could shock them.
But then again, you pay a terrible price. It‟s one of the things that the heretic al-
ways lives with. You cannot afford to make a mistake. You can't, you can't because
you'll get crushed like a stone. And the crushing isn‟t going to be pleasant. If you
come with Ego power and you manipulate people and it doesn't work, they‟re going
to be really upset. I know. All that expectation that goes with it, all of it.
There is something I've learned in my process about the nature of illumination.
Whenever there is any experience I can remember that had any mystical value
whatsoever at some level or another, I was in pain. It‟s so common in mystical ex-
periences for those in the process of the mystical experience to suffer. It‟s the way
in which you deaden the defense systems of the body and you make it more sensi-
tive to being impacted. Shock is about shattering. Nobody who can initiate you can
provide you with the initiation. They can only set you up. I'm a great setup man. I
can set you up. And the way I set you up is that I try to shatter you. If I shatter
you, I know there's a chance. I know that that shock itself may lead to something.
Remember that I'm speaking from the perspective of the 51, not the 25. The 25
wants to control the way in which the shattering gets put back together. That's the
priest in me, the teacher who sits up here and lays out the formulas so the shatter-

ing of coming to yourself is not a shattering that leaves you naked. Anybody who
met me in the early years knows that's what I did; I left you naked. I just shattered
you, told you to get the hell out and went about my business. As I have matured as
an initiator, I have begun to recognize the need to fulfill my 25 as much as my 51.
To get to the point where there is a structure provided for those who have been
shattered, because otherwise, you lose so many that perhaps truly could be reconsti-
tuted.
But the whole thing to understand about the 51 is to recognize that as a Clarion, all
you're trying to do is shock people. That's why it‟s the Clarion. Imagine what that's
like. You‟re fast asleep and somebody blows a horn in your ear. You can‟t imagine.
This is an incredible shattering experience. Your body comes up breathing and whal-
ing and praying. This is what initiation is. We have all this exalted shit about it.
Really, we take initiators and we put them on this high pedestal and all they are is
very loud horn blowers that are just so damn loud they shatter our thinking. That‟s
what people like me do. We just shout at you.
Whether that shouting is a whisper, the 57 on the other side of the 51, if the 51 is
smacking you in the face, the 57 is crawling into your underwear. In the end, it gets
you. You really have to see it doesn‟t know it's an initiator. I had to learn that,
particularly as a Manifestor. I was really dumb. The idea that I had impact on
people was not something I dealt with. The idea that I would say something and it
would hurt somebody is not something I ever thought about. Imagine, you can‟t get
dumber than that.
I was running around shocking people, had no idea I was doing that, had no idea
why they were so annoyed with me. And there's my 5 going, “We have to get out of
town.” So I would get out of town—no idea. When I began to enter into all of the
new age, Ibiza, there was the time of the height of the guru heat, and when I met
the Voice and realized what this was, I thought, “These fools, don't they get it. Don’t
they get what initiation is?” It‟s static, it‟s interference. It‟s all it is. Basically all I
do as an initiator is a smack people.
What is so amazing about the dummy Ego is that it actually assumes importance for
its ability to create interference in other people. Not only that, because it‟s such an
individual channel, they think it's them. “Follow me, this is the way because this is
the way I've gone and I can lead you and I can show you.” That was my mantra in
the early years. I used to get up on stage and say, “Don't believe me, don't trust
me.”
By the way, it was very clever. Just another way to shock. People would say to me
at the end of a reading, “What should I do?” I‟d say, “Go home.” Just shock for
shock sake, after all, because there's nothing that the dumb Ego can do but shock.
If you're a Clarion, all you want to do is shock. I'm so safe when I live in my own
house because I don't end up in those situations where I do my 5/1 Clarion. I can
be so innocuous in it and it still is going to carry all that.
Then you begin to see it‟s not holy. I do not see initiation as holy; I see it as noisy
more than anything else. It is this power rooted in the penetration; remember, it's

rooted in the penetration. The difference between the Cross of Penetration and the
Clarion is that the Clarion is loud enough to break through the surface barriers and
go deep inside of you. I‟ll penetrate you right down to your base and rattle all the
parts underneath. There's no escape from that, which is why most human beings
prefer their 51s dying foolishly in battle because you don't want one cranking you up
all the time.
If you want problems, get yourself a Clarion. My fascination in my cross is that I so
enjoyed the Libran version. On the other side of my Clarion is the Sun in the 57,
and the archetype of that for me was Alistair Crowley because we're in a similar kind
of business and sort of darkest and blah, blah, blah. But it's so interesting to see the
difference between being a 51 and being a 57. How different that is. The 51 is so
stupid. The 57 is an awareness gate. It's an awareness gate; not the 51. That's
why I remain innocent. He was never innocent. I'm a real innocent. I'm too dumb
to be anything else because everything about me is rooted in my Ego. I‟m an Ego
Manifestor, I‟m an Ego initiator, I‟m an Ego being, I‟m an Arian, I am as Ego as Ego
can be. And it‟s dumb Ego. Perfect.
Clarions are not really here to be intelligent. They are most effective in their inno-
cence, and what I mean by that is that if you're an intelligent Clarion like I am, you
really put your life on the line. You're at risk. You're really at risk because the mo-
ment you can be intelligent about why you're shattering people is the moment they
say you're responsible for shattering them, and that's the moment they can take
their revenge on you if the shattering isn‟t productive.
But the key is the practicality. It's just the practicality. The thing that saves me is
the logic of all of this, the usefulness of all of us, the practical application of all of us;
all of it saves me. So when I say to you that you're an idiot and you‟re stupid, you
have nothing you can do with that because I can prove it to you. There is nothing
you can do about that. I can shock you as deeply as I can because my shock is hon-
est. Because of what I know, I'm lucky.

LAC Clarion 1
I would like to see 5/2s take on a larger responsibility in this business. It would
really be helpful. It would take some of the pressure off. To be a 5/1 Clarion you
have to prove everything. That‟s the 1st line trip. You have to prove it all. The 5/2s,
it would really be great; it would be really easy. You don‟t have to prove anything.
You just do it, walk away, it‟s ok, go back to their cave. They rarely come out.
The last thing a 5/2 wants is to be responsible for another human being. It‟s the last
thing they want. It‟s not like the 5/1 wants to be responsible for other human be-
ings, but they are forced to be responsible because they have to prove it. They can-
not just set you on the way and let go. They have to prove to you that the way is
going to take you somewhere. That's where the heresy so often breaks down; the
great seduction of the 5 is that it can pull you into its magic, but it doesn't mean the
magic will deliver. So many heretics don't give you, in the end, what is practical.

And because they‟re the Clarions, we stand out, we are thunder over thunder, we are
the nature of this Quarter, we are the mental forces that stand up there and take the
heat for it.
Now, the 5/2s are in a cave. There's nothing more important than letting everybody
else know. Whether you‟re going to be the 5/1 or the 5/2, at some point or another
in your life there is going to be this demand within you to actualize what you are.
Everything about our experience is that the only way we can make things work is
that everybody does have to know, and everybody has to know something very spe-
cial. What I have to know is that they themselves are the center of the universe.
When you look at the 51, its natural circuit is centering. That‟s its natural circuit.
Centering has an enormous impact on human life. It brings everybody the opportu-
nity to move towards the individual, to move towards following your own conviction,
to finding within yourself the power to live your behavior, to live correctly as your-
self, to be awakened in that, to follow the convictions that arrive out of all of initia-
tion. That is what the story is all about.
When the 5/1 or the 5/2 play out their role, they're moving you towards that, to-
wards finding your behavior, your way, but finding it through love, finding it through
the power of being yourself and trusting in following your own way. Remember, this
is the breaking away from the tribal servitude, the slave world, the world where eve-
rybody is living under the sum of controlled organization. When you get to the 51,
the 51 says, “Damn that, no, there has to be something else. There has to be some-
thing else.” It's too dumb to know what it is, the 51, but it's born to set that fire.
It's the gall—the 51st gate is the gallbladder—it‟s the gall to defy collectivity, to defy
the tribe.
It's what I teach you. There is nothing more important than you being you. You are
the center of the universe. You are the only truth of what you are. You all are the
only representative of what you are. You are the only hope we have. You are the
only one who has the unique, individual human right. I am somebody who is here to
awaken the individual. I teach you differentiation. I prove to you that you're differ-
ent from the next person. You must understand that the moment I can prove to you
that you're different from the next person, you no longer have to be worried about
measurement. You no longer have to worry about the collective placing you in a
cubbyhole. You no longer have to support the tribe just because you're born with
their blood. You can awaken to yourself.
And of course, that's what initiation is all about. Only when we get to the point that
we are in our full glory as our differentiated self are we ready to become one with
the rest. It‟s like until you love yourself, you can‟t love the other. So, the path to
wholeness begins with separation, begins with differentiation, begins with waking up;
it‟s not about the controls on the outside. Here lies the illusion of freedom, to break
free, to leap into the void and lose forever the constraints of the mundane world. I
know that movie. You can get there.

The 6/2
LAC Clarion 1
When you're dealing with the 6/2, they are not Clarions. They're not Clarions in the
sense that they are not blowing horns. They don't. As a matter of fact, their credo
is: I don't have to do. However, their very nature can be the Clarion. In other
words, this is an archetype of the 6/2 as a role model. And 6/2 can be its most pro-
found when it doesn't seem to be doing anything in particular. The moment a 6/2 is
only breathing, that's the moment everybody is impressed. As long as they‟re just
living their lives, everybody's impressed.
If you're a 6/2 Clarion and you‟re living correctly, everybody gets the message who
has contact with you. They all do, and you don't have to tell them. The way in
which they penetrate you, the way in which they shock you, it's very subtle. The
other thing is that with a 6/2, because of the nature of the 6 and its role in our
communities where it becomes a source of wisdom where people go for an objective
point of view, the 6/2s are always blessed because people ask to be shocked. I‟ll
shock you whether you like it or not. This is the universalizing principle of the 5, but
the 6/2 is very different.
I know as a 5/1 that not everybody will ask to be shocked. I've done my research. I
have my 1st line business. But the 6/2, that ability in them to give people the news
to wake them up, shatter them, whatever, it has to be invited, it has to be called.
The people who ask for it, get it, and they don't mind. They actually walk away from
a 6/2 shocking experience and they walk away saying, “Ah, that was great, it's ex-
actly what I needed.” You make an appointment with a 6/2 rolfer and you know
going in that you‟re going to get it, and then you get it and you walk away feeling
terrific. But if you go to a 5/1 and you don't know, you think you're going in to have
a manicure and you end up getting rolfed, you‟re really pissed. You don‟t like it,
that's not what you came for.
In the early years, particularly, before my 5/1 reputation got out, I would have
people where this was their 85th reading that year, whatever it was, cards, finger-
nails, nose hairs, coffee drippings, bumps on the head, and astrological charts. And,
of course, when they came to me, the last thing they expected was that they were
going to get whacked, that they were going to get rolfed. What they expected was a
manicure. It‟s one of the things about the 6/2, they can be so powerful because
those lucky bastards get people who want to get rolfed. I don't. Not only do they
get these people, but these people walk away saying it was wonderful.

The 6/3
LAC Clarion 1
When you get to the 6/3, you have one foot in his life and one foot in the grave,
particularly if you‟re a Clarion. To be a 6/3 Clarion is really a problem. You don't
want to have a 3 as a Clarion. It's not healthy to give people the wrong news. It
really isn't. Being a Clarion should not be a trial and error process, it really
shouldn't. Three-six Clarions learn early in life to be very careful about what they
say because they end up shocking people and it ends up being a real problem for
them because they make mistakes. They come home and say, “I heard that Joan
died,” and it was actually Jane. And mother flips out. 6/3, whack, whack, whack,
don‟t do that.
It's messy, and the whole thing about that is when you're moving through this Quar-
ter, remember that this Quarter is about the witness returning. It‟s not about form
yet, it‟s not about duality, it‟s not death and mutation and transformation; it's not
about any of those things. It has larger, thematic forces. Now, the 42nd gate is
quite a gate. The 42nd gate is really something that says, “Look, if you‟re going to do
anything in this life, then do it to the bitter end.” Whether that bitter end takes 10
minutes or takes a lifetime, do it to the bitter end.
One of the things about the 6/3 is the deep recognition that the search for the truths
is something you cannot give up. You cannot. You have to keep on hearing it, deal-
ing with it, working with it, right to the end until you can be transformed, until you
can go from the end to the beginning, until you can go from the 42 to 3 so you can
get to the new and mutation and the possibility of something else. One of the things
that this movement of the 51 to 42 gives us is an understanding about the process
of illumination or the process of initiation or the process of awakening. The channel
53/42 is a cyclical channel. It brings a cyclical format. That cyclical format is rooted
in a seven-year cycle. All cycles are rooted in that seven-year, cellular program.
One of things to recognize, what I teach you, is that initiation is a timeframe and
initiation takes seven years. The spontaneous, individual shocking and shattering
that can take place in the 51 becomes an experiential way that must follow a seven-
year program to get to the point that the transition takes place, matures, and a new
mutation arise. The program is very sweet. It works it all out; it‟s all there.
The dilemma for the 6/3 is that it has one foot in the spontaneous, and it has anoth-
er foot in the cycle. They're the ones who give us that bridge that says, “Look, if you
think that you wake up in the moment, you‟re crazy.” You can have satori, you can
have altered consciousness, you can have whatever kind of experience you want to
call it, an illuminating experience, an enlightening experience. But even if you have
been enlightened, it isn't going to go into every cell of your body for seven years no
matter how much light is shining in the moment. That‟s something to understand,
and it's built into the program, and the 42nd gate is the essence of the maturing
process; how we mature through cycles; all cycles.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Ah, such a lovely cross, the Right Angle Cross of the Maia. It is perfect. You are not
awakened outside of maia. We are all here in it, and we must obey the rules of the
maia. It‟s the teaching of Human Design. Strategy is simply a way to accommodate
the rules of the maia. This is the mechanics of the maia, the mechanics of illusion.
It‟s just mechanics. You can see here in the 42nd gate that the maia is rooted in
these developmental cycles, seven-year cycles. As we well know,
zillions of different seven-year cycles are going on all the time.
We‟re all in different phases of different seven-year cycles, all
kinds of them.
It tells you something about the nature of commitment. It is out
of this format rooted in the 42/53 that the whole abstract process
begins. All processes are rooted in a seven-year cycle, and every
42 is only going to be healthy when it cleanly goes through seven-
year cycles. Then it can move on, then it can progress, then it
can evolve. The whole nature of the abstract is the 35th gate. There is nothing like
it. As a codon, it stands alone. The 35th gate of Progress is
really telling you what the cyclical process is about: Every
seven years is progress; it really is cellular renewal. So the
42nd gate brings that. This is the nature of the maia.
Now, one of the things about coming in on the Cross of the
Maia is a recognition of how deeply connected these people
are to the maia. If you're deeply identified with the maia,
how lost you are in the not-self. This is a great not-self
cross. The not-self on this cross is wonderful; it‟s deeply absorbed in maia. After all,
just because they‟re next door to initiation doesn't mean they're initiated. It‟s very
difficult to crack through these people. The only way you can do that is you can
show them that the maia is explainable, which is why we have had both esoteric and
exoteric sciences that have done everything in their power to explain to us the ratio-
nales, the mechanics of the world we live in, and the way in which we live.
When you're looking at the configuration here, notice something about
this Cross of the Maia. The Clarion brought in the 61 and the 62; in
other words, Inner Truth and the Preponderance of the Small, the need
to work out detail and facts. This name, the Cross of the Maia, is maia is
rooted in its principle activation which we don't get to until we get to the
Quarter of Civilization, which is the 62nd gate. The 62nd gate is the gate
that truly creates maia. It‟s a maia-maker. It gives us ways in which we
can define the illusion, and as such, we share the definitions and the
illusion becomes solid.

So when you're dealing with somebody on the Cross of the Maia, what you have to
see is how deeply, deeply connected they are to it. Think about how on either side
of the Clarion, in the Cross of Penetration you have the 54 that stares at the fear of
failure. So, these people are always concerned with
failure; they don‟t want you to get in very deep.
Then you get to the Clarion and you immediately get
rid of that 54/53 [gates indicated in green.] So fail-
ure is never a question for Clarions. It isn't; dumb
Ego, perfect, and no question of failure.
Then you get to the other side to Maia and all of a
sudden the 32 shows up on either side of the Clarion,
the 54 on one side and the 32 on the other side [indi-
cated by black]. Maia, maia, maia. You know what it
does to us, the deep, deep, deep fear the maia brings into our lives. The whole thing
about the nature of this fear is you can see that maia is made up of many things,
these four basic themes that make it. The maia is rooted in a seven-year program.
We re-constitute the maia every seven years; we call it progress. You look back
seven years and you see the world is different today; this is what we call progress.
We have this cyclical development of maia.
In that cyclical development of maia, we have two things that work. One is that we
learn more—inner truth, that moving through the cyclical program enriches our
awareness, allows us to discover new things. Those new things become details and
facts that we add to the maia through the 62nd gate, and all of that is to protect us in
the 32nd gate so we do not become extinct, which is one of the deepest fears of the
32nd gate, that we do not fail as a species. The only way we can avoid failing as a
species is that we all progress together. In other words, the more we‟re all involved
in the maia, the healthier it's going to be for all of us.

The 1/3
When you‟re dealing with 1/3, bless the 1/3s, that 3rd line is going to find out that
that there are cracks in the maia. But instead of denying the maia, it just tries to
find another maia, a better maia, a denser maia, maia that's more substantiated, a
maia that won‟t break down as much. What I'm really saying, because I don‟t want
you get lost in this word maia, is that the 1/3 discovers that life doesn't work
smoothly. That‟s all. It realizes that it doesn't move smoothly because it's not old
enough. When you‟re a kid, you think if you're older it will be easier. It‟s just time.

The way in which a 1/3 on this cross operates is when I'm older it will be better.
When I finish school I’ll have a better career, on and on and on. Once I accumulated
enough, it’s going to be okay. It‟s a
great protection; it keeps us deep in
the maia. Even in a situation where
you have an anarchistic reaction to
the way in which the world operates,

you do not get a rejection of the way
in which the world operates. You
suddenly get patience because on

this cross, the 42nd gate rules.
At the end of seven years, if you can
get anywhere, then you have a prob-
lem. That‟s when it begins to sink in 
that something's wrong. Then
things can change. That's why we
have the seven-year itch. You know 
when the third year of your relation-
ship that it is a problem, but you
don't finish it until the seventh. You
finally get to that point where the
cycle finishes and you can move on.
Even if you break the relationship before the seven, you don't get rid of it. It takes
seven years; it always takes seven years no matter what it is.
If you have a one-night stand, it takes seven years to get them out of your life, to
get them out of your environment. It‟s just the way it works. And it's all because of
the way the maia works. The maia locks you into these seven-year cycles to give
you a sense of continuity, a sense of identity, and a sense of place. It‟s all a joke,
but what to do. This is the power of the maia.

The 1/4
RAC Maia 1
The 1/4 is the greatest exponent of the maia. As a matter of fact, they sound won-
derful. Life is good. Yes, yes, there are hardships, but it gets better as you get
older. All of us say that. If I look at myself now at 55 and I think about what I was
like a 30, I'm so glad I‟m 55. It‟s like there are so many things I know about now
that make being in the maia so easy that I didn't know then that made being in the
maia so difficult. Of course, it's true for all of us. Anyone who gets past their midlife
discovers there is actually a part of them that is relieved that they discovered they
know how to survive. It‟s not like you have to put all your attention on it anymore.
You know that you'll get by, you know what you need. This is the cyclical power of
the maia at work.

So 1/4s are the ones who always pass on the maia trip. Patience—yes, we know you
want to learn the piano—seven years. It‟s like practice, practice, time goes by, prac-
tice. Seven years from now, then we can start a new process. In seven years
you‟ve learned how to play the instrument. Then for the next seven years, we can
learn how to be better on the instrument and for the next seven years after that, it
goes on and on through these cycles. This is the way were hooked in the maia. The
maia hooks us because we're on a cellular program. How do you think I hook you
into being deconditioned? It‟s the same cellular program. It is the program.
The nice thing about Design is that it tells you the truth, mechanically speaking. It
says, “This is the way it is.” I never promised anybody that they were going to wake
up in a moment. The program has always been seven. Yeah, you can do pretty well
along the way. Generators, for example, with their facility, can really appear to be
awake long before they are, which doesn't say anything bad about them. It just
means that we all have to wait seven years regardless. When the seven years are
over doesn't mean anything has stopped. You‟re just into a new cycle, in a new
cycle which provides an opportunity to go beyond the 42. That is, the mutation is
possible, the new that's possible, so I can talk to you about becoming yourself—the
emergence of the true self.
And yet, we all know the joke. It‟s not like the emergence of the true self is outside
of the maia. The emergence of the true self is within the maia, and the only way to
get to the true self is by learning techniques of surviving in the maia that allow you
to be the true self in the maia, but it‟s all in the maia. I love the maia. I don't want
to give up the maia. This is wonderful and the more you understand it, the deeper
you recognize the choicelessess of this maia, how easy it is to appreciate, how in-
credible it is. It just is, really incredible, a magnificent piece of art; the maia as art,
the living art of existence. It is incredible.

The 2/4
RAC Maia 1
This is a very conservative cross; I assume you get that by now. It's very conserva-
tive; it's very much concerned with learning and growing with inexperience. And so
it's very conservative from that point of view. Basically, the 2/4 on this cross is un-
der a lot of pressure to make their way in the world. If you're a 2/4 with this cross,
you get a lot of pressure from your parents and people around you that you need to
be involved in the maia. You need to go out into the world; you can't hide from the
world. This is the place where the pressure on the 2/4s is very deep that they had to
go out there and they have to do something with their lives.
When you say to a 2/4 that they are going to have to spend approximately 20 years
in school, that's not an easy thing for them to deal with; it really isn't, it just isn‟t.
One of the things about the nature of the 2/4 is that on this kind of a cross, they are
much more influenced by the people they know than they influence. The reverse, in
the sense of the 2/4 capacity that they are influenced into going into a long training

program, or influenced in staying in a job a long time, or influenced by the pressure
and the opportunity that's brought to them by others to play the game of the maia,
when in fact, they would really like to be left alone.
This is a case where the 2 screams, “Leave me alone.” This is the case when you
say to a 2/4 on the Cross of the Maia, you do their reading and you tell them seven
years from now their life will be different. And the only thing you get out of them is
annoyance. The idea that they're going to have to work on themselves for seven
years, the idea that they would have to pay attention to something for seven years,
the idea that they're going after maturing, all that stuff; this is the pressure that's
there on this cross. You can understand the program needs to do that.
You go from the potential of outrageousness which lies in the 51, the individual frea-
kiness of the 51, and then you come to the 42 which is so deeply collective. It is a
format of the collective. You come to the 42 and it tries to lock you into the expe-
riential way. It also tries to lock your awakening into that experiential way so that
ultimately everybody benefits from it. More people are going to benefit from Design
the more people go through their seven-year program because they're going to be
the greatest exponents of the value of that maia cycle and how important it is to go
through that cycle.
I always thought that story about the young lama who was sent to Bloomingdale's in
New York to wrap parcels for a couple years because they needed some experience
in the real world, the mundane world. You cannot really show your grace as some-
body who is awake until you can live that grace in a normal environment. The whole
magic of being awake is to be awake in the mundane. That‟s why I love being at
home and love my family so much. It‟s so normal and mundane—garbage, dishes,
children, animals that vomit on the carpet, the whole movie, it's all this mundane—
it‟s a wonder because this is where we live. We live on the mundane plane. We do,
and it's okay. I like it because when you're aware, it is not a mundane plane, it‟s
life. It‟s just life. It isn‟t anything else but life.
So, when I look at this cross, I say, good for you, you get them into it. You get
them into these cycles; you get them into understanding that this is how you grow in
life. That when you get into it, you go through it; get to the other side, do your
seven years, get out of it, see what it is, go through the process.

This is one of those places where the 2/5 can really be of value. It's one of these
crosses where the 2/5 can really come out there and let you know what life is about.
Remember, on this cross they really let you know. This is it. And they let you know
within your time frame. These are the annoying parents who say, “Well, when you
grow up, you’ll know.” Don‟t tell me that. “Well, you’ll know.” Every once in a while
I find myself saying that someone. And it‟s like, ah, Ra. But that‟s what they do.

It‟s one of these ways they mold us; it‟s the way the maia works. The maia is bril-
liant because the maia says to us, “It’s not about the now. It’s where we’re going.
There’s work to do, there are things to do, don’t worry about now. Let's focus our-
selves on the right direction. Let's put our shoulder to the wheel. Forget about your
momentary suffering, it doesn’t matter. It’s the journey that matters. Let’s just
enjoy the journey.”
I hear myself with kids and they get annoyed with the teacher they don‟t like. I can
hear myself doing that pattern, “Well, you know in this life, you’re always going to
meet people you don't like, and you’re always going to have to deal with them and
you’re going to have to put up with them. You’ll grow out that, it’s ok.” That‟s the
trip of maia.
Maia says to you that if you‟re going to be spontaneous and kill them in the moment,
we have problems in the maia. You‟ll learn. You‟ll eventually see that they were
actually okay. You‟ll get all over it. Sit transit gloria mundi, here we go. What a
joke; but such a good one because it‟s the truth. Experience is rooted to the seven-
year cycle and experience is life. It is the maia, it is everything; seven years.
It doesn't matter what it is that is; there‟s this line that comes, seven years. I've
watched it now, certain relationships I have, something I never expected to have in
my life. I have many, many relationships over long periods of time because of my
work as a teacher. I notice that whenever I get to seven years with somebody—
which is very important in my relationship to my students—it‟s usually when they're
in their sixth year that I notice there's something inside me that‟s starting to go like
this. It‟s not personal. It‟s not anything about it, but I just notice. It's like this
preparation for, this could be the end. It could be a beginning.
If you‟re going to have a long-term relationship with somebody, you're going to see
that 7 years, 14 years, 21 years, 28 years, 35 years, on those cusps everything
could fall apart because something ends and something has to be renewed, has to be
renewed within the context of the 3rd gate. Mutation has to change. If the relation-
ship cannot go through mutation after seven years, and again it doesn't have to be
an enormous mutation, remember that, it's simply that you have to learn something
out of those seven years and apply it in the next process. That‟s the whole abstract
thing.

But, 3rd line personalities, if you don't have it like me, 3rd line personalities are such

usually get thrown out before it's over and they can never get rid of it. It‟s the worst

go through your cycles. You start something, seven years later you're allowed to get
out because obviously they have to live the extreme. They bring the frequency.
So think about being a 3/5 and you get into a relationship with somebody because
they presume on your 5th line unconscious that you're going to be the best partner
they‟ve ever had. And you‟re a 3. Not only are they going to discover your trial and
error, but you're going to discover you made a mistake. Okay, so it you spend three
months together and you leave them. Now, if they‟re not a 3, you're gone baby, out
of sight, out of mind, forget it, they're looking for another cycle. You, the 3/5, you're
carrying them around for the next 6½ years. They‟re in you, pissing you off and
they don‟t go away. It distorts every relationship you‟re going to have from the time
they‟re gone because you never really get to start one fresh.
When you meet people who have left one lover and you meet the next lover, it's the
same person. You see this so often. I've been so shocked sometimes by the similar-
ities, it's mind blowing. These are people who are supposed to be in a seven-year
cycle who jump out right away and the only way they can sort of get along with
somebody else is they bring somebody else in just like it so they can pretend that
they're in the same seven-year cycle. Maybe it's easier to go to the next 6½ years
with this variation of this theme. But, in the background is the other one and the
friends that say, “Did you notice that George is a lot like Harry.” “Really, you think
so?” They always say that. “Really, you think they’re alike? They’re so different.”
“No they‟re not, you idiot, you took the same package, same problems, same every-
thing.” It doesn't matter that they have a different dress size, same package.
So you know right away what happens to 3/5s. They‟re in the cloning business.
They try to clone replacements for failed cycles. You get a 3/5 who runs away from
some country, ends up in another country, and gets exactly the same variety, but it
speaks a different language. You get the same man, same woman exactly, except
they have a different culture. It‟s amazing to me.
Every once in awhile here in Ibiza in the early years when we were really a clan,
every once in while the ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend would show up from the real
world. They would come. You know this person and their partner and their partner,
you know them, and then this straight variation walks in. It‟s the same person. And
when you've only heard their stories about what they were like, and then you see
them with the same model. The cloning factory and they really get stuck in that.
This is the whole thing about the maia and it‟s something for all of us to understand.
If you don't complete something, it never lets go of you. You get other variations,
other themes that will just take its place. You can‟t get rid of these things. It‟s the
whole thing about understanding the way in which we move forward in our progres-
sion, and to really understand that this is a forward, cyclical movement. And you
have to go through the cycles.
I'm in my 17th year of my process. And the difference for me of being in this third
seven-year cycle to what it was to be in the first seven-year cycle, it‟s extraordinary.
After the first seven years, all I had really done was clean up my act so I could get to

the essence of me. Once you get to the essence of yourself, then you find out what
you can become, after all.
The moment you awaken is the moment you're like a baby. You're born into a new
form; you're born on the cross. And you get to live that out. Then that seven years
that followed that, for me, was totally different from where I am now. I look back on
those previous cycles, and I think wow, what a transition this is. And you know it is
what it's about. You go through these processes. They‟re automatic. It would be
very depressing for us if we did not have the blessing of these cycles. We would
have no sense of progress in this life, we would have no sense of learning, and we
would have no sense of movement. And to understand something about the nature
of knowledge and learning, it takes seven years to take anything into your vehicle.
We know that. If you‟re going to be a doctor, if you‟re going to be a musician, it
doesn't matter, it‟s going to take seven years to master your skill. And after that,
that‟s the beginning.
When you learn something for seven years, once you get there, it's not like you're
ready to pat yourself on the back and say, “Hey, I got there.” Now, comes the next
stage—where do you go with it? You go beyond, you keep on moving. As a musi-
cian, the first seven years is torture. For me the first 20 years was torture. And
finally I got to a place where I don't have to think anymore. You don't play any-
more; it plays you. It just automatically plays. It‟s just there, it‟s just alive. It's
incorporated into your nature, but to get there—cycles of development.
So, everything about our process is about understanding that as long as we are of
the maia, and we are, that the only way we grow in the maia is through the comple-
tion and maturation that takes place by going through these cycles. When I talk to
people about entering into things correctly, this is what I've always been talking
about. If you enter into something correctly, you will see there is a time frame of
that, and you need to go through that time frame, even when it's not obvious. Like
having a relationship with somebody and it ends before seven years. It hasn‟t
ended. Only at a certain level is it all over, but, the rest of it, no.

The 3/6
RAC Maia 1
It‟s very hard for 3/6s and 6/3s. In the Right Angle context it is very hard to do
things to the end. One of the things about 3/6s on this cross is that actually what
they tend to do is start things, drop them, and often come back to them. They‟re
the kind of people who start education and get their university degree in their 40s.
In between was a whole period of this or that or the other thing or whatever. These
are the kind of people who start a relationship with somebody and it disappears and
years later it's reconstituted. In other words, there's always this possibility with the
3/6 that the cycle may be completed, but they have enormous difficulty in complet-
ing the cycle.

A Digital Book for Students
The moment you cannot be part of the cyclical process of the maia, then you end up
being in situations in which it's not a supportive environment for you. You can have
many problems when you cannot work your way through. And being on the Cross of
the Maia and having a 3rd line is one of the real punishments. In the maia, because
the maturation process is demanded, you're only allowed a certain amount of failure.
You're only allowed a certain number of mistakes. You can make a mistake the first
time, you can make a mistake the second time, but the time you're making a mis-
take the third time, you're under pressure. You're under pressure to keep going.
You can see that this is the way we simply process every one, the way we educate
our children, all these things we're doing, it‟s all these cyclical processes in which
there is a basic recognition that in the maia nothing is grasped immediately. It can‟t
be. It‟s like watching myself, the transition over the years in Human Design educa-
tion, we‟re finally getting closer to a seven-year program. We‟re finally getting to
the place that matches the way in which the maia works so that we can really devel-
op mechanically; those at the end of that process are the epitome of what correct-
ness can be because that's the natural route working the cycle through.
So obviously, 3/6s are going to have their difficulty. However, as I said, they really
do have the opportunity to come back and close doors. And they can. Now, many of
them don't do that until very late in life. It's like the kind of deathbed thing where
you say, “Look, I'm really sorry that I didn't…” or “I could have or I should of,” all
that stuff. There could be all that stuff that arises at that time.

The 4/6
RAC Maia 1
That brings us to the 4/6. There are people who learn things through osmosis. The
4/6 on this cross, because of their voyeuristic nature, is very good at being able to
take in valued experience simply by being the observer of others. You‟re simply
participating on the outside of somebody else's learning process. The 4/6 who has
one of you for a friend, and every time you come out of this classroom you sit and
chat and talk, whatever, they get the whole value of the class from you without pay-
ing for it, without asking for it.
In that way, they sort of—I don‟t want to say cheat because that‟s not fair—they sort
of cheat their way along. It‟s like they grab bits and pieces of experience that aren‟t
theirs. One of the things that‟s important for us about understanding the nature of
the maia is that it is one of the most important instruments the maia provides us:
pure, unadulterated experience through voyeurism.
There‟s nothing more powerful and valuable for humanity than what the 4/6 has
brought. The 4/6 has brought us autobiographies, experiential documentaries, cor-
respondence courses, all kind of things. All kinds of things that virtually, almost, and
in our case today virtually applied, all kinds of experience is available compressed.
So you have that opportunity to try to cheat, in that sense, on the process. Howev-
er, despite the fact that you can cheat, despite the fact it‟s going to take the time it‟s

going to take any way, what it does do is provide more of us with contact with maia
than ever could have been possible at a personal, interactive level. And here, that
really is one of the most important keys you're dealing with.
This is the expansion of human thinking. We're dealing again with a 61; we‟re deal-
ing with the pressure to be a thinker. So the 4/6 in this configuration is very, very
important. The 4/6 learns some things through its friends. They learn to see that if
you don't finish school, for some people it's terrible, for some it isn't. They get to
see certain things. They get to see through their friends how cycles actually work.
And they, themselves, are impacted in those relationships to experiment with certain
cycles, but ultimately, because of the trial and error process of their early stage,
they begin to see objectively that there are so many more things we can learn.
There are so many other experiences, and there must be a way, other than being
personally absorbed in it, to be taking in all this other stuff that's out there.
Of course, this is the voyeur at its best. We know how helpful it is to have the evi-
dence of somebody who has gone before us. It helps us to be prepared for expe-
rience; it helps us to appreciate the experience. It is no substitute for the expe-
rience itself. But, it expands our intellectual maia. The maia of the mind is much
deeper and much broader than the maia of the real world.
If we look at the maia that is in our minds in this moment, it‟s far beyond the limita-
tions of the physical maia we‟re in right now. And we can be anywhere in that maia.
Everything about the Cross of the Maia is to understand that it is also there to drive
the recognition in as many humans as possible of what the world is. We have the
internet where we have this incredible capacity that the whole maia realm is on dis-
play moment-by-moment, and there is all that capacity for us intellectually to see
the maia.

Seven years—see ya. If they don‟t do that it makes them sick. They have this great
job—seven years, walk into the office, over baby, I'm going. It‟s done. It‟s very,
very difficult for them to stay. The secret for them is that when they get to 6½
years, give them a sabbatical. If they‟re your lover, tell them to go away for six
months or year; get rid of them. And maybe you have a chance for them that they
will come back and renew that. But reality is that when they come into the world—
seven years.

These are kids who when they reach seven, they want to runway from home. “I

they're not powerful enough. At 14,
the next turn of the wheel, look out.
“I'm done with you, I'm finished

there are not a lot of variations of

There's also something else.
 They‟re awake and they enter into
things correctly, there isn't anything
that feels good after seven years, if
you know what I mean. In other
words, it is not like they're prema-
turely ending anything. For them it
will be perfect; go in, go out, go in, go out. This is the perfect abstract process.
This is the archetype of the abstract process, seven-year cycles.

 32  56
The 5/1
This is the Left Angle. Here, when you‟re dealing with the Left Angle, you have the
shift into the 60 and the 56. You go from inner truth to limitation. You go from the
logical, maia development to the abstract, belief storytelling. You have a different
story here. You have a very, very different story here. The moment you get to this
story you get to something else. You get to two sides of the coin. One side of the
coin is that you cannot experience all cycles. We‟re limited. You may only be able to
go so far in this life. We have limitations. And for anything we can't get, there is
always a story to listen to. That's the beauty of having the 56 hanging around. You
always have somebody who will tell you a story, always.
The whole thing about limitation is that those who come in on his Left Angle cross
have no glue under their shoes. It's hard for them to stay somewhere. It's hard for
them to stay in the cycle. It's hard for them to stay in the same place. And it's only
when they meet the frustration of limitation that they‟re transformed. This is all
about the recognition of limitation.

Obviously, the promise of the Right Angle is that if you stay in cycles and go from
beginning to end you will get your reward. The Left Angle says don't believe that,
that's not always true. We‟re limited. Because a child enters into an educational
program doesn't mean they're going
to graduate. Because you fall in
love with somebody doesn't mean
you‟re going to live with them for-
ever, and on and on and on and on
 and on and on and on.
The 5/1 comes along in this cross,

it‟s there to shoot holes in all of that
seven-year cycle stuff. And not to
shoot holes in the fact that it takes
seven years, but to shoot holes in
the promise that if you go through

the seven years you're guaranteed a
reward. Fortunately, I am protected
 by „no choice.‟
I know people who have been seven
years in Human Design and they‟re
not awake. They're better off,
they‟re better human beings,
they‟re a hell of a lot more aware, but they're not awake. They might still get there,
you never know because the reality is that awakeness has nothing to do with cycles,
deconditioning does. Everybody at the end of seven years is deconditioned. So
everybody at the end of seven years can begin to truly live out the process of being
who they are, but it'll take another seven years before you even get into who that is
and what the potential of it could be. There is always the limitation that it's for you
to come to the door and never walk through; what to do with limitations.
I have a 60th gate, I really know. Everything is limited, everything, everything, eve-
rything, everything. Each and every one of us by the very fact that we‟re differen-
tiated, we are already limited. I can't generate. If I don't accept that, I‟m going to
be sick. I have to accept my limitations. I have to accept the limitation of what I
am as a being. I have to accept the limitation that my mind is only going to work in
a certain way, that I am only going to live in a certain way, breathe in a certain way,
be a certain way. It is all limitation.
One of the things that this Left Angle shows us deeply is that we‟re all limited in our
potential. This started back in the 17 with all this hierarchical stuff and finding our
place and dealing with good luck/bad luck, being initiated into
who we are, control movies and all this stuff. We've been rolling
around in all of this in this Quar- ter, and particularly in this part of
this Quarter. And remember that when you're looking at yang-yin-
yin, you‟re looking at the shock elements. This is a yang-yin-yin
and the nice thing about the 42 is that it has the yang-yang-yin at the top or the

other way round—but anyway, yang-yin-yin. It is built into this cross, this ability to
be able to shout out, “Yes, there are cycles. That is a limitation.” But, we are also
limited, and not every cycle is for every one because we are limited.
Just because you enter into a cycle doesn't mean you're going to be rewarded, grad-
uate, get to the other side and this is the teaching. It's the balance from the Right
Angle saying, “This is it, this is it, this is it, and all I have to do is do my time.” The
prisoner counting off the days, “All I have to do is my time. If I do my time I get my
parole and I‟m out.” Then the Left Angle comes long and says, “It doesn’t work that
way. As a matter of fact, by the time you get that chance and you think you're
going to get out, they might not let you out. There would be nowhere for you to go.”
So, the 5/1 in this configuration, the real heresy is to tell you that you're limited.
That's the heresy. The heresy is to say, “Okay, let's look at it this way.” We have all
kinds of brain-mind potential. And if you take ten examples of brain-mind potential
going from the lowest of the highest and you put them all into a seven-year pro-
gram, you know that some of them are going to do well and others aren't. There are
limitations. There are limitations that defy the value of the cycle.
If you don't enter into the right cycle as yourself, you're not guaranteed that it's
going to bring you success. Every generation brings a burst of developmental edu-
cation that‟s supposed to lead to wealth. I mentioned the other day about Russian
engineers in the „80s learning about computers, becoming a computer programmer.
And now they have so many computer programmers they don‟t know what the hell
to do with them. All of those who are still becoming computer programmers, they do
not have the same advantages because there are limitations now that that didn't
exist before. It's not like there are 8,000 startup companies waiting to pay them a
fortune and give them stock options now. There aren‟t; it‟s all gone.
We get to see within the context of the maia that we go back to the basic law of
understanding that life is not fair, that there's good luck and there is bad luck. And
that some people aren‟t made for things even though they dream of being it. If
you‟re tone deaf, forget the piano lessons. There is just nothing you can do about it.
And of course, the whole thing about our knowledge is the recognition that until you
face your limitation you have no potential at all to be yourself because that is your-
self, your limitation. The moment you honor your Strategy, you get the see that
you're not going to enter into cycles where you're going to be punished by your limi-
tation. You're going to enter into cycles that are going to fulfill your limitation.
People think everything is about transcendence. I want to be every inch of what I
am. I don‟t need to be more than what I am, honestly I don't. But I know very
clearly that if I live every inch of what I am, my impact is greater than what I am.
That‟s the transcendence. That's the magic because it impacts others. The reality is
that all I can do is live out my limitation. I can't do anything else. It‟s not like I can
make myself an emotional Sacral, Root, Head person. I‟m never going to have those
centers. You accept your limitation.

The 5/2
LAC Limitation 1
This is where you see the deep, deep negative that lies underneath the 2nd line; you
can see it in the 7.2 in the line of the Democrat if you look at the detriment. Basical-
ly, this is the denegation of democracy by democrats. In other words, “Yes, I love to
be in a democracy; too bad people are stupid and they get to vote. I'd like to give
the vote only to people who weren't stupid, which is basically I like to give the vote
to people I trust who will vote exactly the same way I do,” but nonetheless that's
another story.
So when you get to the 5/2 of limitation, you get the heresy that can be deeply pu-
nished. That is, this is somebody who truly sees the limitation of others and rather
than that being a positive experience, it isn't. This is the kind of thing where you
burst in on them and they don't want to have anything to do with you and they‟re
telling you that they just got this wonderful new job, so forth and so on. And you
look at them and you say you can't do that, that's never going to work for you. And
they don't like that, nobody likes that. And when it turns out to be true, they like it
even less.
The 5/2 in this configuration rarely gets to that point unless you push their buttons.
You don‟t want to be married to one of them. I don‟t mean any offense to anybody
who has this. But they'll smash you because that's a paranoia that can be very, very
easily provoked, and very easily provoked to simply let you have it. “Don't tell me
you can do this. I know that you can't. I know that you don't have it. Forget about
that.” Well, it‟s very powerful.
It is also one of the most important things about limitation. If you meet people who
have gone through processes where they've gone through whatever, traditional or
New age therapies where people try to confront each other at very deep levels, and
so forth and so on, there are some of us who appreciate that kind of confrontation,
or appreciate the value of it. Very few people really have the courage to tell you to
your face that you're being a fool. And though we don't necessarily appreciate it,
these are people who can be very important in our lives because they can simply
direct us to the truth.
A 5/2 can be of enormous value to somebody who has just fallen into the maia trap
and thinks that just because they do their seven years they‟re going to get their
reward. Just because they're in the cycle doesn't mean they're going to make any-
thing of it because it doesn't mean they belong there. It doesn't mean it's for them,
it doesn't mean it's right, it doesn't mean it's going to work, and nine times out of
ten they never entered into it correctly in the first place anyway.

The 6/2
LAC Limitation 1
What I like about the 6/2 on this cross is that by its very example shows you that it's
okay to be limited. Those moments where people will ask me—there have always
been and always will be questions relative to Design, my process and such—in the
early years when people used to say to me, “How come it's 88°?” I can‟t tell you
how much pleasure I derived from saying, “I don't know.” You can't imagine how
much pleasure; I‟m a knower, it‟s my job to explain things. But at the same time,
I'm somebody who has the limitation within me, I know limitation. I don‟t know why
the Voice said it was 88°. I didn't ask. I didn‟t ask the Voice anything. You don‟t
ask these things, particularly not this thing. And I wasn‟t capable of it anyway. I
don't know. I don‟t know why it's called a Rave. I don't know why it's called a G
Center. I have no idea. I didn‟t ask. Excuse me—I know my place in that movie, no
asking, just “okay.”
The 6/2 recognizes and accepts with joy—that is its potential—to accept with joy its
limitation. And when they say, “I don't know,” it‟s like, “Isn’t that wonderful?” Not
to the person who is asking the question, but that‟s them. “Hey, that feels so good.
I don't have to pretend that I think that I might, could, possibly, maybe make up
almost an answer. Oh, it’s wonderful.” What do you mean you don‟t know? “I don’t
know. I’m allowed not to know. It’s my limitation. If I had to know everything my
brain would explode. I don’t know. And it doesn’t make me a lesser being because I
don’t know that; it’s my limitation.”
The magic of the 6/2 on this cross is that you get that from them. You say to them,
“Why don't you do something with your wardrobe? I mean, you look awful, why
don‟t you do something about that?” And you know what they say to you on this
cross, the 6/2? “I have no taste,” and they don‟t mind. There is no pretension to,
“What do you mean you don't like what I'm wearing? Don‟t you think I can buy my
own clothes?” And all this defensive posturing and all this; it‟s just, “I don’t have
any taste.”
It is very refreshing. It‟s like, “Yes that's true, you’re right.” And they‟ll look at you
and say, “Do you want to go shopping for me because you can. It’s one of my limi-
tations. Go shopping for me. I can’t shop—me, personally shop, I can buy, but I
can’t shop.” That is very different. I can‟t go looking for things. I can't. If I go into
a place and I know there's something I'm supposed to buy, I‟ll buy the first example
I see and leave. You should see me buy technology—ok, I don't care. I'm not a
shopper. It is my limitation.
I learned in his life to let other people shop for me. You think I bought black
clothes? They were given to me. People bought me black stuff in the early years. I
guess they wanted me in black. And ever since then, people have been buying me
black things. And it goes, well, I can‟t shop. It‟ not like I‟m going to go out and do
that. I don‟t know how to do it. It's a limitation; what are you going to do?

It‟s the magic of the 6/2; it‟s the magic of what limitation is. Limitation is such a joy
if you don't let it bother you, if you don't feel like it's a handicap or a punishment or
a frailty, it goes on and on and on and on. I love my limitations. I do. People say to
me, “You know you're not very cuddly.” I know. What do you want me to do, feel
guilty about that? Am I supposed to take a seven-year course of sensitivity to be-
come a cuddly person? Give me a break. No, I‟m not. What to do.
It‟s magic to accept your limitation. It's magic. Now, these people, unfortunately,
because it‟s not-self, they can be infuriating. Their boss says to them, “This is an
aspect of your job that we really require you to do.” And the 6/2 says, “No, I can’t
do it.” It‟s very refreshing, frank. And the boss looks at him, “What do you mean
you can‟t do it.” “I can’t do it.” “I just showed you how to do it.” “No, I can’t do
this.” You can get fired for displaying your limitations. When you go in for a job
interview and you‟re a 6/2 on this cross, you really have trouble. You think you can
handle this job? Nope. It‟s over; you walk out, end of interview. You think you and
I can work together? No.
It‟s the way it is. And of course what happens is that everybody lies. Yes, of course,
I think we can work together. They all lie it. And of course, you end up with all the
problems that come with it. The beauty of a 6/2 is that they are the archetype of
“tell the truth even if it hurts.” Now, that‟s not conscious, you understand, this is
simply the mechanism of the cross, but it‟s beautiful. There is something wonder-
ful—I have this huge Ego. For a huge Ego to be able to say I can't or I don't know or
this is out of my scope and blah, blah, blah. This is an enormous step. You never
would have caught me dead accepting my limitations before all this happened to me.
No way; you try, I‟d cut you to pieces. We have all of these fears about our value
and our worthiness of what life is about, this and that, and blah, blah, blah. You
don't want to say to somebody, “I can't.”
It's wonderful. For me it is one of the most satisfying things I've encountered in this
whole part of my process. For me personally, there is this sense of, I don't care. I
don't care if there are things I can't do, I don't care if there are people I can‟t satisfy,
I don't care. I can't do it. When you‟re a 5 and you deal with projection and you live
with limitation, you understand very quickly you cannot be everything for everyone.
You can't. So, let go of that. Don't try to fill in the gap, don't try to do that. It does
not work.

The 6/3 LAC Limitation 1
The moment you get the 6/3, you‟re really going from limitation to the 3rd gate.
You‟re going to mutation. You‟re going to the channel of mutation, and you‟re going
to the whole mutative process. The mutation is what transforms limitation into
something new. The essence of the seven-year cycle is that you come out new, you
come out fresh. And of course, this is one of the things that limitation can expect.

There is a mystery in life. There is a mystery of what life is as an essence. And the
essence of what life is is that life is mutative.
When we speak of limitation, we speak of limitation within Solomon‟s realm. That is,
the world under the sun in which there is nothing new. There is just nothing new.
The moment you're living within the perspective of a world in which there is nothing
new, it is easy to see an absolute limitation. Until there is a mutation and I grow a
defined emotional system, I will always live with the limitation of having that Center
open, if you know what I mean. But the thing to recognize about the nature of life is
that limitations do get transcended. They get transcended because the rules can
change. The maia can change. It can change through mutation.
What we get to when we step into the next realm is to the law. We get to the Cross
of the Laws and we get to understanding that the laws themselves are mutable, that
laws change, Newtonian laws change when they become Einsteinian laws. The laws
change, the rules change, the conditions change. And as such the potential of any
one can be transcended, can be transcended through mutation.
6/3s are caught in that cusp of being able to say, “I don't know,” and wishing that
they did because somewhere inside of them there's something that says, “Maybe you
can, but not the way you are.” You can't live out your cross as a not-self, but you
can potentially as yourself. That's an enormous, mutated step that takes place after
you go through your cycle. So, the reality is we know that despite the presence of
limitation in the maia, the maia itself is not static, it's not fixed, and it‟s not frozen.
And when the conditions of the maia change, then the opportunities for everyone
change.
After all, today, given this knowledge, everyone has an opportunity to be awake as
themselves. That's a change in the maia. It's reflected in the fact that the maia
descriptions have changed. It‟s a change in the maia. It opens up a mutation in
which we have a different kind of limitation that we're dealing with. Each and every
one of us has an opportunity to see, recognize, and embrace our limitations, and at
the same time, mutate into our purpose.
So this is the movement you're seeing from the 42 to the 3. The 42 is not about
“ends” in that sense; that‟s superficial Human Design. At the index level of 42 is
only talking about cycles, cycles that demonstrate to us what our limitation is. Yet at
the same time, cycles that open up to the mutated possibility of transformation.
It‟s nice to see that the program provides. And it's nice to see that life never traps
us. It never traps us. No matter what our limitation is, there is always the potential
for us to mutate, and in mutation, everything is changed because the rules of the
game change.

Introduction
Every time in my journey in Design and elaborating on various aspects of the body-
graph, whenever I've had to deal with the 3rd gate there is always a part of me that
would like to sort of stop the course and start a whole new course that would take
about 10 years. I never know where to go in the 3rd gate. It's so profound. After
all, it is the 3rd gate that determines what our sexuality is going to be, what our ge-
netic inheritance is going to be. It's the 3rd gate that coordinates what recessive
genes are going to move from the past forward into our process. The 3rd gate is an
extraordinary thing. It's a gateway for deaths; it is a gateway for life. It carries
within it extraordinary qualities. And yet, it's really not possible other than when I
have the opportunity to talk about it within certain contexts, to begin to elaborate on
how profound, how extraordinary this gate really is.
The 3/60: Format Energy of the Individual Process
Difficulty at the Beginning; it‟s a great name. The first thing to recognize deeply
about the 3rd gate is that here is an example of the extraordinary impact of formats.
After all, the 3rd gate along with the 60th gate is the format energy of the individual
process. When you're looking at the Cross of the Laws you have
the definition of the 3/60. You will not find anywhere in the
wheel a more powerful cross. Just in terms of definition, includ-
ing the 51/25, you will not find any cross that has this power;
none. Because the reality is that the 3/60 is, in essence, the
format energy of life itself.
When you're looking at 42/53 or the 52/9, the abstract or the
logical format energies, you're looking at the way in which those
processes are manipulated by frequency. So the abstract brings
you to a cyclical process and the logical format brings you to a concentrated and
focused process. But when you're looking at the format energy of individuality, you
get back to it-ness. You get back to what's possible out of what never seemed to be
possible. We're talking about the new. We‟re talking about mutation. We‟re talking
about something that, at least within our illusion, seems to emerge when, in fact, it
didn‟t exist before. Why do you think that every child seems to be different, bless
the 3rd gate. This is what it's all about.
What it‟s all about is mutation. Life is nothing but mutation, and anything that
doesn't mutate doesn't last long. Everything about our ability to
survive as a species, to triumph as a species is that we are deeply,
deeply, deeply mutative. We can roll with the punches. So, the
whole process of life, what it is to be, is rooted in mutation. What
you can see here in the 3 is that you have two yang-yins. A very
strong mental formula built into that along with its lower trigram affiliation with the

GATE 3
Difficulty at the Beginning
rest of its neighbors. What that‟s saying is that in understanding the 3rd gate, one of
the deepest things to recognize is that it's here to mutate or bring mutative quality
to our mental processes. But if the mind doesn't mutate, the maia doesn't change.
The maia of 10,000 years ago is very different than the maia of today. It's the same
thing as saying the world 10,000 years ago is very different than the world of today.
But all this has to do with the mutative potential of mind.
Mind for us is the great initiator. Why do you think we have so many problems with
the not-self? The not-self is ruled through the mind, and in a deeply subversive and
difficult way for us to break because in fact, we cannot break the way the mind
works. Everything about life, everything about our assumption about life is all
rooted in all of these mental concepts and perceptions of the way in which the brain,
as a physical biological plant, is designed to be limited, in terms of how we can
perceive phenomenon experience and many other things.
So, when you're looking at Difficulty at the Beginning, the first thing I want you to
understand is that at the deepest level, this is a force of mutating mind. The goal of
mutating mind is when the 3 can get to the 43. What I mean is that when you look
at the 43/23, for example, when I work at the corporate level of this knowledge
which is dealing with the Human Consulting System and the Wa, when you deal at
that level of the way in which humanity is organized, the quality of the 43/23 is
simply a quality of efficiency. This is the magic of genius. Genius makes the difficult
or the obscure simple, if it can; otherwise, it is freak. One thing to understand about
the 43/23 is that all it's trying to do is make things more efficient so it doesn't have
to think; it can just idly enjoy silence.
So, when you're looking at the 3rd gate, what you're looking at is that there is this
dynamic, mutative force that is driving us towards more and more mental efficiency.
That's why it's really difficulty at the beginning. The first thing that you recognize, at
least the first thing I recognize when I entered into this whole process because of my
experience, was that it was so clear to me that human beings at the intellectual level
had lost the art of simplicity. It was just obvious to me. Bullshit baffles brains,
people would just go (sound) and they would say nothing. I've heard people talk
and talk and talk and you wonder what they‟re saying.
For me it was always, because I'm a 43/23, uncomfortable when I had this feeling
that somebody didn't really know where they were going. I mean, they‟re mouth
was working, but the simple essence of something just wasn't there. Everything
about this knowledge is that you can reduce human phenomena to a simple keynote
and nod your head—oh yeah, that‟s me, I'm a shocker. Now, that‟s simple. It‟s also
deeply efficient, after all. We know that about Human Design, it‟s very efficient. It
eliminates resistance.

The 3rd Gate: Law of Mutation
RAC Laws 1
So, one of the things to grasp about the 3rd gate is that one of its deepest, deepest
motivations, if I could say that, is to drive the development of the mutative mind,
the so-called insight that seems to come out of nowhere that makes something
simpler, more efficient, and easier. Everything about the 3rd gate is getting to the
point where the old process of coming into being is more and more and more and
more efficient which is why we're learning how to re-create life. This is our process
of developing that level of efficiency.
When you're looking at the 3rd gate and you come to its Right Angle cross, because
of the nature of this cross being the most powerful of crosses, what you come to is
the Cross of the Laws. The law; every Quarter has a law. You have the four arms of
this cross. The thing to recognize about the 3rd gate is that the imposition of the 3rd
gate is the law all of mutation. It brings the law of mutation. Basically the law of
mutation is the openness to mutation within the law; in other words, the capacity
within the law to mutate and not to be fixed.
One of things you'll see about the four various laws we have is that there are con-
flicts within it. The deepest conflict within the law is between the 3 and the 50. This
is the great conflict in terms of how we live out the binary of the law. The 50, like
Moses, carves the law into stone, and we'll talk about the 50 law when we get there
because it's based on other things. It‟s in the Quarter of Duality. It is about laws
that govern the way in which we‟re ultimately going to develop into communities and
the bonds between us, the sexual bonds and all the laws that have to do with our
sexuality and all these other things. But they‟re very, very fixed; no mutation.
Whether it's female or male circumcision, whether that has been a law forever, there
is no room in that 50 code to change that law. You can, in essence, change that law,
but it means you have to shatter the stones. You have to shatter all the laws.
The First Law: All Laws will be Broken
So when you're looking at the 3rd gate, you're looking at the very, very first law, and
the very first law is that all laws will be broken. Now, in saying that, understand that
the 3rd gate will support laws because the laws are necessary. There is no way, for
example, that we could understand the nature of the universe or the nature of our
biochemistry without having developed laws, and in a sense, intellectual laws that
reflect the natural laws of the nature we‟re investigating. In other words, the rules
of the patterns, all of that is structured. And the structure for us is absolutely neces-
sary.
We have learned to see that because of good and bad luck, because of the nature of
what it is to be in the binary, that it is exceedingly difficult to control all of the

GATE 3
Difficulty at the Beginning
people. One of the things that becomes necessary is that there is a framework for
control. The thing about the 3rd gate—because the 3rd gate is a carrier of genetic
information that is going to move from one generation to the other—already built
into it is the hope that the next mutation will be a better one. And so the thing to
recognize when you have, as I do for example, a child who came in on the Cross of
the Laws who has the Sun in the 50 rather than the 3, that you always have to rec-
ognize that everyone who comes in on the Cross of the Laws has an aspect of them
that will be ready to break the law. But not to break the law in the criminal sense of
that, but to break the law in the sense that the law is no longer is valid, that the law
no longer applies because we've mutated.
If you're going to change the marriage law and say that marriage is not something
that is simply male-female, that doesn't require a physical change, it requires a men-
tal change for that to take place. In other words, built into the mutative quality of
our intellectuality is a development that gets us to a place of intellectual tolerance
where we can see that any bond can be justified as a legitimate bond. Whether
you're marrying your dog, because I guess that's next, whatever the case may be, if
you say that you and your dog are dependent on each other, I guess, theoretically,
you could marry your dog. There is an aspect of the 3rd gate that will always go
along with that.
It‟s what I like about them. They‟re not anarchists, they‟re not saying hey, let‟s get
rid of the law. That's really not them. What they're saying is—children do it all the
time—“That’s a dumb rule.” It‟s like—“That doesn't apply to me, I don't need that
kind of rule. I'm different. That rule doesn't apply to me, let's change the rule.”
And they're very powerful at that. They‟re very, very, very powerful.
When you're looking at the Quarter of Initiation and you recognize that it is based on
laws; laws will not stand up forever over time. This is the basis of our intellectual
depth. It's the magic of mind. No law will stand up for all time. If you get rid of
Homo sapiens, Human Design doesn't mean anything. It will have had its day and
little green Martians are coming around and looking at bodygraphs and saying,
“What was that?”
It‟s one of the things that science fiction physicists love to tease with. They‟re wait-
ing for the decay of active proton. Now, theoretically, protons can decay; theoreti-
cally, they have a time frame. But there is an assumption that some of them have,
if you actually have that decay in a proton that's part of a life force on this planet,
you can have a chain reaction that in a moment eliminates everything.
Whether that's true or not is not the point. What I really like is the fragility of struc-
tures. They‟re fragile. The perception that our mental inefficiency had of the cosmos
a thousand years ago, the rules that were discussed in the first universities about
how many angels can fit on the head of pin, all of these rules and structures and
guidelines and whatever, whether it's Hammurabi nailing it into his obelisk, the reali-
ty is that all laws decay. All laws get to a point where they don't fit anymore. I like
that. I mean, it says that we‟re alive. It's the law of life. The law says, “Hey, don't
presume, wait and see.” At any moment, at any time, anywhere, mutation takes
place, at any time. And if that mutation takes hold, forget about the law.

There are so many human laws that will not apply to a Rave. They won‟t need that
kind of stuff. Most human laws are based on the recognition that at our worst all
disputes end in violence. That's basically the premise of our laws of order in order to
keep all of us together and not have us at each other's throats. We develop all these
laws, all these rules, all these structures in order to civilize us. You can see that the
moment you strip off that surface of law, the moment it‟s gone, people go berserk.
They really do; the killer monkey comes out.
So, when you're dealing with the 3rd gate you're dealing with a very interesting force.
When you think about it in the context of the laws be careful because really see what
that 3rd gate brings. That 3rd gate says, “For now, this is the law.” But when you
have that 3rd gate as an instrument, you perceive it differently. It‟s like, that's the
law now, but it's not going to last, it‟s not going to stand up, it doesn't fit.
There is always this, and you have to see that there is an enormous rationalization
that goes on through the 3rd gate in all kinds of people. It‟s individuals, after all,
who has to deal with the law. Most individuals will only deal with rules because there
is a part of them that thinks they're beyond the rules. “They don’t apply to me.”
Well, they apply to everybody. “No, they don’t apply to me,”—the individual who
pulls into a no-parking spot. It‟s like, “Hey, I will park my car here, and that rule
doesn't apply to me.”
The whole thing about human beings is that consciously you don't even have to think
that, you live that. “Hey, this is my parking spot. I have to park; I have to do my
thing. This is a place that is available. Nobody is here now; I’ll put my car here.”
Then the tribal or collective police come, whoever it is and say, “You have broken the
rules and you're going to be punished for that.” And you go, “But the law doesn't
apply to me. Hey, I’m just a nice guy looking for a parking spot. I’m a foreigner; I
don’t know the rules here.” Tough.
The Story of Saul
I‟m going to tell you a story. I don't use honey. I don't use honey because I just
don't like it. But, in my early years here I dealt with honey people, freaks drinking
tea all the time, putting wads of this goo into it. And they would always ask if I
wanted honey and I would say, no. I got tired of that, so I told them a great story.
Ancient Israel; the Israelites were fighting the Philistines or somebody else and al-
ways killing each other; this is a story of Saul. He was going to be made the first
king of the Jews. Saul had a son, Jonathan. And Jonathan had a friend who was
David, who would eventually be the David of David and Goliath stories.
One morning, Jonathan, who led his father's warriors along with David, when running
out with their warriors to go into battle against these people, they were going to
sneak up to them in the early morning, and so forth and so on. This was a tribe that
had been threatening them for a long time that was physically superior to them.

They went through this battle plan of theirs and they were successful and they de-
feated the tribe.
It was far away from their base. But the prophet, Samuel, spooky guy, he imme-
diately knew—mystical magic—he immediately knew that a great victory had been
won. He went to Saul and said, “We have won today a great victory. There is to be
no looting, there is to be no taking of treasure, there is to be no raping of women,
and the men are not to eat. And they are not to eat for 24 hours to show their ap-
preciation to God for giving them this great victory.” So the word goes out to the
entire camp. Everybody is given the rules and instead of this huge celebration that
would naturally have come, big bonfires, and all of that, everything was very calm,
very somber, very subdued.
Meanwhile, out there in hinterland, the boys are running back from after their battle,
coming back to the camp with their victory story. And as is the case of warriors who
lead their men into battle, Jonathan, who had led his men into battle, is the last one
coming back. These men have been running and fighting for over a day; they‟re
exhausted. They haven‟t eaten and Jonathan is running along and he comes to a
little brook and on the brook is a falling tree and in that fallen tree is a broken hive,
and it's dripping with honey. Jonathan, as he is running all over that place, takes his
hand and digs into the hive and grabs the honey and puts the honey in his mouth. It
gives him energy, but the moment the honey touches his mouth, Samuel the proph-
et, this spooky guy, goes to Saul and says somebody has broken the fast and they
shall die. It is the law.
Okay, so, the word goes out to everybody in the camp and everybody gets really
nervous. “I didn't eat anything.” Nobody admits to eating anything and slowly the
warriors start coming in from the battle. They come into this very somber, tense,
anxious scene and all of them saying, “No, no we didn‟t eat anything thing.” Finally
at the very end comes Jonathan, the son of Saul, the hero of the battle, and he
comes in, and he hears what's going on and he says, “It was me.” And Samuel says
to Saul, such a theme, ancient theme, “Kill your son, it‟s the law.” Samuel said,
“How can it be the law if he didn't know?” Samuel said, “God‟s law is God's law. The
law has been broken.” Saul refused to kill his son. Samuel the prophet went into
the tent of David and said, “I anoint thee king.” Saul went mad. Jonathan and Da-
vid ended up going to war against each other.
Laws and Punishment
The law is a funny thing. That‟s why I don't eat honey. You never know when
you're going to break a law that you know nothing about. This is the nature of the
world. It's something to keep in mind. There are all kinds of laws and there are
laws that are there and you don't even know you're breaking them. You really don't.
And yet, you truly will be punished for your transgression. This is the story of the
not-self. The not-self doesn't know that there are laws; truly it doesn't. And every
time it crosses those lines, every time it initiates when it's supposed to wait and so

forth, every time it breaks the law of what it's meant to be, what it is here for, it gets
punished. So, you end up with a world in which they are all Jonathan's, all found
guilty and not knowing why. “What did I do that I should have such a life like this?”
“Well, you broke the law, you idiot, you broke the law. If you break the law you get
punished.”
So when you come to the Cross of the Laws, it‟s a serious cross. It really is. It's
about what it means to all of us. These laws are here in the world. There are laws
we do not know. It doesn't mean we‟re innocent. It just means we‟re ignorant.
This is the point. The greatest enemy in the world is not evil because evil for me is
just ignorance. This is what it's all about. And if you are ignorant of the law, you
are ignorant of the law at your own peril. That‟s why it's so important for me and
my work that I have been able to lay out the parameters of a reliable mechanic be-
cause that's the law. It lays out the structure for you. It says to you, “If you honor
your Strategy, you obey that law, here it is, and as long as we’re in these forms it is
going to protect you.”
Something else as well, this knowledge, if it is anything, it is a way of lifting the veil
on ignorance. You cannot know these things and remain blind to the nature of the
being; you can‟t. But, for me, it's so clear that humanity as a whole is ignorant of
the laws of life, the laws of the being. This is why they are constantly being pu-
nished, constantly. It is something I see over and over and over again. Most socie-
ties that are dysfunctional and poverty-stricken and deeply limited are societies in
which education is limited. Particularly the education of women; it's one of the most
distressing phenomenon I see on the planet. Ignorance is the enemy.

The 1/3
If you're coming in on this variation with the 1/3, that's perfect. This is an interest-
ing force. Obviously, it is going to investigate the rules. You're going to have the
strength of the 1 in that. But you‟re also going to have the trial and error. You‟re
going to have the mistakes, the martyrdom, and the pessimism, all of the things that
come up the 3rd line phenomena. But remember, one of the things about the 3rd
gate in terms of the laws is that we are here to see that laws are malleable; we are
here to see that laws can become dated. We're here to see all of those things, that
they simply don't apply anymore. Where I grew up in Montréal, and I know this is
true in a number of American cities, there are still laws on the books that date back
to the 19th century. There are still laws on the books that say you cannot tie up
your horse in front of the grocery store, or whatever. And they‟re laws that simply
don't apply.

Difficulty at the Beginning
One of the things about the 1/3 is that it is going to discover that. Now remember
something about having a child who is the Cross of the Laws because the first thing
to recognize about them is that they
are always going to assume that they
are the ones who should be setting
the rules. They're going to assume
that very early and they're going to
take that position for the rest of their 
lives. Whether they do that with any
kind of conscious recognition, it all 
depends on their configuration. The
reality is when you come in on the
Cross of the Laws, you come in with
great difficulty because you start off
in which you have to deal with the
laws imposed by others and all of the 
various laws and rules that you have
to deal with. 
With my young son on the Cross of
the Laws, I actually have to describe
every single rule in existence. He's a
1/3 Cross of the Laws; I have to
describe every rule, and I have to give some reasoning behind why there is a rule for
all of those things. I have to because he will naturally break every one, every single
one of them.
So, when you're dealing with 3s on this cross, when you‟re dealing with Manifestors
on this cross, then you're dealing with a high level of potential punishment. In other
words, they‟re going to test the boundaries of the laws. You can't be a good law-
maker unless you can learn early in life what laws hold up, what laws don't, what
laws are strong, what laws are weak, what laws are just, what laws are unjust; all of
that is part of that growing process of being on the Cross of the Laws. These are
very, very powerful beings. You're dealing with a deep mutative force that‟s also
mutating you at the same time when you have contact with them.
The 3/60 Mutates Others All the Time
It‟s one of the reasons why Cross of the Law people have such an impact. So, when
you get a child who‟s a 3/60 Cross of the Laws, you know that you're going to have
to deal with challenge to every single rule and every single law, even ones you didn't
know. Ones you didn't know, the kind of thing where you didn't think you‟d have to
tell your kid that—he doesn‟t have a 10—so there are a million rules to behavior.
“Don't stand up on somebody else's table at a restaurant.” You‟d never think you
would have to give a child that rule unless you have a child on the Cross of the Laws

because the child on the Cross of the Laws is able to define new orders of rulemak-
ing.
As a matter of fact, they‟re trying to find a place where there are still no rules yet,
where they‟re free, in that sense. This is an enormous pressure to be a 3/60. These
are beings who are always in that pulse and at any moment everything is different.
You should see the look on his face when you say to him, “No you cannot stand up
on the table in the restaurant on somebody else's table, let alone our table.” It's
like, “What do you mean? These people didn’t mind. They thought it was cute.
Does this rule really apply? What harm have I done?” There‟s this real sense of
“Jeez, come on, this isn’t fair; we were all having fun here. Let’s change the rule.
It’s okay for cute kids to jump on other people's tables.”
So, there is a real funny phenomena that this cross is more difficult for the other
than it is for the person who carries it. Imagine what it's like to be the parent of the
1/3 on the Cross of the Laws. You have to spend all your time making up rules and
backing them up. I am so tired of threats. He already recognizes that a threat is
simply a way of allowing him more time to do what he‟s not supposed to do. It's
like, that already doesn't work. So, it‟s not so much them, it‟s the people around
them, their parents, and their siblings. It‟s like everybody else is constantly saying
to them, “Hey, look here‟s the rule.” That's the greatest force of this cross. Re-
member this is the 3/60; it mutates others all the time.
Basically what happens is that it's not so much that the Cross of Law people end up
being judges and cops. Everybody else does to control them. That's the reality.
They mutate everybody. If it wasn't for these people, we wouldn't know what laws
to make because they are the only ones who can really break things. And a 1/3, you
have to invent new rulebooks for them. It's so wonderful the way the program
works. You would think, all right, here are these powerful beings coming into the
world, and they‟re going to set all the laws. No, no, no. They get punished by the
people who set the laws who set the laws because of them.
If all the 3s were saints, this is would be a place without jails. There would be no
problems. We would have what the ancients called the natural laws. The program is
sly. The program recognizes so many things about us that we don't. It knows the
level of our density. I decided to change that to stupidity, it gives it a certain—but
what is the expectation. Let‟s say that the program wanted people on the Cross of
the Laws to be the people who brought us the law. Then we have problems. We do
because we know that human beings are caught up in their characteristics and if
you‟re a 3/60 most of your life is depression.
The 3/60 is the Source of Melancholy
After all, in the 3/60 there is no other place where you can meet chronic depression.
There is no other place where you can meet the depths of darkness. The 3/60 is the
heart of the individual process. The 3/60 is where the juice of the muse is produced,

if you will. It's the source of our melancholy. It is the melancholy of waiting for
change.
There is nothing more difficult for an individual than a world in which there's nothing
new. And for human beings who are living with this as an aspect of their nature, it is
not easy. The reality is that more times than not, they just feel like life is hopeless
and empty because there isn't anything new. There isn't anything exciting; there
isn't anything. It's not like they're going to end up being the great lawgivers. It‟s
not what they‟re here for. What they're here for is to mutate all of the rest of us into
establishing laws. That's what they do. They force us to create the rules.
My first son, there were practically no rules. I don't think I ever gave him more than
a handful of family rules. He came in as 10.1, perfect sense of behavior; he could
behave properly when he was six months old. You never had to say anything to him.
There was no challenge to rules; there was no need. And then I get this Cross of the
Laws bombshell and I‟ve never had to make so many rules in my whole life. And of
course, he's changed me in doing that. This is what I mean by the quality of this
mutative force and how powerful this cross is because they mutate the others. And
they mutate the others, in essence, to control them. It‟s amazing.
Okay, so we know what the 1/3 is. We know the 1/3 is going to help you find out
how many rules you didn't put on the books that you should have. Anybody who
comes in on the Cross of the Laws will always be good in this life in finding a way
around them. They‟re the ones who carry the cross; remember, they're not the ones
who aren‟t really going to want to create the laws. They‟re actually the ones who
don't want to deal with the law at all. They just get very wise in the way that the
law works because they see the law as always a counterpoint to their own freedom.
And remember the Root system is where freedom lives. If you have an open Root,
you‟re always in a hurry to be free, free of the pressure.

The 1/4
RAC Laws 1
The 1/4 needs laws, but won't challenge them. Again, anybody who comes in on the
Cross of Laws needs the laws. They need it in the sense that they call it. But the
1/3 calls it and rebels; the real anarchy of the 1/3 comes out and then new rules
have to be created. The 1/4 is going to call for rules, but it‟s not going to challenge
them. But, if you don't give that child rules, you have a problem.
It‟s like the hippy families in the 60s with their experimentation and the way they
were going to raise their children. Some of them were going to raise them without
any rules. For some children, again, what we know, depending on your design, for
some beings that would have been very refreshing and could have been very re-
warding, and so forth. But for children like this with their fixed nature, not to be
given rules was devastating.

Remember, something about the nature of mutation on this cross is that individuality
is deeply connected with the principles of love. It is about passion, romance and
many other things. And not to be given guidelines is to feel that you're not loved.
There are children who have parents who will not discipline them and feel like their
parents don't love them. At the extreme, these children will make more and more
and more problems trying to get that attention from their parents because guide-
lines, rules—remember the 3rd gate brings out our whole track of genetic inheritance.
It's so deeply connected with each generation coming and the blood lines. Without
rules and regulations children can feel unloved. And that's particularly true of the
1/4 and the 2/4.
The 1/4 is the extreme. If you don't give them direction, they're really lost. If you
do give them direction, there's no challenge. Not only that, they're very good at
making sure their friends obey the laws as well. So, for example, if you have 1/4
child and they have a friend over to the house, that friend automatically will be told
what the rules are in the house. Don't break these rules. Don't shout; whatever the
case may be. When my 1/3 son brings somebody over, yeah, there‟s a sort of rule
here, but, let's see what happens. Sometimes he only threatens.

The 2/4
RAC Laws 1
When you get to the 2/4, the whole thing is that the 2/4, more than any other child,
needs to have very clear rules at home. It's the home life that matters. To have
rules at home is very important. Again, all of these children are going to bring out
rule-making from their parents. This cross is very important to understanding how
to raise children. Not simply because they have this cross, but understanding how
all of us make rules because of this cross. Whether our children are on this cross or
not, the way in which we've been conditioned by these energies or these aspects in
our design, rule-making comes out.
I have the 60 in my design. So, for me, having the 60 in my design, I have a con-
nection to that whole process, not only to the laws of the 60; I can be very, very
rigid. You can see that in Human Design. There‟s no malleability for me in the rigid-
ity of this law. I'm a 60, I know the limitation. And yet, at the same time, I'm al-
ways dealing with the harmonic 3. I‟m always dealing with the pressures of the
potential of the mutation of that law. But the fact is that rules naturally come out of
me. Naturally because it's an aspect of my design; just because I don't have the
cross doesn‟t mean anything.
I'm trying to show you that inside of all of us is every cross, whether active or inac-
tive, whether a cross that affects our not-self or a cross that affects our true self,
that each and every one of us have different crosses in this lifetime—the cross of
your Saturn cycle, the cross of your Kironan cycle. Rarely is it going as be the same
as the one you carry as a birth cross that is your true purpose.

Thematically, we deal with all of the crosses, and we deal with them through the
gates. In this case, it‟s such a classic example of how a cross, how one's purpose in
life is to affect the whole community of humanity. That's their purpose. As a matter
of fact, they're more likely to suffer from the law than anyone else. They'll get pu-
nished by the law because they're the ones who will push that button. And yet with-
out them, we would have no order. We would truly have only chaos and survival of
the fittest. We would live in a world that is still as cruel as the animal world before
us. All these people who think the animal world is nice, it‟s just dog-eat-dog.

The 2/5
RAC Laws 1
The 2/5 is the secret lawbreaker. They‟re the secret lawbreaker. And the parents
rarely get a chance to make a rule because they rarely find out that there's some-
thing being broken that they didn't know about. That rule can be very, very, very,
very minor. You supposed to go to bed at eight o'clock and you're under the covers
with a little flashlight reading a book or listening to the radio until 10:30. As long as
you don't get caught, they don't make a rule. Think about this mystically. There are
laws of the universe we do not know yet. We do not know because nobody has
shown us that they can be broken. Only when they show us they can be broken can
we actually find a rule. They‟re there, they‟re out there, and if you ever catch it then
something can emerge.
But in their personal lives, again, this is the burden of the cross. Now, I when I say
the „burden of the cross,‟ I'm talking about the not-self. I‟m not talking about the
potential in the true self within this configuration. The vast majority of not-self on
the Cross of the Laws are people who push buttons, who create a reflection of the
law and end up being victims of the law more often than not because most of them
think they're smarter than the law. They have this stuff inside of them. It's like, “I
can get out of this one.”
So, 2/5s secretly break the laws. If you have a 2/5 kid on the Cross of the Laws and
you think they're goody-goody two shoes, have they ever got you fooled because for
sure, for sure, for sure, for sure, they're doing things you would immediately create
a rule for it if you knew about it. Now, every once in a while you'll catch them.

The 3/5
RAC Laws 1
There are so many funny things to talk about sometimes. This is one of those places
where I must say I have—I guess it's my resonance with 5—a really strong empathy
for the 3/5. I guess with 3s anyways, it is same thing for me with a 1/3, I have a
certain respect. Even despite the ignorance of the not-self, I like this ability—my
mind is a 3rd line mind. I have the 43.3, the 23.3, I have the 4.3. I have a very,

very deeply 3rd line mind. And my 3rd line mind resonates with this toughness of the
3.
I respect that—I'm talking about cosmic toughness, I‟m not talking about machis-
mo—this ability to get back up; they just get back up. You whack them, they get
back up, you whack them, and they get back up. It's not so much that they get back
up and they're angry at you, which is even more amazing. They just get back up.
Each time they collect scars. They can tell you the story of the scars. But in most
cases, they don't necessarily dwell on that. There's a certain beauty in the vitality of
mutation.
When you're dealing with a deeply mutated cross and with the 3rd line that is muta-
tive like the power of the 1/3 on this cross, the 3/5 really take the brunt of it. The
1/3 always has an advantage. It has that 1 Personality. It will figure it out after a
while. It‟ll figure out, “Okay it's not worth it.” That's the whole thing about 1/3s and
the law. They will break the law, they will get the rules applied, they will go through
that process, but they‟ll begin to see in their trial and error that it's not productive to
keep on breaking the law. It doesn't work. It's much nicer to have your mother
pleased with you than it is to have her not pleased with you all the time. It‟s just
that they eventually figure that out. Not only that, they figure out how to fool the
parent into assuming that they are different and better, whatever.
The 3/5 though, no, no, no, no, no, the 3/5 is a martyr Personality. It is a martyr
Personality with a heretical force. The moment that it is confronted with rules is the
moment that its heresy comes flying out. 3/5s can't stand rules. That‟s why they
make great researchers, super researchers. Ah, these rules are wrong. If you have
some kind of scientific theory and you want somebody to legitimately test it, give it
to a 3/5, even though they turn out to be nuts. I did that. I respect the 3/5 capaci-
ty to try to debunk something; wonderful. When you get a 3/5 on the Cross of the
Laws, that's all they want to do. They universalize it—nobody should be treated this
way.
3/5s have enormous problems with their parents no matter what cross they‟re on.
The parents have this presumption in the very beginning on the projection of the 5;
they immediately see the reality of the 3. The parents are always going to be con-
fused about a 3/5 child; they don't know what to make of it. There seems to be all
its promise and there seems to be moments of that progress shining, that 5th line
coming through. The rest of the time it looks like they're a real klutz. It‟s like they
can‟t get anything done and it looks like everything falls apart in front of them. Not
only that, but they have to hear bad things about them from their teachers, from the
parents of their friends, and they end up with a bad reputation. Being a 3/5 and
being ignorant and having ignorant parents is really not a nice trip.
You come in on this cross as a 3/5, you really get whacked. These people just want
to run away. But wherever they go, they force people to create rules for them. Not
only that, when you meet a 3/5 on this cross, the first thing you know in your head
is, “I'd better tell them how things work.” Right away you're ready to set out the
rules for them because you know right away; it's there in the projection field.
They're going to break your rules. They are—get your hands out of the cookie jar—

they‟re going to break your rules. You just know, you can smell it. So right away
you say to them, “Look, when you're dealing with me it‟s going to be like this.” It‟s
not easy for them.
Just to add some nice things to this, if I can, these are the people, that if you go on
the Internet they'll tell you how to cheat the government. These are the kinds of
people who will universalize how to break rules. Come to my site and I will show
you how to build an atomic bomb. There are people like that, lots and lots and lots
and lots and lots and lots and lots of them. And this is the 3/5 at its best on this
cross, universalizing how to break dumb rules, according to them.

The 3/6
RAC Laws 1
Well, if I was going to make a joke I'd say if you don't go to jail, you go to hell. And
then again, I don‟t know if that‟s even a joke, if you know what I mean. You're
going to create turmoil around you as a 3/6 on this cross. Again, this is the whole
thing to understand about the Cross of the Laws. It's the cross of “You have to make
a law for me; otherwise, you can’t control me. Otherwise, you will have problems
with me; otherwise I'm going to disturb your life; otherwise, otherwise, otherwise.”
And 3/6s being so chaotic, particularly in the first 30 years, their assumption is that
all the rules are against them so why care about the rules. “I don’t have to obey the
law; the laws are for the white man. I don’t have to obey the law; the law is only for
the rich. I don't have to obey the law; the law is only to the advantage of the upper
class,” and on and on and on and on and on. “I don’t have to obey the law.”
Of course, what that means is that that is really put into others because what's put
into others is that it's impossible to create rules for this person. So, let's put them
away, let‟s institutionalized them, let's trap them, let's deconditioning them, let's
imprison them, and so forth and so on. Again, when I say something like that and I
realize there are 3/6 Cross of the Laws out there, it's not about coming into the
world and going—oh my god, I‟m hung for jail. That really isn't the point.
Yet at the same time, this is why I stress so much how important it is, not simply to
the person you're working with directly, but if they have children, for them to under-
stand the 3rd line and what is required. If you do not raise your 3rd line child with the
awareness and openness to their process, a 3/6 like this on this cross is going to
have parents who are just pulling their hair out because they don't know what to do
with their child even though there's nothing wrong with the child. It‟s not like the
child itself, it's not their fault. This is just what they are here for. They're here to
push buttons.
Carlos Castaneda in his Don Juan books, my favorite theme of his was the petty
tyrant, that the petty tyrant was the greatest teacher. If you have somebody in your
life who can push your buttons, you have something to learn. Anybody who can
push your buttons teaches you something. If it's that easy to crank you up one way

or another, then you have to see there's something wrong in you. It's not about
hating your petty tyrants. It's about embracing them and loving them.
Cross of the Law beings are petty tyrants. My little son is petty tyrant. He‟s a deli-
cious petty tyrant and I love him dearly, but he is my petty tyrant. With him, it's so
easy to see how many buttons can be pushed. For me to see where I am in my
process in dealing with him, and to understand that it's not that I can punish him for
being a 1/3 on the Cross of the Laws because that's what he does to me. It‟s me I
have to deal with in that situation.
So you can see that when these children come into the world, if their parents don't
have any awareness, that's really a problem. Think about it. You have a Cross of
the Laws and it‟s your third child, and all of a sudden everything you thought about
being a parent gets turned upside down. It‟s like we never had to be this way with
the other children. And then you think that‟s a terrible child, that it‟s a burden and
it‟s a problem. Or that child comes first, and then you get the next one who doesn't
have that and the next one becomes the darling of the family because it's so terrific.
We didn't have to go through all this hassle and rulemaking.
You know very clearly that this is a pattern that filters through every single family
because it's there. The moment as a parent that you're stuck with making more and
more rules, you have more and more concerns, you‟re more and more upset and
you‟re more focused that there's a problem. If you have a 3/6 not only are you
making rules, but they're not 1/3s, they're not going to eventually figure it out.
They're not 3/5s; they‟re not going to eventually just use it to their advantage if they
can. The 3/6s are going to suffer. They don't have that facility the 3/5 does to
simply run off to another city. The 3/6 just feels uncomfortable in that situation.

The 4/6
RAC Laws 1
When you're dealing with a 4 on this cross you're dealing with enormous power. It is
one of the places where the 1/4, for example, is so powerful, where that fixedness
doesn't seem to matter at all. When you're dealing with a 4/6, again you're dealing
with a 4 Personality so you‟re dealing with an influential Personality and an influential
Personality influencing those around it. Now, one of things that means is that the
parent who makes a law for the 4/6—because remember the 4/6 is going to be a
4/3, so it‟s going to make mistakes, it‟s going to do things—the parents are going to
set the law. The law is going to be received at the Personality level, the Personality
is going to take that law in, and what happens is that the parents are then going to
influence other parents to provide that same rule for their kids.
It‟s not the 4/6 directly influencing the other parents. Again, it‟s the same kind of
phenomena; it‟s not like the 4/6 is the thing that it‟s all about. It‟s not the cross and
the person; it‟s what the cross does to everybody else. And so the voyeurism we
connect to, the 4/6 becomes this, rather than staying within the house, the mother
gets on the phone and is talking to one of her friends saying, “We worked out this

program for Johnny or Janie and we set some rules about doing their homework and
it's really working well.” And next thing you know, that mother is setting up the
same rule for her kid, and it all started with this 4/6.
Now, ultimately in their process they can get to a point that they can become role
models for what are influential rules that can be of value, as an example. They can
end up being very good educators, they can end up being people being very sensi-
tive to what rules can or cannot be in terms of productivity. But the secret of this
cross is not to try to put the law in the children, but to see that the children are
putting the law out. They are creating the demand for rules. They are infecting their
parents. They are infecting their parent‟s friends. They're infecting their parents
circle, and on and on and on. That's their job, which means they're actually more
difficult than other children.

verse, if you will, of the Right Angle
process. In the Right Angle process the
Cross of the Law is forcing, mutating
those around it to create frameworks and rules.
When you get to the Juxtaposition cross you are simply taking in structure and rules
and being mutated by it. In other words, the world changes you. The rules change
you. Here you're dealing with fixed fate. You‟re really given a fixed line. These
beings can be deep exponents of very, very fixed and focused values of mutation. In
other words, they can say that my life changed “When I followed a regimen of run-

And it's the answer for everyone.” And every friend of theirs, they try to drag them
out there in the morning to go running with them to make that a rule in their life
because it‟s going to be beneficial.
Remember, I'm trying to make these rules as mundane as possible in my descrip-
tions because there are rules for everything. This is one the things you see about
the Cross of Laws, there are rules for everything because there is everything. And
the fact that you don't know the rule doesn't mean you can't be punished. Again, it's

where rules could go, the rules of the future. Now, the rules of the future are very
important to us. This is a place where the mind, because it's all mental, can go
beyond reality. After all, the 41st gate is a gate of fantasy. One of the things about
understanding the law is that we would never have the scientific potential and in-

is able to do is find a place where new rules can be looked at that have nothing to do
with life itself.
In other words, this is not applied rule-making. It's not about making a rule for
Johnny or Jane. It‟s about what would happen if John and Janie could fly, what kind
of rule we would need then. In other words, it's about setting up the virtual. So
much of the virtual is right here in the 3rd gate; the mutation away from the real into
the virtual, the ability for us to be able to create, as science does, create models that
aren't real. A scientist will create a model in which the wind is always blowing at 200
miles an hour to see what would happen to the world; but by doing that you learn
certain things about the nature of erosion, and so forth and so on.
In other words, you create a model that doesn't necessarily apply to reality; it‟s not
rules that work here. It‟s like quantum. Quantum is the ultimate 3rd gate mutation
because the rules of our reality don't apply in quantum. Because they don't apply
you have to find new rules, and find new rules that have no application here what-
soever. If we don't have the mental capacity to create artificial environments where
we can experiment with order and structure, we have no future scientifically; we
have no future mentally.
Now, at one level, this is about dreaming, dreaming in the sense of I wonder, “I
wonder what it would be like. I wonder what it could be.” This is the magic that all
5/1s carry. They carry that 1 underneath and the 1 mystically is the line of wonder
of all. And to find any foundation is to wonder about—you give me something solid,
I will wonder about how solid it really is. And then if I set up situations that are not
normal situations, I may be able to see what appears to be solid here is not solid in
another context. This is us. This is our brilliance.
And again, you can see this 3rd gate is so mental; the yang-yin repeated twice—so
mental. So when you come to the 5/1 on the Cross of Wishes, what
you‟re really coming is to some- body who pays absolutely no at-
tention to the law of the real world. They‟re always surprised that there
are rules. Their heresy is that the rules don‟t necessary apply be-
cause there are other dimensions, there are other realities, there are
other universes, and on and on and on. Oh, bless them, they‟re right.
The rule of the not-self and the rule of the true self are very different. It‟s just dif-
ferent. There is always within us this deep capacity to mutate. This is all about
mutation. One of the most important mutations for the mind is not to get stuck in
believing that any foundation is truly solid. My first revelation was when I really
grasped that my feet never touched the ground. That was the most astonishing
thing for me, the simple physics of it. My feet never really touched the ground.
They don‟t. None of us ever touch anything. At the moment you could bring some-
thing beside each other, you have the electron shell, which is nothing, it‟s not the
matter of the cell or that final edge or whatever it is where they‟re going to meet,
and where they meet is nothing. As a matter of fact, atoms are mostly nothing.
We‟re sitting on mostly nothing. In fact, our asses never touch the chairs and there
we are bitching. It‟s so incredible. It‟s all illusion. It‟s so incredible.

And yet, at the same time my brain would go—I can remember this, I was in 6th
grade when I heard this and my brain was going (sound,) “I don't quite get that.
Well, how does it work?” And to realize as my interest in science developed you get
to this place where you say, “Well, wait a minute. We have all kinds of levels of
rules here and there are a lot of levels in which the rules simply do not apply.” And
this is the only way you're going to develop mentally. You don't see the neutrino
ocean. And if it wasn't for the mind, we would never get there.
Dirac, this genius, came up with the idea—he realized that the neutrino in 1949 was
an idea. Nothing else, just an idea, an idea in somebody's mutated brain, a piece of
magic. Just an idea, and ultimately that idea would become what is, in fact, the
foundation of all the whole consciousness program. It changed all of cosmology,
changed all of the rules. The neutrino with mass is still vibrating through the scien-
tific community because it changes the cosmology—an idea rooted in this.
This Cross of Wishes is something very spectacular. It's bringing us to the unex-
pected; it‟s bringing us to the potential of discovery of something totally different, a
new rule, a new game. Let's have a new game. Unless you get to the 28th you don't
get a new game. The 28 will always bring you a new game. Here is the preparation,
let‟s go to the place where there are no rules. Let's find out how something gets
locked into the rules and doesn't have to be. You can be free from the structures
imposed on you by the not-self. It's a mutation that frees you.
Everything about the wishes is about making life better. You wouldn't think so in the
sense that they seem to get out into very, very abstract, conceptual places. But, if
you look at the mathematics of computer programming, you will see that going out
into very bizarre, abstract code writing, and eventually leads to very practical, useful
things within the context of this reality. In other words, the old cliché about “Why
did you go to the Moon? We went to the Moon to help man,” in essence, is true, and
it was in fact. There were technologies developed that were necessary to get to that
place.
That's a classic example of what the Cross of Wishes is all about—how do you do
that? The mathematics is credible, aside from the technologies involved and the
construction values and the training and the facilities and on and on and on and on
and on. Without this capacity of the Cross of Wishes, we‟re not prepared for that
because we don't have the mental ability to go beyond the limitations of what's there
to experiment with causality, to experiment with probability, to experiment with all
of those various other things. And out of that comes the unexpected.

own discover things of great value in their imagination because it's really about the
imagination and the fertilization of mind. It is so fecund, it‟s so fertile, the Sacral.

stand what we‟re dealing with here. This 3rd gate is so rich in power and fertility.
The reality is that it is really able to reach into the virtual, and in the virtual see
what‟s never been seen, and actually find something that's of value to the real world.
Now, the mad professor is a good 5/2 on this cross. The idea of the solo genius, Dr.
Jekyll about to do his Hyde, the Renaissance man, the da Vinci locked away with his
genius, that kind of image in which there is this spectacular lone wolf discovery. It's
an archetype of that. And the 3rd gate is there because of the individual potential of
all that, the freak potential of all that, the fact that there is this quality that can be
there. However, 5/2s being 5/2s, most of the time they assume that other people
will think they're nuts because they're aware of the power of the laws that are ac-
cepted.
These are the kind of beings where often you don't find out much about them or
their ideas until they're dead. Now again, less so today, because in the cycle that
we‟re in now, there's enormous pressure on us to publicize anything and people do.
There are babies who have their own websites. Now, everybody is out telling every-
body everything; it's all over the place.

The 6/2
LAC Wishes 1
When you get to the 6/2 you get to the role model. They're very influential people
and they are influential in the sense that because of the 3rd line aspect, they do un-
derstand the nature of law as action/reaction. The beginning of understanding the
nature of the atom begins on this cross. This is one of the things about this cross
that is so spectacular. I'd like to get into it deeper, but I don‟t have the time for it.
There is so much science here.
This is a kind of transpersonal impact over the other for their experience of the law.
The 6/2 in its 3/2 stage is really able to see the whole nature of cause and effect,
and cause and effect is one of the fundamental basics for exploration. Everything
about the law is the recognition that laws are created as a result of something.
What's beautiful about the 27 is it wants to create laws for something that hasn't
existed yet. At least hasn‟t existed in the sense of the maia.
In other words, if you could suddenly see that there is a hidden law in the universe—
for example, I know that there is a hidden law, the law of the monopole. It‟s a hid-
den law. The reality is that the moment of the law of the monopole is something
that becomes universal, and the moment that its cause and effect is understood,
then we will understand the most essential principles of how the larger organism is
held together.
Everything about the Left Angle at this site is about pushing into Star Trek country—
go where no one has ever gone before. All of that because one can see that as a
6/2, you get to see that laws don't necessarily apply. And you begin to ponder
something. What you begin to ponder is if you change the cause, you will change

the effect. It‟s the way it works. And so they begin to experiment with that. Now
when I say „experiment‟ it doesn‟t mean that has to be in the pure scientific sense.
They'll experiment with it as a child in terms of the way in which they‟ll deal with the
world around them, and so forth.
But it‟s very important to grasp this about these beings. In other words, what
they're ready to reveal to us is that there are greater laws. And the ultimate wish is
a prayer. There are greater laws—the laws of the totality, the laws of God, the laws
that Jonathan wrote that he didn‟t know anything about; they are out there. They
can be extraordinary role models in the sense that they can influence us, and influ-
ence us to recognize that there are transcendent laws that go beyond the mundane
restrictions, that those transcendent laws are things we can have access to. If you
have a 6/2 on this cross and they wake up to Design, they are going to be one of the
most powerful expressions of it in terms of being an example to others.

The 6/3
LAC Wishes 1
By the time you get to the 6/3, what you get is the thinker who wants to be a doer.
In other words, they don't just want to think that virtual whatever, they want to
implement it as well because they know that the moment you can see the order is
the moment you realize the order can exist. Anything that you can imagine; think
about that, that‟s quite something. Anything you can imagine, there is a possibility
that it can exist. There are people now who want to build an elevator to the space
station. And theoretically it should work, but you know, you have to have one of
these influencing you to get to a place where you would even think about such a
thing.
And not only think about such a thing, but if you're 6/3 in this case—and that‟s why I
brought it up, I always joke about 3/6s and 6/3s having ladders stapled to their bo-
dies so they can get up and down from the roof with more ease because they do it
all the time in their life—not only do you have to be able to imagine such a thing, but
the intelligence it takes to actually figure out how to build it. And then the remarka-
ble thing about humans is that if it can be done, they'll try it. It‟s really incredible.
I read this long, long piece on the web because I had seen a comment in the news-
paper and I went looking for it. An incredible idea; very energy-efficient, very
cheap, it‟s just that the construction job is a bit of a problem. Human beings, I love
them. This is a part of humanity that really is intriguing to me because we're not
just nest builders. If we were just sort of hyped up nest builders we wouldn't be that
impressive. But, we can really go beyond that. There is a quality of mind that‟s
extraordinary and cosmetic. Not all of those fantasies become implemented realities,
but all of those fantasies together give us a richness of intellectuality that is the
beauty of our species; it is what it's all about. We are here to know the rules. We
are here to know the cosmic rules, we‟re here to know the biological rules, and we‟re
here to know the whole story. Once we figure these things out, every time we figure
it out, everything changes, and that's the magic.

On the Cross of the Unexpected, the moment they discovered Uranus, everything
changed. Seven-centered went to nine-centered, body temperature went up, the
world began to change, the whole thing. There were those before who knew it was
coming in the sense of premonition, in the sense of fantasy, in the sense of dream.
The future Rave children, you know yourselves, because most of you have been
connected to the to the new age and to mysticism of our time, we know how many
voices have risen over the last 30 to 60 years that have talked about the indigo
children, the new wave children, the children who are coming at a harmonic conver-
gence, the children here, the children there. It‟s in the air and it's been in the air for
a long time.
There is nothing new in that. The only thing that‟s new is like what Human Design
is; it gives you mechanical, verifiable, logical evidence. But the theme has been
there; the thinkers have been there. I remember as a kid reading Jules Verne. I
read Journey to the Moon. When I was a kid, when I read that book, television had
just moved into the home. The only rockets that were going up were imitations of
Wernher von Braun‟s V-2s and half of them were smacking into the ground because
it couldn‟t go anywhere. We were living in a world where going to the Moon was the
story. In the 50s, and it wasn't until „59, Sputnik was „59 wasn't it, „58, one or the
other. It wasn't until that moment that there was even this sort of inkling, but even
then you didn‟t think about going to the Moon. But yet, it was already there inside
of us. It was just there.
Christiaan Huygens, who is an extraordinary scientist in the late 17th,
early 18th century, wrote a book that was only published after he died.
It was called Other Worlds Discovered. He was traveling to the planets
and meeting creatures. The guy invented science fiction, and he was
the first person to write about aliens. His description of things on the
Moon is wonderful. If you ever come across this, it‟s not like that thing
is much in print, but I assume there is some, you pick it up. He was a
very famous scientist of his time. But on the Web you can get some
archive material and you can take a look at it. It‟s fascinating.
This is one of the things about understanding this kind of cross. There is this ability
within us to imagine what nobody in our time can see is viable. And yet, through
that imagination, inspire generations to get to a place of realization.
Whenever I hear people dreaming about what the future could be, not so much I
trust their dream, but I respect that this is a basic quality in all of us, that we're
looking for a better world, that Paradise is something we seek in the flesh. We‟re all
looking for utopia, all of us. It‟s bred here. We all have this wish inside of us for a
better world. All of us, even the worst of us, have this wish inside of us for a better
world, and it is here.

Introduction
This brings us to the 27th gate. The 27th gate in Human Design is a role gate. All
role gates are very powerful; they‟re powerful as archetypes. The genetic continuity
of lines in a role gate is very important. When you're looking at the 27th gate, you're
looking at a genetic imperative; you're looking at the genetic imperative to nurture.
One of the things to understand about the primary function of the 27th gate, aside
from the obvious biological necessities to nurture the
young, the energy that comes—remember that the
Splenic Center is a non-motor—that the energy that
comes from the 27th gate is the energy that is abso-
lutely essential to establish intelligence in a human
being.
The 50th gate is the gate of intelligence. Out of the
50th gate, which is one of the gates of the Cross of the
Law, comes the three streams that operate through
the Splenic system. That is: instinct, intuition, and taste, or judgmentation. So
when you're looking at the 50th gate, you're looking at the relationship between in-
telligence and fear. Everything about the 50th gate is that it is there to provide us
with a font of potential intelligence to combat our fears, to be able to survive, and so
on.
So, the 27th gate is very important. The ultimate nourishment of the 27th gate—
remember when we talk about the tribal we talk about the 27/50. What we're basi-
cally talking about is the responsibility that arises in our species when we give birth
to young that we have to nurture them for seven years. Now, there is that basic
nurturing which is shelter and food and healthcare. But, the reality is that one of the
most important things we must nurture in our young is their intelligence. What
makes us superior in that sense, and I don't mean to get into any arguments about
hierarchical status, let‟s say what puts us at the top of the food chain is our intelli-
gence. And yet at the same time, to recognize how fragile we are.
There‟s this wonderful scene in Ice Age, a children's movie. I get to see a lot of
children's movies over and over and over again. There is this wonderful scene in Ice
Age where a lot of these of prehistoric creatures that are very cute are looking after
or traveling with a human baby. There is this wonderful scene where the woolly
mammoth, which is wonderful character in this movie, picks up with its trunk this
baby and it calls the baby lumpy. There is this thing about—what‟s so frightening
about these things. They‟re so fragile, they‟re naked, they have no fur, they don‟t
have good teeth, they don‟t have claws—I don't get it. And of course, what it is is
that we‟re smart. We have the potential for an intelligence that's never been availa-
ble in form before. All of that is the by-product of the juice coming out of the 27.
If you have a mother who is a 27, which would be an archetype of this gate, just as
the 59—the archetype is male, by the way, not that that means anything other than
it might inspire you to think about certain things. But nonetheless, that 27, that

I want to get into this cross because I like this Right Angle because it's fun. This is
the Right Angle Cross of the Unexpected, which means we know nothing. I like that.
It‟s one of those great places where whenever I'm dealing with people on the Cross
of the Unexpected and they ask me
about this or that, I go, “I don't
know, anything could happen with
you. You are the embodiment of the
unexpected,” which is great. We just
don't know. Now of course for them 
that could be a very spooky thought.

Being on the Cross of the Unex-
pected is about as close as you come
to having a chance for a spiritual,
mystical life. Well, sure, at any mo-
ment anything can happen. And if
you have that philosophy in your life

that you don't know what is going on

in any moment and anything can
happen, hey, nothing wrong with
that, that is a really good space to be
in. The evidence for me of the Cross
of the Unexpected is marvelous. My
joke about Uranus, Neptune and
Pluto were all discovered on the Cross of the Unexpected. Every year begins on the
Cross of the Unexpected. This is us. This is the beauty of what is to be human, you
never know. Ah, to be a 3rd line on this cross, you‟re in your glory, at any moment,
at any time, in a fraction of a moment. As a matter of fact, it happened one moment
after the other, this incredible potential of the unexpected.
Think about something about the unexpected. When the unexpected happens, it's
nourishing and expands your intelligence. When the unexpected happens, you have
a chance to find your purpose. When the unexpected happens, a whole new series
of experiential ways are initiated. When the unexpected happens, others are going
to be influenced. It‟s four gates, the arms of this cross. This is the unexpected. The
unexpected is a transforming agent. And when you carry the unexpected in you,
hey, this is one of the treats of being human. It‟s like you‟re going along and there
are all these rules and everything seems to be orderly and you're walking along in
the orderly cosmos and all of a sudden out of nowhere Jesus is standing in front of

is. I‟m sure the dinosaurs got whacked on the Cross of the Unexpected; nine billion
of them on the planet all traveling along—having a nice day, Louie? Yeah; whack,
over.
On the unexpected anything, anything, anything, anything, anything can happen and
that‟s its glory. You‟re not safe. It's 10 o'clock, do you know where your children
are. You never know what's going to happen. And not knowing what's going to
happen is so influential; it creates so much fear. And then, of course, you become
more intelligent trying to prepare yourself for what you can‟t prepare yourself for.
Who could have prepared for Uranus showing up? You can‟t prepare for that. You
couldn't see it with your naked eye, and all of a sudden it's there. Imagine Galileo's
fright. Suddenly you see all these Moons around Jupiter. It‟s like; they‟re going to
name them after me.

The 1/3
RAC Unexpected 1
If you‟re a 1/3 on the Cross of the Unexpected, God bless you. You‟re going to meet
the unexpected, you really are, little unexpecteds, big unexpecteds. Virgin Mary, she
must have been born in this cross. That has to be unexpected, right? I didn‟t do
anything. Never mind, just my sense of humor.
If you going to be a 1/3 in this situation, obviously what's interesting about the 1/3
here is that the unexpected is going to be explored. Not simply that the unexpected
happens, but the unexpected is going to carry with it that 1st line Personality that is
deeply going to go into it. And here for the 1/3, they're really blessed because there
is no foundation. It's not like their trial and error is to discover the flaw in the foun-
dation. You can't discover the flaw in the unexpected until the unexpected happens.
So this is a place where 1/3s are kind of liberated. They're not going to have the
same kind of trauma in their life because the fact is that when things go wrong, be-
cause this is their cross, there's always going to be a part of them that says, “Hey,
this is interesting.” They will notice it. The unexpected can be a reward.
These are the people you meet who are 3rd line and you start giving them all this 3rd
line stuff about being a pessimist and a martyr and they look at you like you‟re nuts.
“Oh, my mistakes in life have always been great; I have always found wonderful
things. Jesus, I couldn't live without mistakes. I think this is the way.” Really, 3rd
lines who really live the 3rd line process, even though they don't know how it works,
it‟s because of this cross. It‟s like, “Hey, every mistake has a silver lining.” There's
always something that can be there, and they find it, much to the distress of others
who want to punish them for the mistake, which is the way of the not-self dealing
with the 3.

The 1/4
RAC Unexpected 1
This is not a healthy place for the 4th line. The 4th line does not like the unexpected.
When a stranger comes into the life of a 4th line, they‟d better have antenna up that
says, “This is a risk,” and they do. There is a place inside of them. You can see the
extreme of that in the 2/4 where they want to have this unfettered security in their
environment. So, when you're dealing with the 4th line you can make them very,
very uncomfortable. They don't want the unexpected. They don't want the rug to
be pulled out from under their feet; they don't want that.
Even at the simplest level, they get into the car in the morning with their parent and
they're going to school and all of a sudden the parent turns off the normal route to
stop somewhere to get something, and the parent hadn't told the child; there is this
unexpected. They‟re already very uncomfortable. “Why are you doing this, where
are you going?” They don‟t like the unexpected, so they‟re not going to be comfort-
able with it.
One of the things you‟re going to find about the 1/4 is that the 1/4 is always going to
find another to avoid the unexpected and stay with the way things were before.
These are nostalgia freaks. These are people who say that is was always better
before, always. You know the people who want to live in Minervia, the Atlantians;
Atlantians drive me crazy. Get rid of them, they‟re really nuts.
For me anyway, retros are really a problem. This is kind of a retro phase, this 4 in
the unexpected. It‟s like things were much better back here, they really were. Life
was simpler, it was easier. The fact that you didn't live as long, that you were cov-
ered in lice, you smelled bad, and on and on, you forget all those things. It's just
the nostalgia for this nice past era. You forget about all the worms that are in your
body. This is the nice past era. Yeah.
The French court; imagine making love to a woman who hasn't had a bath in 30
years. And people think that that was a golden age. It‟s like, excuse me. When
people are looking backward, this is the abstract; the same way that the left ear
doesn't hear everything, it depends on the mood. The abstract mind remembers
what it wants to. It‟s like the person who tells you that right beside the hotel was a
river. You get there and there's no river. What river? What did you see? How
peaceful it once was, or these memories of childhood, this 1/4, how things were so
much better when they were kids. They forget that that's not true, but nonetheless.
So when you're dealing with 4s and the unexpected, please recognize that it isn't
necessarily going to be a comfortable thing for them. It isn‟t. If you resist the un-
expected it doesn't mean you're being a fool. The unexpected may not be bringing
you something positive. There is no guarantee that the unexpected is positive, none
whatsoever. It‟s a crapshoot, it's a binary, sometimes yes, sometimes no. And
there isn‟t anything that says if you're embracing the unexpected that that's going to

be good for you. After all, 28s are libel to risk anything. And a lot of it does not
bring them a positive reward. It just brings them pain, struggle, a sense of despe-
rateness in not having found their purpose, and so forth and so on.
So when you're looking at the Cross of the Unexpected, again, you can always see
how the program makes sure that we have a balance; the embrace on one side, the
resistance on the other side. So the 4 here, this is resistance. It‟s not a matter of
good or bad, simply about the not-self and the way the not-self operates through its
characteristics, and how that's going to be different for them. After all, this is a
cross that brings shattering. This is a cross that brings the end of things and the
start of things. That‟s why it's the beginning of every year. It really is. You don't
know what you're getting into. You just don't know what you getting into.

The 2/4 can accept the unexpected on the outside. So, if they‟re looking out the
window and lightning strikes their neighbor‟s house, that's okay, but don't let it
strike their house, that is not okay. I have had many, many years on the road and
many visits to people's houses, and every once in a while you go into somebody's
house and they're in their early 30s, and you walk into the house and it's a mauso-
leum. They've inherited furniture from parents, grandparents, whatever and there is
this oldness to the frequency that's so out of place with their vibration. A 2/4 on this
cross—the house is locked into a state of timelessness. It‟s like going to Cuba and
seeing the cars. It's 1958, and it's only 1958. If you want to buy a car manufac-
tured in 1958 go to Cuba, they‟re beautiful. That's when the embargo started.
That‟s the last new cars got there.
So you go a 2/4 on this cross and you go into their home and the room they grew up
in still has the teddy bears. Don't change anything because if you change anything,
I'm really in trouble. This is the 41, the 41 is very spooky. Remember about the 41,
the 41 initiates an experiential way and it initiates the desire to fulfill it. The mo-
ment the Cross of the Unexpected comes alive, you are filled with that desire and
driven by the desire to have that experience, to go through it. These are people who
get dragged into the 21st century.
It's like me, it‟s like now. I have a new website and when you arrive at the website
there's this page that says to you that this website has a different technology and
you‟re going to have to download a software program before you can even open up
this website. There are so many 2/4s who will not do that. If you have the arche-
type of the 2/4, this cross, that's the last thing—why couldn't they have just left it
alone. Don't surprise me, I came here expecting to get what I wanted and it’s not
here anymore. They don‟t like that. It's like you go to this cross, the 2/4 and you
go into the kitchen and you're talking with the woman in the kitchen and you say,
“How can you still use this kind of a stove?” Don't even touch that, don't even go
near that.

Again, it‟s one of the things to see that the moment you see the 4 on this cross, you
see resistance, resistance to the unexpected. Yet they‟re on the Cross of the Unex-
pected, it‟s not like they‟re going to avoid it. They‟re not. And they‟re a 2/4 and
they‟re going to be called to it. It doesn‟t mean that all 2/4s will be desperately
upset by that; some of them will be called to it and become missionaries of that,
really get into that, whatever it is, but the not-self, generally, no.

The 2/5
RAC Unexpected 1
Any time you're dealing with the potential of projection and you're dealing with the
unexpected, this is always an opportunity for the 2/5 to shine. This is always an
opportunity for them to be able to display their heresy with a sense of security be-
cause the opportunities have changed. A 2/5 who is locked into an environment in
which some aspect of their Personality, and things they would like to be able to do, is
never permitted and all of a sudden they're in another environment where everybody
does that. That unexpected can really give them a chance to shine, to be called out
in their heresy.
But again, when you're dealing with so much projection, when you're dealing par-
ticularly this way—again, this is one of the things about the 2/5. Always remember
when you meet the 2/5 to remember the story of the little boy and the little girl, or
the story of the lover with somebody else, and there is that unconscious going like
this—“Come and get me, come and get me, come and get me,” it‟s a pull. The 5th
line seduction is calling from the unconscious. And the Personality is saying, “I’m
hiding.” And the unconscious says, “Come and get me.” And the Personality says
“I’m hiding.” This is very frustrating.
It's also very difficult for them because they don't know they're seducing. The 5/2
does. I am not naïve about my capacity as a 5 Personality to seduce. It's obvious.
It's obvious whether I want to be seductive or not. It's obvious. It's just there, it‟s a
thematic. But I have conscious access to it, it is my Personality. But when it's your
unconscious and you don't know you're doing it and you have a Personality that
says, “Hey, leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone.” But you have an un-
conscious that is saying “Come, come, come, come, come.” And then whoever is
coming near you is projecting on both of them because that part of you that says,
“Come, I’m the best.” And that part of you that‟s going like this is the part of you
that says, “Break through my barrier and you can find my beauty.”
So, you can end up seeing why 2/5s just don't like the game; too much pressure.
But, because they're heretics, moments of the unexpected can liberate them and out
it comes. It has to be called by others, but at the same time, that‟s always the case
with 2/5s or 5/2s, they have to be self-motivated. In other words, you‟re never
going to get unexpected behavior from a 2/5 unless they have motivated themselves
to show you that behavior. That‟s why they can be so surprising. You think you
know these people, wow, you can be so surprised.

The 3/5
RAC Unexpected 1
The moment you get into the 3 here, you're already in an advantaged position. The
moment you get to the 3/5 here, again, this is one of those places where the 3/5
doesn't have to be the extraordinary martyr. Most 3/5 positions, after all, are very
difficult. That isn't to give 3/5s the opportunity to lament about the nature of their
lives. Obviously, correctness and an understanding of the 3rd line thematic is going
to change anybody's life who is a 3/5. They are of enormous value to society.
They‟re the heart of the Right Angle process. They‟re really the heart of that
process.
The heart of that process is that everything about being in the world is that here's
enough material for all of us, 3rd line theme, and more than that, the benefits of
learning how to gain a material hold on this plane can be universalized to the advan-
tage of others. 3/5s can really teach us where not to waste our money, where not to
waste our careers, where we can go in order to be able to do well. They have that
potential within us. And we‟re ready to listen to their trial and error wisdom because
that‟s what it is; we‟re ready to listen to their trial and error wisdom because we
attune to their unconscious that seduces us into thinking that they really have an
answer for us based on that wisdom.
So there is no greater exponent of the unexpected than the 3/5. The 3/5 is really
great at getting the advantages of the unexpected out by unexpectedly discovering a
cure for cancer—get it out, baby. Out of nowhere, it was really unexpected. “I was
actually trying to make a new kind of toothpaste. And the unexpected happened.
That glass fell off that counter and…”—the magic of the unexpected. And if anything
is going to go wrong, it is going to go wrong for 3/5s. Here they‟re in their glory
because out of any of those things that go wrong is the possibility of the unexpected
showing up. So this can be a very magical place for a 3/5.
The first time they can take advantage of the unexpected, they heal their 3rd line
dilemma. In other words, the 3s problem is that they think that failure, that mis-
takes are a failure, and that they are lacking something. But the moment that mis-
take leads to a discovery, the moment that mistake leads to an exciting unexpected
desire, phenomena, whatever, the moment you enter into the risk that is bringing
you the purpose and all that stuff, the moment that the unexpected gives you influ-
ence, that's the moment you begin to see, “If I hadn’t made that mistake, I never
would've gotten here.” And for the rest of your life, making a mistake is glorified for
you. As a 3/5 you sell it to others. “Ah, don't worry about that mistake, that's how I
found the answer. I found the answer this way.”
You never know when the unexpected is going to show up. And for a 3, this is one
of the things to teach them. Remember, we have all of this in all of us, every person
who has a 3rd line in their design, let alone in their profile. Everything is inside of us.
And wherever that 3rd line is in your design, there's a chance of the unexpected.

Look at me in my 3rd line mind, wow, did I ever get the unexpected out of nowhere.
It totally changed my mind. Whack, unexpected, wonderful, I finally found some-
thing that my 3rd line mind couldn't trash.
It‟s a real gift to be a 3rd line being, after all. It‟s why I like them. They will find a
loophole. The only thing they can‟t find a loophole in is the absolute, and I am a
merchant of the absolute, the absolute of the maia. So 3s have always been my
greatest testing ground. They‟re the ones. If anything is going to go wrong, they‟ll
know, they'll tell you. So, the magic of the unexpected, the magic of the 3/5 is in
this, a great place to be 3/5.

The 3/6
RAC Unexpected 1
The whole thing about the 5 and the 6 is that the 5 has something that it has to do
in the sense that it has to universalize because that's its thematic. But the 6 is only
interested in individual transition, it‟s only interested in itself. After all, it‟s one of
the things about the 6 that‟s so interesting. It‟s only transpersonal in its impact of
others. It's really absorbed in its process. It starts off with Right Angle thematics
going through the trial and error.
So when you're dealing with a 3/6, the unexpected is simply something that they
metabolize, they internalize. They can unexpectedly change. One of things you
notice about 3/6s is that they can really change. It‟s very different from the 6/3
transition to the next hexagram. 3/6s can really change. And that unexpected is
simply there. You see it in them. Often it‟s just cosmetic—this week a blonde, the
next week a redhead, whatever the case may be. But there is always this—you will
always find the unexpected in a 3/6.
The beauty for them with their double 3rd line theme and all of that is like every 3 on
this cross gets the benefit of learning how good mistakes are without having been
taught Human Design because the unexpected is bound to reward them one way or
another. That doesn't mean all of them do, but they get to see this is the value of
trial and error. You learn things nobody else knows, you get stuff. A new thing
opens, and the unexpected gives you power, influence over the collective.

The 4/6, the end of the Right Angle. 4/6s are more chroniclers of the unexpected
than anything else. Again, the limitation of the 4th line here, and basically this is
where you really see the voyeur. It‟s like someone asexual who chronicles porno-
graphy. It's really bizarre. That's bizarre. There is a certain bizarreness to the 4/6
in this configuration because in fact they are a witness of the unexpected rather than
being impacted by the unexpected themselves. As a matter of fact, they don't like

it. They can watch a trend within their milieu where their milieu starts moving in a
certain direction, they watch this transition. The reality is that the unexpected is not
something they're going to embrace; they‟re going to resist it. They'll be on the
outside watching what happens to their friends on the inside going through that
transition rather than being drawn into it themselves. They are going to resist that
transition.
Again, I painted the dark side for you, but also understand, even in the most positive
context, if you‟re a 4/6 and your milieu goes through a radical change, the unex-
pected comes into your life and it's going to be very difficult for you to go along with
the rest of your community. You‟re going to be the resistant one. And the 4 has
difficulties with the unexpected, it just does.
It will have difficulty with any cross that is going to bring something out of nothing.
There are crosses like that, the kind of cross where you don't really know what's
coming. The 4th line is always going to have its day, and in the very same way the
3rd line is going to love it. There‟s nothing like a missionary teaching you shit that
came up 2000 years ago in thinking that it‟s contemporary. And the moment the
unexpected comes along, some new trend, some new philosophical direction, it
doesn't mean they embrace it; it means they fight even stronger for the continuity of
the past.
Resistance; I love it. This is called dynamic tension; it‟s the nature of life. You can-
not have all the balance at one end. You can't. Everything about the binary is that it
creates Juxtapositions phenomena. If you put two forces beside each other, the
reality is that a third thing emerges, something that's larger than the sum of its
parts.
So what we need, for example, like here on this Cross of the Unexpected is to recog-
nize that we're not going to be given a world in which the unexpected is only em-
braced. We have both, and within both, the two becomes four because within both
is a variation of the unexpected being good and bad. If you get into the details, then
the two will become four and the four will become eight and the eight will become
sixteen, and you go on and on and on and on into all the possibilities of somewhere
between embrace and resistance.
Out of that comes the larger dynamic. In that way, the unexpected is tested. Those
who embrace the unexpected are not judges of its value; those who resist it are not
judges of its value. In the end, the measurement is the by-product of the whole
process. We can see as mutated beings that the unexpected truly changes us. We
know that. It‟s like here on the island, there was an earthquake in Algeria which is
right across the sea from us, and it was actually a tidal wave that hit here. The wa-
ter rose in some places here 9 meters, and boats in the harbor were all smashed and
thrown up onto the beach. It came out of nowhere. The unexpected is the nature of
being, we know that. Yet, at the same time, we can't trust it because after all, it
comes unexpected and we don't know what it brings.

The 4/1
When we get to the Juxtaposition, we get to the pure thematic, if you will, of the
hexagram itself because it takes the hexagram‟s name, in that sense, and here we
have the Juxtaposition Cross of Caring. There's no unexpected anymore. That‟s
very important to understand. There are only risks, and the risk is that those around
you are not going to understand you
caring about the intelligence of oth-
ers, but caring about the intelligence
of others so that you can be intelli-
gent with them. This is one of the

deepest drives in us here in this
 Juxtaposition, these are education
freaks. These are the people who
realize clearly that in order to really
care, you must understand; if you
don't understand, you can't care.
This is not blind caring, you can see

that. This is caring that‟s rooted in

trying to find rules for maintaining
and nourishing human life. These
people are very, very, very fixed.
When you step from the 4/6 to the
4/1 here, this is one of the longest
suspension bridges in the world.
Even though the 4/6 is very, very fixed itself, it‟s nothing like the 4/1 because the
unexpected has nothing to do with it. The 4/1s theme is that we must care and we
must care that we are educated.
Now, obviously, they are powerful forces for us and they are very important. We're
coming to the end of the Quarter of Initiation and the Quarter of Mind. I do want
you to understand that the program recognizes that mind is something that has to
be trained. We're training our minds at a very high level. In the end, it's not so
much the detail you remember. It's like students who take copious notes and may
never use them again. It is a way of training your mind to frame the knowledge so
that the knowledge can come back out easily. But you must train the mind. When
my son says to me, “Why do we have these courses in school.” I always tell him it's
not about what they're teaching you, it‟s about your mind being trained, being
trained in logic, being trained to do discern things, being trained to see, all of that
process. It is the training of the mind and how the mind will work.

And so built into this Juxtaposition is this deep recognition that the unexpected is
only threatening if you're not prepared, and you can be prepared for the unexpec-
teds by simply being yourself. The greatest nurturing of any child is to nurture its
uniqueness and to nurture the intelligence of that uniqueness so it comes out as a
true being. That's really something. Then the unexpected doesn't matter.
The other thing is that when the unexpected shows up, we can't just allow it to show
up. In other words, we have to test its value. And if it‟s valuable as a mutation, as
a new force, then we have to be able to train humanity to recognize it and deal with
it. The last hundred years has been a process of teaching humanity about the rela-
tivity of our universe. Right now there are probably, maybe 200 housewives who
can explain Einstein's theory of relativity. Now, when it started, there probably were
none, so we're getting there. But until everyone, until the majority let's say, can
grasp what relativity is, it has not become something that we been properly trained
to as an unexpected reality, and we‟ll keep on training everyone until the grasp of
that is inherent. And we will, in our own slow way.
I exaggerate; a lot of people actually know, at some level, the certain phenomena of
relativity, certain recognition about relativity. There are an awful lot of people who
know that the time-space continuum is something that is derived from that. It‟s not
like we‟re totally ignorant. We have been working very hard for the last hundred
years trying to get people to grasp the basic rule of our illusionary environment. It‟s
like how long it took us to teach people about bacteria. Christ, what a job. You can
unexpectedly look in a piece of glass that you've played with and discovered that
there is a little creature crawling on your skin, that you couldn't see it otherwise, and
that unexpected. It takes a long time and a lot of training to deal with the conse-
quences of the arrival of the unexpected.
So this is deeply educational. And it says that the unexpected will naturally change
the rules of nurturing, and they do. It is not enough for us, for example, to teach
our children what is basically learned in primitive societies. In the West, if you don't
educate your children for 20 years, you've been a failure as a parent. If you don't
give them all kinds of developmental advantages, you‟re a failure. You have to take
advantage of all of that stuff to nurture them properly. So this is mental training.
It‟s very important. It's the theme of nurturing.

about death as a place rather than a time, to seeing that it's all movement. Birth is
simply a place in a movement; we‟re always moving. One of the magical things
about this cross is that this trust is really attuned to movement, finding the right
alignment. It‟s deeply directional.
Just think about the gates for second and understand something, what's being
aligned. If you don't find the right geometry in life, you cannot have influence. You
cannot find your purpose. You will not develop enough intelligence. You will not
have the right experiences. It's all there, the four gates. Alignment is very impor-
tant. Now, what the hell does that mean? The prophets of alignment, the 5/1, the
heretical ones, they're all trying to tell you the way. They're all trying to tell you the
way. Now, I'm a 41 and I have the 7 activated three times pointed at the 31, and
I'm deeply individual with my 20-10-57 that the 28 has a deep impact on. These are
things that are a part of me. And yet at the same time, it‟s always angered me that
people say “This is the way, my way or the highway.”
And the 5/1 here on this cross is going to tell you there's the way. Now, they're not
the Cross of the Four Ways. They're pointing you towards a way. They pitch the
route, this is the way. Of course,
you can get into a lot of problems
when you give people the wrong
directions, a lot of trouble. Every-
one has a way. Everybody does.
We know that because we‟re all

pose. I'm talking about the form in
this life and its alignment to its pur-

there are all kinds of forces out
there that are saying, “No, no, no, the unexpected happened to me, and after the
unexpected happened to me, it changed my life and now I know this is the way, but
it is a way for you, too.”
It's always so amusing for me because I love the humor of all of it, that here I am as
a messenger of an absolute. Now, an absolute says, “Hey, there is nothing else.”
Fortunately for me, all the ways are inside the absolute. That's the real joke. It's
like I don't have to say there's only one way, there are as many ways as there are
designs. The only time you see that people are aligned this way is that the vast
majority of humanity is aligned into certain ways and they‟re locked by the condi-

tioning. We don't know that each of us have a unique way, which in Design we
simply call being yourself. Whatever is going to be our route in our geometry in this
life is uniquely our own and not comparable to any other way. There is no other way
for us.
You‟re going to meet somebody who says, “This is the way.” So you can see that,
the old esoteric games. Most of what goes on in the so-called New age is simply the
continuation of a certain way. It‟s not even diverse; it's basically the same thing.
We've been conditioned to these certain processes: this is how you mature, this is
how you grow up, this is how you go through things, you have to take these steps,
you have to go through these things, this is the order that‟s given to you.

do it themselves, this natural 2 in them that really is uncertain about how to describe
any phenomena that is positive for them.
So, in this case again, you're going to get that 5/2 who will live out that personal
way. If you do get to know them, and you can, they can be called. You‟ll get to see
that they have what they feel is their direction, their way of going through things.
This alignment. It‟s like, for example, we've turned education into a stepping pro-
gram in which just about everybody goes to the same process. Schools are struc-
tured in certain ways by certain age groups, all of that stuff. This is the whole edu-
cational train-the-mind formula being lived out as aligning people to that direction.
Everybody gets aligned to developing their education in a certain way, but all of that
linear education doesn't mean that we have really succeeded in giving everybody the

kind of person where you usually see them in a job that you wouldn't want, a job
that you might even have a prejudice towards, and you see them in that job and you
see that for them it‟s perfect. You can see that they really love what they do. You
can see that they‟re aligned to what is correct for them.
The whole nature of alignment is just another way of talking about putting people in
their place. It all goes back to the theme here. Don't forget the theme of this Quar-

ter. The theme of this Quarter is mind and mind has to be organized, humanity has
to be organized. You can‟t really teach all of us unless you create institutions. Once
you organize all of us, you have to control all of us, which means you are also going
to try to control what we think. It goes on and on and on; it‟s all here. It's all here
and we‟re the by-product of it.
As much as the new enters into our lives, I'm still doing what teachers did 5,000
years ago. I'm still here with my students. I'm still here in the same old program.
There are so many things about the way we have been designed to be together, to
work together and to impact each other; these are the ways that have been laid out.
Everything about alignment is trying to get you. It‟s very parental. We‟re still in the
27; it's trying to get you to get in the right direction. So many parents suddenly
have this moment of relief when they think their kids are going in the right direction.
They‟re suddenly aligned and they're really getting there, they‟re really pointed to-
wards it.
It‟s not being in the direction itself. Remember, this is the doorway that leads to the
way. It‟s not the way itself. To be aligned simply means that if you're standing on a
spot and somebody wants to take a picture of you and they turn you slightly, they‟re
aligning you, they‟re lining you up. But it doesn't mean that anything else is hap-
pening. This is an opening up. So this cross is about that; that's why the 6/2s can
be very powerful here because a 6/2 is a door opener. They open the door as an
example. They just do. It doesn't mean you can open the door, too. It doesn't
mean you can necessarily follow them. But they are an example of that; they are an
example of going towards the alignment.
So you have a lot of kids at the end of high school and those kids who are aligned
towards going to university are going to have a lot of impact on those around them.
This is going to make it more important for the others to see, “Ah, there‟s the way.”
When I was going to school, no matter what level of school I was in, there was al-
ways somebody who was pointing towards the next level. It‟s like you‟re finally get-
ting aligned to your direction and then you see that by the time you get into univer-
sity and you start focusing on what your specialty is going to be, you begin to see
this alignment, you begin to be lining up on that. And then of course, you could be
the result of the unexpected and sex and drugs and rock 'n roll get in the way; but

ways. We can only be aligned to one of four ways. When I say that, remember

we‟re dealing with a binary that multiplies out of a binary. The moment we're talking
about four ways, we‟re talking about endless nuances of each of those four ways.
So, when you're dealing with the 6/3 on this cross, it is a very important bridge and
a very quick bridge. It‟s not like that long suspension bridge. This is a little jump
because that 6/3 knows better than anybody else that they don't just want to stand
in line. They don't want to just line up, it's not enough. What they want is to be on
the road, to live the way itself.
So many people stand in the doorway of the way and say, “Oh, I wish.” That person
who reads about somebody trekking in the Himalayas, “I wish.” It‟s like this is the
crossing over, this is the part that they start reading the book, and after the first two
chapters they go buy a ticket and get on an airplane and write the book themselves.
“Let me see this way, let me live out this way.” So many people dream of a way,
that there is a way for them.
When we're dealing with the Cross of the Four Ways, it‟s not like we‟re talking about
the Nodes in terms of direction. It‟s not like we're talking about our angle in terms
of that concept of direction. There is an expression: They have a certain way about
them. If this is not your language, it can be difficult because it is one of the few
ways that I can describe the four ways. They have a certain way, and you're not
talking about where they're going, you‟re talking about a certain quality in them.
You‟re talking about a certain quality that has a certain, specific consistency to it,
and this is what we're moving towards.
To follow one of the four ways is that when people think about you, it‟s a quality they
can sense. You have a certain way about you. All of us born in this Quarter have a
certain way about us that relates to this Quarter. The same way that other Quarters
have the same thing, a certain way. Our certain way is rooted in the 24. And then
again, we‟re dealing with a Quarter of Mind and the 24 is the cosmic mental toilet.
So, we really get to see what that's all about.

A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
I love ends. I love ends as much as I love beginnings. I‟m a good Arian. Begin-
nings are natural for me and ends are always a dream. So, I love coming to the
end, I love coming to the end of this Quarter.
When we come to the 24, take a look at that hexagram. One of things to recognize
is that we‟re coming to the end of the Quarter. When we enter into the next Quarter
we enter into the 2nd gate. We enter into the pure six yin lines,
and obviously when we‟re going to look at the next Quarter, we‟re
going to see that its basic binary is going to be yin-yin. In other
words, you can see here how all the yins have finally just piled up
above this one yang. You can just see them; they're all just piled up
there.
So, the pressure of the yin world is really an enormous pressure on this mind now
because this is mind that has to find its way in the world. It's mind that has to find
its way in the world of matter. The thing to recognize about the Cross of the Four
Ways is that they are not emblematic of their Quarter any more than the 6/3 is em-
blematic of the profile of the hexagram. In other words, they are already some-
where else. So, at the same time you can say if you come in on the 24 that you
came in on the Quarter of Initiation; yes, you came in on the Quarter of Initiation
(spoken in a long drawn out manner,) you‟re already moving to the receptive.
You‟re already moving into—yes, mind is okay, but I have to build something; you're
already going towards there.
The 24th Gate of Rationalizing
The 24th gate is the great gate of Rationalizing. Think about the 61/24; the individu-
al process, mentally, is very bizarre. It‟s not collective. It doesn't have this kind of
“I” contingency experience pattern. The knowing seems to emerge from nowhere.
The 61 question is a question that not simply emerges out of
nowhere but may actually even be a question about nowhere.
In other words, that 61—and it's not coming as a visual pattern,
it's not coming as a memorial experience, it‟s just suddenly
there. And what do you do with something that‟s suddenly
there as a thought, as an inspiration flowing through? Basically
what the 24 does is try to create a form for the inspiration.
Everything about the 24, the work of the 24 is to try to put
inspiration into some kind of form so that ultimately it can be explained. Now, we
call that rationalizing at the broadest, broadest level.

Returning
But I want you think about this name because this name tells you the torture of the
individual mutative way mentally. The Return—over and over and over and over and
over again. You know what that's like if you're a 24 and there is a song in your head
and it takes you eight thousand years to get rid of it, over, over, over, over, over,
over, over again, the same thoughts, the same pondering, the same thing over,
over, over, and over again. This is the great trap of the individual. Why do you
think individuals are so open to melancholy and can be saved by creativity? All we‟re
talking about is mutation. If the mutation isn't there, melancholy is immediate, and
the moment mutation is there, art is possible.
So the whole thing to understand about the individual mind is that most of the time
it's repeating the same things, stuck with the same things. I don’t know, I don't
know, I don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know, I don't know, I
don’t know, oops I know. That‟s the process. And while you‟re going I don’t know, I
don’t know, I don’t know, you can end up being very depressed, depressed that
you‟re never going to know, depressed that it's never going to happen, depressed
that is never going to happen, depressed that it‟s never going to be there. And
people with the 24, it‟s over and over again. The whole thing about the 24, the mys-
tery of the 24 is to understand something: If you have something going on over and
over and over again, you often don't notice when it has changed.
Most human beings don't realize that mutation is everywhere and if you see it, it's
alive. This is the magic that is inherent in the 24, it's there everywhere. It's there
everywhere, but you don't necessarily see it; you don't see it because you're still
going over the same question, you‟re still processing the same thing over and over
and over again. This is why you have in the 24 the mystery of the knock on the door
that you ignore that can change your life. 24s can be so deaf to the opportunities of
life because they don't notice that things are changed because it hasn‟t clicked in;
you‟re still running around in the same circle.
But the 24 has something else, the 24 is very special. We will see that when we get
to the Left Angle Cross of Incarnation. Think about incarnation as a fancy hotel, and
as you enter that hotel, it has one of those revolving doors and they‟re usually a 4.
Every time you go through one of these doors now, for the rest of your life, you're
going to have this in your head because it's really what it's all about; there is this
revolving door. The whole thing about the 24 is that this is the beginning of the
revolving door. You know when you arrive at the airport they have one of these
revolving big ones, you're coming with your bags and you have to wait for the door
to open, but once you get in you‟re on the wheel and you're off. That's what the 24th
gate is.
In other words, if you're looking for an initiating point of the incarnative process, it's
in the 24th gate. This is where incarnation ready begins. It doesn‟t make a differ-
ence with the tail of the worm. It is a wheel, after all. Once it starts revolving, it‟s
revolving. These points simply are of interest intellectually, but it is the first way of
the first Quarter. One of the things to understand about the first way of the first
Quarter is that incarnation is the way. That's one of the first things to understand

about this Quarter. What this Quarter is really saying is that is the only way. So,
the 24 carries a lot of those mysteries with it.
Cross of the Four Ways
Let's talk about the Cross of the Four Ways. The Cross of the Four Ways is deeply
connected to the Nodes. That‟s the first thing. They're deeply connected to the
Nodes in the individual characteristics. And the Cross of the Four Ways itself is rep-
resentative of a life in cycle. What I mean by that is the same kind of thing I mean
when I talk to you about the 6th line being. You have a 6th line in your profile so you
know you're going to go through three distinctive phases in your life. The reality is
that people born on the Cross of the Four Ways have four ways in their life, and
those ways tend to turn on their Nodes. Basically, what all the beings who carry this
cross go through is at approximately every 18.6 years, their thematic changes. It‟s
a thematic that's there within this cross; in other words, the four arms of this Cross
of the Four Ways.
I love this combination because it‟s so magical. They‟re the only four names in all
the descriptions of the I‟Ching and the original names translated, they‟re the only
four names that really talk about a way; the only ones. So you have 19 Approach,
you have 33 Retreat, you have 44 Coming to Meet, you have 24 Return—the four
ways. So this is the way of Return. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to equate
that with incarnation. That's the way, it's the way of return and it says something
about any of us who are born in this Quarter that there are things for us in this life
that we will always have to return to, always, always. There is a place to return to,
always. It's part of the way.
But people who were born on this cross, it‟s very different. It‟s very much like the
Cross of the Laws in that it impacts on the other much more than it is impacting on
the person who carries it. The parent who has a child the Cross of the Four Ways,
the difficulty the parent has in one 18-year cycle will disappear in the next. They
think that Johnny or Janie has grown up but they have just changed themes. At the
same time, whatever way they were into deeply impacted everyone around them.
If you come in on the 24, you're pushing everybody towards the mental, you just
are. You're pushing everyone to the mental that they will not give up on the mental.
Think about the nature the return, again. It will process the same thing endlessly;
there is no beginning or end. The only thing that can stop it is mutation. And again,
there is no mental way to go. There are certain problems. We‟re all trained that
way as children. We‟re trained with one of the great mental training things—riddles.
Somebody gives you a riddle and you try to work out that riddle. And you cannot
work out that riddle just by going through it the first time, you can‟t. You need to
process it. You need to keep on going all over it and over it and over it, and for
some funny reason, even though you're not following a logical track by going over
and over and over, all of a sudden there's satori—oh, I got it.

Returning
This is what this Quarter tells us about our minds. It says the fact that you don't
know doesn't mean you give up. The fact you don't know simply means that you
don't know; but, you may know, it may come. Mutation is always, always, always
possible. As human beings we understand that we are only here to return because
every time we return, we expand our consciousness. Humanity has been doing that
from the beginning. Every return brings a greater depth in the consciousness of the
planet, the intelligence of the planet, the awareness of the planet. Despite how easy
it is for me to describe the horrors, the reality is that we've really done pretty well.
We're a long way, in terms of awareness and consciousness, than we were 50 years
ago. There‟s been a real shift in humanity, particularly since 1960 since we entered
into the 1st line theme of this global cycle.
So, the first to recognize about a 24 is that they're going to live out a life in which
they're going to have these changes, sometimes very radical changes. I have a very
old friend of mine here on the island. And she's the Cross of the Four Ways, and
she's one of these archetypes of that cross. The first 18 years she had a very specif-
ic kind of life that suddenly was really changed. She went from basically a very poor
standard of living, a difficult early life. She got married very young, she got married
when she was 19. She married a doctor. She went into a totally different world.
She went into a very straight, different class, a mother program. When this person
was 37 years old I gave her an acid trip, sorry, what to do, life can be odd. And she
ended up in Ibiza, and she ended up being a freak, she ended up going through what
is now coming to an end, which is that third 18-year nodal cycle. They go through
radical themes.
But the thing that‟s important to understand about them is that themes do change.
These are people who do not have a stable line in life. These are people who can
change careers when they're in their mid-to-late 30s because it's a natural move-
ment for them. These are people who can give up everything when they get into the
next one. They go through all these cycles.
They're much more important for all of us as thematics in the way they condition the
rest of us than they are in living it out themselves because in living it out them-
selves, if they‟re not prepared, it doesn't seem like there's any alignment. The joke
is that the Cross of the Four Ways beings provide the direction for the alignment of
others, but have no sense of alignment themselves. For them it seems like there's
always, somewhere down the road, a sharp right or a left.

the material so there are many crosses where it can do well, but it is interesting
within this context. They are trial-and-error people, and they're going to be on a
roller coaster of a life. Now it‟s not much of a roller coaster. 18½ years is a long
time. So it's not like they feel like there's a change every moment. But the thing to
understand about a 1/3 is that they‟re going to gain enormous experience. And
more than that, it is natural for them to get to a place of transition, to leave some-
thing behind, to go in another direction, to go another way. As a 3 that's not dis-
turbing; it isn‟t. It may in fact be
vindication—I really made a mistake
and now I'm going to change and
I’m going this way. It is so happens
that that turns out to be when
they're around 18 or 19 years old,

and they don't know that's just the 
mechanics at work, but as a 3 that‟s
easier for them.
The material part of it comes from
the fact that by going through sev-
eral ways in their process as 3s and
finding out what doesn't work, they

can turn that into an experiential 
base that gives them opportunities
on the material plane. This cross
has enormous capacity to manipu-
late the other. It's a 44 cross, after
all. This is the gate of manipulation.
It really can do things. The 19
creates a form for us. The 19 lets us know what all our basic needs are, and how
powerful that is on the other. When you have a Cross of the Four Ways child, many
of the things you think you need are not things you need at all, but are conditioned
by your child on the Cross of the Four Ways. This is very powerful. It also brings
out more manipulation in the parent, all of these various things.
When I first started to teach Design, everybody always saw the outside coming in as
their investigative perspective. In other words, what did the outside do to me, what
did my mother, my father, my sister, my brother, my lover do to me? What does
my child do to me? What does the program do to me? All of that is: What is it doing
to me? But, I always wanted you to be able to see and be able to teach others what
we do to the other. It is amazing what we do to the other. We do unto the other as
they do unto us. We know we don't like what they do unto to us, and we do it unto
them. We do do that.
The moment you really understand that is just simply a universal principle, you can
see that any aspect of any cross of any configuration is being put into all of us all the
time. Imagine what it‟s like if you took it away. Imagine you take away on this
planet all the Right Angles of this cross. The moment you take it away, everything
would slowly begin to break down, everything. It‟s like the people who say, “Well, if

we kill these bugs we will save this crop,” without understanding what that really
means, what the real chain of life is all about, how interconnected all things are.
At the moment you will take out an ingredient of our genetic code, we are no longer
human. The great risk depopulation and sterilization and infertility in humanity is
that we will end up with gaps, and it'll kill us. It will be our extinction. You get to a
certain base point where humanity will become automatically extinct because it can-
not function anymore. Simply a disease at the genetic level where you're simply
taking out information and there is a gap that's no longer bridged.
These beings, all of us, are essential to the whole. It's like my trip with Generators
when I tell them that with every breath, they make the world happen, and they do.
If you took away all the Generators, none of the rest of us would be alive even
though we would think the idea is okay. A world without Generators, I could levitate
all day, but I‟d be dead so it wouldn‟t matter. There would be nobody around to take
a picture so I could prove it.

The 1/4
RAC Four Ways 1
The 1/4 is not going to be advantaged. By the time they figure out that the first way
is the right way, that they've worked on it, studied it, and they've convinced all their
friends that this is a way, all of a sudden they turn 18, 19 and they go in a totally
different direction and they have no choice; they‟re pulled. It‟s very, very uncom-
fortable. It's not as disastrous as it would be if this was a 4/1 because the whole
thing about having the 4 at the unconscious is that you don't really know who you‟re
allies are and you don't really know who your community is and you may not feel a
great sense of loss when you move on because you may immediately see new oppor-
tunities.
But if you have a 4th line Personality and everything you've built up around your 4th
line Personality dissolves and you're pulled off in another direction—you think you're
going to go to university with your friends and instead you go into the military and
everybody's looking at you and wondering what the hell happened to you. “We all
expected you to go this way. Not only that, you told us to go this way. You didn‟t
tell us you were going to go over here. And we‟re all here without you.” And it‟s
really like that; all of a sudden.
And if you‟re a 4, that's not comfortable. Again, like with 3s and 4s, if the parenting
contains the wisdom of this knowledge, how much easier it is. It isn't going to say to
the 1/4, “By the way, it's going to feel good when that change comes.” It doesn‟t
because we are what we are; we‟re going to go through what we go through. What
it does do is show them that this is not the end. When you‟re fixed and something
stops, it's as if everything stops. Your life stops, the world stops, everything stops,
and that's the great risk for them; they freeze up, they can‟t go any further. And the
fact that everything is moving in another direction is something that becomes over-

The 2/4
RAC Four Ways 1
You wouldn‟t really notice, other than the fact that the change is on the inside, what
you're dealing with with 2/4s. In this kind of configuration, the 2/4 is going to go
through these changes that are going to take place on this cross. But again, those
changes are going to be more evident to somebody who knows them on the inside
than somebody who sees them on the outside. They look very similar on the out-
side. But there is a tremendous amount of change on the inside.
The other thing is that 2/4 people are the ones who are the most surprising as mis-
sionaries because the 2/4 on this cross, where you go along on the first cycle, it
doesn't do anything for you; there's no call that really pulls you out. You go into the
next cycle, there may be interchanges in your life, but still nothing to really call you
out to display that cycle. And then you get into the third phase, you‟re somewhere
in your late 30s—by the way, the phenomena that we called the „midlife crisis‟ has
nothing to do with Uranus. Uranus is the „midlife measurement.‟ But, I've never
considered Uranus as a bringer of crisis in the midlife, in that sense, other than it
means a change in the prana, and for many people that can be a real deep transi-
tion, and so on. But the crisis is actually rooted in this cross. This is really where is.
These transitions take place at the end of the second cycle. And remember, we‟re all
affected by the four ways.
So, when you‟re 37 or 38 years old and you're entering into the beginning of the
third way in your life, the third way is a crisis way. So many people are changed in
that moment, so they give up their wife, their husband, their job, they go live in
Tahiti, they become plumbers, God knows what. They go back to school—
returning—they go back to the life they had before, they go back to their hometown,
they go back to whatever. In other words, there can be this real shift, a real crisis.
And we all have these ways imprinted in us. There isn't a single one of us who didn't
get to our 19th birthday and consider ourselves an adult. Do you know what I mean?
It's like, second cycle. The first way is over, the growing up, being a teenager, living
with mom and poppa, that's the first cycle. The second cycle is getting your feet wet
in the world. This is the ways.
So with 2/4s on this cross, wait until they're about 37. Then you're likely to see
them called out. Then is the only time you're going to notice their shift. In other
words, you‟re going to see their way. They‟re going to demonstrate to you, it‟s going
to come from the outside and they will be missionaries of it, try to influence you with
it. “I finally found the way, all these years, I finally found the way,” they will say.

The 2/5
RAC Four Ways 1
The very idea that each and every one of us is influenced by the Cross of the Four
Ways into the way in which these cycles work, it's also about something else to rec-
ognize about them. When you're looking at initiation, you're looking at purpose
fulfilled through mind. So the thing to recognize for all of us is the first 18½ years of
our lives, this is the architect; this is the time to develop the mind. The greatest
thing to waste is a young mind. There is nothing worse; nothing, nothing, nothing
worse than wasting a young mind. But also for us to see that the development of
our educational programs, the emphasis we have made on putting children into
schooling early and organizing their education and all of that, this is classic, this is
the way. The way is you come into the world as a servant of learning, or as a victim
of learning. You come into the world powerless. So you come into the world, this is
the way of initiation; this is the way of mind. The way of mind is that in order for us
to have the mind, we need, we have to be taught. This is the way.
Every once in a while 2/5s will teach you something very special because they are
the ones who can universalize a way. The 2/5, there is that possibility when that
special moment comes, whichever cycle it is, that really calls them to motivate
themselves to go out there and live that way. They can influence a great many
people. This is where we have trends, things that catch on for a while, things that a
lot of people do for a while because it becomes the thing to do, the “in” thing to do,
whatever the case may be.
These funny gatherings—it‟s very common in Berlin, they been playing this game. A
whole bunch of people who know each other all call each other on their telephones
and they all say, “Let's meet at this point.” And out of nowhere, hundreds and hun-
dreds of people meet; they all make some noise and then they all leave. And it's
very in, this spontaneous networking stuff; it‟s spontaneous. All of a sudden there
are all these people in one place, and nobody knows why they're all there.
This is one of those things where you see the power of what trends—this movement
is a way. A 2/5 can bring that kind of heresy, bring you that thing that‟s a little bit
different, and bring that flavor to a particular way that they‟re on. And again, it's
very difficult to discuss the Cross of the Ways without really seeing that this is a
cross because it influences the other; you can't really understand what's happening
in this person's life without knowing their characteristics. The characteristics are
very important here, for the person themselves, so you can begin to see how they
will handle their four ways. By knowing their characteristics, you'll get to see which
cycle is going to work for them.
If you come in on the Cross of the Four Ways and your Sun isn't in the 24, this first
cycle that we all go through, the first 18½ years isn‟t necessarily going to be com-
fortable. You‟re not necessarily going to shine in that cycle, but when it hits your
button, then there‟s that chance for you to come out and be able to shine with that

aspect. But again, how you're defined, what your authority is, the way you‟re going
to live. Remember, it‟s so difficult with crosses. Without getting to the place of the
true self, you cannot truly experience the cross. Here on a cross like this where
they‟re influencing others, it is exceedingly difficult for them in their life, unless they
can really get a grip on who they are, because as long as they‟re being incorrect
within themselves, those transitions will be natural and productive.
Everybody on the Cross of the Four Ways gets at least one way in which they can
really shine because it's really their way. You come in with a 24, the best part of
your life is going to be zero to 18. Think about that. And the best part of your life
only in the sense of your mind and the way it's developed. But this is the phase
where it's really going to make a difference for you how well you do, in that sense,
relative to your characteristics, relative to your ability to be yourself.

Again, the 3 is obviously advantaged here because anything that allows a 3 to see
that trial and error is productive and is healthy for them. The moment life is pulling
you in a certain direction as a result of something, this is very healthy for 3s. They
like that; it‟s good for them. However, the problem for the 3/5 is not their trip on
this cross. The problem is everybody else's other trip with them. They‟re very, very,
very effective at getting other people to go their way. On this cross they‟re very
effective.
They're not seen as bumblers. They‟re not seen as 1/3 error makers. They‟re not
seen as that at all because the moment you meet their aura—even if you only meet
them in their first cycle—you‟re meeting an aura that tells you these are beings who
move in life, they will move through things, and they're not predictable. The only
thing predictable about somebody on the Cross of the Four Ways is that they're
going to affect the people around them. That's predictable.
This is one of those places where if you cannot live as yourself it's going to be a lot
more difficult than for, let's say, somebody else on another profile on another cross
not living themselves. So, in dealing with the 3/5, the difficulty with the 3/5 is that
the people around it will blame them, accuse them, and punish them for influencing
them. This is a very difficult heretical position. Basically what you're saying to other
people is, “Look, life is not stable.” It‟s the 3/5 pitch on this cross. “Life is not sta-
ble, life is full of change, don't be afraid of taking a chance, don't be afraid of
change, don't be afraid of another way, don't be afraid of making mistakes—hey,
come with me, let's jump over this cliff,” and away you go.
Now, the 3/5 may be equipped to get onto the other side. “Oh, sorry that really
wasn't the way for you, was it?” They‟re wonderful doctors. You just don't want to
be a patient of theirs in their early years. Not that they‟re going to kill you, but
there is a great diagnostic capacity within the 3/5. Threes anyway, because so much
of being able to grasp something is to know what to eliminate; the moment you

know what to get out of the way, you begin to see. This is the magic of the 3. That
doesn't work, that doesn't work, that doesn‟t work, ah, eventually you work your
way through the weeds and you see, oh, shit, it‟s a Tiger, run. It‟s like oops, I finally
saw it.
So 3/5s have this capacity to diagnose the way; remember they‟re 5s, after all. If
you're going to universalize, you have certain gifts; you just do. So the reality is
that they can then lay out this, “This is the way.” So this is somebody who tells you
that, whatever it is, it doesn't matter, whatever the social thing happens to be in
that particular time. They‟re in that cycle, let‟s says it‟s drugs and they‟re in that
cycle and this is the way, and they convince others that it's the way and they be-
come trick masters and they tell him what the drugs are going to do to them and
they tell about the pit falls, so put a little chocolate in your pocket if you‟re going to
take LSD, and they go through that whole thing. That's really their thing.
And then all of a sudden their cycle ends and they give it all up. Not only do they
give it all up, they go into a totally different way. You know you meet them 10 years
later and it's like—Jesus, what happen to you? And from the point of view of the
Cross of the Four Ways, when they look at that other person, they say, “You got
stuck where I was, man, I’ve moved on. I'm somewhere else now in my life, you
swallowed my trip hook, line and sinker. It’s not my fault you’re still trashing around
out there. I went this way.” Oh, the other hates that. “Why you dirty rat, you
didn't tell me. We really trusted you. We really assumed that you were the 5, you
were going to be our savior, and you are our general leading us to victory. And you
abandoned us.”
This is one of those examples of the 3/5 not running the away, but being perceived
as abandoning. This is a 3/5 who doesn't have to leave home because everybody
else feels they've abandoned them anyway.

The 3/6
RAC Four Ways 1
The nice thing about the 3/6 is that it recognizes that there are so many nuances to
the way, whatever it happens to be. They are the great catalogs of the way. They
love the transition. If you come in on this cross and you have the 35/36, you‟re in
heaven. It‟s like, “Yes, transition is the way; that’s all. Change is the way. The only
thing that endures is change, it’s all change, don't be afraid of change, don't be
afraid of this or that, don't be afraid of falling down.” These people are emblems of
courage. They‟re great, if it doesn‟t kill them because they are vulnerable, but
they‟re great.
The 3/6 on this cross says, “Hey, that's great, any way is good. Give me a way, any
way, I'll try it, I’ll try it for awhile, wonderful experience, wonderful information,
great experiential teachers.” When you get to a place where the 3 has a good time,
the 3/6 and the 6/3 have actually some relief. That is a difficult thing, that‟s a very,
very difficult configuration unless you have that deep recognition of the 3 thematic.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
This is a great place for the 3/6. “It’s okay, I don’t feel bad.” They see that it's all
changed. They‟re the kind of person who says, “You wait and see, you’ll see, that
will come to an end, too. It all comes to an end, it just does, don’t worry about it,
don’t think it’s forever, it’s not forever, nothing is forever.” It‟s what they teach us.
And again, all of this is our initiation, Quarter of Initiation. All of this is about under-
standing that the game is never solid. People used to say to me that I was a fatalist,
or a determinist; I'm not. It's so obvious that Human Design reveals nothing but the
deepest, deepest, deepest mutative principles. The whole thing about life is that life
is nothing but change. We may have our little fixed aspects of definition, but every-
thing else isn't. The vast majority of your bodygraph is nothing but unexpected
openness. Anything and anything and anything can happen, and will.

The 4/6
RAC Four Ways 1
I don't like traffic lights, but I do like it when there's in a person like a traffic cop in
the middle of a crossroad directing traffic. I like that. I always find it so cute, this
movement of watching all the ants in their cars all going by. This is the 4/6 on this
cross. The 4/6 on this cross is a cop in the middle of the road directing you one way
or another. That's really what they're like. Now, the whole thing is that if you come
to that crossroad and you want to make a left, you may have to wait 36 or 37 years
because they‟re going to insist that you make a right first. That's really what they're
all about. They are really the ones who put you on a path; they put you on a way.
Ultimately, the role of the 4/6 at the Right Angle completion is for them to simply be
a role model of their way. In other words, if they go with their way, ultimately that's
the only way. And of course, the moment they are truly following what is their direc-
tion, they are always pointing people in the same way, always, always. And again,
you can begin to see that humanity is constantly being the led. The not-self blindly
is being led by all kinds of forces. It just is.

Unfortunately, this is not the Cross of the Four Ways. This is about as close to mind
fuck as you get. These are people who are so mind-caught that the idea you could
even imagine telling them that the mind doesn't have any inner authority is like try-
ing to negotiate with King Kong. It isn‟t going to work. This is very, very, very, very
mental. It's the final expression of the mental nature of this Quarter.

The only thing that holds the maia together is when there is a mental glue. These
are the beings who are caught in that mental glue. They are desperate to find a way
to make everything explainable. And that could be a very powerful influence on
others. But for them, it's very difficult. This is a very, very mental process.

The 5/1
We come to the Left Angle Cross of Incarnation. It's very important in the sense
that it lays out the parameters for us. It lets us know something, that in this lifetime
we don't have to have all the answers. In this lifetime, we don't mentally have to
triumph. It‟s not what it's about. We will have many chances. We will be able to
come back. There are other things that we will get to do. The reality is that this is
just part of the process.
At this point when you get to the
Left Angle, it‟s already pointed
towards enough of this mind shit.
It's time to build a life. We have
to build a life and we know that.

first phase comes to an end,
there‟s a part of you that says,
“It's time for me to go out in the
world, get a job, find a lover, have
children,” do something with one's
life. So, the whole incarnative
process is about, “Well, okay, but

in, it's very nice that you're here,
thank you very much, but now you
have to go through the whole
thing, okay. You have to go
through the whole process of what
it is to be in form.”
The 7 the 13 are role gates of the Sphinx, role gates for leadership, role gates for
revelation. When you think about incarnation, one of the things to recognize is that
incarnation has—and you can see it in the arms of the cross—four basic themes. It
just does. The first theme is that you return whether you like it or not. But that‟s
one of the most important places to get to mentally. It's called choicelessness. The
first theme is—no choice, baby. You just return; you just come in. This is the way it
goes.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
Once you've accepted that you just come, then you have to find your role. You in-
carnate to live out a role, which we know is our cross. You incarnate to live out the
role, the purpose, the fulfillment of your incarnation. How sweet. And once you find
your role then you can control others. Isn‟t that interesting? Once you find your
role, you can control others, which means that we can do things as a whole together.
We incarnate as a much to just find a role as we do to find a way to handle the other
because the 44th gate is the fear that we will not make it into the future and that the
only way we can deal with the fear of not making it into the future is that we‟re real-
ly good at protecting the resources that will take us into the future—our children.
Your role leads you through duality, into duality, into bonding. You go all the way
around, you get to the 13 on the other side and you become a return-completed
human, the human experience. It‟s all about the human experience; incarnation is
about the human experience. We know that. This is what this is. This is about
being human. And being human is not one life. Being human is an incarnative se-
quence; it‟s a sequence.
Now, people who come in on the Cross of Incarnation don't necessarily care about
incarnation. Remember that hexagram‟s impact is on the other, much more than it
is on the person who carries it. It is the nature of this cross, and the cross before, in
the Right Angle, it affects other human beings. So when somebody asks somebody
on this cross, “I don't know why I'm here,” they‟ll tell you you're here to find a role,
whatever the case may be. They'll give you an answer, in that sense.
But this is not the Cross of the Four Ways. One of the things about people on the
Cross of Incarnation is that they never quite figure out how to live in this world.
There's a part of them that doesn't fit here. Now in the new age era, these are
people who would gravitate to that, trying to find some kind of kinship with whatever
it may be, incarnative paths, or all of these kind of things. But the general quality of
these people is that they don't really feel like they fit in and they don't end up having
that kind of normal fit in life which is why they‟re the gateway to the form principle,
and a gateway to civilization and the building of things, the nature of the Throat and
manifestation, and all of that.
You get into the Quarter of Civilization and you have all 11 gates of the Throat out of
the 16, 11 out of the 16 gates are going to be Throat gates. It‟s a totally different
process. It's like the Cross of Incarnation doesn't quite know how to fit into the civi-
lized world. It never really quite fits in. They can be very bright, intelligent forces.
But they still don't have this comfort with the world they‟re in.
If you‟re a 5/1 on the Cross of Incarnation, it doesn't tell you anything. It‟s like the
Cross the Four Ways—if you don't know the characteristics, you really don't know
what's going to happen. It‟s not possible for me to really give you a description
because they're not going to run around saying, “I am the heretic who tells you that
there's incarnation.” It is not the way that it works. When you meet them you
think, oh, I‟ve met this person before. Fractals are transpersonal. These are people
who get that constant déjà vu experience—ah, I’ve done that before.

It doesn't mean they're going to be a spiritual boo-boo telling you, “Yes, yes, yes in
my last life I was...” Nine times out of 10 they have no sense of that, other than the
basic transpersonal sense. The difficult thing with 5/1s on this cross is that they are
uncharacteristically paranoid. The Cross of Incarnation, they meet you, you‟re on
their fractal, it‟s transpersonal, they know they've met you before, and somewhere
inside of them there's this fear that it wasn't good. I often have this as a transper-
sonal 5/1. I meet somebody and there's a sense of in my last life I think I really
didn't like them. It‟s like I can just smell that. There was something fishy in there.
Anyway, that's the kind of thing that can happened, but it's one of the anomalies of
this kind of a cross where it's very difficult to say, okay the 5/1 on the Cross of In-
carnation is going to bring out all of this. They will impact the people. And they will
impact other people with their transpersonal nature. So these are the kinds of Left
Angles who get recognized as Left Angles; it‟s quite strong.

The 5/2
LAC Incarnation 1
With a 5/2, most of the time it's „there's only this life.‟ They don‟t read esoteric ma-
terial. As a matter of fact, they don‟t want to know because the next life may be
worse. And that's really their thinking. “Hey, if I incarnate, if it's going to be like
this again and I'm going to be this stupid all over again and I got to start off as a
damn baby all over again. Oh, I don't want to be a teenager, I don't ever want to do
that again. No, no, no it’s not fair. I don’t want to deal with any of that.” Yeah,
they can be called to it.
These are the kind of people who wake up to their transpersonal nature because
they have such a shock experience with it. It's usually love; for the 5/2 it‟s usually
love. They meet somebody and they just can't get over this sense of, I know you,
and they think that's what love is. I want to warn people about allies—you never
know. As a transpersonal being there are lots of people I recognize, I tell you, but
don't misinterpret that as love; it's very dangerous. They will.

I have a great example of a 6/2 of this cross, my late friend, Jurgen, 24.6, Mr. In-
carnation. The day I met him I looked at him and I thought, “I‟ve known this guy so
long. I‟ve know this guy forever,” that kind of just wow because it was very deep
and he really didn't know. They rarely do, after all. It's very difficult with the 24.6
because they look the gift horse in the mouth. This is their Personality Sun; they are
very likely to just overlook the obvious. They're very likely to miss those moments
where there is really a chance to see the truth.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 1
A Digital Book for Students
One of the things that was obvious for me about somebody like that is that you can
see how misplaced he felt in the world. It wasn't like he enjoyed his incarnation.
Oh, there were aspects of life he loved. But I knew this man intimately for many,
many, many, many years and he was very dark. And in those dark moments, his
sense of the purposelessness of what life could be, the just having to be here just to
do it again. There was this level of it.
And again, there can be a lot of it. You're dealing with individuality; you‟re dealing
with the potential for melancholy, depression and all of those things. And the fact
that people who are on this cross don't benefit from the fact that they're on this
cross. They don't; others do. They‟re the ones who remind us that it's possible
because when we meet them, there is that, “Wow, I know you know.”
It reinforces for us this potential of coming to grips with the reincarnative process,
something that's essential for us. It‟s something that we need to grasp, we need to
understand and we need to understand mechanically. We need to see how that
works; we need to see the process. We are in the last phase of true knowing. We
need to know these things.
At the same time, for me when I look at my relationship with Jurgen, he was my first
colleague. I can see very clearly that we were able to bring together a new incarna-
tive form. You could see something new coming into the world mentally, being
brought into the world mentally. And of course, that's part of the magic of what
these beings can be. He couldn't have done it alone. There was nothing to translate
without me. But then again, in the nature of being, what could I have done without
him?
The magic of all of these things; and to really see that all of the forces in our lives,
when you begin to examine the way they interconnect with you, you really begin to
see not only is it choiceless and helpless, but we are not here to judge our relation-
ships. It's time for all of us to just realize that we've been in the grind for a very
long time, all of us, and what we are this life is what we were last life, and on and on
and on, and don't try to judge me on this life alone. Ultimately, I think that's going
to be one of the best statements. “Hey, stuff your criticism; you only know me in
this life. Come on; don‟t pick on me just because of this variation. Your last varia-
tion was really shitty.” And we‟re getting there.

mind, what am I going to do?” This is there, that‟s really frightening for them. It‟s

physical world, the world of gravity, the world of walls in front of you, and the world
of real things.
When you're a 6/3 on his cross and you're just all kind of fluttery and there's all this
mind stuff everywhere around you, and then you look over the hill, and it‟s like—do I
have to? The way you see this on the mundane level is these are people who every
once in awhile stand like this and say, “Do I have to get a job? Do I really have to?
Do I have to work?” And then they fall over the edge. Fortunately, they are 6/3s.
They go racing out of there after a couple of months and it‟s like, “I don’t want to do
that, I don’t want to be in there. It’s terrible down there. They’re all busy. I don’t
belong down there, I’m going to back up here, everything is nice up here”—you have
to get a job. “No, I haven’t finished this book yet.” How are we going to feed the
children? “I’m studying. You want to go down there? Not me.”
They have a really hard time. They scare the hell out of a lot of people. Remember,
everything that has to do with this gate, it really impacts other people. They scare
people. They‟re the ones that, you finally finish university, you have your degree
and they say to you, “Wait, you have to work now. It’s different. Wait until you see
how terrible that is. You should have studied tree surgery; you could be out in the
forest somewhere.” No, no, it‟s a real shock.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
We‟re going to begin with the 2nd gate. We‟re going to begin with The Receptive.
We‟re going to begin with one of the fundamental gates of Human Design. And it is
so because this is the place where the magnetic monopole resides. You can see this
in the name of the juxtaposition cross that being the Juxtaposition Cross of the
Driver. The 2nd gate we begin with the Sphinx. When you begin with the Sphinx
what you are talking about is something that comes into life to be a direction force.
That‟s what being a Sphinx is. Being a Sphinx is somebody that comes into this life
and basically they are a light pole at a street crossing. And not only do they go
green and yellow and red, they have pointing arrows. And this is what they're all
about. Some of the most interesting Sphinxes that I have met are ones that have
undefined G centers. They give everybody else direction and they‟re lost. And they
can‟t understand why they‟re lost and yet everybody comes to them and finds
direction.
When you're dealing with somebody who comes in with their personality Sun in the
2nd gate, direction is everything for them in this life. But more than that, to
understand that these people come into the world to work. It‟s very important to
see that. Everything about the 2/14 is that the 14th gate has a deep capacity to
energize a direction of work. Now, obviously it is the Generator that provides the
power for that. The thing to understand about the 2nd gate is that the 2nd gate is
always pointing us in a direction in which our energy can be transformed into
material. We live in a material world. It is very nice to come in the Quarter of
Civilization and your brain is humming. But thank goodness you have four other
arms of your cross, because otherwise you couldn‟t live in the world. This is the
concretization of life. This is bringing everything into form. And at the very, very
beginning of the way in which this Sphinx drives us in terms of Civilization is that
Civilization is based on the transformation of direction into material gain.
When you look at the earliest successful societies, the way in which they
demonstrated their success was that they built enormous monuments. And
enormous monuments that took the investment of huge amounts of energy—the
pyramids, whatever you want to look at. And it‟s something very important to
understand that this is a 2nd gate principle. Look at our world. You‟re in an
emerging country, and what do you do. You spend $1 billion building the tallest
building in the world. Put up your monument, this huge monument to the success of
your material direction. There is some guy in Africa who decided that he was going
to build the biggest mosque in the world. They had a laser beam that pointed all the
way to Mecca. Bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, this is what it‟s all about.
This is the 2nd gate. You don't build a civilization by carrying tents on your back.
So, the first thing about the Cross of the Sphinx is that when you're dealing with a
2nd gate Sphinx, what they can really point you at is a material direction. Most
people think because the open G center is about love and direction, that they get
carried away with the love part. Well, that's Vessel stuff. When you‟re dealing with
the Sphinx you‟re just dealing with direction, just direction. And this is material
direction. So everything is being pointed toward metamorphosis in the throat.

GATE 2
The Receptive
Everything is pointed towards the pressure of transforming what is energy and that
includes our thought processes, transforming them and concretizing them materially.
If you are going to look for the perfect guide, when you‟re like seven years old, you
reach your first Saturn quarter, and there's somebody who's a 2 in your life that
says, plastics. Forty years later you‟ve got it. There is a material direction for
everyone where their ability to filter energy is transformed into the appropriate
material. When I talk about people living out their mythology, basically what I'm
talking about is materialize it. We all have the mythological potential, but you have
to materialize your mythology, which means you have to fill out the detail. It‟s like
what a great actor does with a role. No matter how good the script is, if the actor
doesn't bringing depth to that performance, it doesn't matter that the words are
good that comes out of the actor‟s mouth.
It‟s one of the things about the materialization of the form principal is that the
articulation of your strategy—why you think I tell Generators to concentrate on this
sound of their sacral. This is materializing it. It is taking it out of the abstract and
it‟s concretizing it in the world. The other thing is the 2nd gate is deeply, deeply,
deeply mutative. It‟s mutated. And so it's very important to understand this deep
mutative quality.

The 1/3
So, let's begin with the 1/3. You begin with the 1/3; you know what a 1st line
personality is. This is somebody who has to investigate. They need to investigate
material direction. These are the kind of children that can be interested in—1/3s are
always at some level or another are going to be interested in how other people
succeed, because they understand making mistakes and failure.
The 1/3 child in this configuration isn't simply going to want to be a fireman. They‟re
going to want to know how much money a fireman makes. They‟re not just going to
be interested in being a football player. They‟re going to want to know how much a
football player makes. In other words, deep within them is a resonance to what is
the right material direction. One of the beautiful thing about the 1/3 is that if you
raise your 3rd line child correctly and they know that trial and error is their process
and they know that making mistakes is not actually making mistakes, it‟s research,
then you can have a child that develops with this ability to see that they need to
investigate and study these different material directions and experiment with them
themselves to finally find one that works. And that not all of them are going to be as
productive. And it's their job to find out which one is productive—I finally got all the
directions that are not productive.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
If you don't prepare a 1/3 on this cross, if you don't prepare them for failure, they're
going to assume that they can never find the material direction. And if they have an
undefined self, they're really going to suffer, because they‟re going to assume that
they can‟t truly give other people a beneficial direction, that they can't tell them
because they‟ve only made mistakes
and because they‟ve made mistakes
they've got problems with their 1st
line personality and its sense of
inferiority and its sense of insecurity.
And then you end up with somebody
who is deeply insecure about their
material direction in life.
You have to understand something,
you take a couple and they basically
have a fundamental attraction to
each other and they come together
and they begin to live their life
together. In the Western world, if
there is not enough material
resources, this is going to place
pressure of this relationship. Even if
the relationship is strong enough to
stay together, it is going to separate
them in ways that aren't natural. It
is going to drive them into different careers. It‟s going to open them up to different
ways, and there is always going to be problems in the inherent relationship. All of
this is about materialism.
If you have a lousy relationship and you have a lot of money, you can basically
survive it. There are certain things that aren‟t a bother anymore. But everything is a
bother when you're struggling on the material plane. And each and every one of us,
because each and every one of us have an arm of our crosses in this quarter, that
each and every one of us have to deal with our responsibilities on the material plane.
We have to. And it is about concretizing.
And if you're somebody that's coming in this quarter, that's what it's all about for
you. And this 1/3, if they make consistent mistakes and they are punished for those
mistakes they will never find their material direction. They just won‟t. Remember
that the right angle crosses explore the potential of the hexagram. That 1/3 is
exploring the potential of hexagram. And its trial and error is very, very important,
because after all it is the foundation profile. If the foundation profile falls into its
anarchy, then we don't have a productive way in which we can feed ourselves.
Look at this planet. Look at how many people, 3 billion people, one half of the
planet earn approximately a euro a day. Think about that. One half of this planet, 3
billion people, and you know that they've got problems with their drivers, their
material direction. This is not-self business.

The 1/4
RAC Sphinx 2
You go to the 1/4, as soon as you lose that 3 underneath everything's different. The
moment you have the 4 at the unconscious level, when you have it at the
unconscious level is that you have an unconscious need to get information out. It
makes it very difficult to be a 1/4 investigator. The 1 would like to investigate
whether the direction can bring fruition. But the 4 is always ready to make friends
and influence somebody else, even when the plans are only half made. So they end
up getting into situations where they put out this information about direction, but it's
too soon. It's too soon. They haven't done enough investigating.
And this is always the difficulty with the 1/4. The difficulty with the 1/4 is patience.
Its transpersonal unconscious doesn‟t really want to wait for the research to be
completed. Oh, we‟re going to build this wonderful extension to the house. And of
course, the possibility is that it never happens, it never happens because part of that
wasn‟t allowing the investigation to figure out how to make enough money to pay for
the extension to the house, because that's the underlying theme in Civilization.
You've got to be able to find a way to turn energy into matter, this basic principle.

The 2/4  1  7
RAC Sphinx 2
2nd line personalities are hermits. 2nd line personalities want to be left alone. 2nd line
personalities don't want to tell you where to go. As a matter of fact, a 2nd line
Sphinx, when you ask them for direction, they‟ll say, oh, ask Harry; they‟re very
democratic. You want to find out where to go and how to get this done, don‟t ask
me, ask Harry, because even though I know, I don't really know if I can explain it to
you because I don't know how I know where to tell you where to go, I just don‟t.
And this is the whole 2nd line dilemma.
And again, they have the same problem with the 4th line underneath. That 4th line
underneath is always ready to embrace the community and be influential by nature.
The 4 can't help itself. It always wants to influence. So, here when you're dealing
with a 2/4 and you‟re dealing with a 2/4 Sphinx, you know right away that you're not
going to get anything out of them unless you approach them. They're not going to
be there volunteering. And they themselves aren't necessarily going to be very good
at creating material. What they're very good at is depleting the material resources
of their parents, and then of their friends, and then of their whatever, and the banks,
and on and on and on and on. 2/4s with mortgages the size of the world, tapping
into other resources, because if they don't get the call—remember this is the
missionary—they‟re very good once they get the call they could become material
giants, in that sense, they can be very powerful in guiding people towards material

The 2/5  1  7
RAC Sphinx 2
2/5s are really very difficult because in the end anything having to do with a 2/5
polarity, whether it's a 5/2 or the 2/5, always has to do with, in the not-self, this
deep suffering from projection and disappointment because the expectations are not
fulfilled. And that 5/2s in and of themselves truly need to motivate themselves. It‟s
very difficult to motivate a 2/5.
All you can try to do is break down their 2nd personality barrier and hope that their
unconscious might tune into it through the harmony, maybe. Most 2/5s are very
reticent. This is the kind of person where you past them on the street and you ask
them for directions and the directions they‟re asking for is exactly where you're
going to and you shrug your shoulders. This is a classic 2/5; 2/5 direction—no, don‟t
know. They don't want to get involved, because the moment they get involved then
they have to go through this whole process of explaining it well enough so the
person gets there, because if the person doesn't get there then they get the whole
negative vibe coming back.
Aside from that, when you meet them on the street they‟re so paranoid when you
come up to them. They think that you're going to mug them or something, there's
almost this relief actually that you're asking them for a direction you want to give
them, because you don‟t want to end up walking with them, you don‟t what to have
anything to do with them. That‟s a typical 2/5.
So when you see a 2/5 and they come in on the Sphinx and you‟re waiting for them
to tell you how to become a millionaire, you're crazy, because the chances are they
are not going to do that. However, obviously there are real skills there. This is a
changing profile, it's a minority in the population, and it‟s a bridge. The 2/5 is a
bridge between the 2/4 and the 3/5, so it has a very important role.
When you're dealing with the not-self and you're dealing with not-self parents, to
have these kinds of configurations it‟s very difficult for you to be lucky enough that
you‟re treated correctly. After all, we're not talking about type here, and we're not
talking about what the actual characteristics in the design are, we‟re just looking at
an overview theme. So when you're dealing, generally speaking, with the 2/5 Cross
of the Sphinx, what you know is that when you meet them you think they could
direct you to precisely where you need to go. But whether they will or not depends
on how good you are at calling that out. This is really what it's all about, but they're
not naturally going to do that, they're not naturally going to be good at maintaining
their own material life simply because they will not really trust it.

opportunity. It‟s like a crisis suddenly brings out this—ah—this 5th line underneath.
I'm only available in times of crisis. Now I really know how to do this. So those are

speaking, this is not something that is going to flower in these beings.

The 3/5  1  7
RAC Sphinx 2
Here you have the 3 for the first time at the personality level. When you're dealing
with a 3 at the personality level, you have to see that this is a personality that thinks
it makes mistakes. This is a personality that knows it makes mistakes. This is a
personality that knows it fails. You have to recognize that about any 3rd line
personality. The 3/5 is always a difficult configuration. The 5 unconscious leads to
other people believing that in meeting them there is the projection that somehow
they're going to be of value to them. And yet, when a 3rd line personality, they‟re
bound to mess up, they‟re bound to disappoint the expectation of those that are
feeding off of the unconscious. 3/5s tend to have careers that collapse, tend to run
away from places, then to lose their reputation, tend to suffer deeply from what
people say about them in terms of their failed their failed process.
The only thing that heals 3/5s is first of all to understand the nature of being a 3.
This is absolute. I have noticed something about 3/5s. I think that they probably
represent the most profound potential investigators we have in the sense that I think
that the 3/5 profile is at the heart of what we call science. It's also what makes
science so dangers because of the nature of the 3rd line.
But it is something to understand about how profound the potential is in the 3/5.
That 5th line unconscious is a universalizing potential. That 3rd line personality has a
deep gift of recognizing those things that do not transform energy into matter, or do
not transform that energy into matter properly, or according to the expectation of
what it could do. They can be of enormous value, 3/5 Sphinxes, in guiding others.
But every 3/5 Sphinxes I've ever met every one of them, and there's so many of
them that I‟ve met, they are so messed up. And the ones that I know that are
Taureans, the ones that carry the 2nd gate version, their struggle with the material
plane is sad, this sense of failure, this sense that if you have a business and it goes
broke you're never going to be able to have a successful business.
I remember William Zeckendorf, a developer in New York City, and he wrote a
wonderful autobiography. He was the guy that built the United Nations building. He
wrote a wonderful autobiography about how he had been officially bankrupt three
times in his life. And he said it was wonderful. He said every time I was bankrupt I
was still worth as much money as when I wasn't. He said if you owe people millions
of dollars you‟re still rich. This is a classic 3rd line. And of course, in the end he
didn't die that way, he had his trip.

And one of the things you see about the 3/5 Sphinx is that with its first failure its
material direction is destroyed. If it doesn‟t make it the first time, and you know
what that's like, unless they understand their process the whole thing about a 3/5
Sphinx is that you don't just try one thing and it fails and you quit, you keep on
doing it until you find one that works. And every time doesn't work you learn
something and you apply it to the next level, because this is the 3/5 nature.
And along the way you learn things that are incredible. You learn easier ways to
transform energy into matter. And if you take that very simple sentence that I just
gave you, you find more ways to transform energy to matter. You're talking about
almost all of the basic principles of science involved. There are so many things that
can be discovered. And they are the ones that can really discover the most efficient
way, the most effective way, the most profitable way to transform energy into
matter, and most of them are useless. Most of them are busy trying to exactly the
opposite. They're collapsing the maya around them.

When you think about what it means to be a 3/6 here is the first example that we
have of somebody who has a profile that has a 6th line, they‟re going to go through
three phases in their life. You don't want to be a 3/3 for 28 years. To be a 3/3 for
28 years truly is a test. When they're lining them up in the bundle, they're saying
this one is good for the 3 work. I remember as a kid these wonderful clowns, you
would fill them up with air and you can punch them in the nose and they go back and
then they come back up like this and they knock them and they come back up. This
is my inner vision of the 3.
You can never really get them down. The most pessimistic martyr-ridden 3 is still
not going to give up. They will have given up on everything other than being a
pessimistic martyr. But they're still there, you could still step on them and they'll
still take it. It's amazing. It's amazing what the 3rd line will put up with. And of
course they are our explorers. They're the ones that survive the failures. I can't
imagine being a 3/3 because I wouldn‟t have made it. I'm not genetically designed
for that movie. I see that in 3s. It‟s like—whack, ok; whack, ok; whack, ok; whack,
ok.
If they‟re not raised properly and if they really think that‟s their problem, this is so
sad. It gives me such deep empathy for my son‟s who are 3s. It‟s so sad. It‟s like,
hey, no, no, no, you don‟t get it. This is really the most exciting job you can have in
incarnation. The most exciting job you can have is correcting the maya. That‟s what
3s are here for. 3s say, look, there‟s something wrong with maya, we have to fix it.
Now, they don‟t talk in that way, but that‟s basically what they‟re doing. This thing
in the maya doesn‟t work, let‟s rework that.
Basically, if you take all of the 3s in the 3 process on the planet, what you‟re getting
is a refinement of the maya. But if it‟s all not-self you‟re not getting that refinement,

because what‟s happening is that those pathways of energy to matter are being
maintained that should no longer be maintained because they‟re just wasting
resources. This is a vast, vast wasting of resources.
Now obviously, if you‟re a 3/6 and you come in and you‟re going to live a 3/3 in the
first cycle as somebody that is going to be a Sphinx, then you have to recognize that
there are going to be many, many false directions for you. And yet, at the same
time if your mother is there saying to you, there are going to be many, many false
directions for you it is all ok. It‟s all ok because the context is different. The context
is, find out, don‟t suffer, find out, and don‟t suffer. When something doesn‟t work
doesn‟t mean you‟re a victim. When something doesn‟t work it means you‟re
actually very smart because you know it doesn‟t work. It‟s really an advantage to
your consciousness.
Now, obviously it is a tremendous relief for any 3/6 to get up on the roof and to be
able to balance the 3rd line personality with a 6th line unconscious that creates a kind
of quantum field. It‟s what makes 3/6s and 6/3s interesting is that they‟re caught
between pessimism and optimism and they‟re neither. And this is the thing that I
talk about when they come off the roof after their Kiron, this potential for them to
live in a juxtaposed state. What happens on the roof is there is movement for
them—3/6, 6/3—there is movement for them back and forth between the pessimism
and the optimism, what I call them always being able to being to go up and down off
the roof no matter what time they are in their life. This ladder that is stapled to the
side of their body so they can jump down and jump back up.
The whole point of awakening for a 6th line being is that when they come off the roof,
they live in the juxtaposed state. Not this, not that; not pessimistic, not optimistic;
just it, themselves, as they are existentially in the moment, correct.

The 4/6 doesn‟t like being right angle. The 4/6 thinks it‟s left angle and they‟re not.
It‟s one of those things for the 4/6 to understand is that they‟re still involved in a
personal process despite what appears to be their genetic previous disposition to
only be interested in the other.
One of the things about this direction of the transformation of energy into matter,
this whole driving because this is the end of the Sphinx, it‟s the end of the right
angle that when you come to the end of the right angle everything about this
material path is determined very, very early and it's always a mistake, almost
always, because when you're dealing with a 4/6 they start off as a 4/3, so
thematically you know that where they're going to make the deepest errors are in
their associations. And 4s can only transform energy into matter with others.
One of the things about the influence of the 4 is that the 4 can “provide” the energy
that the community transforms into matter. They‟re the ones that can breathe out

part of what their process is. The material direction of 4/6s is often distorted in their
first 28 years because they get aligned to the wrong direction because they‟re not
operating correctly as themselves, that 4/3 stage is really going to be a mistake
because the 4/6 has to learn not simply how to make money, but who to make
money with, and who to make money off of. That is their learning process when

The Juxtaposition Cross of the Driver
 1  4
The 4/1
Juxtaposition always brings the potential for influence. Juxtaposition beings always
have the potential of being deeply influential because they are transference points.
They have a relationship to the left
and they have a relationship to the
right. And they act as a kind of
bridge for the movement of that
information. And yet at the same
time they‟re very, very, very fixed
in that sense. And they‟re very
fixed in this case, the Juxtaposition
Cross of the Driver, they‟re very
fixed on the direction itself for itself.
This is one of the things about
understanding the nature of the
right angle Sphinx, the nature of
the right angle Sphinx here with the
Sun in the 2nd gate it is going to be
deeply immersed in the maya.
After all, this is also a Taurus gate,
deeply immersed in the maya. And
that maya is all about not direction
for direction sake, but direction for
profit sake, direction for transformation sake, direction for metamorphic sake. But
when you get to the juxtaposition, it‟s just where to go. These are the people that
say Brazil's the answer. Okay, maybe Brazil is the answer, but what do you mean,
what are we going to do there? I don't know; all I know is that Brazil is the answer.
And you‟d be amazed at how many people are going, ok, let‟s go to Brazil, it‟s the
answer.

Years ago in the esoteric world there was this thing about that Brazil was going to be
the place. So there are all these loonies in the middle of the jungle who don't belong
there, living a life of dealing with mosquitoes, because there was somebody out
there who drove them there. The Driver: Brazil is the place.
Costa Rica is the place; Ibiza is the place. Ok; however, it doesn't mean they're
wrong. But this is not right angle anymore, this is not about everything is about
accomplishment. Everything is about getting to the net result. Remember that the
right angle crosses explore the potential of the hexagram. That 1/3 is exploring the
potential of hexagram and its trial and error is very, very important because after all
is the foundation profile. If the foundation profile falls into its anarchy, then we don't
have a productive way in which we can feed ourselves.
So, when you get to the juxtaposition you have to see it within its context. They
are the ones that can have a feel for where the places where things can happen. It‟s
not just the lunatic fringe that says, go to Brazil. It‟s somebody you‟re having a talk
with them and you say, there is a city next door, you should really go over there. I
have a friend over there, so forth and so on. It‟s the kind of thing where they point
you in the direction without pointing you in the transformation itself. It‟s just
driving, because you‟re getting to the left angle and the left angle doesn't do
research. The left angle tries to influence the other.
Please recognize something about the 4/1 is that if they don't have a solid
foundation they are going to have a point in their life that is going to be a great risk
for them. To be so fixed is really an illusion. This is something that can be seen at
the color level where we can understand that the way in which the color chain
operates to the line that the 4 is always something that has this capacity to shift and
to shift its attention, basically. When you're dealing with the 4/1, when you‟re
dealing with all juxtaposition, this shift of attention allows them to both remain
integrated to the right angle where they where they come from and integrate to the
left angle where they‟re going.
And basically what you're looking at in juxtaposition in the larger context is that
you‟re looking at this transference of the research to the marketing department,
because that's what it is. The right angle does the research and the left angle does
the propagandizing. This is the basic law of every hexagram.
So, when you're looking at the 4 it's neither research nor marketer, it's not. It‟s the
chain of command. It's a link in the chain. It‟s the link that brings things together.
So when you're dealing with the 4/1 you have to see always that depending on their
education, their culture, their advantages, the quality of their foundation is going to
be what they present and you can never touch where it comes from. In other words,
everything about the 4/1 is being able to be influential to anyone. Here you're
dealing with a 4/1 driver and as I told you in the introduction this driver is not going
to tell you how to make money. It‟s not going to guide you in a direction in which
you're going to understand how you transform the energy, it‟s simply going to point
you at a place.

The Left Angle Cross of Defiance 1
 1  4
The 5/1
The left angle tries to influence the other. And this is one of the most difficult of all
left angle crosses. This is the Left Angle Cross of Defiance. This is the Left Angle
Cross of Defiance when it comes to direction. These are people who don't give you
direction by telling you where to go
other than to go to hell. They teach
you also the potential of defying the
material direction that everyone
else.
The left angle, Defiance—God comes
and says if you're good I‟ll give you
whatever you like, Cross of Defiance
says, piss off. The devil comes and
says I‟ll give you all your dreams, all
you have to do is be nice to me,
Cross of Defiance says piss off. This
is the Cross of Defiance.
So, one of the first things to
recognize is that no matter how
many Sphinxes there are in the
world going, it‟s over there, it‟s over
there, you should do this, you
should do that, you should find it there and you should find it there, the very next
step is somebody saying, no. I love that about the program. And you can see the
deterioration. The right angle is saying, look, the whole thing is we have to find the
right direction so we can do the work and make the money and build our civilization.
And the juxtaposition says, ah, there must be places to live. The whole idea of
transforming things into the material suddenly is immediately moving away to—let‟s
looks for a nice place. I don‟t care about the work, let‟s go to the beach.

All of a sudden it‟s all shifted. And by the time you get the left angle, the left angle
is saying ah, they don‟t know. No. Defiance is something that's very, very
important. It's one of those essential things to realize is that defiance works in two
ways. One way it is you defy the order. In other words, the order is, this is the way
in which you transform your life. You go to school, you get an education, get a wife
or a husband, and you get a house. This is the way. And the Cross of Defiance
says, no, no, there must be another way.
Then you have those that are on the denial path themselves who finally can defy
even that go beyond that, literally. They‟re very important because what they do is
that they tell us is look this is a mutative process. Yes, we have to concretize, but
there aren‟t only the fixed ways that the Sphinx tells to concretize, there other ways.
And we have to be allowed to defy that order in order to find our unique path to
materialization. And that unique path to materialization is different.
The 5/1 is the only truly transpersonal propagandizing universalizing force. 5/2s are
buried and the 6s have another job. So the only real propaganda comes from the
5/1s. What to do. This is the way that it works. So when you're looking at Defiance,
the heresy here is you don‟t have to be married. Forget about that. You don‟t have
to have a career; you can do a little work here and little work there. And maybe we
go live by the beach or we go live in the jungle for awhile, whatever the case is.
Here is that heretic saying, no, no, no you don't have to do it that way. Now,
remember, that doesn't mean that's good. There are all kinds of heresies about the
way in which we should bring material into our lives. And there are all kinds of
people who want to tell you what kind of material lifestyle you should have and how
you get there. And every deviation from the norm is what you find coming out of the
mouth of the 5/1—there are other directions, you don't have to do that. This is
defiance.
And of course when it comes to making money in different ways, wow, are humans
ever cleverer, aren‟t they. This is because we don't just have these traditional right
angle ways to develop out of that whole research process. We have a left angle
saying, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute there‟s more. And all of this is a
mutative process, 2nd gate, all of is a mutative process to keep on expanding the
material paths.
Please understand, if you expand the material path you expand the language, you
expand the detail, you enrich the maya and make it denser. And that's the whole
point of this left angle. The heresy is not even an heresy, it's salesmanship. It‟s
saying, look, we need other ways to make money, we need other ways to bring in
energy, we need other ways to create our material, and we need other ways to build
things. And this is a way of getting more and more human beings into different
streams in order to make the maya more and more dense.

The 5/2
LAC Defiance 1
The 5/2 is the Buddha that refuses to be of service so that eventually he‟s killed,
murdered by those he refuses to be of service to. And it's one of those things to
understand about 5/2s; they are only going to be of service if they want to be. To
have a 5th line personality is difficult. The 5th line personality is very paranoid and
you can understand that the deepest paranoia is the threat of the material plane.
Oh, how paranoid people are about whether or not they're going to be able to make
it in this world, whether or not they're going to have enough on their plate. How
many students I deal with in my career who want to do something, but they don't
have the material resources to do it.
It‟s one of the things that drive people bananas on this planet. And when you're
dealing with a 5th line personality, because it has this natural paranoia it looks at this
whole process and it tries to find a practical way to do that. And a practical way that
is free of punishment. The 5/2 can be of enormous value if it is self-motivated.
Most 5/2s live private heresies. The 5/2 is the one that's been making a fortune in
the stock market for years, never told anybody, and when they die you find all these
stock certificates stuffed into their mattress. And remember that this only carries a
certain quality of direction. We're dealing with a left angle cross; we have a shift
that is taking place. We have the 17th and the 18th gate that are part of this cross.
It's different.

The 6/2  1  4
LAC Defiance 1
Whenever you get to the 6 you get to something that is outside of the process, the
one thing that you know about this 6th line is that the only thing that it‟s really
interested in is the 23rd hexagram, 1st line, because that‟s the very next hexagram.
Everything about the 6 is to understand that whenever you're looking at somebody
who has a 6 profile, the personality Sun, you look at the very next hexagram,
because that‟s where they‟re looking. They‟re not paying attention to what they are.
They‟re not like the 5th line involved in propagandizing. They are simply looking
ahead. This is transition. This is the nature of transition.
So here on the Cross of Defiance, the 6/2 is looking towards new explanations—the
23rd gate. It‟s much more interested in the new explanations because the new
explanations—the 43/23—is about efficiency; it‟s the channel of structuring. They are
looking for new ways, new structured ways, mutative ways in which we can
transform. One of the most important things for me as a heretic was to make sure
that anyone who took this heresy as their own would be able to support themselves
materially. It‟s one of the keys.

The Receptive
So, this 6/2, when you‟re looking at the 6/2 Cross of Defiance, what they‟re really
defining is all right, I know all this stuff already. What I‟m really interested in is
what‟s new, what new things can be worked with. And these are wonderful for being
able to point people towards processes, emerging sciences, and emerging directions;
the kind of people that can imagine the need for something and find it in a way, go
out there and create it out of new technologies, out of the new possibilities that we
have in our level of science.
But it‟s very important to understand that process in the 6th line being. Now,
obviously dealing with a 6 personality, they‟re going to have a 3rd line phase. They‟re
going to go through this same trial and error process and you can see that when
you‟re dealing with the 12 profiles, what you‟re dealing with is that you‟re dealing
with 6/3s, basically, because the 6/2 or the 4/6 have to live with a 3 phase anyway,
so basically half of all profiles have a 3rd line phase in the first Saturn cycle. And that
really tells you about mutation on this planet and change and transformation and
movement and chaos and discovery and all of the stuff that comes with it. But
remember, the 3rd line is the material line. And the 3rd line mind—I make money
from my mind. I have a material mind. I turn my mental structuring into you
paying fees.
And this is just the way that it works. This is the way in which everything about our
civilization and the way in which we achieve material works. The lower you go on
the material level; you see that material makes material. So you have physical
laborers. All they‟re doing is moving material. And the higher you go up in the
hierarchy you get to a point where concepts themselves become material. This is
the world we live now. This is the world where the individual mental capacity can be
the font for wealth. My greatest asset is my mind. I can sit down with a banker and
get credit for this mind. This is my asset. My asset isn‟t buildings and all these kind
of things. This is the change. And this is when you‟re higher up in that hierarchy of
being able to transform energy to matter. The lower you are, the more you‟re
simply involved in matter exchange.
So when you're dealing with a 6/2 and you‟re dealing with a 6/2 defiance, what it's
really doing is it‟s defy everything other than, hopefully there is that soul mate
opportunity, that magnificent possibility. Most of them never get to that, because
they never get to the necessary level of hopefulness and optimism to be able to see
it‟s possible.
How many great, great, great opportunities—remember that the 6th line is a line of
looking a gift horse in the mouth. How many 6th line beings in their first 28 years
have exactly what they need pass before their eyes and never see it, don't hear it,
don't notice because there's so busy defying the wrong things. They're so busy
making mistakes in their defiance, that they don't catch it when it's there. And by
the time they go up on the roof they are so distorted by the negativity of their
personal experience that it is so difficult for that optimism to emerge. And without
the optimism, without the deep recognition that everything that they‟ve seen that
doesn't work is pointing them towards a whole new process. Without that they‟re
never going to get there.

The 6/3
LAC Defiance 1
In the 6/3, as with the 3/6, you're dealing with a very difficult youth configuration.
In the new Uranian cycle it's so important that we understand that maturity begins in
your 40s. And every time that you look at somebody who is under 40 I want you to
imagine a teenager under 15. Now I‟m not suggesting or insulting anybody who's
35, I tell them to think about themselves as 12. I really want to see that relatively
speaking, in terms of the maturing process, it is the same. The 15-year-old is the
halfway point of old Saturn cycle, the pre-1781 cycle. We live in an 84 year cycle.
And in order for 3rd line beings really to be healthy their parents have to take the
pressure off them that in that first 28 or 29 years they have to establish their life,
they don‟t. They won‟t really know necessarily what the right career or person is
going to be for them in their life. They won‟t. They have to go through this trial and
error process. They have to learn these things. They have to see what doesn't work
for them so they can fine-tune their process. The moment you can give the 3rd line
child the benefit of the 6th line child with the 3rd line phase that you can give them
the benefit of that wisdom you‟re going to transform their lives, from the very
beginning, transform their lives.
Remember that the 6/3 is deeply, deeply, deeply fragile and mutative. It's very
similar in many ways to the 4/1 because the 6/3 goes to the 1/3 of the next
hexagram. It is the reverse bridge; not going from the right to the left, but the left
to the right. So, they‟re much involved with that other side.
I suggest to any of you that has a 6th line personality to look very carefully at the
wheel and see what the next hexagram is to your personality Sun. In astrology, the
use of the ascendant is actually quite brilliant. That is, the idea that there is
something that you're moving towards in your life. It's a something that you're

pointed towards that next hexagram in the same way. It‟s like, that's what it's all
about; new explanations, new structures, new efficiency and that‟s where I can make
my way in the world. That's the magic of that movement.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
I think of the 23 in the same way as I think of the 62 which we‟re also going to look
at and 56 which we‟re also going to look at because they‟re all in the throat. These
are the magical metamorphic gates for me. They‟re magical because they have what
appears to be an impossible task to be able to transform conceptualization into
concretization. In other words, to take an opinion, an insight or an idea and turn it
into words, and not only turn it into words, but turn it into language that is
transferable and understandable to the other. This is an incredible leap and it is at
the heart of what I'm trying to point you towards in understanding the nature of this
Quarter of Civilization. Because there's 11 throat gates amongst the 16 hexagrams
please recognize that everything they we‟re really looking at is this key of
understanding that our whole purpose is the transformation of energy into matter,
that‟s our whole purpose. It‟s why we breathe in oxygen; it‟s our whole purpose.
We‟re always in the building process. We‟re building up the health of ourselves all
the time, we‟re building it up. It‟s just building. It‟s concretizing all the time,
concretizing.
So, when you're looking at the 23rd gate, the 23rd gate does something very odd.
The 43rd gate is a gate that is purely acoustic. Insight is very funny because you
could call it in-hearing, instead of insight, because that‟s what it is. It‟s in-hearing.
It is an inner acoustic that has no sound but is audible. In other words, if it's inside
your head you hear it. But it's not a sound at all. It‟s just imagined as a sound. It‟s
magic, after all.
The moment you go from the 43 to the 23 all of a sudden, I know, I am one, all of a
sudden it becomes words. I don‟t know how they do that. This is like translation; I
don‟t know they do that. How you hear coming in one ear and you blow it out the
other end. I don‟t know how they do that. It‟s a miracle. It‟s the most incredible
thing about the metamorphic process, and it is the magic of our process.
In order for the Maya to exist we have to be able to do three things. We have to be
able to detail the maya and convince you that it‟s still going to be here tomorrow,
because it isn‟t here tomorrow. Now, that‟s quite something to grasp. It‟s like
people go on vacation and they leave their dog. Dog doesn't know you're going on
vacation, it can‟t grasp that. It can't grasp that tomorrow, no way. So, the first way
to maintain the maya is detail. And the detail is the maya is going to be here
tomorrow. The second way to maintain the maya is to pretend that it's always
existed. You know, this is the 56th gate. You pretend that there is history, you
pretend that there's a past. Hey, folks it's gone, what past. It's only the fact that we
keep on saying there was one. We keep on saying “yesterday.” As long as we keep
on saying “yesterday” and we really believe that yesterday is something that
happened, yesterday happened. The maya is very tricky.

And when you get to the middle of this and you get to the 23rd gate, the 23rd gate
says you; let me explain how deep this maya really is. It‟s so deep, let me explain
to you how this maya works. If you're good you go to heaven, if you‟re bad you go
to hell. And the moment you put that in the maya they‟re people nodding there
head. Hey, I hear that if you're good you go to heaven and if you‟re bad you go to
hell. And then you get people who tell you stories from the past—he went to hell.
And you think, gee, they‟ve gone to hell in the past, they‟re probably going to hell in
the future.
Oh, it‟s wonderful what the maya is. And of course, when you're dealing with the
23rd gate you‟re dealing with a freak show; genius to freak; but please start with the
freak. Knowing in the maya is not something substantiated by the collective. That's
why it has to be explaining. So the collective can get it. And the only way that the
maya grows is through the mutative quality of the 23rd gate. The maya is
expressed in its detail, it‟s remembered, but the growth of the maya is rooted in the
23rd gate, because the 23rd gate explains new things about the maya all the time.
We make it up all the time, every moment of every day were making up the maya
and concretizing it into something solid, all the time, every day.
I'm a great fan of Dirac. He was brilliant. He was the first guy that thought up the
neutrino. How brilliant. He thought it up. And then we discover that there's 3
trillion of them a second with mass that is going through everything all the time.
What a wonderful transference. From the concept, the imagination, suddenly it's
there in the maya. If Dirac had never told us, it‟s one of those things to understand
about the maya.

The 1/3
In this Right Angle Cross of Explanation you can see that is a cross configuration that
brings definition. This is the 43/23. Now, the 43/23 is always there with the
potential of its in-hearing to translate that into an explanation of some new way of
looking at, or understanding or dealing with the maya. And mostly it's about
efficiency in the maya. And remember that the explanation is not for nothing. It's
being explained so it can be concretized. It‟s the whole point.
Nothing better than being a 1st line on the Cross of Explanation, after all, as long as
you can be patient. And if you're 1/3, as long as you're not going to be damaged,
damaged with what you explained was nonsense, damaged with the whole mistake
process, damaged with the whole insecurity that rises out of the 1st line process.
Whenever you're dealing with a 1/3 you're dealing with such a fragile psyche.
You‟ve got a 1st line that is inherently insecure. You‟ve got a 3rd line that tends

towards martyrdom and victimization because it makes mistakes that everybody
expects shouldn‟t be there.
So, the moment you‟re dealing with 1/3s you have to recognize that if you don't help
them early, if you don‟t get the adults to immediately start understanding and
experimenting with their design, you
can't expect much in terms of what
they're going to bring to the
explanation of the maya and what
can be concretized out of that.
However, if they come to understand
what their nature is—that 1st line
theme of introspection, of
investigation—in order to find the
foundation to be solid, they can get
to a point of explanation.
And please understand something
about genius to freak. You‟re only a
freak when you tell something,
explain something to somebody and
they walk away going, I don't know
what that person just said. I don‟t
know what they mean; I don‟t know
what they're talking about. I don't
know why they told me. I don't
know. And everything about being able to move from the freak to the genius is all
about explanation. If you can explain a unique perception of the maya so that
somebody else can get it, everything is fine. So the explanation becomes a theme.
When we‟re dealing with these three gates, concretization is not in the form of a
house, a building, a community, a highway system. What we‟re talking about is the
transformation of concept into the language. You cannot build a civilization without
language. You cannot build complex forms without complex communication. You
cannot build complex forms with huge numbers of human beings integrated in all of
that without a very, very sophisticated language. Language is the essence of maya;
it is the essence of maya. Every word you speak is a form principle that becomes
part of the density of the maya. It's all maya. But the way in which the maya is
delivered in its purest form is verbally. These three gates are the whole story of the
maya. Again, when we're dealing with a 23 we're dealing with something that's
mutative.

When you‟re moving to that 1/4, that 1/4 has an unconscious that is going to be

themes to remember about the 1/4 configuration. It‟s much easier, in a sense, to

have a 1/4 child that‟s emotional—half of them will be—so that 1% of humanity will
be an emotional 1/4. And in dealing with an emotional 1/4 you can teach them
patience, and teaching them patience is wonderful because they need to have
enough time to investigate before their unconscious is called out to socially influence
others with what they investigated.
And again, the only problem that 1/4s really face is this terrible dilemma of knowing
something and not yet truly being able to explain it, and then being forces to bubble
it out before they're ready and have other people say “I don't know what you‟re
talking about and I don‟t know why you are telling me.” So this is one of the things
about the 1/4.
The other thing is the responsibility of the parent. As a parent with a 1/3 or a 1/4,
the responsibility is to be absolutely rigorously honest. Now, of course that's true of
all relationships between parents and children, but however, it really is the case with
the 1/3 and the 1/4. And the 1/4 for a particular reason, if you're a fundamentalist,
regardless of what branch of fundamentalism, if you‟re a fundamentalist and you
raise your 1/4 child to be a fundamentalist, it's going to be very, very difficult for
them in their life to ever be anything else.
As a matter of fact, to become something else would be an enormous trauma for
them. It‟s something to understand about them. They really need objective
parenting so at the unconscious level, that the foundation that is established for
them that they're going to bring out into the world that they are not constantly being
conditioned by a very narrow perspective. They need to investigate and they need
to be free to investigate.

The 2/4  43  4
RAC Explanation 2
I find 2/4s very interesting. Being a 5/1 I have a very strong harmonic relationship
with 2/4s—the 2 to my 5 and the 4 to my 1. What is always so interesting to me
about them is that when you're dealing with something like explanation, the whole
thing about the 2/4 on the Cross of the Explanation is that they know things and
they never tell anybody. And the whole thing about being a 2/4 is that there‟s
always going to be somebody in your life that knows that about you. They can smell
it, this ability to look into a 2 window. They say, I know you know something, I
know you know something. We‟ve heard that in so many conversations over the
years. You're with somebody and suddenly you get that sense that, hey I you know
you know something, tell me, tell me, and then they start and it‟s such an
embarrassment that you asked, because the most difficult thing in the world to do
for a 2 is to explain what's natural for them. It‟s like how do you do that.
So, the whole thing about the 2/4 Cross of Explanation is that they can be called.
And as they're going to operate correctly that call will come. And when it will come,
what they will discover is that they don't have to explain how they explain. They
don't have to. They can just explain. And as long as they do that they're going to

have a tremendous influence. The most difficult thing for the 2/4 is that the 2/4 has
this psychic dilemma of a personality that goes like this, and an unconscious that
goes like this—stay away from me, come over here; stay away from me, come over
here. So often there is a problem for them in terms of what is coming towards them.
Not everybody can call that out. This is one of those situations where in a group of
friends, because again you're dealing with a 4, there may be one friend that actually
gets to hear explanations from this person that really work and nobody else does.
But there are certain people they can call them out for the right explanation.
If you have a 2nd line personality child you have to recognize that their natural
tendency is to deplete resources. Their natural tendency is to allow you to provide
explanations, even though they know you're wrong, and just do so because they can
stay within your maya context and continue to receive the resources. It‟s the nature
of the 2/4. But the moment you call them, that's when their explanations can have
enormous influence in terms of their opportunism field, in terms of the people that
are going to be available to them.

The 2/5  43  4
RAC Explanation 2
I never expect much from 2/5s. The 2/5s that are in my life in Design are very
deep. They have very powerful natural gifts. But, it is very hard for them to find a
way to use them. The tendency of the personality is the tendency of the 2/4
personality. It‟s the same personality. You provide the explanations, I‟ll be very
democratic, you provide the explanations and that takes the burden off of me. It‟s
the same thing that I described to you with the direction. It's like even if you know
where to tell him where to go you just shrug your shoulders, why get involved. Why
get involved with all that and have to deal with all that and they have expectations
about me and I have to fulfill those expectations and then I've got to do this for
them and they‟re going to want another explanation, and where is all this going to
end. Who needs this?
So, when you're looking at the 2/5 explanation, don't expect any easy explanations
that are going to come just like that. As a matter of fact, the most disturbing about
a 2/5 is that you're sitting with them and they get up and they start doing something
and you have no idea what they're doing and they're not spending any time with
you, you have no idea what they're doing and they're not telling you, they do not
explain it. Ah, what are you doing, dear? And there is silence from the other end of
the house. They‟re actually making a nuclear device in the kitchen.
Even if you get to them, that‟s what is so frustrating, even if you get to them,
they're so damn paranoid at the unconscious level, even if you get to them, and
there is this sense of, okay yeah, I could explain this, but I don't want to tell them.
Only if they're really, really, really, really in trouble, if they're nearly dying, I‟ll
explain how they can survive, but I don't want anybody who is almost dying. I want
them right at the edge, and maybe in that time of crisis I‟ll bring my practical
knowledge to work if I can motivate myself to deal with the stink of somebody dying.

The 3/5  43  4
RAC Explanation 2
When the 3/5 on this cross can explain themselves, everybody benefits. One of the
most important additions to the maya comes from the 3rd line mentally. And when
you're dealing with the 3rd line mutatively—after all, I‟m a 43.3, 23.3, this is a highly
mutative material structuring. After all, I'm the one who screams I‟m not a
philosopher, I‟m a mechanic. This is material structuring; this is a mutative material
restructuring.
Now, remember something about the essence of the 3rd line. What the 3rd line is
going to find out, if it's healthy, is that it's going to find out not simply what the best
way to explain is, but the best way to mutatively explain, the new kind of
explanation, the explanation of the new. And the only way that you can explain the
new is by clearly explaining how the old doesn't work. This is the essential anarchy.
There's no point. There is no point for the 23.3 to explain anything new, unless it
can explain why it replaces something old. It‟s very important.
And of course, one of the difficulties with the 3/5 explanation is that they‟re ready to
explain the new, but they do not explain the old, because the only reason they‟re
into the new is because the old has punished them, and they don‟t want to think
about that anymore. The reason that they're looking for a new explanation is that
none of the old explanations worked. Now, that‟s an advantage in one side for the
other as mental authority going out as outer authority, but it's terrible for them on
the inside, because they don't use the value of what didn't work in order to establish
the value of what they‟re saying can.
In other words, they need to be able to explain the dysfunction; they need to be able
to explain failure. Oh, I'm really good at that. I will tell you how useless astrology
is. I'll tell you how useless throwing I‟Ching is. And not that that is a lack of respect
for those esoteric sciences, it is simply that it's my job to explain that what is new
structurally is better than what is old structurally and that this is just an evolutionary
movement. And if I cannot relate to its past I could never represent synthesis.
Now, remember what I said before about the 3/5 being the root of our scientific
investigation. Without 3/5s we do not move forward in the whole realm of what
science is. And the most important exponents of science are 3/5 explanation voices,
and they‟re all not-self, which doesn't help much. And yet, it‟s something to
understand that these are voices that fill up the maya with stuff; they just do. Once
upon a time, the scientists filled up the maya with ether. You ever meet an ether
you liked? The scientists will fill up the void and make the maya denser with all
kinds of concepts that don't necessarily come to fruition. And most scientific
explanations will fail if they do not operate in an evolutionary structure. In other
words, if they do not show what they‟re coming out of in order to show what they‟re
moving into.

3/5 scientists are the ones that speak the least, because it's so easy for them to lose
their reputation, it is so easy for them. And after investing nearly a decade in
education and servitude to institutions they're not about to make that mistake. So
what you end up with is that you only end up with certain 3/5s that are going to
actually do that and most of them are simply running away from failure and looking
for something that will work. Again, without the continuity it does not help
humanity.

The 3/6
RAC Explanation 2
The 3/6, again the process of the 3/3; in other words, I really understand what it is
to make mistakes in explanation. I spent most of my life as an atheistic nihilist. So I
know how off you can be as a 43/23 explaining the structure of things. You can
really be off. The grace that I see in the 3 is that there is a readiness to accept that
one has failed and it‟s okay. It was great learning process for me intellectually to
embrace and then let go of so many concepts that I had.
And again, that one of the things that we see about crosses in their relationship to
the maya is that we cannot expect real productivity until we get into at least the
post-Saturnian phase. I don't think anyone should be involved in organized scientific
research until they're into their post-Saturn phase. I think before that it should be
individual with tutors or mentors or whatever in order to be able to develop this trial
and error capacity, we would have many, many, many, many, many, many more
discoveries.

The 4/6
RAC Explanation 2
When you're dealing with a 4/6 no one has more potential influence than the 4/6.
And what the 4/6 is really good at is explaining what is new to the group. So you
have somebody in your group that knows a little bit about physics and there‟s
something new in physics. They‟re the ones that have the ability to be able to
explain it to you. It was like somebody gave me a card the other day, relativity, and
it was this wonderful example of when you sit with a beautiful girl for an hour time
passes very quickly. But when you sit on a stove and you‟re ass is burning time is
slow. They‟re very good at giving you those kinds of explanations.
They‟re very good at being able to take the complexities—remember this is
structuring. The 43/23 is not just a structuring, it‟s about efficiency. It‟s about
efficient structuring. And one of the things that the 4/6 is very good at, because
they‟re not studiers, the 4/6 isn‟t here to study. What they‟re really looking for is
the right platform that they can deliver.

The thing that they get is the opportunity in their circle to eventually come into
contact with that right platform and there they are with their 43/23 mutating that to
an explanation that‟s going to have impact over that very community. That‟s their
gift. And of course, we know that the real problem for the 4/6 is being a 4/3 for 29
years. You‟re going to spend 29 years with the potential that everything about your
material life and your capacity to be able to concretize is going to be determined by
the fact that you chose the wrong friends, that you have the wrong friends in your
life, that you have the wrong associations in your life.
What I like most of all is that if you‟re really, really going to change the world you
need a lot of 4/6s on this cross. They‟re very, very powerful beings. And when they
can become true examples of their influence, their ability to be able to explain is
something that has far greater power than my capacity to explain. This is not a
comparison of skills; remember that. This is simply about influence.
When you‟re dealing with the 4/6 you‟re dealing with the one that can really
influence the small unit, the tight unit into a whole new way of explanation, into a
whole new structure. Remember, this is the Quarter of Civilization. This is not about
saying, aha, here is a new explanation; let‟s add this to the concept library. No, no,
no, this is about how to efficiently transform the concept into a reality without
explanation. We can't build properly, the better the explanation, the better we build.
The more mutative the explanation, the more mutated our capacity to be able to
evolve in our technologies, in our medicine, in our services, in our communications,
in all of these things.
And the instrument of change on this planet is tribal. We all see that on the surface
globalization is truly a success for humanity. It's the first time that we‟ve been able
to integrate the planet, and be able to integrate the planet through what—money.
Globalization is about a global transformation of energy into matter, a global
transformation of concepts into material. And who resents this? The tribes; they
resent it. They resent the global intrusion that confuses people about their local
moralities, their local religions, their local this and that, their local way of doing
business, their local way of materializing things.
And the only force that's going to transform that are 4th line beings. Not by changing
the world, but by changing their group, their neighborhood, their community, their
tribe. So, when we're dealing with a 4/6 on the Cross of Explanation, the end of this
right angle process, that when the 4/6 realizes that they are here for themselves
only—remember they're tempted to a shift—when they recognize that they're just
here for themselves only, and in that they can reflect their example that‟s when they
can have the deepest influence on their community.
And to recognize something about the 4th line community, because we have a great
example of that, the 4th line community is no longer necessarily the community in
the four little houses in the same patch of ground somewhere. We have virtual
communities. We have virtual communities of specialized interests, and this is a
realm of expanded 4th line influence. So, the 4/6 explanation, they‟re very, very
important to us, but they're useless if they don't understand what it is to be 3rd line
for 28 years. It is useless if they don't have the patience to wait until they‟re on the

roof. Then they're not going to have those influences. And in terms of the not-self
obviously they're not going to get to live out the potential of their cross.
The 4th line of the 23 is really one of the keys in understanding all 4th line themes;
this is really the social gift of the 4th line being. That is, to be able to assimilate with
others and at the same time be mutative. This is the key to assimilation. It's not
about the negative aspect of assimilation in which the potential of diversity is
homogenized.
It‟s something to understand that this is one of the tricky aspects of what
individuality has to go through in order to have an effect on the tribe or an effect on
the collective. That the only way that it does that is in certain ways, that‟s why the
individuality has a 12/22. And we‟ll see the 12, again a throat gate, again part of
Civilization, we will see that these are tricks in order to get the mutative across. So
the friendliness of the 12/22 is an illusion, it‟s a mutative strategy. And the same
thing with assimilation, it is a mutative strategy. Now, I‟m not talking about the not-
self, I‟m talking about what its true potential is.

attention. I‟m a 43/23. It‟s very difficult, it is very difficult for me to hear what you
have to say, it's very difficult. I have to put all my attention to work to actually pay
attention to people. It‟s why as a teacher I never liked questions. I don‟t want to
deal with it.
When you're dealing with assimilation, when you're dealing with the juxtaposition,
you always have to remember juxtaposition is so much at the mercy of its
upbringing. What you're going to distribute as an influence is a foundation that you
took in through your conditioning in life. So many of the 4/1 explanation are people
that when you meet them they‟re still explaining stuff that was a mutation 300 years
ago. And that's the thing you find most common about 4/1s. On this juxtaposition
cross, rather than getting what the right angle brings, which is frightening variations,
the right angle in its exploration comes up with all of these different kinds of
explanations and all of a sudden. And instead of what we saw last time with this
moment in defiance, this is the opposite. You get to the juxtaposition here and it
says, hey, let's assimilate, let's all see that we have basic explanations that work for
all of us. Don't be afraid of that radical explanation, look, there are these basic
explanations that we can all live with.
And this is the way they hold groups together so their brains don‟t blow off. Yes,
yes, yes Einstein came along, but we can still be Newtonian in our village. It's still
going to work here at this relative level. We can still be Newtonian, it's okay. So,
one of the things you see with the juxtaposition here is that they are inherently
afraid of what's new. They would much rather explain what is tried and true, even if
the tried and true is bullshit. So you can‟t imagine the strength of a 4/1
fundamentalists, whatever. We should all go back and live in the 12th century, says
Osama.
You have a 1st line child make sure it‟s well educated. If you can‟t afford a great
education, do everything in your power to make sure that they‟re stimulated. But do
everything you can to open up the opportunities of investigation for them,
particularly the ones that have the 1 unconscious because they don't know that's a
gift. I don‟t know that was a gift of mine, with all my 1st lines. With the 1st line
unconscious, you don't know that. I never thought of myself as an investigator. I
thought of myself as a heretic. What‟s this investigating; this was my unconscious.
Please understand that if you're somebody is a 4/1 you don't think of yourself as
being investigator. You think of yourself as being an influential social being, or a
potentially influential social being, or at least a social being. But you‟re not down
there wallowing around in the 1 going which people should I be friendly with in order
to get my message across. What's the best way socially to bring this mutation into
their world, and so forth and so on?

The Left Angle Cross of Dedication 1
 43  29
The 5/1
When you're dealing with a left angle the only true expression of left angle
propaganda is the 5/1. So, the 5/1 is always going to take the brunt of the
expectations of whatever the hexagram can bring to others. One of the things to see
about the nature of dedication is that first of all, when you're looking at that you
have to see that you have a line
shift in the background, you have a
cross shift. We've moved from the
right angle to the left angle. So,
we've moved away from the
explanation of the 49 and the 4, and
we‟ve moved into the 30 and the 29.
In other words, the unconscious arm
is now the 30 and the 29, and that's
a totally different frequency. The 30
is about fates, the 29 is about the
commitment to the experiential way.
Both the 30 and the 29 are abstract
in their nature.
This quarter is never, never satisfied
with an idea. It‟s never satisfied
with the formula, it‟s never satisfied
with an explanation. This quarter
demands that it's transformed into
form, because if you don't turn it
into form it‟s useless. It's useless. So, when you get to Dedication you get to
something else. The dedication isn't about saying, all right, here is this new
explanation; let me explain it to you. It's about, how do you get this explanation
into form. And that‟s heretical. Therein lies the heresy. The heresy is: I am not
satisfied with the explanation. We must implement this explanation.
I‟m a classic 43/23, I have a revelation; yes, it‟s nice for me. It was interesting and
I'm a bright guy and it really opened up new horizons for me intellectually, it was a
wonderful experience. But it is clear to me that if it is a true mutation, explaining it
is not enough. It is my limitation; this is not my cross. It's my limitation, I‟m a
messenger. I do what I can to bring that message, but my dream is that it‟s
concretized in form. So, you're not given philosophy, but you're given mechanical
activities—follow your strategy and honor your authority and experiment with being
your design. This is what this is all about. The dedication of making sure that the
mutation takes hold.

So, the 5/1 heresy is get the mutation into the collective, because if you get it into
the collective it will live forever. Think about all the shit that‟s still around that the
collective carries. You get something into the collective maya; it is going to be
around forever, forever, forever. Look any New Age magazine it's horrifying.
Forever these things stay around, you can‟t get rid of them.
The 5th line is paranoid. We know it‟s paranoid. And that paranoia is based on not
knowing whether it really is capable of answering the demands of the other. And the
whole thing about the 5 is that if the 5 cannot handle the demands of the other it
collapses. It loses its power of attraction. Repulsion is the natural polarity; the
damage to reputation, and so forth and so on. You can't imagine—it‟s like a
dedicated on this cross, an astronomer who runs a UFO magazine. You can't
imagine how damaging that's been to their reputation in certain circles. They are
the idiot fringe. And the more they try to concretize it, the more there are those
who will do debunk them and will say they‟re frauds and fools and whatever. In
many cases it's true. After all, the fact that you're dedicated to materializing a new
concept doesn't mean you're right.
Like the doctor that was given a Nobel Prize in medicine because he invented how to
do frontal lobotomies by punching a pole up your nose; really, well, Nobel Prize, well,
thank you very much. Women would come in with menstrual depression and spend
the rest of their life in boxes going (sound). You can‟t imagine how many people
were brutalized by the tens of thousands. They haven‟t even taken it away. They
don‟t care that he‟s dead. He should be stripped of that and tried as a war criminal.
So, there is no guarantee that because you're putting your shoulder to the wheel,
that what you‟re concretizing is of great value to humanity, which is the risk of being
burned at the stake. There‟s nothing riskier than trying to concretize a mutation and
getting the collective to go along. You say to the collective, well look, one way that
we can release that pressure that you feel is that we drill in your head. There was a
very famous guy who used to hang out in Ibiza years ago. And it's literally what he
did to people; he used a dentist drill and drilled into their craniums. And they‟re all
going, let‟s try this. Whoa, I don‟t want some mad Dutchman drilling into my brain.
So you really have to see that there is a lot of freaks, after all; genius-to-freak. You
allow somebody to give you a freak structure; you‟re going to get what you deserve.
And there you are under the influence of the 29 going okay, okay, okay, and the 30,
fates, come along and say, idiot, you fool. Now, when it‟s magic, when it's correct,
these are beings that are honored in the end, because they're the ones that you say,
if not for them, if not for their determination. And you‟ll always notice that these
people are never given individual keynotes as a description—they brought such deep
understanding. It was their belief in their work that allowed them to help all of us.
It‟s like the collective takes it over immediately; immediately the individual is gone.
That‟s the process. Oh it‟s so seductive, but it‟s a 5th line theme after all. Seduction
is what it's all about. And the only way that you can seduce the collective into a new
possibility is that you have to demonstrate a reality. When I say to somebody that it
will take you seven years, and they think, yeah, well, okay. And then the meet
somebody who's been through the seven years; it‟s a totally different process. It is a

totally different resonance and frequency in their body, because a person who has
already experienced it has experienced it in the collective. It‟s a collective
experience. It is no longer new. There's nothing new under the Sun. It‟s collective.
It's now, oh yes; you can wake up this way. It‟s a totally different frequency.
If you‟re the messenger, nobody's ever heard it before. They‟re all thinking, what is
he talking about. What is this seven years, why does it work that way and what‟s it
going to feel like and what are the stages and how will I know. They‟re always
saying, well, how do I know. I say, wait and see; you‟ll get there. No sense telling
you now because I don't know. That's one of the deepest jokes about
transformation. I don't know what you become when you become yourself. I only
know you as not-self. I don't know what you become. I've already experienced
people becoming their true selves and I discover I can‟t stand them. What to do.
There is no guarantee; none whatsoever. We‟re all here to live out that special
uniqueness and some frequencies are not going to be comfortable. It‟s the way it
goes.

The 5/2  43  29
LAC Dedication 1
If you‟re going to bring something new into the world, if you‟re going to have a new
explanation about the way something works, then the only way you‟re going to be
able to do that is that you‟re going to have to call those. Remember something
about the 2 and the 5; the 2 is called, and the 5 calls. That‟s the job of the 5. Times
of crisis, practical provisions, you make the call. And the call is: Do this, because if
you do this then we‟re going to be able to substantiate it, but more than that, we‟re
sneaky, we‟re going to get it into the collective. You get it in the Solomon‟s world—
nothing new. It's not new anymore.
Human Design is not new anymore. It may be new to somebody who hasn‟t met it.
But it's not new anymore, it‟s in form and it‟s in the collective. And the moment it‟s
in the collective, the moment I was able to see the transference of this knowledge
into the collective one thing inside of me was a little bell that went off and said,
they‟re stuck with it now, hell with them. They are stuck with it now and they‟re
never going to get rid of it. You can try to marginalize it. You can do whatever you
like, but as long as it's in the collective, you‟re never going to get rid of it. There is
always going to be some nut somewhere that will dig it up and say, hey, he said this.
It‟s wonderful.
Whenever you‟re dealing with a 5/2, whenever you see a 5/2 imagine a Buddha in a
cave, always—don‟t ask me anything, I'm not interested in you, go away. Not only
that but the 5/2 Buddha is really messed up, Buddha anyway, but the 5/2 Buddha,
particularly. The problem with a 5/2 Buddha is that it has an unconscious that traps
it in a cave. And its personality is always thinking: They need me. And yet, it‟s
pulled back into this cave. And of course, eventually the villager shows the other
villagers and they all stand outside the cave, the Buddha tells them to go away,
eventually they drag the Buddha out and they kill him.

This is the whole thing about 5/2s, 5/2s have a deep fear that the village—you know
that wonderful scene in the early Frankenstein movies where the mob is coming and
they‟re going to tear down the house and they‟re going to find the monster and kill
it. This is the 5/2. Deep in its psyche there's this—I‟d better get more bolts on my
doors because they‟re going to come and kill me because I'm not dedicated to them.
Everybody has this assumption that the 5th line, because of the 5/1, that the 5th line
is there to serve them, regardless. We need you, you serve us now, and if don't,
you‟re going to get a bad reputation. No wonder they‟re paranoid. And then you
come to the 5/2, this is the ultimate paranoia. Their unconscious says, we don't
know what to do, we don‟t know what to do, we don‟t know what to do. So, it‟s like
when anybody comes, it‟s like, oh do I have a reason to be paranoid. We don‟t know
what to do, we don‟t know what to do, leave us alone. You think you see light; we
don‟t see the light.
Where they‟re dedicated is in secret—great black magicians, dedicated to their little
inner mysteries. I always describe the archetypal 5/2 women as a secretary. She
dresses so conservative that she's almost a time machine to another era, everything
is perfect, you don‟t know anything about her, she goes home at night, she rips off
all her clothes, she watches wild porno while she talks a strange language to her dog
while she‟s investigating some esoteric science, and nobody knows. And she is really
dedicated to all of that. And nobody knows. The next morning nobody sees
anything, nothing.
It‟s one of the things about 5/2s, the not-self 5/2 is one of the least available
resources we have. And recognize that they are binary, the 1 and the 2. It‟s nice
to have a 5/1 teacher. But there's a lot that the 5/2 teacher could add. This is one
of the things to understand, the difference between what it means to be an
investigator and what it means to be a natural. The 2nd line is a natural. It's not
about they need to understand the mechanism in order to provide a solution. The
solution is simply something that emerges, it appears, and it is simply there.
Somewhere inside of them that process is all worked out.
And this is the magic that they bring, because they bring a magic it isn't going to
follow the same linear, the same structural mechanics that investigation and
research bring. Whenever you see a natural—for me, it‟s the difference between
seeing somebody who grew up loving music and talk themselves to play, and
somebody who was trained to play. Now, they both can play well; that's not the
point. But there is frequency about them that is totally difference and there is so
much that you can learn from the natural. Don‟t ask them to teach you, it‟s
pointless. But you can learn from them. You can learn from them because they‟re
going to be able to do something that is rooted in a deep experience.

The 6/2
LAC Dedication 1
I have spent the last four or five years particularly focused on giving everyone an
understanding what the 6th line in a profile is all about, the fact is that you have to
go through these three stages. I‟ve been discussing this as we‟ve moved along this
morning. But there is really something to look at when you‟re dealing with the 6th
line beings, is that everything for them is a process until their Kiron. For the 6th line
being it's not enough that they manage to survive the first Saturn cycle and they get
up on the roof. Getting up on the roof is about a period in which they're trying to
find a balance to that first period. In other words, year by year, as they‟re on the
roof they begin to balance this process between what they went through in the 3rd
line phase to what's possible in the 6th line phase.
And everything about their processes is that if we could see that graphically, by the
time they get to be 50, 51 by the time they get to the Kiron, what they've done is
they've balance those two things out. Now, it‟s a faster process on the roof.
Basically what you're looking at on the roof is you're looking at about 22 years, 23
years, whereas, you‟re looking at 28, 29 years in that first 3rd line thematic process.
So it's a slightly faster process, but it's a balancing process. And whenever you're
thinking about being with somebody who has a 6th line profile, keep that in mind.
Remember that their whole life is about reaching a point of transcendent equilibrium.
This is the whole thematic of 6th line awakening. The 6th line awakening is this ability
to be able to find that point of equilibrium and then transcend it; in other words, the
juxtaposition of that, or the quantum of that. And of course, the quantum of that is
this has been a philosophical goal for millennia, because basically it can best be
expressed with the Zen expression: Neti, neti—not this, not that; not this, not that.
And of course, whenever you go to the root of any Eastern culture, you're going to
get to this grasp of the maya, to recognize that maya is this and that, and the
transcendence of the maya is that not so much that you're this or you‟re that, but
you're neither, but you're also. It's just one of those things to recognize.
So, when we're looking at the 6th line process recognize that the roof stage is an
equilibrium building stage. In other words, they‟re trying to balance the scales.
They‟re trying to raise optimism to the same level as pessimism. It‟s very difficult if
your first phase has being run in which you have operated deeply in the not-self, and
of course what you have is you got an overload of experiences that have not been of
value to you, experiences that you don't recognize have been a value to you. Most
of what you get out of that, because of the memory of the 3rd line system is that you
get the memory of only those pessimistic devastating dangerous uncomfortable
experiences, those things that hurt you, and those things that didn't work. And
every time you hit those places where things didn't work and they hurt you, you go
into this whole business of becoming the victim and the martyr.

It‟s very difficult for a 6th line being to begin this process of balancing without
understanding what their process is. I‟ve been able to see this in a very limited
number. I know three people who reached their seven-year cycle at their Saturn
return. And they‟re the only examples I have of what that difference can mean if
you're really clearly aware. If you talk to any of the three that I know—my daughter
is another one—if you talk to any of the three that I know they will tell you that this
is a very dark place regardless of your knowing. And it‟s a very uncomfortable
experience. That it can be very, very painful.
So you can see that even in those that are prepared, yes, being prepared helped
them to understand that they will get through to the other side. But the reality is
that it's a very dark, deep place, and imagine what that is for the not-self. There are
enough of you in here and out there who know how devastating that 3rd line cycle
can be. You just know. And what it takes to recover from that and how long it takes
to recover from that. So, when you‟re dealing with a not-self and you‟re dealing with
a 6th line personality, what you know clearly is that even when they get to the roof,
yes, there is some relief, but if they don't build to the point of equilibrium they're
going to have problems coming off that roof.
It's one of the most healing things that we do is we remind every 6th line being,
every 3rd line being what it means to be 3rd line and to exalt it. Exalt the 3rd line
process to let these people know what they have to do for their children who are 3rd
and 6th line, for them to truly understand this is absolutely essential. Because it‟s
only when we begin to change the psychology of the 3rd line and the psychology of
the parents of 3rd line children and 6th line with their theme of the 3rd line, are ever
going to have a real healthy change in the planet.
Remember something about the 6, particularly the 6/3; they go to the next
hexagram. They are the link in the continuity. We are totally dependent on them to
create viable chains. How many 6/3s do you trust to take you to the next
destination? So, when you're dealing with a 6/2 and you‟re dealing with a 6/2
dedication, one of the things about them is that you're going to see that they suffer
deeply at the hand of the fates. You don‟t want to see a 6/2 in their Saturn phase
where the fates come in and whip them, I mean, really brutal. And the dumb things
they say yes to. And they don‟t know any better, and boy do they suffer. And there
is their unconscious every time that happens going, let's quit. Let‟s find a way to
hide. Let's find a way to get lost. Let‟s drug ourselves. You name it, anything.
This 2nd line unconsciousness, this is a hermit, this is powerful barriers. This is the
natural unconscious who doesn't want to deal with all that. It's so difficult in that
3/2 phase to come up with explanations for oneself; why things screwed up because
the natural can't do that, the natural can‟t start investigating—why did you become a
drunk? It was the natural thing to do. It‟s not like they have an explanation; well,
my grandmother died and when she died she said to me, get drunk, that‟s how it all
started. They‟re just naturals, they'll take the natural way to avoid the pain, and
they learn right away and it hurts.
So, you lose an enormous amount of dedication. Now, what are they supposed to be
dedicated to? Look at the movement in the wheel. If you look at the moment you‟re

headed towards the 8th gate. The 6 up there is say, oh Jesus, we‟d better get this
together, because we're going to have to show everybody this. How do you show
them all this? Once you get somebody to experiment with it, how do you show
everybody else? How do you make it public, how do you get it out into the world?
Where do you advertise? How do you let them all know? I think have to think about
all that. If they're not correct then the chain doesn't work well. So what gets
showed off? Well, you can find them in on any street corner, except they‟re on a
very, very low roof; usually is a roof over the subway. They have Drano in one
hand. Ah, the things that can happen to human beings.
The 6/2 dedication is truly deep fools on the hill, unless they really have an
opportunity because what happens to them is that they become dedicated in the
most negative sense. Whatever it is that they want to hide from they find a negative
focus for that and become dedicated that, become dedicated to idiotic philosophies
or whatever the case may be. They become dedicated to something that just
narrows them away from anything else. But most of all, it is what their unconscious
does to them. The most difficult thing for a 6/2 is not actually the 6 process, but this
constant pulling of their unconscious, this constant pulling them away from
everything.
When they‟re born as a 6th line personality, think of themselves as a role model, as
an example, as ultimately a leader, and one of the ways to understand the
leadership of the 6th line is that it leads us to the next hexagram. If we don't get
lead to the next hexagram we break the chain of life. You can't break the chain of
life. So, in a hexagram, despite the fact that the 6 has nothing to do with the
hexagram itself, it links the hexagram to its potential, to its life forces. So if we
don't have 6th line beings, 6/2s, 6/3s that can operate correctly as themselves, we
never have a chain that works correctly.
The magic of what it is to recognize that the transformation of the whole is a vast
thing. It's vast; there are so many links along the way. And each and every one of
us is an example of those aspects in that progression. Every time that we can wake
up a 6th line profile, particularly a personality 6th line profile, we know that in a
certain way they are going to be able to provide essential bridges for others; those
that are going to be there on their fractal line, that are going to be there in their
geometry in this life.

You don't want to be a 6/3 on this cross and have dysfunctional parents and a 3rd

simply, I walk in the room and there's glass everywhere, my thing is, get out of the
way, there‟s glass all over the floor. I don‟t want him to step in the glass. But
there‟s no, you idiot, what‟s wrong with you.
My thing after something like that is, bouncing off walls in the kitchen is not cool,
while I'm scraping the glass off the floor. And his attitude towards my explanation is
kind of like, hey, if I hadn‟t done that and bounced into it I really wouldn't have seen
what happens, would I. And look at that that was really cool, it smashed
everywhere. As a matter of fact, if you‟d let me, I‟d smash them all, it‟s really fun.
And I really do know what happens when you whack into it. You have to see that it‟s
a totally different psyche. That‟s Newton. He wasn‟t going to suffer over the pain of
the apple. It wasn‟t like, ah, I‟m a victim again. I‟m going to get out of here. I‟m
not going to sit under trees anymore, they just knock me down.
It‟s the whole thing about understanding the perfection of the 3, the prevention of
the 3 is you‟re Spinoza and you're sitting in the window of your little place in
Amsterdam and you watch a tile slide off the roof and smack somebody on the head
and suddenly you begin to think, not about them bleeding, but suddenly you begin to
think about the nature of God, how does it work. This idiot was exactly in the right
place, exactly at the right time to have this thing slide onto his head. How clever
God is. This is a classic 3rd line.
This is just the way it works. And it‟s the magic of it. And of course we don't do
that, we don't nurture that in our 3rd line children. We smacked them. We tell them
to smarten up, to shape up, we tell them to get it right, and I‟m going to fix them.
Get it right or I‟m going to send you going to military school. Get it right or we‟re
going to send you to a convent, whatever it is. Get it right, stop making mistakes.
And every time you come home and they look at your school marks it‟s the kind of
thing that you have 99 they‟ll say, where is the 1.
I know that. I had personal experience with that. I have a 3rd line mind. I can
remember coming home, I was a clever boy, coming home with a high school report,
I think it was grade 10, and I think I had 700s and a couple of 98, 97's whatever;
that's from somebody who never studied, like I teach you. And I came home with
them I thought this will give me a few advantages. My father—what happened here?
I said, what are you talking about? He said, what happened here, this one, 98, what
went wrong? Are you nuts, man? You want me to start feeling bad about this now?
You‟ve got to be crazy. I have friends in school that want to kill me because they
know I smoke dope in the backyard and they don‟t know how I did this, they assume
that I'm the greatest cheat that ever lived, and you look at that and say, what‟s
wrong with this.
This is the 3rd line and this is what you deal with. I was blessed with a very powerful
ego; it saved me. But the reality is the 3rd line really gets punished. There is nobody
there patting it on the back when it does something good. They‟re so used to
screwing things up that when they‟re good they're expecting the worse. If you‟re the
parent of a 3rd line child and they manage to cross from the end of the room to the
other without anything being destroyed, you never give up alertness because you

know they have to come back. Well, so far so good. Let‟s see if they make it back
this way.
The 3/6 dedication, for them to get to a place of a quantum dedication is the goal of
all 6/3s. We want all the 6/3s of all the crosses to be able to walk on water. We
want them to be able to cross that bridge. We want them to be the bridge. We
expect them to be the bridge. We expect them to lie down across the chasm and we
will walk over their back. That‟s what they're here for. And until they're fulfilling that
role, we're not going to be able to transform the whole.
Again, it goes back to the underlying theme of the 3s, to be able to deal with what
the 3 experience is all about, how profound its impact is, how important it is for us to
nurture proper thinking. Remember that the psychology of humanity has been
shaped by Manifestors. And the Manifestors were able to rule until 1781. They were
able to rule by simply pulling everybody along, pointing everyone in a certain
direction. We don't have that anymore. That's not there.
And one of the things that we have to see is that when we're looking at working with
individuals, and particularly working with 3rd line individuals, the Manifestor‟s
propaganda was, follow me, this works. And so we end up with a psychology which
we‟re only looking for things that work. And embarrassment if we're a sucker and
we‟re involved with things that don't, so we don‟t tell anybody. We take it out of our
resume.
And the whole thing for the 6/3 is that there is no way for us to move forward until
they can eliminate what doesn‟t work. The bridge is a bridge of usefulness. And it is
a bridge of usefulness that is exampled by the very way in which the role model lives
in its life; not this, not that—an existential truth of itself. And then we can finally
create the proper change. Remember, the life force is not about stasis. As long as
we're not-self the bridges between the gates, and we‟re talking chemistry here, the
sequencing of things, as long as we're not-self the bridges between the gates are not
evolving.
What that means is that they're not evolving in terms of the consciousness field.
The consciousness field is dependent up these bridges awakening, opening up, in
that sense, and opening up at another level as we evolve in the diversity. Like the
neurons in the brain that expand in the development of the brain itself in the first
three years. We have to be able to get to a point of discernment when we cut back
on neural paths.
This is what the 6/3 is all about. It‟s there to provide us with efficient bridges. Not
that we have to take all of these themes that the hexagram is explored that do not
work. But those themes inherent in the hexagram that do work and you know they
work because the 6th line profile is the embodiment of that in their existential truth.
And that‟s how they bridge it, so that the natural bridging movement of the 6/3 here
is to step into the 8/1, to step into the Cross of Contagion.

Introduction
There is an old mythical story that says that our entire solar system is in Taurus.
The ancients believed that our entire solar system is in Taurus. And according to
that the actual position where the heart of that would be would be the 8th gate. It‟s
in the 8th gate that you have the star group that is known as the Pleiades who are
representatives of the cosmic yin, according to the old Theosophical people. They
were the polarity to the cosmic yang that could be found in the seven stars of the
wag in the Great Bear, the so-called Seven Rishes for the seven daughters or the
seven sisters or the seven wives that the Pleiades have been referred to. And the
Pleiades reside in the 8th gate.
The 8th gate has as deep a materializing principle as anything you can find in the
bodygraph, because the 8th gate represents the opportunity to be able to materialize
in form. Not an expression that is fundamentally linguistic and conceptual, but to
express in physical form. Now, obviously that it isn't something that is easy because
if you look at the 8/1 we're looking at a projector channel. In other words, we‟re
looking at a channel that in of itself is certainly not motorized and that ability to
present oneself physically in the world is something that's going to have to be
recognized and invited from the outside.
In looking at the Right Angle Crossing of Contagion recognize that contagion is a
very powerful force and a necessary force. It is not enough that we have those that
are going to be able to make the explanations and begin the process of the
experimentation of concretizing those new structures in form, the way the 23 would
do. Here at the 8 we are no longer pointed up to the ajna and the responsibility of
translating the ajna, we‟re pointed down towards the self, and the potential of
translating the true nature, direction and love of the being. And everything about
the 8th gate is about being able to make the spread and the use and the
development of forms contagious; in other words, to take that first experiment and
turning it into a household item, to turn into a basic requirement in life.

The 1/3
When we're dealing with the 1/3, if you are looking at the 8th gate, you‟re really
looking at something that is a core of holding together the mutative direction of the
whole. The 8th gate is a mutative direction of the whole in each and every one of
the examples that are there.

It is interesting because when you're dealing with the 8th gate you have to recognize
something about it. The 8th gate understands probably better than any individual
gate that the best thing you can do is plant a seed of mutation and move on. And
one of the things about the nature of contagion is that contagion is all about planting
some kind of infectious seed to find the thing that's going to turn on the others, to
keep on turning the energy into form.
We see that all the time in our modern lives with the way in which certain items
emerge out of nowhere—the hula hoop phenomena—they emerge out of nowhere
and all of a sudden everyone has to
have one. We‟ve seen that with the
household computer, the desktop
PC. Wherever we want to look, what
television was, what all of these
things had been in our recent
evolutionary experience of expansion
of form.
It's the cross of contagion that
makes these things irresistible.
That's what it's all about. It's about
creating irresistibility and the
irresistibility is interesting. The
polarity to the 8, that is, its
opposition is the 14. This is
fundamental energy resource for the
material direction of life. So, the
material direction of life has to be
expressed through the 8th gate. So,
there's enormous pressure on the 8th
gate to get that out and to get that out as a mutation. It's not enough just to be
able to do it; you‟ve got to make it interesting. So many artists, for example, have
the 8th gate in their design. It‟s not just getting it out, this is getting it out and
making other people want it, getting it out and turning other people on, getting out
your individual expression and seeing that that is contagious to others because they
want to be like you.
I always remember because I have young children, I've watched Jungle Book many
times, and I particularly love the part where the monkeys sing this wonderful song
about that they want to be like humans, I want to be like you, I‟ve always wanted to
be like you. The whole thing about contagion is contagion is that kind of seduction
to the monkeys of the world. Oh, good, I want to be like you. I want to be like you,
I want to be like you.
I can remember when nobody, nobody except the very, very poorest hard working
slogs wore jeans. I remember coming into a world where you didn‟t wear denim.
And I also remember a world that if you didn't wear denim there was something
wrong with you. How quickly that became contagion, how quickly you cannot
survive in the world without this bluish cotton on your body—contagion.

And you have to see that there was a whole collection of contagious beings walking
around in jeans in 1957 that turned people on—oh, I want to do that, too, and oh I
want to do that, too, oh, I want to be like that. I know it well. My Kiron cross is
contagion. It‟s interesting, what contagion is really, really about. And remember
that when you're looking at contagion you can never forget that it's a 30-29 as well.
Here is a contagion that says that you can do it, too. It‟s the fates that have brought
this to you, and isn‟t it delicious. And this is going to make you happier, richer,
smarter, faster, and cleaner, you name it, this is going to do it. It's all new and
improved.
This is the mantra of the 8—it's new and improved. It‟s better, it‟s more efficient.
You can't do without it, but I don't have to tell you because just as I walk through
the street you see it. Oh, gee, I want pants like that. I want a car like that. I want a
life like that. I want god like that. I want a doctor like that—contagion. And the real
contagion is that you actually make the maya denser. One hula hoop does not make
a maya. Ten million hula hoops and the maya is dense with hula hoopology. Good
thing I can articulate, because I could have gagged on that one.
Can you imagine what it's like to be 1/3 on the Cross of Contagion? Hey, I‟m going
to give you something wonderful; oh, my God, I gave you herpes. Oh, I‟m sorry; I
thought I was doing a much better job than that. You really have to understand the
whole thing about a 1/3, they can make a mistake; they can make the wrong thing
contagious.
This is where you see how much the 3rd line could save us a lot of grief. There's so
much contagion in the world because every form principle has its agent, we all know
that. Every form principle has its agents. And the moment that you have good,
solid 1/3s they‟re given a form principle, they check it out and find out that it's
useless, and instead of telling everybody that this is not something to get hooked on,
this is not something to give up your life for, this is not something to divorce your
dog for. Pay attention. I've been there. I've done that. This is terrible. Don‟t do
that. For every contagion there is anti-contagion. And we don‟t have enough of
that.
So, what we have is a lot of not-self crosses of contagion, 1/3s, and they're turning
you to pumping smack into your body, voting Republican, you name it, they‟re doing
their job. And the not-self contagion is a horror because they really have the power
to turn you on. They‟ve got this little yes mechanism; say yes, say yes. And they‟re
always the greatest salesman for the fates because they never really tell you what
the fates are. What they really say to you is this was your fate. Aren‟t you lucky
that today I can give you my disease, aren‟t you lucky. It‟s like this is your lucky
day. And the power of them is that the other person, at least for the moment,
assumes that it‟s their lucky day.
Now, if you accept contagion from a 1/3, you deserve everything you get. I have no
mercy for the not-self. Most of them are beyond redemption, and they're going to
find the most outrageous things contagious. I have met people that have been
turned on to things that I honestly in all of my no choiceness I gulp that in the

diversity there is such inanity in the world and there are people who are absorbed in
it. What to do. This is contagion.
And the most frightening thing about contagion when you see it from that not-self
perspective is that you begin to see how many things in the conceptual maya that
should never be concretized, get concretized. We all know what that like, you can
imagine many things, but all of us know most of them we‟re not going to do and
shouldn‟t do. It's okay to imagine them, but the concretization, that‟s something
somewhere inside of us we have a boundary that says, no, no, no, don‟t put that
concretely in the maya because you're going to get arrested. It's okay to think it,
there is no police in there yet, but the moment you concretize it, oh, boy.
So, all of us know that within our infrastructure. The whole thing about contagion
beings is that they don't know that. They‟re bringing the foundation to you. Their
investigation is contagious. You‟ll never know what I found out, I found out that if
you only eat blueberries for six years that your life is going to change. And the
power of this is that they'll go for it. And by the time the 1/3 finds out that eating all
those blueberries is nauseating, has created all kinds of vitamin deficiencies, and
they have all kinds of problems, they‟ll move on to the next thing, Cross of
Contagion, they‟ll move on to the next thing, they left behind a wake of blue stained
people.
And one of the things that frightens them is that they meet them later. You did this
to me. No, no I never had anything to do with that; that‟s not me. You can‟t
imagine how powerful contagion is because the contagion is that there is an energy
in you in which you really do want to do something with it, transform it. It‟s very
powerful. And if it‟s correct, it‟s beautiful, obviously.
How fast a tribe can lag behind if it doesn‟t follow the contagion of what‟s new? I
watched a special not too long ago of a small village in South Africa and they had
been given their first mobile phones. This was a documentary over a two-year
period of what happened to this society when they got mobile phones and how
different their life way. They stopped being an isolate rural village instantly. They
were able to make telephone calls to bring things in. They were able to negotiate
over long distances. They were able to do things that they had never been able to
do before and the whole village began to change. New infrastructure was added;
more telephones showed up, people began to buy things. New things came into the
village. The net result was that a road had to be repaired in order to make it better.
This contagion led to all kinds of things.
Some of the most wonderful work that‟s being done in the world is not those people
that collect money and give it away to the poor, but those who give them things that
can be put into form that they can work with that transforms their lives. There was
this wonderful guy in India who developed this very efficient machine to be able to
take cow dung and to be able to transform it into usable heat and energy. It
transformed huge swaths of population over night.
So when you look at this contribution, recognize how important this contagion is,
how important it is that it is correct so that it can become a virus, that it becomes

something that enters into the blood stream of the whole. My whole approach to
mutation is that. Design is a virus at that level. And it is a virus looking to be
constituted that when that virus goes into your body all of a sudden your mind
doesn‟t have authority any more. That‟s a great virus. And it concretizes
immediately.
This is the whole story. If it didn‟t do that, if it didn‟t concretize, then it could never
take hold as a mutation. And once it takes hold as a mutation, then you keep on
pushing the contagion because it keeps on moving. And contagion operates in
waves. The very, very, very, very last thing that the Voice said to me before it was
gone at the end of my eight day, the last thing it said was, “wait for the wave.” It‟s
the last thing it said—“wait for the wave.” Well, I understand the principle. I know
what it is to surf that wave. I know what it is to wait for the crest. I know that
motion.
And this is the whole thing about the nature of contagion. It‟s not that these people
are just immediately powerful, please understand that. They put an infection in.
They put a virus in. And you may be the only carrier that infects the next person.
Or they may be the carrier of what you passed on to them that infects the next one,
and on and on and on and on.

The 1/4
RAC Contagion 2
The 1/4 Cross of Contagion; your father is a neo-Nazi and you spend your whole life
trying to turn everybody on to being a neo-Nazi. You get a foundation, there it is,
there‟s your platform and out the door you go. Remember that when you're dealing
with 1/4s, when you‟re dealing with 4/1s, how they were raised, their education,
their culture are things that have an enormous influence on them because it's such a
fixed harmony.
At the deep unconscious level the 1/4 is going to take on the established platform
around it. And all it will do in terms of its 1st line investigation is that it will
investigate the tools that it needs to be contagious. It doesn't mean that it's truly
going to get down and investigate. Remember the difference between a 1/3 and a
1/4. You tell both the 1s a story. You say to them when you lose your tooth the
tooth fairy is going to come and the tooth fairy is going to put money under your
pillow. Now, the 1/3 child stays awake all night waiting for that damn fairy. And of
course, sometime during the night, there is momma sneaking into the room with a
quarter to sneak under the pillow case and there is the 1/3 pretending it's asleep and
it will never trust its mother again as long as it lives. Never, never—what kind of
bullshit is this; fairies? It‟s you; you‟re paying me for my lost teeth. Why couldn‟t
you tell me in the first place, I‟d pull them all out? Why do I have to wait to wake up
in the morning? What is this bullshit? Just give me the money. I‟ll count the teeth;
you put it in a glass.

You tell the 1/4 that the fairy is going to come; it goes to sleep very peacefully. I‟ll
check it out in the morning. That's how its 1 works. It wakes up in the morning,
looks under the pillow and there‟s a quarter. Hey, there‟s a tooth fairy, isn‟t that
nice, it works. And then they put the quarter in their pocket and they‟re happy. And
when they go to school that day they say to their best friend, hey, the tooth fairy
came last night. And the friend says there‟s no tooth fairy. No, no, it really works. I
pulled my tooth out and put it under the pillow case and I got money in the morning.
Then the 1/3 kid comes by and says, you idiot, it‟s your mother, you fool. They
don‟t listen. They don‟t want to listen. That would be very confusing. They‟d have
to stay up all night. They don‟t want to stay up all night. That‟s not their trip. It‟s
not their concern. As a matter of fact, you could tell them a hundred times and when
they‟re married and have kids, guess what they‟re going to do. Now, when you lose
your tooth the tooth fairy is going to come and put a quarter—well, inflation—put 50
cents under your pillow.
So, think about what that means in terms of what they carry as their interpretive
intellectual tools into the world around them, they absorb the platform they grow up
in. And it‟s very, very difficult for them to shed that, because it‟s not their genetic
predisposition to do so. It‟s their genetic predisposition to trust their platform;
they‟re not 1/3s. So, if you‟re the parent of a 4th line child, pay attention. You have
to recognize that when you start giving your opinion or your prejudices or whatever,
it‟s not like you don‟t have to do that, but it‟s also like you have to put that in
perspective for your child. This is what I feel. This is what I think. Other people
think differently.
It‟s like with my children. When my children ask me about Jesus, Mohammed,
whatever, I don‟t lay my Human Design trip on them. I just explain to them that
some people think that this is whatever and that they did whatever. That‟s not what
I think. But other people think so. I have 1/3 children; I can‟t lie to them. The
moment that I lie to them they‟ll never trust me in this life. So when they ask me a
question like that I try to answer their questions objectively.
When a 1/4 that‟s even more important, because it‟s not so much their relationship
to you as a parent, they‟re going to believe you. They‟re going to believe you even
when others try to get them to doubt you. And so what you have to see is that the
parent then has to be truly objective in the way in which they present their slant on
life. We well know that not all parents are truly willing to do that. Parents assume
that they own their children and their children better understand things the way they
do. And if you have a parent that has all kinds of social, political slants that are very
extreme, it‟s not like they‟re going to say to their child, well, this is only what I feel.
And of course, this is most important thing when you‟re dealing a 1/4 or a 4/1 they
need to have that objectivity in their life.

The 2/4 RAC Contagion 2
Beware of waking up these tigers. I have a real harmonic relationship to the 2/4.
And as a 5/1 Clarion I understand that the 2/4 is much more powerful than any 5/1.
They are really, really powerful beings. But they‟re only powerful if they‟re called.
They really have to be called. And we know the archetype of the 2/4, the archetype
of the 2/4 is that they are called to the extreme. In other words, you have
somebody who is a blazing alcoholic, they‟re a 2/4, they get the call, and you‟d
better not drink around them because they‟ll be a tiger at your throat until you
understand how bad a thing you're doing to yourself.
If you‟re a 2/4, two-pack-a-day smoker and you get the call you‟re the most
nauseating son of a bitch that ever lived when it comes to anybody else smoking.
You‟re overwhelming. And not only are you overwhelming, but you‟re powerful
because of your ability to be able to influence your community, influence those
around you. There‟s nothing more powerful than the 2/4 when it's called.
When you put the 2/4 on this cross, Cross of Contagion, wow; the moment you can
get them to answer the call, they have an enormous contagious force because they
are able to be the sinner that becomes the saint. Wow, is that powerful. St.
Augustine made a living off of that. Oh, I used to be profligate and was raised by
whores. And then he said, ah yes, but then Jesus came. Wow.
There‟s nothing more powerful. All of our spiritual archetypes—I'm a good
example—all of our spiritual architects, me the atheistic nihilist turning out to be
some kind of fuzzy—the whole world together as one. It‟s like what happened to
me. This is what happens. There‟s this incredible whoosh to the other side. So you
never really know what to expect from them. You never get a hint in the not-self
non-called stage what the 2/4 can be as a force.
From the surface when you look at their lives, nothing seems to change. If you go
into a 2/4s house, you visit them, you come back 10 years later everything is where
it was 10 years ago. There might be minor upgrades, but they‟re minor upgrades.
You could be a blind person and come back there and you don‟t need your stick. You
never notice this with them until they get the call. When they get the call they burn
the house down. They‟re out in there in the world turning everybody on; the magic
of it.
It is about contagion, and one of the things to recognize about the 2/4 is that it is
very difficult to get rid of what they put in you. Contagion is really a chemistry. So,
it‟s something to keep in mind. I'm not telling you to wake up 4s just for their sake.
Let‟s do that for our sake. It's time that what was contagious is valuable. This is the
whole point about correctness. When you're dealing with somebody on the right
angle variation of this cross and they are correct, this is a very, very profound and

powerful influence in the world. And whenever you're dealing with a cross that
contains one of the role gates, this is archetypal. That is, the 8th gate is archetypal.
This moment of the 1 to the 8 is one of the fundamental expressions of humanity.
This is the mutated contagion. This is the gift of being able to turn people on for
good or for bad, for right or for wrong. There are these wonderful scenes in these
desert movies in the 40‟s when the Foreign Legion would take out their swords and
they‟d draw this line in the sand and everybody knows that if they cross the line
they‟re going to die. They‟re all told if you cross this line, blah, blah, blah. And
everybody is looking at each other and nobody moves and there is always one, this
jerk. All of these guys could have stayed in the cafés and drank coffee. They were
asked to volunteer, they didn‟t have to, and they‟re going to die.
And there is the Cross of Contagion stepping across the line. And the moment he
steps across the line, all the others start stepping across the line—serial killer, mass
murderer—and in those movies he‟s the big hero. And when you see him die you
cry. The son of the bitch took all the others with him, and they blame the enemy for
those deaths. And they knew the enemy; the enemy was within them, that Cross of
Contagion; oh, it's a good idea to die this way. And the moment they do that the
energy goes out, it‟s contagious—oh, I feel like dying. What a joke.

The 2/5
RAC Contagion 2
The 2/5 Cross of Contagion, sometimes it is good that hide in the cave because when
they come out they make a lot of people sick. You can feel 2/5 contagion energy in
what people call the back-to-nature movement, the back-to-simpler-times
movement, let‟s be a Quaker, let‟s be a 12th century Moslem, let's go back to simpler
times. And this is movement back to simpler times is another kind of contagion.
And it is the paranoia of the 2/5 that where we are going is killing us.
This is the whole not-self principle. The whole not-self principal is humanity is sick,
we‟re destroying the Earth, we‟re going to get what we deserve, we‟re killing the
planet, we‟re killing other animals, we‟re doing this, and it‟s all bad. Let's destroy
technology. Let‟s all becoming the uni-bomber. Let‟s blow up scientists hands, let's
turn off the Internet, let‟s close down the television stations, and let‟s go back to a
simpler way of life.
This is a typical not-self 2/5 contagion philosophy, because they don't want to
demonstrate anything. These are the kind of people that see something and they
realize that everybody is going to be turned on by it and they‟re suddenly very
snotty about it. Well, I have my typewriter, what do I need a computer for? And I
don't know why people need that. I have my typewriter; I‟m a typewriter person, or
I‟m a pen person. That was me. I write with pen and ink, what am I going to do
with one of these machines?

So, one of the things to recognize about the 2/5 is that the 2/5 has a very, very
interesting responsibility, because if it's correct, its real heresy is that not everything
that is part of the contagion field is for everyone, it‟s what they can teach you. One
of the things that we see is that the moment there is a fad—I learned this with
drugs. The late Tim Leary told us all to turn on, turn in and drop out. Well, there
are millions of us that turned on; there were some millions of us that tuned in.
There was a hell of them that turned off. It wasn't a contagion that was for
everyone.
And again, one of the real heresies, the deepest heresy, what I represent as a
heretic is that there is only one authority, and it is not God; it's you. There is only
one authority, not God, not government, not lover, not child, not anything. There is
only one authority and it's you. It's the greatest heresy of all. And one of the most
important things in the realm of contagion, because mutation works that way, is
discernment. And the natural gift of a 2/5 when it's correct is to be able to
universalize contagion discernment. In other words, there‟s something that will
really turn you on, but it's not for you. You stay away from that even though that's
attractive.
In other words, the 2/5 understands the underlying seduction inherent in the energy
of contagion. Now, most 2/5s are not correct, the vast, vast, vast, vast, vast
majority of them. So what you have is a revulsion with contagion as a general field,
trying to turn people off to all of these different things that keep popping up. And by
the way, it lays the foundation for the great struggle that we‟re involved in, the
struggle between the future and the past. The struggle is concretized in our world
today between fundamentalist radicalism, and I don't just mean Islamic, and
globalization, these two forces.
And again that victory is not one with the collective. The collective is already one on
the money level. But the tribe is to be transformed and contagion is the way. And
remember that this not intellectual contagion, this is not sexual, pair bonding
contagion, this is not mutative contagion. What you're looking at here is contagion
that is there to put things into form.
When I was a kid growing up in Montréal I watched the city grow. It was
extraordinary to see the way houses started to be cut like cookie cutters; the
suburbia development, the whole process of all this, the contagion of certain kinds of
design structures. There are people that live in identical houses, thousands of them.
Have you ever seen pictures from helicopters? It‟s so spooky. Now, some of that is
penta. But so much of that is the contagion, to be turned on. Every year, if you
look at the way things are—cars, you try to turn them on, you bring out a new style,
you bring out a new gimmick, and you bring out a new something, all of that is the
contagion business.

The 3/5
RAC Contagion 2
It's important to realize that there are a lot of natural contagion forces out there.
There are a lot of people that carry this cross. One of the things about the 3/5 is its
ability to be able to be caught up in contagion and its tendency then to change it. So
for example, in my experience I've had the experience of dealing with the 3/5 in
which you've turned them on and the moment you turn them on through their trial
and error process they immediately start looking for something they can discover.
Now, there's both the correct discovery and the artificial discovery.
When you're dealing with the not-self, the first thing to recognize about the nature of
the 3/5 is that the moment that the 3/5 is turned on to anything they‟re
automatically going to find out how much of it is truly functional. And of course, one
of the things at all 3/5s deal with is is that they're constantly being turned on by
things that slowly they get turned off by. But it‟s not that they walk away from
them. The way they get it turned off from them is they actually change it, the 3rd
line theme. They try to find ways to make money out of it, they try to find ways to
adapt it to whatever their needs happened be, they work with all these kinds of
configurations.
They have enormous difficulty as not-self being a contagious force for others. As a
matter of fact, the only way they're contagious—if you're a teenager growing up and
you have a bunch of friends and one of your friends is a 3/5, what you‟ll hear your
mother say is don't do what he's doing, don't do what she is doing, don't be like that.
In other words, don't get caught in that contagion.
All 3/5s have to deal with the fact that just about everybody that they're ever going
to deal with in their life, who never really gets to know them, is always expecting
them at some level or another to bring hope and then frustration. All 3/5s deal with
that. You walk up to a 3/5, you step in the aura, you immediately assume that
they're going to be the saint and the savior, and then you feel their personality. And
their personality tells you maybe—and everything begins to break down at that
point.
Nobody really appreciates how important the discovery capacity is of the 3/5. And
you can tell that they‟re dense. So many times they thought that they were going to
discover something and they didn‟t, so many times in their life, because after all,
they are the 3/5. Their unconscious is saying there are practical solutions, there are
things that make a difference, and there are things that can be universalized. And
their personality is say, yes, let‟s try. And then it doesn't. So you put out a survey
and you say to a 3/5 put in your data here, it‟s going to be interesting, you‟re going
to see the results, and you‟re going to discover something. They don't show up.
And you can‟t imagine how much of a problem that is for humanity as a whole than
3/5 contagions don't show up. They don't show up and they don't tell us what's to

be discovered in all of that, because they‟re going to be able to tell us right away the
value of the contagion relative to their trial and error discovery of it. It‟s these kinds
of people that understand the potential and the value of any trend. The moment
they sample it they‟re immediately going to put it through the 3rd process.
The 3rd line personality has a gift of finding out if there's something wrong. If there‟s
anything that is going to go wrong they‟re going to find it out. They‟re the kind of
people that while, when the hula hoop—I used to hula hoop because I was so
bizarre—when there are all these people using the hula hoop there‟s some 3/5
somewhere that discovers that it‟s destroying all their hips. And all these girls who
were practicing the hula hoop as babies can't get babies through the uterus
anymore. I made that up. But maybe it‟s true. You never know.
Nonetheless, when you're dealing with a 3/5 you have to understand what they're
for. They‟re the ones that have the gift of discovering something that can be of
universal value. And when it comes to contagion, they can recognize not only what
the best contagion is, but they can recognize those contagions that can impact every
one. I love it when 3/5s come to Design, it doesn't matter what cross they‟re on, it
is their role in this life to be able to step into the logic of this knowledge. And it's
their role in his life to find out whether it works or not.
They are the best ambassadors, 3rd line beings are the best ambassadors of Human
Design. They‟re the ones who can always tell you, I know, I've tried everything; I
know the bullshit in just about everything I've tried. Here is something that seems
to work. And as a 3rd line they‟re never going to say it absolutely does. They‟re 3rd
line. This one seems to be holding up so far, and they‟ll say that until they die that
this seems to be holding up so far, which is the way it should be with logic—so far so
good, so far it's holding up.
This is their magic. Again, it goes back to the parenting. It goes back to the very
basics. It goes back to how you raise your 3rd line children. It just does. As long as
they see that when things go wrong it is not the end of the world. Life goes on. You
don't start beating them. You just remind them that it would be nice if you paid
attention and in the meanwhile the table is enjoying your Nestea.
Anyway, it is all the way in which we raise our 3rd line children. If we raise them
correctly, I think those beings in my life in Design who are 3rd line beings I think is
one of the most beautiful things I've ever shared with them and I see the results of
that. I see the 3rd line beings in my life who understand this knowledge who just
move through their trial and error. And they‟re not to carrying scars anymore;
they‟re not carrying the wound to failure. This is the whole thing. You don't want to
be scarred. You‟re bulletproof, unbreakable, and untouchable; this is the thing for a
3rd line to recognize. It‟s such a powerful force. You can knock it down; it bounces
up, and knocks it down again. It doesn't need to be scarred. These are incredible
forces.
The moment that they‟re operating correctly then they can do their job. If you‟re a
3/5 Contagion, you‟ve got a job to do. And one of the most important jobs you have
is your real ability to be able to point out what things that are contagious are falsely

The 3/6
RAC Contagion 2
I‟d like to say something nice about 3/6s, but I can‟t, not right now. Not when it
comes to the 3/6 contagion. I consider every 3 and 6 combination that I meet that
can be transformed as my great victories in life. Not just for them, because it makes
an enormous difference in their lives, but to really see how clearly disadvantaged
this kind of configuration is. And also to realize that because each and every one of
us mythologically have so much power, the differentiated human being has so much
power, the differentiate human being on the Cross of Contagion is going to seduce, is
going to bring others into that contagion regardless.
And by the way, it doesn‟t mean you do it consciously. It doesn‟t mean you‟re
standing around and saying isn‟t this cool. You are a contagious force. You‟re the
kind of person that when somebody says what did you do this past weekend, you
say, I was doing lung dancing—I don‟t know what lung dancing is. I guess you put
machines into your body; whatever it is. That other person is going to walk away
saying, I want to do that, too. It‟s really insane. They don‟t know why they want to
do that, too.
I remember years ago here, there was somebody who set up a shop where they did
enemas for you. All of a sudden it became contagion. It was the funniest thing to
watch. I had friends of mine, they were telling me where they were going and I
said, “You‟re doing what?” Well, it‟s the latest thing. I said if the latest thing is
taking your liver out of your body and throwing it up in the air are you going to do
that, too? If somebody came up with that technique, yes, they would. Oh, it‟s
frightening. I had such a laugh. All of these people getting all of this old shit
pouring out their bodies—on the line of contagion.
Human beings, you have no idea how powerful you are, each and every one of you
on your cross with your chemistry. And all those beings out there in your life that
have open receptors to what you are. Everything about Design tends to be from the
perspective inward out so we tend to look at conditioning as always something we‟re
always dealing with as outside forces, but remember, to others we‟re the outside
force. We‟re the conditioning agency. We‟re the ones that are doing that. If you‟re
living your life on junk and you‟re on the Cross of Contagion and you‟re a 3/5, you‟re
going to turn a lot of people onto heroin. You just will.
So, when you‟re thinking about a 3/6 on this cross, blessed are the parents because
they‟re the only ones that can really make a difference, because contagion works
different ways. It‟s not just a one-ways street. It‟s not just about making others
contagious. If you‟re a 3rd line being it‟s a trial and error process, you get turned on
by things that then you can turn on others to. And you‟re open to all of that. And
the problem with all 3rd lines is that they do not know how to discern. Third lines are

not taught that. It‟s not naturally in their chemistry. It‟s not like they say, maybe I
shouldn‟t do this. If they were like that, we would discover nothing. The very thing
that leads them to be victimized is the very thing that the program needs in order for
discoverer to unfold so they don‟t discern, they leap in.
That‟s why we need to teach human beings about strategy and authority so what
they leap into is correct. My mantra for the 3rd being that is correct, is you‟re going
to enter into things correctly that go wrong. It‟s not that you‟re going to enter into
things correctly that are suddenly all going to go right. It‟s not what you‟re here for.
You‟re here to enter into things correctly that go wrong because only then are you
going to discover something. Whether you discover that the whole thing is wrong or
something that makes it wrong, whatever that is, on the Cross of Contagion when
you find that out it‟s your job to let everybody know. And we know that the 3rd line
being that are not-self do not do that. They don‟t. Everything that goes wrong in
their life is an embarrassment and a humiliation, and so many of these beings have
open egos. They have weak sense of self, weak sense of value.
It doesn‟t meant that their capacity to be contagious stops. It means it flips. The
depressive 3/6, loaded up with mistakes, living in their Saturn cycle, and whatever is
their response to that, becoming more and more depressive, getting involved in any
kind of escapeolgy, they‟ll drag others with them. And not only will they drag them
with them, they will imbue them with that same tenor and tone. They‟re the ones
that can say, ah, it‟s all hopeless. There is nothing out there. Remember, for the
3/6 that 3/3 phase is so deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply pessimistic. It doesn‟t seem
like there is a ray of sunshine. It doesn‟t ever seem there is a light at the end of the
tunnel. It doesn‟t seem like there is anything that truly works. Everything is—well,
I‟ll do what I can to get by, just to get by.
So when we‟re dealing with the 3, it‟s always the same. If they get to the roof,
things can begin to change. They can start moving towards their equilibrium, they
can begin to move away from the depth of the pessimism and find optimism. The
optimism that you find on the roof is that you find something that works for you. It
doesn‟t have to be perfect. But you find something that works for you. You‟re still
going to experience all those things that don‟t work because it‟s your job. If you‟re a
3/6 your personality is always going to deal with that, but slowly, but surely there is
a recognition that there are all kinds of levels of functionality. And this is one of the
things that the 3/6 can discover.

The 4/6
RAC Contagion 2
When you‟re dealing with the 4/6 on the Cross of Contagion they know what's
around. This is the voyeur configuration. Their real gift is being able to understand
all the various contagions that are around, the various trends, the things that are in,
the things that are out. They‟re the voyeurs that can keep their eyes open for all of
that. And remember that the role of the 4/6 in Contagion is that they're only really
designed to have a functional role when they reach their Kiron. In other words, the
real impact that they can have, their real contagious capacity is something that isn't

going to come until they go through with the first binary, they go through the
pessimism and then they get to the optimism and they build towards the equilibrium
so that they can begin to balance the this and that.
Ultimately, the 4/6 Contagion is a force, a very deep force, because if they are
correct their ability to be a role model, their ability to be an example, their ability to
lead is self evident. It‟s just there. And these will be deeply contagious forces. But
the dilemma, as always with the 6 is that you've got to go through the 3rd line phase
for the formative years of your life. And the whole thing about the contagion when
you're dealing with the 4 is that they have to be turned on by somebody they know
in order to be able to turn that into a contagious agent for others. But in the 4/3
phase of their first 28 years, they don‟t have it. They end up with the wrong group.
They end up being oriented into a specific contagion wherever that is, that is not
correct for them.
The ideal for the 4/6 is to sample what‟s in. These are the kinds of kids where you
can see the 4/6 Contagion ones. Remember that 4/6 children anyway have very
strong social connections. And so when you see them in the school environment,
you really see that they have a networking capacity. But when you see a 4/6
Contagion, the one thing you'll notice about them is that they are always in “clicks.”
These are little closed groups, the seven or eight kids that are collecting guns for a
shootout. They‟re part of that little click. They‟re part of the click that smokes
cigarettes after school at the local café. It‟s highly specialized.
And the whole thing about these 4/6 Contagions that this becomes a framework and
this is where the first dilemma is for them. They don't get to see what the contagion
field looks like. They get to see that this is the only thing and they get carried away
with it. And hopefully it isn‟t going to be something that is going to be physically
destructive to them, what happens very often. Four-sixes are the most vulnerable,
not in terms of what they will do, but in terms of what their friends will do. So you
can be a very nice 4/6 kid and you could end up in a car with other kids because
they‟re a part of your click and the driver happens to be stoned, because you‟re in a
stoned group and that stoned driver drives off a road. You can end up suffering the
consequences because you're simply with the wrong people.
And again it goes back to understanding that if you have a 4/6 child, as a parent you
have to pat particular attention to your child's associates. It‟s about getting to know
them. It‟s not about telling your child to only focus on this group, you will not be
able to stop that 4/6. What you need to be able to do is to remind them that there
are other things that are in for other people, different things, and different ways that
people do things.
And of course, that's something that ultimately appeals to them because they are
voyeurs. They are ultimately interested in the possibility that there are other things
to see and other ways in which those things operate. But again, as a parent anytime
you're dealing with the 3 or the 6 you really have to make the effort. It‟s difficult, by
the way. When you have a 3rd line child you learn that right away. You learn that 30
times a day there's something that isn't correct, that doesn't work quite right that

leads to something. And you just have to deal with it. You just have to see it‟s a
process.
For us with our knowledge we have much more space for that, and our ability to
adapt in terms of the way in which we operate with our own children. But to get this
across to parents this is something that is so important to let them know so they
understand.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Contribution
 14  59
The 4/1
Contagion in the not-self, the right angle of this, is quite spooky for me because I
realize how many things—it‟s my joke years ago, people used to say to me why does
it take so long in Design. And I would say, rumors fly and the truth crawls. And it
truly the way it goes. And it‟s these contagion people that send the rumors out into
space that fly across the globe as quick as quick can be. I tell you, in this phase in
my Kironian contagion I have
learned some things about how you
infect, because this is what
contagion is all about.
But when you get to the 4/1 my
attitude changes in the sense that in
the juxtaposition configuration, and
of course the cross is changing
because what you have at the
unconscious level is no longer the
30-29, but you have the 55-59, and
you're beginning to move towards
the Sleeping Phoenix. You‟re
beginning to move towards the most
mutative of all incarnation crosses,
because it's at the heart of the rave
mutation. And when you look here
at the juxtaposition, when the 55,
the gate of the mutating spirit,
when the 59, one of our primary
role gate in reproduction or primary role gate in mating, and you at what this thing
says. It says this is a juxtaposition cross of contribution, it‟s all about contribution.
In the end, what contagion is all about is that the experimentation in the field of
contagion is something that needs to be contributed to the whole.

The difficulty for the 4/1 is that the 4/1 doesn't discriminate. It just passes it along.
It‟s not like there is a border guard standing there and says, wait a minute, wait a
minute, this contagion of yours is really silly. No, it's not the job of the 4/1 to be a
judge. You cannot be a shifting connecting bridge force and be a judge at the same
time. What you have to be able to do is you have to be able to know who to
influence according to which contagion.
It‟s the one thing that the 4/1 finds our right away in life. There are certain people
that it can influence and there are certain people you cannot. And one of the things
that the 4/1 on Contagion learns is that there are certain things that will turn on
certain people that won‟t turn on others. And they can actually figure out who
should receive what. I'm not going to give them the common cold, I‟m going to wait
until I have the flu, and then I‟ll give it to them because they‟re really ready for the
flu. These over here need the common cold.
It‟s really something to understand about them. They‟re deeply, deeply influential
but the way in which they‟re influential is that there is no inherent judgment in.
They're just passing on a platform. It‟s one of things that can make them so
irritating as not-self. It doesn't seem like it matters what the platform is as long as
the platform gets across. That's really their theme. It could be any platform.
Because the point for them is not the research, the point for them is not the
investigation.
As a matter of fact, their unconscious is only going to drive them to investigate how
to be more influential and it will help them with the discernment of how you make a
contribution. This is 8th gate, how does an individual make a contribution. The
collective and the drive stand back like this when it comes to the individual. The
individual makes a contribution by being irresistibly mutative. And they're always in
the experiment themselves. This is the scientist that takes the experimental drug.
And if it happens to turned out to be Mr. Hyde, well, what to do.

The 5/1
It‟s something to see that this is an enormously individual left angle. You've got
three individual gates, the 8, the 14, and the 55, so you're dealing with a
tremendous amount of individual mutation. And one of the things to recognize about
mutation is that all individuals suffer from uncertainty. There is even a science
called the uncertainty principle.
There are two kinds of builders. There is the builder that has to have the plans, they
have to see all the details, they have to know where everything goes, they have to
have all the measurements, they have to prepare everything, and then they build it.

And then there's the builder that just starts building. It has no idea what the hell
where they‟re going to go. They just know that they need to build. When you're
dealing with uncertainty, uncertainty is the builder that has no plans. The building of
civilization has not followed any plan. There is no plan. It is all uncertain.
When they built that enormous highway through the Brazilian jungle to a new
capital, Brasilia, what a joke; but, you didn‟t know going into it. It is one of the
things to see that the greatest the transformations into form begin without knowing
what the result will be. Now, something happens in this. We‟re coming out of the
8th gate, so you‟re coming out of a very creative gate; it is part of the channel of the
role model. There is a great deal of art in this. And one of the things to understand
about the uncertainty principle is that it's the root of all creation. I know that. I
know that you could not write a piece of music before it happens. It‟s an uncertain
process. You start writing a book. There are two kinds of writers. One that plans
ever step and there is the other one that lets the book write itself. This is the
uncertainty principle.
The uncertainty principle is very important, otherwise we would never ever, ever
attempt to do extraordinary things. And one of the things that the 8th gate
recognizes is that humanity can be turned on to building. Do you notice? I love all
these new age ones with their theories about the pyramids. I've seen so many
theories about who built the
pyramids. My uncle by the way
built them. I just wanted to let you
know. They had thousands and
thousands and thousands of people
that quite willingly gave up their
time to participate in some
enormous adventure; great
uncertainty.
As a matter of fact, there are some
projects that have been built by
humanity in which it would require
more than one generation. So
uncertain that you not even know
and will not live long enough to see
what the form will actually look like.
It is these extraordinary projects
that unify the spirit of humanity.
Think about man going to the Moon,
which is a classic example of this. I
don‟t know when John Kennedy announced that, I think it was in 1962, he
announced that the Americans were to land on the Moon by the end of the decade.
They were having trouble just getting rockets up, let alone go to the Moon, but they
were in competition with the Soviets that had launched Sputnik and put Yuri Gagarin
into space.

The baby boomers were turned on by the new science fiction and the ability to
visualize it, television and all these things. It was a very exciting concept that we
were going to go to the Moon. Enormous amounts of money had to be invested.
Nobody knew what would actually happen. There was an enormous uncertainty of
whether they could accomplish it at all, and what a reward for humanity when it
succeeds. These great projects are from the Left Angle Cross of Uncertainty. And
basically they stand as monuments to the capacity of humanity to work together to
transform the planet.
I am sick and tired of people bitching about human beings digging into the ground
ripping up trees, pumping out oil. It is what we are supposed to do. You think it's
our fault? We are transforming agents. Go up into a spaceship and looked down on
Earth. And there are a few proud statements. The Great Wall of China—we‟re
humans. Look at us; we build monuments you can‟t really even see unless you are
out there somewhere. Like the carvings in Cusco, these vast carvings in the Plains
and the Andes.
This is uncertainty, this is how uncertainty works. And you can see that this is
something very, very important because this is a way in which you put a massive
mutation to humanity. After all, our maya grew enormously through that
experience. And for the first time the Moon became really real. I've seen Moon
rocks, have you? You see Moon rocks and you think wow, there really is a Moon.
There are still people in the world who don‟t think we went. There are a lot of people
in the world that think that it was a Hollywood production. It's amazing. There are
all kinds of people—didn‟t happen, just a TV show.
When you‟re dealing with a 5/1 Uncertainty, what you‟re dealing with is heretic that
is going to give you a universal project. That‟s their role, a universal project to be
concretized in form. Great pyramids, the replacement for the World Trade Center,
you name it, they have these great projects. They have a huge one in Spain here;
they‟re diverting water here in a project that‟s absolutely massive, the kind of thing
that can only be initiated under an uncertainty program because nobody knows what
the results will really be. The ecologists are screaming that you can‟t do this. And
the poor desertified farmers in the South are screaming that you must do this. And
everybody's uncertain about the way it‟s going to turn out. And yet, it‟s a massive
project. And if it turns out to be successful, there‟s this incredible bond in the
society in a sense of, we've done it.
Why do you think we can keep on getting cities to host the Olympics? Silly cities;
what a trip that is to do that in this day and age. But, I can remember watching
when Barcelona was going to host the Olympics. It transformed the entire city.
When I first came to Barcelona, yes, it's a beautiful city but it was unkempt. The
harbor area was not pretty. The beauty of Barcelona was hidden. All of a sudden
within a matter of three or four years in preparation for that event all of this stuff
changed. And you can see this when it was all done and the world had come and
these billions of people had looked at the city and had marveled at its beauty and the
whole community was raised to another level of that we have a special city, we are
a special tribe.

What that did for the spirit of the Catalans. I remember the ads where they showed
only Catalonia on the Spanish peninsula, only Catalonia colored in. The whole of the
Olympics and there‟s this (sound of breathing in) and all the people that had to
invest and the people that died in the construction projects and all the money and all
the concerns and everything else and all of a sudden you're bonding humanity in an
uncertain concretization. And we love that.
You have to understand that about humans. We actually love that. Oh, how we love
our big monuments. How we love uncertainty. We do. It commits us to the form
principle. That‟s what it's all about. Now, most 5/1s don't live the purity of their
heresy. We know that. So we don't have—and the fact is that it‟s dying out—we
don't have 5/1s that can mobilize humanity in that way. It‟s rare, and for all the
reasons that we see in any 5/1 configuration.

The 5/2
LAC Uncertainty 1
Whenever I think of the 5/2, not that he was, but it me of Hitler's sketches of the
Berlin he imagined, which are quite incredible, by the way, imagining something that
could be the symbol of a thousand year empire. And you can see these incredible
monuments. For me, fascist architecture is absolutely incredible architecture. This
sense of that we're building something that last for the ages. And this is one of the
deepest underlying themes of this uncertainty. Yes, yes I know we don't know if we
can do it, but if we do it, it‟s going to stand here forever.
I have on the pin board in my kitchen, we collect funny cartoons, and there is a
wonderful Peanuts where the two of them are at the beach together and Linus has
built a beautiful sandcastle. In the background you can see the tide coming in. And
he saying to his sister, who is giving him a look of exasperation, he saying, for years
people are going to marvel at this, and there's the tide roaring in.
So, one of the things to see about the 5/2 is that it has all of these larger concretized
projects that never get out of their space, they never become form. Now, don‟t
misunderstand me. It's not just about needing somebody who is going to build the
pyramids. We know that doesn‟t happen very often. What it really represents is
pulling people together to do something.
For example, the classic uncertainty principle is to involve yourself with your children
in the long-time program of building a back porch. It has to be this slow and gradual
„everybody's got to help,‟ and there is all kinds of resistance in that process—will we
be able to do it, do we know what we‟re doing, can we figure it out. And of course, it
all started because your next door neighbor is a Contagion, and they built one. So,
you have to build one because everybody now has one of these in the backyard and
you want to build yours. You start that project with your children.
Now, by the time that contagion has succeeded, and hope it doesn‟t collapse or burn,
what you discover is you have created a new bond. You‟ve created a new spirit of
that cooperation. And the spirit of it remains in the form. A buddy of mine here on

the north end of the island was redoing his backyard area. There was a whole bunch
of us that helped him. He built this beautiful fish pond. We went up in the
mountains here and found big rocks and hauled them down and built this enormous
pond for goldfish. You could swim in there. We built this whole thing.
Every time that I go to his house and I step out into the back, which is now mature
and it's very beautiful, there is this sense of those people. I instantaneously have a
frequency all of the ones that were there. As a matter of fact, I noticed the last that
I was at the house we stepped out into the back and that was the first thing that
came out of my mouth. It was a remembrance of all of us together doing that.
Now, it's not like I'm that kind of person, if you know what I mean. It‟s simply that
when you build a form with others you create a bond with them, you do, a very
powerful one.
It‟s one of things to understand about this uncertainty because it's not really well
understood. This is the recognition, because you‟ll see it‟s quite different when we
see in its other arm on the other side. Start working with us so we can build a better
tomorrow—you hear that all the time. I don't know if we'll find a cure for cancer, but
give me your money. If we don't start building the research centers and we don't
hire the scientists and we don't all do this together, then down the road we‟re going
to feel very sorry. But if we do come to cure, all of us are going to feel terrific.
I remember polio. I was part of that generation. There were kids in my class that
got polio. Every parent was in deep fear. And then all of a sudden Jonas Salk, all of
a sudden there is a vaccine. And all the people that were involved in that research,
the reward they received in energy, let alone anything else was one of the things
that concretized in the imagination of the modern citizen that organized scientific
investigation was going to keep us healthy and save our lives. And it gave us
strength to fund all kinds of huge scientific investigating institutions, and they‟re
going to solve our problems for us. We went overboard with that. But uncertainty is
so important.

The 6/2
LAC Uncertainty 1
When you get to the 6th line it has very little to do with hexagram itself, we know
that what is really doing is that it's really looking ahead. It‟s looking towards
something. It's always like that. It's looking towards the 20. That 6th line is say,
what is this about uncertainty? I want to be in the now. I don‟t want to be
uncertain. I don‟t want to deal with uncertainty at all. Don't tell me what it's going
to lead to. I don't care about that. I just want to be in it. I don't mind being in the
field of contagion. I don't mind being involved in a long term whatever project, but I
don‟t want to think about the outcome. That's not going to be the point. The point
is that no matter what I still have to be in the now. I still have to be here. I still
have to be busy in the present and being busy in the present can only be perfect if
I'm not thinking about tomorrow. That‟s 6th line.

So the 6th line being, Cross of Uncertainty is very uncertain about what the
hexagram is actually all about. It‟s like, okay, I can accept the research part, people
can be turned on, that's our job, we turn on people. But this business of turning
them on to things that you don't know where it‟s going to go, I'm not very
comfortable with that. I‟ll leave that to the heretics. Me personally, I‟m going to
deal with this differently because in my first 28 years I discovered that long term
form building is pointless.
Remember, they‟re going to start off a 3/2. They‟re going to start off with, all right,
if you study every day and do your work, and there are all these promises about
where it‟s going to lead to, where it‟s going to go to, and of course the 3/2 screws
up. It just does. Well, you‟re not going to get your reward. Well, then don‟t tempt
me with long-term projects, tempt me with what I can do now, that would be great.
Turn me on for the moment. I'll be that force in the moment.
So there is this movement. And of course, the moment you're dealing with this
you‟re dealing with the vast majority that are not-self, you‟re dealing with a 3rd line
thematic that is basically pessimistic, that is basically saying this is all bullshit, this
long-term stuff is just enslavement, this stuff that is nothing but promises, promises,
promises is not for me, it doesn't work. You give me somebody who has
Uncertainty, and you will see that they‟re going to have problems in their life with
relationships. They‟re the kind of people where their partner says to them it's about
time we got married, and they say no. No, I don't think that I can guarantee you at
all that I can love, honor, and obey for the rest of my life—the uncertainty principle
at work.
There is a contrariness to it that‟s perfect. The whole thing about the 6 when it‟s
really awake is that no matter what it's involved in, you‟re an awake 6/2 Contagion
and you‟re working at the pyramids, and you‟re hauling blocks with everybody else.
And the slave beside you says, well, that‟s really going to be so incredible when it is
done. And that's the moment that the 6/2 looks at them as if they're just plain nuts.
And the only thing they say to them is: shut up and lift the stone. Let's just do our
work, just do the work.
One of the most interesting things about the uncertainty is that uncertainty is
pointed towards this deep, deep, deep existential truth. Everybody is asleep;
everybody is asleep, everything is uncertain, because everyone is asleep. And the
only thing they're interested in is can we wake them up. And one of the funniest
things for me in understanding this concept—I‟m a Canadian, Canadians have very
funny expressions. One of them is when you're annoyed with somebody and they're
being stupid, you say to them wake up and die right. It‟s a very strange expression.
It‟s like being an idiot and you say to them, wake up and die right.
And this is what the 6/3 and the 6/2 are really ready to do in terms of what‟s there.
They‟re there to wake them up. Everything is uncertain until the Sleeping Phoenix
wakes up and dies. This is the whole nature of the mutation that we‟re in. It's all
uncertain. What's most uncertain is the new rave. What's most uncertain is what
are they going to be like, when are they going to come, who‟s going to look after
them.

Everything, everything, everything about the uncertainty principle can be understood
in the fact that this is all about mutation and mutation is uncertain. You do not know
the way it‟s going to go. It can turn out to be cancer. You have no idea where it's
going to go. And all of life is like that. If you are going to be a principle of mutation
you have to recognize you do not know where it's going to go. It doesn't matter
whether you think you're building a pyramid or not. You don't know where it‟s going
to go.
Whenever you‟re dealing with somebody that has a 6th line in their profile it‟s only
post-Kiron that they can really fulfill their role on their cross. Remember, they
always have to seek that equilibrium. And one of the things that you will see with
uncertainty is that in the 3rd line phase, they will bite into the apple, they will bite
into the expectation that certainty is going to arrive and they will be disappointed,
they will be upset, they will be victimized by it.
They will go up on the roof; they‟ll begin to see that there is nothing wrong with
that. In other words, they‟ll begin to see that all mutation is uncertain, that there is
no way that you can saddle it, that all you can do is go along with the process and
wait and see. And ultimately, they transcend both of those points of view.
Ultimately they are simply the embodiment of what they‟re pointed at, the existential
embodiment of truth, their truth that all life is a long-term project, that being is a
long-term project, that incarnation and the turning of the wheel is all a long-term
project, and it is all uncertain, so we might as well be right here right now as
ourselves correct, and then we can live in peace in the now.

The 6/3
LAC Uncertainty 1
Six-threes have a special role because they are the bridge to the 1/3. They are the
bridge back to the next right angle. And we know the next right angle, the 1/3 Cross
of the Sleeping Phoenix—when I do a reading for Sleeping Phoenix I always begin
with something for them, I always tell them that they have to wake up to what their
life has been and they will have to totally give it up to rise again. It's a very difficult
thing when you're dealing with people that are on the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix,
when you wake them up, you wake them up to death in the life that they had.
Otherwise, they can never truly awaken. So it's quite something to take them to a
place like that. You have to be aware of that.
The 6/3 drools at the idea; they love nothing better than to wake you up, destroy
you‟re not-self life and see what happens. Look, they‟re on fire, let's wait and see
what happens. Nobody understands that better than a 6/3. Life can be such a hell.
That first 3/3 phase can be such a distortion. And uncertainty, wow, this is the
embodiment of uncertainty; it's all uncertain. All you can do is hold onto the now.
That‟s what they‟re looking at.

Almost all philosophers have pointed us to the now, this funny place, whatever it
may be. And yet, I want you to understand very deeply why. The only reason that
were being brought to the now is that it now is the place of the Sleeping Phoenix and
you have to wake it up. All of us are being pointed towards that now; all of us are
being pointed towards mystical death. The job of uncertainty is to point you towards
mystical death, for the not-self to die. And as you'll see in the Sleeping Phoenix it is
quite dramatic. The not-self doesn‟t just slowly dissipate, it crashes and burns.
And whether there's going to be a healthy being that rises, well, obviously that's
going to be dependent on how they‟ve been conditioned, what they understand,
whether they‟ve been correct, all the many things to see.

Introduction
One of my favorite hexagram images over the years has been the chop configuration
for the 20th hexagram, these four yin lines with two yang lines. When all this
happened to me in the years that followed I began to look at the various things that
have been given to me because I didn‟t know them myself like the I‟Ching and
because I am a 20 myself it was one of the many hexagrams that I read in the
traditional I‟Ching that I paid attention to. And the traditional I‟Ching is very
beautiful, particularly the way it explains in their language how the hexagram is
structured and how those structures have different names and whatever. But the
thing that always impressed me about the 20th hexagram was this concept of the lei,
which is practically impossible to translate into English. The best that I can get to is
correctness, the way of being correct; it is the way of being correct.
And in looking at that way of being correct there was a tradition in Confucian society,
which is the roots of the I‟Ching, there is a structure that they build all over the
countryside and that structure is something that you see on postcards from the
Chinese mainland. This structure is a gate. It is not a gate with swinging doors, but
simply the frame that is a gateway. And the gateway truly does not open up to into
anything. As a matter of fact, they‟re quite odd. You‟re walking along a path and all
of a sudden you get to the crest of a hill on this path and there is one of these things
standing there and you have to step through it.
One of the interesting things about the 20th gate, Contemplation, is about what the
now really is. You get to that place and you stand in the gateway. And wherever
you have been is behind you and whatever you can go is before you, but the
gateway is the now. And for the Confucian, the gateway in form was to remind you
that you're always walking through the gateway, wherever you go in your process.
And when you look here in the chop you can see the gateway. It‟s there. These four
yin lines with the two yang; you have this gateway and it is the gateway to the now.
I'm starting off philosophically because I have to deal with this Right Angle Cross of
the Sleeping Phoenix. And before I deal with the Right Angle Cross of the Sleeping
Phoenix again, I want to remind you that the Phoenix rises from its ashes, but a
sleeping Phoenix cannot, first it has to die. We have a tradition, an ancient tradition,
a mystical tradition called the mystical deaths. It is something that many mystics in
their life have written about. I myself went through such a process. And one of the
things that is embodied in the Sleeping Phoenix is this process of the mystical death.
You have to wake them up so that they can die in order for them to rise from their
ashes and be born again.
Now, you can look at this as a resurrection theme, you can look at it any way that
you like. But first you have to wake up to your role that you are to die. First you
have to wake up and think okay, I'm the son of God, and then you can go through
your movie of dying and then you can be reborn again. So the Sleeping Phoenix
carries with it a deep, deep, mystical quality.

Contemplation
Whenever you see things in Design that have a mystical quality to them you know
right away that underneath is some kind of mutative force. And when you're looking
at this configuration, particularly when you're looking at it from the point of view of
the personality Sun in the 20, you have something that is very, very individual and
very, very mutative. And the most interesting thing about the Sleeping Phoenix is
that they‟re the busiest people in the world. We have this wonderful expression—
sleepwalkers—these are sleep racers. They're on the fly, busy, busy, busy. And this
is their sleep; they‟re dense, dense, dense, densely in this sleep.
Whenever I have an opportunity—I don't give personal readings anymore; that is,
face-to-face, side-by-side. An acquaintance of mine on the island going back for
over 20 years came up to me one day and said, I really would appreciate it if you
could help me. And I thought, well, all right. It was a Sleeping Phoenix. It‟s so
interesting, because when you're dealing with a Sleeping Phoenix, when you‟re doing
a reading for a Sleeping Phoenix, basically, you can only approach it is a shaman,
you can't approach it any other way. You have to wake them up in a hurry and you
have to wake them up so that they can see. And at the moment that they can see
what they have been living asleep, then they abandon it all.
And it's always one of my concerns, it‟s been one of my concerns from the beginning
as a professional analyst that I was sending women home who were really ready to
leave their husbands because they recognized the relationships were not correct,
that their husbands were correct, so forth and so on, it's a funny wave of
responsibility one feels when one is putting out that kind of energy out. And for me
the Sleeping Phoenix is one of those classic examples.
You see when they wake up they have to abandon everything. It‟s death. So, if
you‟ve got a nice 30-year-old-ish Sleeping Phoenix who is married, has a couple of
young kids and has a career and everything looks rosy, and you wake them up,
they‟re gone. Everything around them, everything that's been there will die. So
most of the time what you see in the Sleeping Phoenix is that they‟re too damn busy
to find anybody that will wake them up. They‟re so busy that they think they‟re wide
awake. And they are busy, busy, busy in the now. There is nothing more difficult to
deal with than somebody who's always busy in the now. And when I say busy in the
now, it is a Manifesting Generator construct. Everybody thinks of physical busy in
the now, I mean been busy in the now, not just physically busy. The head is busy,
the eyes are busy, and the muscles are busy. Everything is busy, busy, busy, busy.
No time to contemplate, contemplation—it‟s one of the great jokes.

The 1/3
The 1/3s are probably the only ones that you can wake up, probably; maybe the
3/5s, maybe. It‟s not like it's easy to wake up a Sleeping Phoenix, it isn‟t at all. It's
something really to understand, you're dealing with the other arm on the cross,
which is the 59 and 55, and you‟re
dealing with deep individuality with
deep moodiness. You're dealing with
the force of the Quarter of Civilization
that says that concretization takes
place in the now, that you have to
build in the now. That you have to
keep building in the now and never
stop building in the now and by the
time you‟re finished building in the
now you're dead. Stay right there,
now build, nothing else matters.
You‟re uncertain about everything
else; too busy.
Now, there‟s a good side and a bad
side to everything. Isn‟t civilization
lucky that we have these super,
super slaves racing around building
everything? The most interesting
thing for me is that in the prime of
civilization as a quarter, one of the driving forces of the building of these giant
monuments was the sleepers. How interesting that they were building huge funereal
monuments all over the planet, busy, busy, busy. It‟s probably where the nonsense
of the afterlife comes from, that you're going to wake up and Peter is going to be
there and say, gee, we‟ve been waiting for you, how nice it's been.
What is there to investigate when you‟re asleep? They don't investigate, they do.
This is the sickness of the Manifesting Generator. The 20/34 is the only example of a
true Manifesting Generator. All the others are Generators with manifesting
potential, in that category that we call Manifesting Generator. The only true
Manifesting Generator is a 20/34. And you can see the dilemma of the 20/34, they
have to do. They don‟t realize that the doing should be a response. This is a world
driven by the not-self and Manifestor propaganda. You have to do.
And the moment that they‟re doing, the very awareness of their inner authority is
lost. They‟re asleep. Manifesting Generators as a class are asleep, because the
doing is so overwhelming that you take away the basic authority in your life, the
basic awareness to guide you in this life. So this is the archetype, this is “I‟m too

busy, I‟m much too busy to wake up.” It‟s like being in a good dream and you‟re
running around having fun. No, I don‟t want to wake up. This is all fine; everything
is all fine because I‟m doing.
So, when you‟re dealing with the 1/3 the only thing that it investigates is how to
keep on doing. And of course, it will end up doing things that are not productive
because it has a 3rd line unconscious, that it's going to make mistakes and what it‟s
doing is going to be punished, it is a Generator. This is a Generator cross. You can‟t
say that for everything. When we‟re looking at this, we‟re looking at something that
is so common. Think about it.
The 43/23 gives us the intellectual capacity to be able to structure and become more
efficient as a being. The 40/37 bonds us to the other and provides us with inherent
security, emotional, physical and material security. But the 20/34—when you‟re
talking about bees you call them drones. These are the drones. They‟re out there
mindlessly doing. And everybody knows that if you're a 20/34, at least it‟s what I‟ve
taught analysts, the only thing that can guide a 20/34 is a 43/23. And you think the
43/23s want the 20/34s to wake up? They don‟t want them to wake up. They want
to structure and align their activity to the benefit of mutation, and be damned if they
don't wake up, they‟re useful droning around.
What the 1/3 is all about is always the potential deep within the anarchistic nature of
its unconscious to challenge the foundation. Everything about how this Sleeping
Phoenix is going to operate has so much to do with the way in which a 1/3 is going
to be raised, the way in which its trial and error is going to be dealt with. But the
great risk of having a Sleeping Phoenix child is that they'll blow up in your face if you
wake them up. And you can only wake them up in their second Saturn quarter
between seven and 14. You wake them up they may disappear.
This is a very, very, very strange configuration. After all it's rooted in what's going
on in the 55. It's rooted in the mutation of the emotional system. This cross is
carrying all kinds of mutative frequency. And there is a Sleeping Phoenix that is
going to wake up, because when you come to me, if I'm still alive in 2027, and you
ask me what the name of this cross is, I‟m going to give you another name. This is
only the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix for humans. It's not the Cross the Sleeping
Phoenix for raves. It‟s quite different.
So it's an enormous battle in the sense that the mutative forces that underlying this
cross are not essentially accessible to humans, which is why most of them are
blessed with running around madly being busy until they die not even noticing that
there was something to wake up to. I know people with their Sun in the 20. You
have to get clamps, you clamp them into a chair, you hit them eight or nine times in
the face, you give them half a bottle of Scotch, you do something. You calm them
down for a moment so that maybe you could input something. And whenever I look
at them I think, is it worth it? I‟m still a Manifestor. Is it really worth it? At least
asleep they‟re useful. There they are busy. I‟m a 43/23; I can guide them into
something that is a little more useful, because I know that if I that button and they
see the light that everything around them is going to dissolve.

It also tells you something that if it‟s only beings like me that can punch through the
depth of the veil that they carry, then you can see how difficult it is for them just
genetically to make that step. It doesn't mean that they are to be abandoned. But I
do want you to understand the dilemma here. If you have a Sleeping Phoenix child,
and particularly in the material, that is, in Civilization, there are variations, this is
very intense at this level, because it is the absorption on being busy with material on
the material plane. These people barely have enough time in their consciousness to
even take in somebody else at the right angle level.
All of a sudden you begin to see these are people that will go plowing along and all of
a sudden discover that somebody they really cared for, somebody they really loved
has been using them terribly. Often the Sleeping Phoenix is awakened by betrayal.
It has to be a trauma that opens their eyes. Not a physical trauma, sometimes if it‟s
3rd line, but mostly psychological trauma, that thing that you haven't been looking,
you haven't been seeing, you didn‟t notice what was going on around you, this is
when this veil can drop. And it‟s only when this veil can drop that they can die to
that life. When you finally see, I‟ve been a fool, then you can die to that life, then
there is a chance. Honor your strategy, follow your inner authority, go through your
deconditioning process and wake up in the real sense.
But this dropping of the veil is very important. These are beings that don't see. It‟s
one of the difficulties of individuality, and this is a very individual cross. Individuality
is waiting for mutation and because it's waiting for mutation it often ignores valuable
things that are not mutative that are around it because it‟s waiting for mutation.
There is this limitation. I know this is a 43/23 intellectual that I am deeply, deeply,
deeply resistant to somebody else's concepts. That‟s the nature of individuality, to
mutate the original, the new.
But it also means that I am often unseeing of other concepts and what may be their
value, because it is a limitation in the process. When you're dealing with those who
are Sleeping Phoenix‟s you're playing with fire here, because I've already been
through what it's like to have relatives send you hate mail. I've been through that.
I've had husbands and children and I've had people send me very strange things
about what I did to their mother, father, daughter, son. And I want you to
understand what you're dealing with a Sleeping Phoenix that's the kind of thing that
you're actually looking at in reality.

When we're looking at the right angle variation of this cross what we are simply
looking at is misplaced doing, and misplaced doing rooted in whatever the profile
configuration is. So for example, when you move to the 1/4, everything we‟ve seen
about 1/4 is that the parental level of education, guidance, culture is going to
determine the platform that that 1/4 is going to work with them. And the whole
thing about the 1/4 is that it simply is going to be busy, it‟s going to be busy doing
its investigating, it's going to be busy with all of that. These are people that are so

The 2/4
RAC Sleeping Phoenix 2
We know what the 2/4 configuration is. This is the personality that says leave me
alone, this is the unconscious that is waiting for its opportunities. This is a being
that seeks very secure shelter. This is somebody that doesn't like the challenge to
whatever it is that they're doing because they have no way of being able to
substantiate their natural gifts.
And obviously when you're dealing with a 2/4 Sleeping Phoenix, you're dealing with
somebody who is not only asleep, but is withdrawn. So this is somebody that isn't
even in the external drama of participation. They‟re very much absorbed and very
much withdrawn within their own space. They‟re a whirlwind. You hope that they
have at least three rooms, because they‟re a whirlwind in that space. There‟s always
something to do.
I can't tell you how many 20/34 housewives I have known who spend six hours a
day sweeping. They won't even use a vacuum cleaner because it's too quick,
sweeping all the time, endlessly. These poor souls, they don't have anything else to
fill up their life. And you‟ve got this incredible energy inside of you. I have a friend
of mine here on the island that is a 20/34 and you can never go over to her house
and find her not cleaning. She's always cleaning, endlessly cleaning. It‟s what they
do with their energy.
So when you see a 2/4 Sleeping Phoenix at home, all day long moving the dust. And
in this day and age they‟re really asleep because they‟re on the Internet. They‟re in
their shell, they‟ve got their box in front of them, they have their broadband hookup,
and they can be so busy with nothing, nothing, nothing. They can spend three or
four hours cleaning their computer‟s drives.
Then one day they get the call. You cannot be a 2/4 in this life without the
opportunity to the call. Now, I said that for the 3s on the right angle it is going to be
easier—easier is not the right word, but nonetheless, the possibility of being able to
awaken from the sleep. Remember when I take about awaking from the sleep, I‟m
not talking about being awake. They can only be awake after they die. I‟m not
talking about them being awake. I'm talking about removing the veil.
When you deal with 20/34s, my description for them all these years has always been
the same; it's a horse with blinders on. That's all. There are blinders that are on.
When you're standing in that gateway, the gateway is there for your periphery to
see. And when you see like this and you look back and you see like this, it‟s 360°;
it's all there. And there is the 20/34 Sleeping Phoenix like this, just like we are when
we‟re asleep with most of everything turned down except a few focus points to keep

the body going and essential functions, and whatever. This is the Manifesting
Generator like this. They don‟t see. They only see what‟s in that track. And when
I'm talking about waking them up you tear off the blinders. It‟s not always easy.
When the call comes, the call is going to come from somebody it knows, it's going to
come from that source of opportunity. And this is where the possibility is. Here is
this 2/4 Sleeping Phoenix locked away in its house and there is a revolution in the
streets and there's a knock at the door and a friend says, don‟t you know what‟s
going on. It‟s like, look around you. All of a sudden, everything can change.

The 2/5
RAC Sleeping Phoenix 2
We already have a basic archetype of the 2/5 established. We have a socially
resistant personality that has a deeply attractive unconscious that‟s projected on.
There is a deep trap of having the 20/34 configuration and being a 5th line, because
everybody expects that you can do for them. Not only do they expect that you‟re
going to do for them, but they expect that you‟re going to do for them endlessly.
Not only that you expect that not only are they going to do for you, but they‟re going
to know what to do for you before you even asked them what they should be doing
for you.
And the moment that somebody walks up to 2/5 Sleeping Phoenix, if they can get
that close, there is this immediate projection. What do you do sitting here? There‟s
so much work for us to do. There are so many things that can done. You‟re going to
be wonderful. Whoa, the not-self Sleeping Phoenix throughout the world are
enslaved beings. They are the heart of my Generator as slave metaphor. They‟re
deeply enslaved beings.
And one of the things about the 2/5 Sleeping Phoenix is that there is this part of it
that says oh, I know I should be out there been busy, oh, I know that this is
something that I should really be doing, but oh, jeez, I don't know if I want to do
this for you, I don't know if I want to get caught in this thing in which I can no longer
breathe because I'm going to be so busy and so absorbed and so involved.
Mothers who have 5th line children set them off on the wrong track with the first
breath, after all. The assumption is that that 5th line baby is the Messiah, and it's
not. And they discover right away as soon as it pukes on them or shit on them or
piss them off, or whatever the case may be, that immediately this is no longer the
perfect child. The expectation projection field is an enormous field that is deeply
dense.
And when you're dealing with a 2/5 on his cross, you have to see that this is going to
be a deeply, deeply paranoid being when it comes to any kind of social interaction.
This is the kind of child when you see them in their room they are busy, busy, busy,
busy, busy. And the parent comes in with a friend and tries to introduce the friend
to the child and the child, for half a second, raises its head and goes back into his

busy, busy, busy. In other words, there this, “don't get me going,” which is basically
what all 2/5s on this cross say at the auric level—don't get me going, because if you
get me going I'm going to be absorbed that for the rest of my life; don‟t get me
going.

The 3/5
RAC Sleeping Phoenix 2
For me this is the science profile, the discoverer profile. Maybe I should explain that
to you. When you're looking at any 3rd line theme, as we know we‟re always dealing
with the whole thing of mistakes and losing the sense of value and worth. When I
talk about the 3, the 3 needs to publicize what doesn't work, that they need to get
that out. At the moment that they get that out, they‟re going to be fulfilling their
role.
When you‟re dealing with the 5 at unconscious level, the 5 is about the potential for
universalization. There is an aspect of the 3/5 in which the failures of things that
don't work, the things that breakdown can become universalizing principles. In other
words, a lot of people can be told about something that isn't functional that takes
away from our efficiency, and so forth and so on.
So, when you're looking at the 3/5, they‟re the ones who can publicize in the easiest
sense genetically, because that‟s a predisposition, they're the ones that can publicize
what does not work in order to be able to guide us towards what does work. It‟s the
whole point. It‟s the whole point of 3/5 discovery. This is the material plane. One
of the things you notice about 3/5 Phoenixes is that they‟re the ones who really
discover on the doing plane. In other words, there is this need, the 3 cannot stay in
the house, it's not a 2, there is this need to go out and explore, there is this need to
deal with the material nature of the plane, their drive out into the world busy, busy,
busy and they make a lot of mistakes fast.
And one of the interesting things about the 3/5 in this configuration is because the
busyness is something that is just a full vibrating constant for them, that all of those
fast mistakes tend to lessen their individual potency as a sense of failure. As a
matter of fact, one of the things that I teach Manifesting Generators is to make lists.
And the reason I teach Manifesting Generators to make lists is that in the archetype,
the 20/34, you're so busy racing over things that don't work that you don't
remember them. They‟re lost. They never get to the resume. It‟s not like
somebody who's a 3/5 and doesn't have this and they hit a brick wall, they can
spend months lamenting the brick wall.
If you're 20/34 and you hit a brick wall you bounce off, you climb a tree and jump
over. And by the time you've been going on for the next several days the sore that
you feel from bumping into the wall is gone, the memory is gone. It's forgotten.
And the experience is forgotten and somebody comes up you a week later and says,
I going to take this running course along that thing and you don't remember to tell

them, by the way, there is a wall over that hill and if you're not careful you‟ll smash
into it.
It‟s one of the things about what the Manifesting Generator is all about, what it is to
be a 3, what it is to be able to say, look, it‟s doesn't work, don‟t do that. So this
could be the magic of the 3/5. Unfortunately, because their 3rd line personality is so
dense in the not-self, that it's so easy for the not-self to take the personality of the 3
and twist it into its martyrdom, to twist it into its victimization of the not-self. It's so
easy.
And the moment that you have that, the moment you have a child that seems to fail,
it's not so much they stop doing, they‟re 3/5s after all, they are 20/34s in this
configuration. It‟s not like they‟re going to stop doing. But they're not going to
advance. They are not going to be risk takers. They're not going to leap into things.
They're going to stay with the tried and true.
And of course that goes against their very nature. The 20/34 is purely mutative. It
is there to be busy with what is new, what is mutative. And so what you get from
the not-self 3/5 is that they turn off, literally, to mutation. They turn off to a lot of
other things. They end up being in sexual denial and they end up having difficulties
in relationships because they don't seem to connect to people anymore.

The 3/6 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 2
To be a 3/6 Sleeping Phoenix is in many ways to not so much be asleep, but to be
asleep in a nightmare. The not-self is in the self-improvement business. That is,
make the not-self a better not-self. When you're so busy and you have to go
through a 3/3 first cycle stage, life can appear to be a deeply depressing thing.
Whenever you're dealing with any cross configuration that like in this instance you
have three arms that are individual, you‟re obviously dealing with the chemistry of
individuality, you‟re dealing with its moodiness, you're dealing with its melancholy,
you're dealing with its potential for depression. How easy in the not-self for
individuality to be transformed from melancholy into depression. It's very easy.
It‟s something so important to see about the 3/6 phenomena here, how melancholic
life appears to be, how deep the pessimism is. And obviously, we‟re dealing with an
unusual configuration because of the nature of this cross. There aren‟t the
opportunities of this cross to be able to stop for a moment and contemplate, get the
joke. You have to be awake to contemplate. It is the contemplation that is the now
waiting in response.
When you‟re standing in the gateway you begin to understand something, that the
movement of your life is a response to life. It‟s just all response. You don't have to
stand still to be contemplative. You don‟t have to standstill to be in the now. That is

what the inherent truth of the 20th is about. It‟s every breath; it‟s every milli-breath.
It's just about not being attached to the “this” and the “that.”
This busyness is a kind of protection from the program in an area of our chemical
evolution that is disturbed. After all, the mutation that's taking place in the solar
plexus has collateral damage in the not-self realm—prostate cancer, autism. There
are all kinds of things associated with this mutation that are not pretty. One of the
most interesting things for me about the nature of the Sleeping Phoenix is how this
busyness is a way of protecting these beings. We can say, ah, they‟re asleep and
they‟re always going to be asleep. Well, we all come back.
Who says you have to wake up? I'm not so certain that I want to wake up any more
of these people. I'm not, because I understand what that's all about, because I
know the name of the cross when it's not Sleeping Phoenix, and I realize it's a kind
of protection. The most important thing for 20/34s is that they have in their life
43/23 guidance. 20/34s are not here to be led, they‟re here to be guided in the in
the sense of that word as it‟s something that is used in the context of projector.
Basically speaking, all 20/34s need to be guided by the right questions. The thing
that will change their life is to have somebody in their life that can ask them the
right questions.
If you want to drop the veils from 20/34‟s eyes, there is always one question that
will do that, always, always. There is always one question. This is the deepest
understanding of Zen masters is that triggers can be very minimal and yet, they can
open you up completely. And it's something to understand about them, these
Sleeping Phoenix ones. There is that question that will shatter them. That will take
down the blinders that will open up what's there.

The 4/6 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 2
I think the most interesting thing for me in the right angle of this is the 4/6 in this
configuration. There is a part of them that deeply wants to escape the right angle
and be the left angle because the left angle is so different. It‟s like, I‟m not into
sleeping. I‟m into duality. So, one of the things that you see in the Sleeping
Phoenix when you get to the 4th line is that you get this shift. And they‟re always
trying to shift to the left rather than shifting to the right. As a matter of fact, they‟re
trying to move away from that entirely.
That‟s very important because the real mutation is taking place through this cross.
It's not taking place through the juxtaposition. It‟s not taking place through left
angle. So it is a natural thing. Remember, all 4/6s, because they have this
voyeuristic quality, don't see themselves as limited to just their personal experience,
because they are so transpersonal in their makeup. They‟re always trying to look at
the world around them. And in looking at the world around them they stop putting
all the focus on their own personal process. One of the most difficult things for the

4/6 in finding its equilibrium in life is that that equilibrium is balancing its social
capacity and its social focus with the need to truly work on itself.
The 4/6 in this configuration is deeply aware of the fact that doing doesn't lead
anywhere. It sees it. It doesn't mean that it does anything about see that, but it
sees it because it is it. One of the things about the 4/6 is that they're always going
to be with their own type, their own kind in that sense. After all, their whole
structure is a tight community of influence. And we know that in the 4/3 stage of
their Saturn cycle they're going to make their deepest mistakes in terms of who they
associate with. And what they‟re going to see is what happens to this drive of
busyness of theirs, because they're going to end up being busy with all kinds of
things that they're going to discover are not productive. And they're not productive
for them, but they're going to see that other people are always trying to latch onto
them and keep them involved in it to access their energy.
The one thing that's interesting about the 4/6 Sleeping Phoenix is that in a way its
life is about pretending it's asleep when it's not. The 4/6 Sleeping Phoenix is lying in
bed as a child and it is wide awake. Here is its mother coming into its room and it
immediately closes its eyes and pretends it's asleep, and then mother goes away,
and it opens up its eyes. And it‟s very busy trying to figure out what goes on when
it's supposed to be asleep. As a matter of fact, the 4/6 looks like they‟re really
sleepers at this level. And they're actually much more alert than the others, much
more aware of how blind this energy movement is, how blind this doing is.
In sexuality trainings I talk about the nature of the sacral center and the sacral
center is about availability, whereas the emotional center is about drive in our
sexuality. And when we are looking at availability in the sacral and you look at the
34th gate, the 34th gate says, oh, I'd love too, honey, but I'm busy. They‟re always
busy.
So you can see that when you're dealing with a 4/6 it really seems like their
dysfunctional. That 4/6 Sleeping Phoenix will have very limited sexuality in its life.
It will appear to be closed off to all of those things, but it will be a great
pornographer. It will be somebody that will collect the images or whatever the case
may be. In other words, they look like they're really asleep, but they‟re not, they‟re
not at all.

oppositions in the wheel, aside from the 43/23, that produce a definition. So this is
a very unusual configuration.
Wherever you see this configuration, this was the original mating and reproductive
time of humans. This goes back to understanding that we were intended to come
into the world and intended to come
into the world with certain
configurations. We were intended
to come into the world with the
combination of these three
channels—43/23, 20/34, 40/37—
there were many more of those
20,000 years ago, if we could think
of it in those terms, than there are
today, as a comparison in the
population as percentages.
This brings in the 40/37 it brings in
the 40/37 at the unconscious level.
It‟s a very unusual juxtaposition
cross. The whole thing is the now.
And what does busyness serve in
the now? The only thing that
busyness can serve of value in the
now is the tribe, the family, the pair
bond, and the community. In other
words, it‟s something very important to recognize that our busy-ness, in the simple
sense, has a purpose.
And when you're looking at a 20/34 you're looking at the archetypal of
purposelessness. You know what I mean by that word—they don‟t have any
purpose, they just want to be busy. And the 40/37 says, no, no, no, no, no, no, you
can only be busy based on a bargain. What's the deal here? You‟re being busy for
nothing, you idiot, if you want to be busy for nothing come work for me. I'll give you
busy for nothing. I‟ll give you more nothing than anyone's ever given you before.
You just be busy for me. This is one of the great relationships. This is how the tribe
expanded its gene pool. You have the 40/37 on one side saying, I want my daughter
or my son to marry one of those, because I need to build another building on this
property.
When you‟re dealing with the concept of now, you cannot deal with that mundanely.
There is nothing about this configuration that is actually mundane, despite the fact
that we‟re in the Quarter of Civilization. There isn't. The only way that form can find
its true nature is through surrender. This whole business about Generators being
slaves, the awaken Generator is a builder. We don't know what it is to live in a world
where Generators are builders and are operating efficiently and are creating what is
correct for them and for all the others who are dependent on the world that they
establish. It‟s all about surrender.

I'm somebody who takes very deeply in myself a sense of the importance of
noninterference in life, in the nature of being, in the way in which it all works. I find
that the moment that you identify is the moment that you lose your surrender to the
now. And the surrender to the now for me is not about time, it‟s about place. Most
people think of the now as a time. But what I'm trying to show you here it's not.
It's a place. And it's the place between this and that. There is always in the maya
this and that.
And yet, in truth there is a place. There is a place that is neither this nor that. It is
the line of your trajectory in geometry in space. It is the perfection of who you are.
And this will business about the now is not about recognizing that there is a focus
you have to have in the moment. I know people‟s designs. If only you‟re a 20 is it
part of your trip. It‟s not everybody's trip. It‟s not about you being conditioned into
the physical recognition of the now, and that you abandon as an abstract your past,
where you abandon as a logical being your future. No, no, no, this is not about time.
It‟s about place.
We are always in the right place at the right time, always, despite the lies, the
foolishness, the nonsense of our self-reflected consciousness. We‟re still killer
monkeys; we‟re not so smart. And we're fixated on time. It‟s like I teach people
about death; death is not a time, it's a place. It‟s a place you go to. Everything is
moving in space, everything, everything, everything. Death waits for you, and not
as a time, but as a place on the horizon. It‟s there. You get to the door. You go
through and you're gone. It‟s just a place.
And surrender is just a place. It‟s just a place between the “this” and the “that.” We
are all of it. This is the costume of life, the “this” and the “that,” the black and the
white, the right and the wrong. And in order to be here in the now you have to
surrender to the place, that you‟re in the right place; that you‟re the right being in
the right place, and that while you‟re there in the right place you are going to live
your lie, you're going to be correct, you‟re going to live what is correct.
They‟re good salespeople for the now, but unfortunately the not-self sells the now as
a time. Oh yeah, it was really nice of Ram Dass to give us that little morsel. But
then again, he fucked up millions and millions of spiritual New Age hippie boo-boos
thinking that they were here to ignore the past and the future and to be fixated on
some illusionary now, what a joke. One of these lovely little drops of wisdom that
turns into a ridiculous generalization.
I‟m a 20, I know the now, and I know its place. I know it's a place without
resistance, that's all. It's a place without resistance. You only meet resistance if
you're caught up in the “this” and the “that.” My spirit isn‟t caught up in the “this”
and the “that,” so there's no resistance. That's the place. That's the smooth
geometry; this magical line like the point between the breath in and the breath out,
this magical place where you coast and you‟re resistance free. It‟s not about selling
some false illusion of time.
The greatest joke is that whole illusion has nothing to do with the 20; it has to do
with the logic people. Time, after all is in the 15.5, it has nothing to do with

individuality. The whole individual process of mutation is based on the fact that
things happened between times. There is no time to the individual. There is time to
a logical being. They have to slice up the rotation of the Earth; they have to slice up
the movement around the Sun. They have to diagram it, pattern it, lock it in, and

We have the Left Angle Cross of
Duality, and that duality is the
pure left angle influence of the
unconscious 40/37. This is
understanding something about
the nature of busyness, that it‟s
there to support the bond. It‟s
there to support the basic bond.
Remember that at the genetic level
every single cross, every single
profile has an underlying theme of
making more, being fertile, being
reproductive. Every variation of
every cross has to be in the world
in order for the world to function.
One of the underlying themes for
me in laying out all of this
knowledge over the years is that I
know when it comes to the
engineering of life that if we don‟t
know how to fill in all the variations
we‟re not going to make it work, because you have to have it all.
When you look at the world, the first thing you understand about our drive to build is
that the drive to build must be based on dualities. It's always about dualities. It's
always about polarities. It is not surprising to me that there were pyramids in Egypt
and pyramids in Mexico. And I don't need to discover whether some idiot was able
to go in a reed boat all the way across, some Egyptian that was going to take the
drive. It is not surprising to me, because the form principle operates that way.
There is always something on the other side. And it creates one of the basic things,

“this and that” concretization phenomenon driven by the motor of the 20/34. The
20/34 is enslaved to the building of the tribal environment. And all tribal
environments, if you look, I find it incredible because I spend a lot of time
information hunting. And when you look at the development of civilizations across
the globe, when you look at certain stages of development, over here you have
something and all of a sudden over here you've got it. And they've got all these
things about morphogenetic fields and simultaneity and travelers bringing it back or
aliens seeding it in two locations, and on and on. No, it‟s this fundamental principle.
It‟s there. There is always some kind of counterforce in the “this and that,” always.
It's always fun for me, people come to Ibiza and say, I‟ve heard that Ibiza‟s polarity
is Goah, or I've heard that Ibiza‟s polarity is Sedona. It‟s natural inside of us.
Something comes up over here, it's going to come up over there and it‟s going to be
different. If you grow up in Ibiza your mother is a witch. And if you grow up in
Sedona, your mother is an angel. They‟re really very different places.
When I landed in Sedona, I walked through there and I thought what are these
people talking about? I have three open motors; when I step on a piece of ground
what goes through my body. And I'm walking around—nothing. There are people
talking about there are these fields, energy. Everybody I met was seeing UFOs and
I'm thinking, wow, is this ever a gentle, soft, sweet environment. It was
nauseating.
You land in Ibiza, you put your foot on the ground and the witch already has your
leg. The moment you put your foot down it comes right out of the earth and grabs
your leg and says, now you be very careful. I can‟t tell you how many people I‟ve
watch come to the island and leave on crutches, and worse, much worse. Don't
bring your infant babies here. Oh, I‟m serious. I know two that have died here.
Don't bring your infant babies here. This island is ruled by Tanit, the priestesses
took child sacrifice. Ibiza is a scorpion island.
So wherever you have these places in the world it‟s like one moment there is Silicon

And this is the principle that‟s here in this duality. It‟s very important. It's like when
you have it in a village, one guy went into the village and he finally builds himself
what he thinks is the house. At the other end of the village immediately there's
somebody who's going to put up something else that's going to be the polarity to it.
And you have it in everything, always. There is always this tendency in humanity to
go to the polarity. So, when you have a 5/1, what they're really doing on this cross
is they don't think in those terms, obviously. What they don‟t recognize is the
moment they put their busyness and their communal connections to work, what they
create in form immediately generates a space out there in the neutrino ocean for its
polarity to arise.
I've been able to watch in my lifetime, the transformation of the world into a place
that was not well known when I was born into a place that is deeply intimate to all of
us now no matter where we live. There is this enormous explosion, an explosion
that takes on bizarre parallels to this. You put McDonalds over here and you put

The 5/2
LAC Duality 1
The 5/2, like all 5/2s, is always going to be reticent to make any kind of contribution
and we know that only the 5/1 is actually the exponent of the hexagram. And you
know clearly that the 5/1 here is going to try to channel the physical activity to the
benefit of the community. What's missing is the 43/23. You will see very clearly
that this relationship between the 43/23 cross configurations and this left angle
configuration is the very basis of the life direction of the planet in form as human.
It's what it‟s all about.
And of course, what that really represents is that the tribe isn't successful always in
channeling the energy of the 20/34. And it's only the tribal relationship to the 43/23
that the three of them together can actually bring about the efficient structuring of
the Manifesting Generator capacity in order to enrich the tribal life. This really is
what it's all about.
And that's why that when I talk about bonding I talk about that the collective and
individuality have problems with each other. The middle ground is always the tribe.
The tribe will take in the individual because it needs to enrich its gene pool. And the
collective will listen to the tribe because the collective realizes that the tribe is what
it has to change, that the tribe has to become more and more integrated into the
collective whole.
And this is where we are today. This is the fix that we're in today. And the very fact
that we have this is what‟s led us to this point in which we are reaching a place of
genuine conflict in which the last stand of the tribe in the face of the collective
onslaught. And that the individual efficiency structuring has made the collective so
powerful. We know that. If you're from a small tribe with your God and there is this
enormous international foreign alien web that‟s around you, it‟s truly threatening
from that perspective.
The other thing is that because of the not-self we have a balance in the law duality.
The law of duality is that the “this” and the “that” have a difference only in reflection
to each other. But in value, they‟re the same. This is the equilibrium. And what
we've seen in this movement is that there are so many parts of the world that don't
have the same advantages. They‟re only now beginning to get their McDonald's.
They‟re only now being able to get their mobile phones, and so forth and so on.
A 5/2 Manifesting Generator is going to be somebody who risks being ill a lot,
because they're going to really be—if you're a 5/2 and you‟re paranoid and you've
got an unconscious that is pulling you back, you‟re holding back an enormous
amount of energy that needs to be active, that needs to work properly. And of

course, for the 5th line personality you‟re going to have all the paranoia that comes
with being trapped into doing something that you're not really equipped to do that
can blow up in your face.
Five-twos by their very nature are not great participants, and yet at the same time,
given the nature of this as a form principle in civilization, again, they can be these
hidden Buddhas. The ones that have a dream of building something that nobody
gets to see. This dream of what can be realized for the benefit of the community,
the energy that can be applied to the building of what is right for the community.
If you don't integrate the community into the now, you end up with Osama bin
Ladens. You end up with people that hate the West because they‟re disadvantaged.
They hate the West because they are poor and the West is rich. They hate all that.
It's understandable. There is an enormous pressure to bring every one through the
collective—the logic, remember they want to bring everybody to the same time. And
you can see that all fundamentalism is about going back in time. This is not about
the now. This is the great failure. We‟re trying to drag them all into this artificial
time.
There are some cultures that are going to have to move very slowly to what is the
median time frame to go from enclaves in various places in the world where you
really have 21st century lifestyles and places on this planet when you clearly have
12th century lifestyles. This is the root of the deepest conflicts that we have and it
comes from this basic form principle.
It‟s a basic form principle of the universal keeping-up-with-the-Joneses. It just is.
And communities are successful based on their material development. How proud
the medieval village to build its first church, even though it took the lives of lifetimes
of 40 or 50 craftsman. It was a wonder. And not only that, but the very wonder one
of them doing it lead the village further down to build its own; this chain reaction
that's possible, how powerful these heresies can be in terms of the way it moves
form into the world.

The 6/2 on this cross is very funny, because as soon as they're old enough they're
obsessed with building a home for the soul mate they‟re going to find. They‟re
obsessed with it. It‟s like they can't imagine a relationship without that form
principle to enclose it. The fact that we live in individual spaces is something that's
really relatively new. It is certainly not a commonality at all in many places in the
world.
Go to the average small Indian village and see how people live in one room with six
or seven children and the odd aunt and grandmother. This is something very, very
special. The ultimate freedom is to have your own room, child or adult. It's the
ultimate freedom. And 6/2s are the great exponent of this, how important it is to

have your own space, that that truly is wealth and is truly something to be
productive towards.
Obviously, in the 3rd line phase there are going to be problems with that, because
not only are you going to be thinking about the wrong form but you‟re going to be
thinking about the wrong partner to live in the wrong form with you. These are the
kind of people they could end up in a career of building houses for newlyweds,
starting their life with the perfect environment. Here's your starter house. Here is
the first house for you. Here is the way to start your life.
But of course, if you‟re dealing with the 3rd line process and you know that there's
going to be all that trial and error, you know that they're going to make mistakes,
you know that they may not even get to a point where they see they have the
material potential to do that. We know how costly it is relative to any society to
build the space of your own, but they‟re the great exponents of it.
Most people think of the Cross of Duality through the other quarters, so they get
another feeling about it. When you see the Cross of Duality in the Quarter of Duality
you're talking about totally different phenomena. You‟re talking about bonding,
you're talking about the focus is the person. Here the focus isn‟t the person. If I
could anthropomorphize the psychology it would be our relationship would be better
if we had a better house. Our relationship would be better if I can finally give you a
house with the kind of kitchen you really want. I would have a better relationship
with you if I finally built you the den that you really want. It has nothing to do with
the other person. It's the form principle.
It is the form principle that says genetically it's very important that we build a wall
around two people. The first thing is that we isolate the potential of a new gene
pool, that we bring them together through not-self attraction, get them to mate and
produce children and those walls then become the shelter and the bonding force.
And in order for us to move to the Quarter of Duality where we have to deal with
human interaction, what you really have to see is you've got to build the spaces that
are necessary for that. You have to do that.
I know that in my own relationship over 21 years, there were certain places that we
lived in where we had problems, and it was very much the places we lived in. We all
know what that is with structures and the baraka that‟s in the walls from the people
that were there before, and the shape of it and the feng shui of it and whatever it
may be. And you end up in an environment that is simply not right for you.
So, the whole principle here in the 6/2 is to be the example, to be the example that
says, I know how important this is. It‟s so important that before I decide on who is
going to be my husband or my wife I'm going to build the right environment for it.
Unfortunately, they‟ll do in the 3rd line phase as a dream and end up with a
horrendous thing and hopefully they can sell for profit so that they can wake up and
build something that's right for them, but to see how important it is for them.

on building. This roof separates me from the sky. These walls separate me from the

other. And so within this framework the family becomes an isolated pool. And then
the bond becomes bonded to the structure itself. You‟re all away from home, you
know what it's like to go back to sleep in your own room, to sleep in your own bed,
to sleep in your own four walls, that sense of returning to the environment. How
sentimental we are about the houses that we grew up in, the house that you had
with your lover when you were young, all of these things, recognize how important
this is structurally for us. Again, to see it through the lens of the quarter; remember
always, as we go this long process, that we‟re talking about the form principle:
purpose fulfilled through form.

The 6/3
LAC Duality 1
Now when we‟re dealing with the 6/3, the 6/3 is looking at the 31. The 6/3 has a
problem with the 6/2 example. The 6/3 and the 6/2 are walking through the
construction site that the 6/2 is developing for his eventual bride, and the 6/3 says,
yeah, very nice, what does she look like. I don‟t know what she looks like. What do
you mean you don‟t know what she looks like? How do you know if she‟s going to
like the house? And the 6/2 says, stop bothering me now, I'm busy. Get out of my
face, I'm busy. I'll bring her here when I need her, I‟ll show her the house and her
eyes will light up and I know then it‟s her.
But the 6/3 is saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, because it knows that from its 3/3 life. It
knows that, over and over and over again. The house it thought was going to be
wonderful that the plumbing is useless. The apartment that you first rent for
yourself that you think is such freedom and the toilet doesn't work and the shower
give you brown water, and on and on and on, the typical 3/3 experience.
Now, you could end up with a very exciting direction and architecture. You could end
up with somebody who wants to be a better plumber. You could end up with all
kinds of things in the form principle. Remember that when I talk about building
these places I'm not just talking about the architect, I'm talking about the builders,
I'm talking about the suppliers, I'm talking about the maintenance people, I‟m
talking about all of those people that have a life because the form exists. The
moment that you build a house you invest in your community. You cannot imagine
how many people I've paid large sums of money to do ridiculous things to keep my
house functioning, immediately you're in the business.
But the 6/3 is going, but the 37 is over there. I can see it from where I am here on
the roof. I can see that over there. This is about love, this is about family, and this
is about marriage. No, I think I‟d better pay attention to the bargain. And
remember, they have it deep in them. This is a left angle with a 40/37 built into it.
So the 6/3 has a real dilemma. One side is pulling it towards the form principle and
the other side there is this, maybe I should check that out first; the bridge.

But in terms of the personality of the 6/3, the personality of the 6/3 duality, that one
of its primary concerns about the nature of building anything is will it be built
properly. It‟s one of the deepest concerns of the 6/3 when it is sitting on top of this
left angle configuration and it's looking over to the Cross of Planning. Oh yes, in the
background is this frequency of we've got to service the tribe, we've got to look after
our partners, this is about the right person in your life, and all that stuff in the

looking at Enthusiasm. It‟s looking at one of the most important of the throat gates
in relationship to material and the material world that we live in, because this is
quality control.
And it is one of the most important things to recognize about us as human beings is
that we're not simply driven to construct a pattern that is going to stay fixed.
Otherwise, we'd all still be living in yurts. That is not the way we‟re designed. The
way we‟re designed is that we manipulate matter more and more and more with
more and more sophistication. And yet, the more you manipulate matter, the more
mastery you need of matter; again, one of these driving forces of our development
as a species so that ultimately we are able to manipulate form to the point of being a
breathe life into it. In other words, to be able to recreate life in our own image,
which is the ultimate form mastery. And this quality of form mastery is rooted in the
Cross of Planning. We have been on the Cross of Planning since 1610.

Introduction
We‟re designed to manipulate matter more and more and more with more and more
sophistication. And yet, the more you manipulate matter, the more mastery you
need of matter. Again, this is one of these driving forces of our development as a
species so that ultimately we‟re able to manipulate form to the point of being able to
breathe life into it. In other words, to be able to re-create life in our own image,
which is the ultimate form mastery. This quality of form mastery is rooted in the
Cross of Planning. We have been all the Cross of Planning since 1610. That‟s a
longtime. It's going to end in 2027. The procession of the equinox, our relationship
in the synthesis of Design to eastern astrology, this movement backwards is that
now we are in the Cross of Planning, in the Cross of Planning from the 37th gate and
it's going to retrograde back into the 55th gate and this is going to begin the next
epoch for us.
So from 1610 to 2027 this is the larger global cycle theme of the Cross of Planning
and here we are in the Cross of Planning at its concretized quarter. Please
understand something about the nature of this particular Cross of Planning, that here
is where planning is concretized and planning is concretized from skills. One of the
most natural progressions from the 22 the 16 is that the 20 dreams of their dream
house, but the 16 designs it. The 16 is the architect and the builder. It‟s the one
that truly understands what's necessary. Not only that, but every single building
that they‟ll build will be an improvement over the previous one. A 16 is not an
architect that builds a subdivision with 27 cookie-cutter houses. A 16 is somebody
who gets individual commissions to build unique buildings, the Frank Lloyd Wright‟s
of the world where they build a house over here and then another and another one
and each time there is a progression in the skillfulness.
It's the way in which the logic creative process operates. Remember that the 16 is
born in the 58/18. It is this underlying challenge to any pattern that drives logical
creativity. So when you‟re looking at skillfulness, when you're looking at the 16th
gate, recognize the power of the 16th gate, that here is the concretization and it‟s the
concretization of identification through skills.
When I first began to teach Design to my many friends who had had experience in
the East they were always telling me about non-identification and I would grin, and I
would say, yes for some, non-identification is important. But if you‟re a 16 or you‟re
a 48 like me, you are never in your life going to be free from identification. If you
are not identified in with your art you could not be an artist, nor will you ever be
skillful. The depth of identification is necessary. All skills are the result of
identifying.
So, the whole thing that you‟re looking at here is concretization, identified needs for
concretizations—skills. And you can see how successful he Cross of Planning has
been through the 16th gate. We have never had more skills available in humanity in

our entire history. If you were to look at a list of all the things that a human being
skillfully is capable to do it would take you your whole life to read the list. It is
incredible. And most of that capacity has taken place in this cycle since 1610. This
is what the Cross of Planning is all about.
The Cross of Planning brought the industrial age, brought the global warming of the
planet, brought the transition of the seven to the nine-centered being. It brought
institutionalization through the 40/37. It brought the city state, the nation state. It
brought all of these things. The Cross of Planning is coming to an end. Think about
something folks. In 2027 humanity is going to move towards living for a long time in
the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix. Humanity is going to sleep and raves are going
to wake up. We‟re going to leave behind this time of planning. I hope I live long
enough just to see the dawn of the era; most of you will.

The 1/3
Nothing is more important to 1/3 than being able to find security in a skill. Anytime
that you have a child that is born with the Sun in the 16th gate, learning skills is
something that is absolutely
essential for them. And obviously if
you understand the nature of their
design according to their type then
you know how to introduce them to
the potential of various skills,
whether they needed to be invited
or asked, whether they need to be
guided through stimulation,
whatever the case may be, it's
essential for these 1/3s to
investigate skills.
Not only that, the great gift of the
16 1/3 is to be able to recognize
how poorly our training systems
are. Oh, have I ever been under
pressure since the moment I
introduced this knowledge with my
48th gate pointing at a 16 that I
don't have to try to find an
educational program that will really satisfy the demands of this knowledge and the
hopes of students entering into this knowledge—how to institutionalize it, how to
organize it on that level, how to identify what skills are necessary. This is all about

the Cross of Planning and how to concretize that, how to create skillful analysts in
order to be able to move the plan. This is all Cross of Planning.
So, the whole thing about the 1/3 is the 1/3 is here to discover the trainings are
inadequate, and guess what they discover instead. They think they are inadequate
because the trainings don't help them. They think they‟re inadequate because they
can't master the skill. And it's not true. One of the things that they can find out is
if how they are guided is correct. If we really had a clear understanding of this as a
global phenomenon, we would see that the whole educational program—remember
education was only institutionalize during this cycle, that the entire class of a society
could all send their children to school, regardless of whether they were rich or poor,
that education became institutionalized at that level. And that you can see that since
the 1700s that we have advances in the way in which we teach our young. And this
is the work of the 1/3. They‟re to discover that how we are teaching the other to
identify isn't the best way, they‟re making mistakes.
Now every once in awhile, it‟s simply that the skill is not of any value at all and you
really know not-self 16s when they're trying to develop ESP, you know they're in
trouble. You know that that's simply not going to be functional. And given the fact
that particularly 1/3s that these children immediately recognize that life is fragile,
that nothing is really predictable, that everything to be so uncertain, that obviously
it's very difficult for them to find something that they can truly identify in that will
allow them to have the skills that are going to give them the security they need in
this life. And it is skills, remember that our skills are concretizing skills, to find skills
that allow you to manifest. Remember that these are throat gates.
I saw a feature on CNN the other night, this guy in eastern Germany, an architect
financier and he's taken over an old French military base and built a totally ecological
park for people to live in. All the houses, they‟re flats actually, produce more energy
than they use. And people who buy these flats actually sell their excess energy
every year to the local city. The whole thing is wonderful.
This is when a dream gets concretized and then it becomes an oddity feature in a
news broadcast. The guy was asked, he was cute, if this was just the fantasy that
he could afford. He said no, it‟s a business. It makes money on selling these things.
They're not cheap; each flat is about €400,000. And he's built in the center of it a
circular one that is over €1 million for one of these flats; they‟re gorgeous. And
there it is in the middle of East Germany somewhere, and it runs on the Sun, the
whole thing. The whole thing runs on the Sun; it‟s really amazing.
Of course, this is what the Cross of Planning is all about. I have so many people in
my life who say, wow, the future is going to be so exciting. We‟re going to get this,
we‟re going to get that and we‟re finally going to get these little cars that they ride
around in in Star Wars and we're finally going to be beamed aboard and all of this.
You fools. In 2027 the door closes. Oh, it doesn't close in the sense that it's slams,
because there are those of us alive who carry this global imprinting. And when the
last of us die, when the child that is born the second before the changeover in 2027,
when that child dies, this era is over.

Somebody once asked me, what's it going to be like? I said, think about the Dark
Ages. The thing about the Dark Ages in a new cycle where institutions breakdown,
where the family bond collapses and no longer exists, where there are no skills to be
identified with in the mass, where there are no projects that humanity will bond
together to build.
I don‟t want to get into writing scenarios for science-fiction movies. I've seen enough
of them to know that it's out there in the wave and people have an idea what's
coming. But it‟s actually for us to see that we‟re actually going to, most of us
anyway, get to that point where we'll actually see the turning of the wheel. And
certainly our children will and our grandchildren will and they will participate. They
will be some of the last survivors of this time and will carry the hope of the Cross of
Planning into late into this century, and perhaps a little bit into the next one, and
then gone.
Enter into the world of the individual. When I preach to you that you are the only
authority, that you‟re here to be the only authority, I am preparing you for what that
means. In our context that sounds very liberating. But in the future it's the essence
of survival, because there is going to be no collective infrastructure to help you. All
these institutions will crumble, they will crumble, fall apart. That‟s why for me in
many ways, many of the things that I discuss now particularly when it comes to
aspects of the transformation that's taking place and here again we‟re in one of
those examples, I realize that so much of what I'm describing is on a short timetable
now. It's not like what it would be if we were all gathered in 1610 and I could say to
you, you know there is stuff coming. We‟ll all have two new centers. We‟re going to
get busy; we‟re going to invent countries like France.

The 1/4
RAC Planning 2
To be a Sun in 16 could be so wonderful, that 16 is pointed at the 48. The
opportunity is there to be conditioned to the search for depth, in order to find the
various attributes necessary to enhance one's skills. Because of the 40/37 that lies
at the unconscious level, when you're dealing with somebody who comes in on the
Cross of Planning their family is very, very important to them in terms of their
development. And there is no greater an example of that than the 1/4. We know
already about the 1/4 that they are subject to very powerful cultural conditioning
when they're young, that their unconscious is simply going to accept the platform
that is given to it by its experience, and that very much its 1st line capacity is always
going to be towards supporting that platform and denying anything that might
question that platform.
This is something you see when you look at these signs that say, Mrs. Jones &
Daughter, or Harry Smith & Son, this is one of these archetypes of my dad's an

electrician, too. There isn't anything wrong with that, but simply to understand the
principle that's at work. Remember that this is about skills. If you have a child on

the Cross of Planning, regardless of whether—remember this is still going to be in
their design—regardless of whether the Sun is going to be in another quarter, it‟s
just going to have less focus, obviously, but it‟s still important to recognize a child
coming in on this cross that they need to be shown skills when they're young.
This is the parent that involves the child in watching and then eventually
participating in what they are identified and skillful in. And it is something in which
you see right away that the child is waiting for that. This is very important. But the
risk with the 1/4 is that if you don't introduce other things to it, if they only see you
as a one-dimensional identification, that's going to be their identification. That's
going to be the skill that is going to have the deepest conditioning quality in their
life.

There is something about the 2/4 that when you see them where they're not called,
you will see that they have a certain very laid back, very closed-off frequency. They
function, they‟re a natural. And because they‟re a natural they don‟t suffer from the
same kind of inner questioning.
If you‟re a 1st line personality there is always a part of you that is going to be
insecure about the way you look at things, feel about things. If things go wrong the
martyrdom that grows out of the 1/3 is because the mind gets absorbed in thinking
that there's a mistake in itself. But because the 2 is a natural it doesn't pay
attention to that. It doesn‟t know that it has a problem, in that sense. It only knows
it has a problem when it gets fired and it suddenly realizes oh; suddenly it sort of
concretizes around them.
It‟s one of those things to see and how difficult it is to be on the Cross of Planning
and to be a 2nd line. It‟s like I don't know how I concretize. I don't feel like I'm
identifying with it, it's just something that I'm able to do. And of course, we have
this difficulty, because of the 1st foundation. Remember the 1st line is a foundation
as the 1st line of the hexagram, as the 1st personality of profile, it sets the
foundation. The foundation is to be insecure until you have something solid.
All human beings are insecure until they find something solid. That is the basic
foundation. And so the 2nd line suffers from that propaganda. The 2nd line says,
well, we‟re supposed to really understand why we can do something. We‟re
supposed to really understand that if we have a talent that we can transfer that
talent to somebody else.
The 16th gate is a throat gate. It‟s a gate that speaks. These 11 gates in the throat,
in this quarter all speak. And you know one of the things that you have to see very

clearly about concretization is that concretization is initiated through language, it is
initiated through communication. The 16th gate has a problem. When you look at
logic gates, you see right away there is no logic gate in the throat that connects
directly to motor. The 16th gate is always begging for energy. And it is one of the
things to be so clear is that so much of a 16‟s life is rooted in dreams that cannot be
fulfilled because of the lack of funding, money.
The 2/4, like all the 4s on this cross are extraordinarily important as influences,
because they influence people in the sense that they get them to become identified
as a group with projects. One of the things about the nature of logic and the nature
of skills is that it‟s collective, that it's difficult to get to the energy, the 16 goes to the
48, the 48 goes to the 18, still no energy until finally you get to the 58. It‟s so
important to understand this about logic, how difficult it is for logic.
The tribe can go straight for the throat through the 45/21. The abstract can go
straight to the throat to a motor through the 35/36. Individuality can do it a number
of ways. Only logic is starved of that energy, which is why when you're looking at
the 16th gate to see the power of identification is to get enough auras so that you
make the money bridge. It‟s about momentum. It is about critical mass. It's about
getting enough people identified with the same thing so it naturally finds its energy.
You can see that in the way in which logic committee‟s work. You have these
committees that study things, investigate things, make presentations, make
proposals and eventually if amongst the public there is enough weight behind that,
ultimately they can find their funding. And in finding the funding then they can go
ahead and concretize the identification. The 16th gate is enormously important for
us, and the 2/4 can be one of those great missionaries.

The 2/5
RAC Planning 2
One of the things that is so obvious to me about the nature of humanity is diversity
and diversity in the purest sense that we can see diversity within the context of
Design. In other words, that each human being is differentiated. There must be
those identified with obscura in this life. I know that for the health of the whole that
the continuity of history must be in the flesh. I don't have anything against an
enclave of 12th century beings, as long as they're not trying to sell that to the whole.
But there is a place for that. There is a place for a few surviving cannibals and
there's a place for all of the diversity. We can't put the humans in zoos to make sure
that we keep them here. But, these examples, it‟s why we have his rush now where
we‟re trying genetically to save everything.
As a matter of fact, one of the most interesting things is there is a scientific group in
Washington, DC that successfully last year had a cow give birth to some kind of
extinct oxen. And there is this cow carrying this alien species in its body. By the
way, because of principle was based on stem cells, it's quite conceivable, God bless
Mother India, it's quite conceivable that we could actually gestate humans in cows,

God bless Mother India. It is technically viable to—it's quite a thought, isn‟t it.
Considering that women are going to be sterile, cows could come in really handy.
Why don‟t you think the Indians have killed them? They know that eventually we
could replace ourselves because we have all these cows. God loves a good joke.
So the whole thing about 2/5s is the ability of skills that are obscure skills. What I
mean of obscure, remember that the 2/5 is reticent and paranoid to say, I'm really
identified with this, because it may not be practical for others. It may lead them into
having a very bad reputation because what it seems that they're focused on seems
irrelevant. But remember something about the 2/5, it can be called to that obscura,
and that obscura can always have universalizing capacity, the concept that floats
around in their brain in the 40s may only be viable in the 70s. There they are
working away at making a television, and all of a sudden that obscura becomes
something that is a universalizing potential.
The other thing is that this is the door to synthesis. Everything about the modern
world is the recognition that the things that are changing our world are not single
entities, and they are not singly sourced, but they are like the television set. There
are all kinds of people who have claimed to have invented the television set. But in
fact, all those people were part of the inventing of the television set, each and every
one of the aspects, whether it's the ability to see moving images or the ability to
record sound or the ability to create vacuum tubes or the ability to be able to
alignment them with transistors, and on and on and on.
And you begin to see that this incredible skillfulness, that here is where the 2/5 and
the 5/2 are in an exalted position on a cross. And rarely do I say that, as you know.
This is a very special place for them, not so much that they are seen in the moment
as being viable, but being recognized in the sense that ultimately they are the ones
that can see how a certain skill can bring all kinds of skills together, and something
else will come out of that. You know this is something that is very, very, very
magical.

Nobody is more effective on the Cross of Planning and more disturbing on the Cross
of Planning than the 3/5. Again always remembering the value of the 3/5, and if
there's ever a cross that the 3/5 could thrive on, if there's ever a time in evolution, if
you know global cycles you can go back and see the eras where the 3/5s could be
comfortable, this is an era where they can be comfortable, because we need trial and
error in order to establish accuracy.
It‟s like the development of Jovian software, of Maya Mechanics Imaging. It's one
thing to create a theoretical package; it's another thing to have it tested. You need
to have it tested. And the moment you have it tested you see that there are things
that you need to do to perfect it. It‟s one of the essential aspects of the logical
process.

When you're dealing with a 3/5, the 3/5 is truly here to discover new skills. You
head out on a path as a 3/5 and all hell breaks loose and in order for you to survive
you have to adapt. There you are without any gasoline on the road and you have to
figure out what to do and so forth and so on. The magic of the 3/5 is that they can
adapt. And not only do they adapt, but the gift here is that they adapt the form.
They use the same form, not for what it was intended for, but it takes that form and
uses it for something else. And this is incredible. If you really follow that back it‟s
like—think about what a gear is, and just the concept of a gear changes everything.
The discovery of a gear changed so many things. A long, long line of this
movement; the great inventions are 3/5 inventions.
The Cross of Planning are the ones through trial and error that are here—and I want
to tell you something, they‟re in a not-self world. These are 3s, these are 3/5s, and
these are cosmic fuckups. It starts day one, and they feel like that. So it's not like
they're inventing everything. It's not like they‟re fulfilling what is their potential.
You can't imagine. Well, you can if you took all the science-fiction that's ever been
written, all of it, and all that science fiction as it relates to the possibility of what we
can have on this planet, that all of it could have been realized during this cycle, all of
it.
The funny thing about human beings is that when it comes to the building principal,
anything we imagine, we can do. Anything we imagine we can do. It is only those
things we cannot imagine that we cannot do. It‟s like people who say that you can‟t
travel at the speed of light. You can't do that, but that's not true. The moment you
can imagine that you can travel at the speed of light, I'm sure it's possible. As a
matter of fact, in understanding Einstein, you know that Einstein only said you
cannot accelerate to the speed of light. He didn‟t say you couldn‟t travel at the
speed of light. He said you just couldn't accelerate.
Now, if you open the door onto something that was traveling at the speed of light
and just jumped on, you could travel at the speed of light. Anything we can imagine
is possible in this cycle. And of course, we know that most of it has been left to our
imagination, to my pleasure of watching a movie at night and seeing the potential of
the Cross of Planning not concretized in life, but as art. And it's right near the end.
You can't imagine how many special machines we still need. If you understand
global cycles, one of the things that's leaving us in 2027 is the 61 and the 61.1,
Inner truth. Whatever truths we need—and the only way we get to truths now are
through machines.
It‟s one of the things to understand how successful we've been in developing skills in
this cycle. And we already know that. Durack could dream neutrinos. Their reality
could be revealed to me as a mass. And yet, it took a big machine deep
underground in Japan to prove it. And only when it‟s proved is it going to be in the
dense maya. We need the machines. And there are certain things we still do not
know. And we need our 3/5s on this cross to discover what machines are necessary.
I have a machine I want built. It‟s called a monopole detector. It‟s a machine that
somebody stands in. And when they stand in that machine, the machine hones in on

their magnetic monopole and measures its frequency. I want that machine. And I
know that there's only 23 years left. And if I don't get that machine in 23 years,
nobody is ever going to get that machine. It won‟t matter.
All this stuff only matters now because we're all caught the planning together; we‟re
all in the same frequency together. We think all of this stuff is important—United
Nations, globalization. We're headed in a stage where it‟s everyone for themselves.
What do you mean “we,” Kimosabi? What‟s this “we” business? This is the “we”
time, this is the bargain time, this is the cycle ruled by the 40/37, and it's coming to
an end. We're in the dying gasps of all of this.
So 3/5s are essential in engines, particularly now. Every time a 3/5 comes into
Human Design I cross my fingers. You can imagine how many times have been
disappointed. You can‟t imagine. There is always this “maybe, maybe.” Maybe I get
a 3/5 physicist who studies monopoles, maybe. Maybe I get a 3/5 physicist who I
can introduce to a 3/5 geneticist, and on and on and on. Because they could discover
how do we do this.
After all, they‟ve only looked up, they‟ve never looked in. I know where they are.
They‟re right there. It‟s just a matter of measuring it. You have to figure out how to
measure it; I guess by getting rid of everything else. There must be a way of
measuring the total frequency of the human body and one-by-one eliminating those
frequencies that you know where they come from, the frequencies of the nervous
system, the frequencies of lymphatic system, the frequency of breath, the frequency
of a heartbeat, the frequency of a liver, the frequency of the kidneys, and you get all
of these frequencies and you take them all away and there‟s going to be one left.
It‟s going to be there. And I can't think of any other way to do that.

The 3/6
RAC Planning 2
Obviously, when you're dealing with a 3/6, and again we‟re dealing with a 3/3
dilemma, what I always want you to remember though is that whenever you're
dealing with this 6 you always have to see this dilemma at the beginning of their life.
And again, to see that on the Cross of Planning 3s have great value to us. They‟re
the ones that can tells that the plans are wrong, they‟re the ones that can tell us that
the process is wrong, they‟re the ones that can tells us that the skills are lacking,
they‟re the ones that can give us all of that direction that we need in order to
concretize all these skills, to concretize the plan. After all, the 16th gate is the only
gate on this cross that carries the burden of actually having to put it into form and it
doesn't even have access to a motor. That's not easy.
So, when you're dealing with a 3/6, when you're dealing with this 3/3 process—my
first comment to any young 3rd line being that I meet is don't worry about your life at
all until you're 30 and then it's okay to worry about your life, what your life is going
to be, who you're going to spend your life with. It‟s okay to fall in love before 30,
but it probably won't last. But then again, you‟ll learn something about love.

But it's very important for 3rd line beings to understand that because they are
genetically designed to be these instruments of discovery, that they meet every
crack, they meet every failure, they meet the potential for things to go wrong. They
do, they're designed for things fall apart in their hands and in their life, this is what
they‟re here for, and how fascinating it can be if your psyche is geared towards the
exploration of that, rather than the victimization, because it‟s a totally different
frequency. As a 3rd line being, when you know something's going to go wrong and it
does, there‟s actually a glee even if it hurts.
You‟re a 3rd line being, and you smash your car, and there is a part of you going

why did I do that and I don‟t know how to drive. Or transferring it to the other and

The 4/6
RAC Planning 2
When we come to the 4/6, this is one of the ideal voyeur places. After all, I‟m talking
about a Cross of Planning in which the profile is a part of that, so everybody with
their various profiles on this cross obviously has an advantaged time. They‟re
resonating to the cycle; they‟re resonating to the global themes. I don't want to get
to 2027 and actually see what it's like to live in a 6th line energy, this kind of
(sound). I don‟t know what that's like. I‟m in my prime here in a 1st line global
phenomenon. With all my 1st lines I'm vibrating to the time, I‟m Mr. Inner Truth,
inner truth is a theme, and I‟m cooking. There I am snaking my way, showing
everybody the knowledge. I get to 2027 I‟ll probably lose my voice.
So 4/6s have a real advantage and the advantage is that this is an opportunity for
their voyeurism to be of real value. They‟re the commenters on the development.
They‟re the commenters on the planning. They‟re the commenters on skill. Not only
that, but because they are so influential, they can influence others towards either
what the skill is itself or identifying with the byproduct of the skill.
Everything about the Cross of Planning is rooted in which trends. It's one of the
things that we notice the most in our contemporary life that you can watch season
from season, particularly if you have young children, you can see clearly how what‟s
in is always changing. There is always this movement, there is always these trends,
there are always these moment in forms. Look at this desk. You‟ve got four
generations of recording machines here, all from different moments of form principle
exuding. And there's some 4/6 on this cross that they have built into them that kind
of consumer digest ability to be able to see these kinds of progressions, this
movement.

They‟re very good on this cross in knowing at what point in the development of a
product you should buy it. If you were an idiot like me and you bought a computer
seven years ago you went into poverty. If you really wanted a good computer, you
were going to be made poor, only to discover that six months later it was half the
price and twice as good. And then you're an idiot; you buy that one, only to discover
that six months later it‟s half the price and twice as good, and then you‟re an idiot;
you buy that one. I‟ve gotten to the point where I keep my old idiot machine alive
just to stick my finger at all the companies, even though I rarely use it. It‟s like, be
damned with all of this.
Now, if you‟re a 4/6 on this, when the first computer comes out it's like, yeah, ok, I‟ll
wait, I‟m going to watch the development of the skills. I‟m going to see of I really
identify with what it can do. I‟m not going to just buy it because it‟s a toy, and blah,
blah, blah. It‟s quite different. But again, as always, this is a 4/6. So you have a
4/3, so you have a childhood that can be distorted by the nature of those that you're
involved with. And this is a 40/37 unconscious at work. So community is very
important, that identification with the skills of the community is very important,
being the voyeur of the community and its skills, and if you're in the wrong
community, how distorting that is.

you will see that all global cycles are
only listed according to the right
angle. It‟s very important. But the
stages of the left angle and the
juxtaposition are still there. But this
is about programming the larger
cycle, not about propagandizing
some other solar system.
One of the things to realize is that
this age, there was a lead-in to this
and the lead-in was this
Juxtaposition of Experimentation. If
you look just prior to 1610, there
was a sudden burst. This was the
height of the Renaissance. There
was this sudden burst of
experimentation. You were going to

would call science. All of that was being nurtured in the late 1500s.
So, think about somebody who comes in on this cross, you‟re a 4/1, you have to
concretize, you need to concretize through skills, you need to influence others to
concretize through skills. They have a term for this in political circles; we can call
this the juxtaposition cross of the lobbyists. Now, if you know what a lobbyist is, a
lobbyist is somebody who is a paid spokesperson for an industry or a consumer
interest group or a human rights interest group who tries to influence people in
government to bring legislation or new laws to protect those interests, or enhance
those interests, or whatever. And this is the nature of this Juxtaposition Cross of
Experimentation.
Don't think of it in terms of the experiment itself. Think of it in terms of how starved
the 16 is for energy. And the pure gift of the 4, the 4 personality with its 1
foundation that says, this is what we need, this is what we have to do, you have to
experiment. And they‟re very powerful verbally. These are the driving forces that
manage to bang on enough doors to get enough money to actually get something to
work, to get it going, to get it out there. They honestly don't give a damn about
what the results are. That's when they get into trouble. What they‟re really good is
at motivating and moving energy, and moving it and focusing it and fixing it so that
it's going to be the focus of the enthusiasm, it is going to be the focus of the
identification, and it‟s going to take advantage of those skills.
And of course, like all 4s, they have real influence on those around them and where
you see that the most as an archetype is in politics with this money raising. In
modern Western politics all of these politicians have to raise money basically, not in
all European countries, but in some, they have to be able to raise money, they have
to have people to raise money for them who don't really know truly all the policies,
aren't exponents of that, which is what the politicos do. Their job is just to make
sure that they get the other to identify with that politician‟s skills, what that party‟s
skills, what that party is identified with and to get the energy to keep it going, to
grease the wheels.

history, because I enjoy history, watching periods of history and seeing general
thematics of that history as a progression. And you can see that we've looked at
what it means to just be focused on the experimentation. But if you see that as a
global cycle, you see that as the beginning of concrete experimentation. The
empirical method is something that was born in this era, born in the late 1500s. This

was the beginning of real science where you measure things and match things and
compare things and whatever.
But if you look at the cycle that came before that, first you had to be identified. You
can see how the identification comes before the experimentation. You have to be
identified. How does the body work? You have to be identified with something. And
only once you have that identification then maybe you could start moving towards
that experimentation and out of that comes the planning. Now, think about the joke.
The procession of the equinox moves backwards, which is the right way. We move
forwards. This is not the right way.
We think we're going through the hexagrams correctly, in that sense. We think this
is the way, but it‟s not. The whole cycle is moving in the other direction. This is a
spiral; this is a spiral at work. You have this global cycle that‟s going one way and
then you have us that is going the
other way. And it's this cycle that
is created and it‟s the interacting
fields between them. So while
we're going through this
progression this way, it‟s really ass
backwards.
It's one of those things to see that
when I say to you that right angle
is research and left angle is
propaganda, that's how we
experience it going this way. But in
global cycles, it‟s actually the other
way around, that in the global
cycle the left angle is actually
telling, or leading up to, or guiding
the right angle into its research.
Now, we couldn't have that on this
level, because all the right angles
would be pissed off, because they‟d
be pushed around by the left angles. So the way in which the gods protect the right
angle is that they don't allow them direct access to their transpersonal karma. You
can't imagine how tricky the program is. You really can't imagine how tricky they
are. It‟s like putting Sleeping Phoenix‟s to sleep. You can‟t imagine how tricky they
are.
The 5/1s are the guiding lights of social mechanical development, but they are
heretics. They change our identification. If it weren‟t for Christopher Wren London
would still be the biggest toilet in the world. Somebody had to figure out what to do
with sewage, and that's a 5/1 and it was heresy. What's wrong with shitting in the
street? It‟s like pulling up to a train station in Bombay and 800 people in the
morning pissing outside at the same time.

It‟s one of the things about understanding identification. The heresy is to identify
with new skills, with new forms in that sense, those things that are beyond what is
established in the mundane. Only the 5th line of such a collective gate has any
feeling about that the future isn't just the same pattern progressed in movement,
but that the future is full of jumps. And one of the things about the 5/1 on this cross
is that their vision is always that potential to see the jump, to see how you can go
from one level, not simply slowly evolve into the next, but make a huge jump.
And one of the things that we saw when we entered into the Cross of Planning was
the first time that we had really enormous community projects. I mean enormous
infrastructure projects unlike anything we had ever seen including Rome, and Rome
was quite an example itself. We had these enormous universal implementation
projects. Communities for the first time were designed.
It's like going to Lisbon, the whole center of the city was destroyed by a vicious
earthquake about 150 years ago. And Pombal, a general, said, no, no, no do not
allow them to just pick up the same stones and rebuild what‟s fallen. Let us build an
entirely new city. This is a 5/1 vision. And with that would come the ability,
because something new was going to be developed, came the ability, because this
was communal, many skills had to be involved that new things would emerge. So
they were able to lay infrastructure for things that where way ahead of their time,
because once the opportunity was there, in flowed the group identification and the
possibility of aligning it.
It‟s one of the most beautiful older city centers that you find. It was magnificent, it
was beautifully done. There are examples, we see that—I'm North American, and as
a North American I grew up watching cities grow. I watched cities being built. In
Canada I watched communities go from being a couple of farmhouses to having 20
or 30,000 homes. It was like, wow. And you can really see what this is, and the
heresy is always that these form principles must go somewhere for us, must open up
the possibility of many other things happening as we're going along that way.
In other words, it is an understanding of how to identify with the longer vision and
the recognition that even though we don't know what's going to happen, which is
very difficult for logic to deal with, we have to start and lay this basis. What we‟ve
come to see, for example, if you build a community today, most builders will try to
build into the infrastructure everything they can imagine that's going to work in the
future. So you bring in fiber-optic cable and DSL infrastructure and all of the things,
you try to take advantage of where you think things are going to lead to.
Here in this 5/1 is this potential archetype of the essential heresy, remember
practical heresy. The practical direction that we can move in in terms of forms, and
yet practical in the sense that nobody really knows it's practical until it's presented to
them. And the most beautiful thing about the 5/1 in this situation is how much you
can learn from the right angle process, because there is a right angle desperate to
bring their identification into form, and here is the left angle having learned from the

The 5/1, because it's seductive, because it has the ability to bring in the positive
projection has real access to be able to find financing. It‟s one of the most
interesting things about heretics when it comes to form, for example trying to find
money to create a new kind of machine, a new kind of mechanism, a new kind of
whatever there are always these 5/1s that manage because of their very seduction
and the expectation of the other in their protection to get the funds necessary to
start something that in terms of the whole doesn‟t look functional and all. In other
words it doesn't look like it is part of what the plan is demanding. But in fact it's
something that's leading up to a place where the plan will catch up. And we need
these fore runners; the ones that experiment with those things actually get them
into viability.

The 5/2
LAC Identification 1
The 5/2 has great gifts. And if there was ever an opportunity for a 5/2 to be self-
motivated—and remember that for the 5/2 self-motivation is their deepest theme—
these 5/2s can provide forms that are very special because they‟re being called at
the unconscious level. That's what's calling them out to become the caller then of a
heresy. Now, they have to be deeply motivated within themselves to do that. The
fact is that it is possible for them. This call usually comes from the inner recognition
that the form principal is not working. And it's interesting in terms of the 5/2 that
these are beings that—I always talk about the 2/5 and the 5/2 as the reluctant
Buddha‟s. You can really see that in the 5/2 and here is where their potential
contribution can be very, very powerful.
By the way, they are very week in the other arms of this cross. Typical 5/2, the
whole paranoid, they disappointed their parents, and aside from the fact that they're
a type that‟s raised incorrectly, on top of everything else, that there is not much you
can expect from them in terms of them being willing or even open to anything that's
going to call them out to be challenged in their heresy.
However, if you raise these on the Cross of Planning that are 5/2s and you take
them to the heart of the motivation, the motivation will point them towards what's
necessary. If you‟re motivated by fear then you're looking for forms at that will
ameliorate or get rid of fear. There are all kinds of ways in which this gets translated
into the form principle rooted in what the inherent motivation is.

The 6/2
LAC Identification 1
If you could ever see a Cross of Planning 6/2 off the roof, awake, what you would
see is the perfect example of being identified. Deep inside of all human beings is a
chemistry that we find in the 28th gate, and it‟s a chemistry that says that life is

meaningless unless you discover purpose. It‟s simply one of the essentials of life, is
that we are here to discover purpose.
Identification is the way in which the logic system compensates for this. After all,
logic is not individuality. The underlying theme of individuality is purpose. That
purpose is so essential so that mutation can be basically positive. But when you're
looking for the sense of purpose in logic, you can only find that sense of purpose in
the 16 and as you will see the most incredible thing about the 16 is that when you
get to the 6th line, think about what it's looking at. It‟s looking at the 35. It‟s
looking at its mirror. On the other side of the throat its mirror in the abstract
process, its distorting mirror because the 35 has access to a motor.
When you're looking at this identification as the finding of purpose in logic, you will
also see that in the 35 having an experience is purpose to the abstract. In other
words, from the logic perspective, if you never find something to be identified with
you have never truly lived. In the same way that the abstract person will say, if you
have never experienced this or that you haven't truly lived. And it is the equivalent
in the collective of what is the true underlying mutative purpose.
So, when we're dealing with the 6/2 they‟re here to be an example of the purpose of
logic. They‟re here to be the embodiment of identification. Now, they‟re identified
with their skill in bringing form into concretization. And their language, this language
of “I experiment or not, I judge or not, I create or not,” all of this is inherent in this
6/2, not this, not that, not distracted by what is there in the maya, but deeply
focused on their pattern, identified with it.
Remember where the left angle comes from in this configuration. To really see that
by the time you get into the basic infrastructure planning, remember we‟re at the
end of this cycle, by the time you have laid all that infrastructure, by the time all
those basic things are there, you‟re always pointed towards what the future will
demand. Right now they're planning to extend the airport here and that's going to
be done 10 years from now, or whatever. The moment you‟ve got basic
infrastructure, there are these long term whatever. And one of the things about the
nature of the 6/2 is that the 6/2 embodies that whole process. In other words, its
identification never wavers. It simply moves along that way self-contained as an
example as a leader.
For years when I was living in Bavaria in southern Germany, the ordeal of going from
my village to the airport, you ended up having to take some vast circuitous route
because ecologists had blocked the building of a four-lane highway that would have
directly connected my area to the airport. And it was in the courts for years and
years and years, but there are those 6/2 embodiments from the beginning, still there
saying, yes, but the road has to be built because we have future traffic flow that‟s
going to be enormous and we‟re not going to solve with this. And they‟re just the
example of it. And they hold on to that.
One of the most interesting things about the off-the-roof stage is how self-contained
these beings can be, and in a sense, so very fixed, because the moment that you‟re
not this and that there is no fluctuation. There is just the identification.

The 6/3
LAC Identification 1
The 6/3, like the 6/2 are going to be under pressure because of the three cycles,
they‟re going to be under pressure because of the 3rd line stage they have to go
through. And we know damn well that our ability to be able to move in the chains
smoothly from the 16 to the 35 is something that is deeply hindered by the depth of
the not-self on this plane.
Whenever you see a 6/3, like with the 4/1 that‟s always ready to shift towards the
left angle, whenever you're looking at a 6/3 you always must recognize that their
attention is elsewhere. This 6/3 is looking at the 35 and it‟s saying, I'm really
identified with this project, but I wonder if it'll work. This is a great design for a
house of the future, but I hope people are only be 2'4" in the future, I hope they
don‟t have to breathe too much oxygen in the future, whatever the case may be.
In other words, one of these is the things to see about the 6/3 is that while it‟s
sitting there on top of this “we‟re going to keep building these great forms, and we‟re
going to have this, we‟re going to have that,” there is these very down to earth 35
purpose on the other side that says, I don't care what you think this will be for us,
let‟s see if we can survive it, let‟s see if we can live in it, let‟s see if it's functional.
In the 1950s, they tore down a section of a slum in one of the boroughs of New York,
a very, very poor place and they built all these wonderful brand-new flats in the
assumption that it's going to change everybody's like. Well, it didn't change
everybody's life. And now there are these big huge slums that are 25 stories high.
And it's one of the things to understand is that, yes form building is great, but what‟s
the experience of the form? It‟s like these people who fantasize about what it would
be like to live in a 12th century castle. You have al these little girls with their
fairytales, how pretty that would be to be the princess to live in a 12th century castle.
Nobody thinks about how bad that was, how cold that was, how smelly it was, how
the princess herself was covered in lice. If she was British she never washed in her
whole life other than her baptism. You don‟t want to be Prince Charming to a
princess like that, not unless you smell worse, which was the case; had various
diseases that were not pleasant. And everybody thinks, oh castle, yes, well.
This is the 6/3 looking at the 35 and saying, this is a great idea, but couldn't we just
build a sample, do we have to invest $18 billion first. Can we just not have a tiny
little example? This is that the final sales pitch of the 16. Remember that it‟s
starves for energy and the final pitch is, look, you‟re right, I don‟t know if it‟s going
to work but, let's just try a little bit. I‟ve got this little, little project. I‟ve got this
grand plan, and I have this little bit of a project that I want to try.

Have you noticed that is the way works? How many enormous projects are all about
that tiny little thing that they bleed out. This is the thing where you say to
somebody that you‟ve got a choice. You spend $18 billion on what looks like it may
or may not work, or you spend $60 million helping me with this little project. And
there is such a relief that the financier doesn't have to put up $18 million. It‟s like,
ok, go ahead and try it. This is the 6/3 on this cross at work. It‟s like, oh boy—the
uncertainty principle of the 3—oh boy, we have no idea what's going to happen with
this thing, we'd better try something else.

Introduction
I often talk about the experiential way as crossing a river There are certain beings
on this cross and you take them to a river and there's a bridge going across the river
and they say, isn‟t there other way? And you say, what you mean another way,
there‟s a bridge here. No, I don‟t want to get across this way, there must be another
way. How did they used to get across here before there was a bridge? It‟s one of
the things to understand that it‟s inherent in the 35. In the very, very first courses I
ever gave where I talked about this stream from the 41 to the 35 I used the same
metaphor. I used to say the 45 shows you when the tank is empty and the 35
shows you when the tank is full, if you had a fuel gage.
It‟s one of things to recognize about the 35 is that the moment that the tank is full it
starts to empty out, immediately, and you want to fill it up again. You just do,
because it's not satisfied. How long does it take you to get horny after an orgasm?
It‟s not like that orgasm is the end of your life. For some people it could be, but
nonetheless, it‟s like, well, yes, yes, and then it‟s gone. And then there is this, well,
there must be another way, there must be more. We have to find something that is
satisfying.
The 16th gate is a gate of identification but the 35th gate is the gate of expectation.
And if there is anything that marks the human experiential way better, this is the
word: expectation. Human beings are greyhounds on a track chasing a mechanical
bunny. This is us. I want that bunny, I want that bunny and away we go. The only
way that you find purpose in this life is that you chase the bunny. If you don't chase
the bunny other people will kill you. Well, it‟s true. And you can see that in
humanity. We could change the name bunny to whenever, we could—chase after
your whenever, your maturity, your career, whatever it's going to be. We‟re just out
there just racing along.
And the whole thing about expectation, the cruelty of expectation is that the moment
that you have it it‟s gone. And you‟re there going, ah, I did all this work to get
across the river, now what do I do? Go back? You ever see that in those movies of
prisoners in the south in the States and they have them on the rock pile and you get
them to move all these rocks to one side of a hill. You see these prisoners struggling
and sweating and they get all the rocks over to one side and they wake up the next
morning and figure they‟re going to have something different to do. No, move the
rocks back.
This is what it is to be caught on the experiential way. Nothing is ever satisfying for
long. It‟s one of the beautiful things about the existential consciousness that has
snuck into the abstract collective in the 46/29. In the 46/29 you have this
recognition that the greatness of the experiential way is based on complete and
absolute existential absorption, because it is only afterwards that you can truly
reflect, it‟s only afterwards that you can really see. It‟s never intended to be
satisfying as an experience because it's the reflection that supposed to be satisfying.

And most people on the abstract plane think that it‟s the orgasm that satisfying
when in fact it's the memory. The memory is much more satisfying and the memory
lasts a long time. And this is the whole reward of understanding what expectation is
all about. It‟s never about what you think you're going to get. It‟s about the residue
of what you get seen through a rearview mirror. And that rearview mirror is a
distorted mirror and because it's a distorted mirror you can make anything you like.
Ah, the beauty of the abstract way.
Now, the Cross of Consciousness people are very interesting human beings. They
have fascinating minds. After all, they‟re 63s-64s. But when you meet beings that
are this cross, there is an enormous difference between the Sun in the 5 and the Sun
in the 35, than the ones that have their Sun in the 63-64. If you‟re born on this
cross with your Sun in the 5 or the 35 you are able to find a natural balance for your
abstract and logical mental system because you have distance from it. And they are
sub-themes of your cross potential.
But the moment that you‟re born with either your Sun in the 63 or the Sun of the 64,
there is always a slant, and it is much more difficult to find the equilibrium. So, if
you‟re born on the 64 there is this abstract slant. If you‟re born on the 63, there is
this logical slant. Here we have the 35.

The 1/3
There are many, many crosses that are wonderful for 1/3s, this is one of them. This
is a personality that deeply needs to investigate the nature of being. Their 3rd line
unconscious in finding things that don't work actually stimulate a Cross of Conscious.
This is one of the few crosses where being a 3 is actually—well, not so much fun, but
it‟s embraced.
In other words, they don't have enough time because of their mental interests to
really dwell on the fact that something didn't work. Their mind will immediately go
into their process of trying to find out why the pattern failed or trying to find out why
the actual experience failed. In other words, their mind is going to explore it at
another level. So they're not going to be that absorbed in the 3rd line process, other
than as it reflects on their personal life.

In other words, like all 1/3s they can have a very difficult time in terms of how they
present themselves to the other. It‟s lower trigram. It's not easy for them to be
able to put themselves out to the other. The natural not-self alignment of guilt and
shame because of your failures with the 3rd line unconscious leads them to feel like
they're not really going to be secure in confrontation with others. And because of
that Cross of Consciousness children
can be deeply absorbed on the
mental plane and appear to be quite
uncomfortable to their parents and
can be of concern to them.
However, we're dealing with
Civilization, and we're dealing with
concretization. And the whole thing
about the 35 is that it's geared
towards the experience and the
experience only, which means that if
you have a 1/3 on this cross and it's
a little Manifestor, look out. It is
going to be roaring out there.
Remember this is about concretizing,
so this is about concretizing your
experience. And when you're young
you don't really understand the
reference points of reflection. You're
just (sound—foof). So, one of the things to keep in mind about children that come in
on the Cross of Consciousness is that the tendency is to think of them as mental,
and you‟re right, most of the time, that's really true. But it's not true here. And the
only thing mental about this is that they may bang their head is they are racing
towards something.
This is something to really understand about the difference a quarter brings to the
quality of a cross. When you put this cross into Duality, the Quarter of Duality, you
end up with huge head trips about partnership and the other, and blah, blah, blah.
When you stick it into the mental zone of Initiation, it goes on and on. Here it's just,
let‟s just do something. The doing becomes everything.
When you are on the Cross of Consciousness and you know somebody who's a Sun
in 35, who the same cross as you, they‟re spooky. They seem so much more
unstable. When you meet Crosses of Consciousness they tend to be up in their
heads. It's only natural for them to be there, but they don't seem physically
unstable. But when you meet 35s, there is a frequency to them. It's almost like
they don't have enough time to even be able to breath, let alone reflect, let alone
grasp what the experience is all about so they can be satisfied.

The 1/4 RAC Consciousness 2
If you're a 1/4 the way you're going to understand the necessity for experiences is
by the models that are around you. If you're a male child and you have a father that
appears to take physical risks, then you're going to want to take physical risks.
You're going to want to be able to base yourself on the same platform. When her
father tells stories to you about his youth, you begin to hear about what he
considered the essential experiences and this laid a foundation.
For example, my generation, which was a generation that experimented with drugs,
the moment you have one of these fathers or mothers idealizing that experience as a
developmental reality and you have a 1/4 child, that 1/4 child is always going to feel
like if it doesn't do that it's not getting an essential experience. And of course, that
can be very dangerous obviously.
So one of the things always to keep in mind about 1/4 children, particularly 1/4 but
also the 4/1, this whole recognition of their cultural background and this recognition
of the parents as being very powerful models. If you have a mother that was very,
very prudish and religious as a child and describes experiences relative to that, the
daughter is going to take that as a platform as a 1/4. That may not in fact be her
life at all. And it‟s difficult for these beings to do anything about it. Remember, that
where the 1/3 will investigate to back up its anarchy; in other words, to find
something wrong so it will investigate the wrongness, the 1/4 doesn't do that. It
uses its one gift to substantiate the platform. In other words, it's only looking at
being able to articulate in-depth what its platform is.
We have an expression for that, following in your father's footsteps. And you have
to see that if you‟re the parent of a 1/4 you have to be very careful about what is
described as essential experience. And again, we have certain advantages in our
day and age. They can tune into the media and the media is going to give them
examples of all kinds of coming-of-age experiences.
But we all know that some of the most important experiences we have in our lives
are those experiences that we have just before puberty and just after puberty. And
the kinds of things that were driven to on the experiential plane in order to be able
to prove ourselves. There isn't a culture in the world that doesn't put children
around the age of 12 or 13 or 14 through some kind of maturation ceremony. All of
that is built-in, these essential experiences that you need in order to be able to come
to a place ultimately of maturity. So you have to be very, very careful. Everything
about all of this the right angle will be deeply influenced by the experiences of the
parent.

The 2/4
RAC Consciousness 2
This is an example in which the 2/4 will try to live the platform of its family.
Remember 2/4s like to stay home, like to be nurtured, like to be left alone. But, one
of the most interesting things in this cross is that they are very easily called out of
that. They‟re very, very easily called out of it. If you come in on this cross and
you‟re a 2/4, you need to be called. Most 2/4s, if they're designed to even know
that a call is part of their life, it's mostly like this because of the depth of the
shyness. But this cross changes the configuration. Here what you have is a 2/4 that
can‟t wait for the call, which is often the problem. They can't wait for that call to
come, because they need experience, they want experience.
You come in this cross, Sun in the 35, and all you want to have is experience. You
want to know what it's like to smoke, to make love, to drink, you want to know what
it's like to travel, you want to know things. Cross of Consciousness people want to
know everything. They are the great collective mental explorers. They want to
know everything. You can tell, because 70% of us are programmed with their
garbage. And we end up thinking about all these things that don't matter. It
matters to them; that‟s them.
When you‟re dealing with the 4s, it‟s so obvious that they need to be brought to
experience by the other. It‟s obvious in the 2/4. The call has to come; they have to
be brought to the experience. Whenever I do any kind of course, I‟m always
somebody who goes back to basics. I always say you have your strategy and you
have your authority, you really have to understand if you‟re waiting for a call and
you don't know how to answer that call, that you don‟t know which call is correct,
then the experiential way is full of grave yards. It‟s full of just sheer—I was going to
say stupidity, but it doesn't sound nice—sheer not-selfness, let‟s be sweet. This is a
headlong rush towards experience.

Two-fives have secret experiences. These are the kinds of beings that experiment
with all kinds of mental concepts on their own hidden away. If it was the old days
we‟d talk about witchcraft and all these kinds of strange things that can be done.
The 2/5s tend to look for ways where they are invisible. One of the things to
recognize about the Cross of Consciousnesses is the Cross of Consciousness is deeply
susceptible to the seduction of altered states—drugs, alcohol, trance dancing,
anything that is going to put you into another space. You can see this in the
experiential spiritual function of ancient tribal ceremonies. If you look at, for
example, a lot of African tribes in the way in which they simply jump up and down

for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours on end. You can‟t imagine what
kind of the state you get into.
And it is one of the things about Consciousness beings is that they're very, very
attracted to these frequencies. And they're very attracted to these things that—
there are all kinds of experiences out there. And all kinds of experiences that feed
consciousness. The ideal of the 5 is that the 35 is actually here to remind the rest of
its cross that it can't just be all mental, there has to be an experiential relationship.
You have to be able to do it. It has to be physically concretized. Then you can
reflect on it, then you can be confused, then you can doubt it, but only then is your
confusion and doubt worthy. How many people are doubtful about things that
haven't happened yet? Are confused about things that they don‟t remember? Most
of consciousnesses are working that way. Instead of saying, look, use that gift once
there's something to focus on.
So the 35 is saying the experience is everything, just do the experience. And of
course, with a 2/5, what you know about the 2/5 is that nobody really gets to see
that. They‟re the ones that are jumping up and down in their bedroom every night
trying to get into a trance state. They‟re in another space. They‟re seeking
different kinds of experiences. And again, this era of the Internet is wonderful for
2/5s and 5/2s. Other than chat rooms, they should stay away from chat rooms, but
other than that, this is a great place for them where they‟re really invisible. Two-
fives want to be invisible—don't come near me, you can't see me. You don't know
what's going on. It‟s all okay, I'm fine; worry about the neighbors, don't worry
about me. I‟m fine.

The 3/5
RAC Consciousness 2
There is a delightful confusion between what logic is and what the abstract is.
Abstract people, particularly the not-self, there's always this assumption that the
abstract way of life is somehow logical, which is really illogical. Their assumption is
that if I do this and I do that, if I have this expectation and I do everything I'll get
there, I'll be satisfied. It doesn‟t work that way. It doesn‟t work that way at all.
And here we're dealing with the scientist, the discoverer, the explorer, the discoverer
that can become rich from its discovery. The discoverer that can manipulate the
form, that can work with the matter, all the great things I can say about being a 3,
and there are so many.
And remember that this is about concretizing experience for the benefit of
consciousness. Now, what I'm describing to you is the new age and these people are
responsible and I don't like them for it, but nonetheless, this is really where it comes
from. There are all kinds of experiences that do nothing for the Cross of
Consciousness, do not stimulate it, and do not turn it on because it doesn't stimulate
the consciousness itself. And everything about the 3/5 here is about the possibility,
the very possibility that there are certain kinds of experiences that immediately will
stimulate the consciousness.

Now, so much of the mystical process, the new age formulas, the gurus, the this and
the that, it‟s all about providing you with experiences that are supposed to initiate a
change in your consciousness field. It‟s a program that‟s sold out there by 3/5s until
they lose their reputation. Because of course, what you know is that they think that
they're bringing you into an experience that is going to stimulate your consciousness
and you end up dying. That doesn't help. You end up broke. You're not going to
think about consciousness then; you‟re just going to worry about where all the
money went.
Like my friend of mine in California who sued the Hubbard‟s people, Scientology,
because he paid $20,000 for an enlightenment course and he wasn't enlightened at
the end, so he sued them. They settled out of court. They gave him back his
money. The 3/5s can be so extraordinary. And the jokes I make about 3/5s, please
understand that I make those jokes because I‟m talking about the not-self and this is
a diabolically dangerous not-self. It really is.
You don't want to have a 3/5 Manifestor angry with you. Revenge is their name.
The 3/5, if they are correct, if they operate correctly, what they are going to discover
is that there are values inherent in experiential processes that can expand the
consciousness. Not simply expand the consciousness in the hip sense of that, but
expand the consciousness by being able to show in a concrete way how to deal with
the doubts and confusion of the collective that is the focus of consciousness.
One of these great lines that I've heard lately in movies, it's really wonderful: I
don't believe it, but I know what I‟ve seen. And this is the most wonderful thing for
the Cross of Consciousness to recognize—I don't believe it, I don't understand it, but
I know what I see. And if it is only “I don‟t believe it,” or “I don't understand it,” it
helps nobody and does not expand the consciousness. But when they can say “I
don't believe it, I don't understand it, but I know that I've seen because I've had the
experience,” then they're going to trigger the expansion of the consciousness field.
That's the job.
And it is the potential of the 3/5 to be able to discover these essential ingredients.
When I talk about them being the scientists, if we lived in an idealized Human Design
world and the 3/5 baby comes into the world, you know precisely what direction to
stimulate them to, because they have the perfect makeup for it. They will never be
afraid to find out that something doesn't work. Oh, it‟s what I love about the 3s.
Mentally I am not afraid. You know what for. This is the beauty of the 3. It‟s like, if
it‟s not going to work, what to do. Let‟s just ride the train, let‟s see where it goes.
It‟s a very, very beautiful aspect of them. I would really like to wake up a lot of
3/5s, I must say. We need those that point us towards the experiences that are
truly transcendent. My guidance to anyone coming to Human Design to experiment,
to follow their strategy, to honor their inner authority, this is an experiential path
that is there to stimulate the expansion of their consciousness. And they don't have
to believe it. They don‟t have to understand it. They can simply see what it is.

And this is what this whole process is. This is what the 35 brings to this cross—the
concretization of experience specifically for consciousness expansion. And of course,
what we get is we get these 3/5s on this cross, bringing us to experiences that don't
expand our consciousness, which bore us, that kill us, that dull the nature of the

The 3/6
RAC Consciousness 2
If you meet a 3/6 Cross of Consciousness, Sun in 35 and they‟re 30 years old, give
them an award—a big badge or something, a chocolate bar, a kiss on the cheek.
How difficult it is to find those things as experiences that will expand the
consciousness. You seen how many human beings on this planet are running around
trying to find just that, the people with their extreme sports, with the jumping out of
airplanes, running across hot coals, trekking in the forest, whatever it is, they‟re
looking for that consciousness expanding experience.
And of course, the 3/6 is going to go through a whole broad selection very early in
life and its deepest pessimism is that there wasn't an experience that expanded their
consciousness. How depressing that is. And remember that despite the fact we're
giving the Sun in the 35, they still have the 63 and the 64. How confusing that all is.
Their doubts about their value in this life and whether any of it is worthwhile and it
will there ever be anything for them to do.
The 3 longs for something that it can immerse itself in that despite the little things
that it finds along the way because that's its perfection it stays solid, so they can
grow, that they can stay with something, that their discoveries can be of value, that
they can fulfill the potential of their consciousness, that they can get to a place of
making sense out of things, get to a place of removing their doubts with formulas.
Every time I touch a profile with the 3 there is no other place to go but to go back to
how to how they‟re raised, whether or not they have positive reinforcement in their
life, or they‟re beaten down for their mistakes. If you‟re beaten down for your
mistakes and you‟re a 3/6, the chances are that the experiential way is not going to
be for you.
So many human beings that have been involved in drugs in their life and whether
those drugs are pharmaceutical abuses or whether they are pleasure drugs or
whether it's alcohol or whatever the case may be, so many beings have gone that
way because they have not found in their life experiences that were transforming.
And it is the transforming experience that adds depth to the field of consciousness.
It‟s why we have a human experiential way. So there's enormous pressure on these
35s.

The 4/6
RAC Consciousness 2
The 4/6 is dangerous in on this cross. Again, I‟m talking about the not-self. They‟re
such an influential force and you‟re dealing with something that is so important to
our spirit. In talking about the human experiential way, I'm not just talking about
abstract people and their design, I‟m not just talking about people in this cross, it is
the human experiential way. It deeply conditions all of us. And of course, they are
the font of that conditioning. And as the font of that conditioning they‟re here to
guide us through the conditioning to the transforming experiences. If they don't
operate correctly, you know we're not getting those transforming experiences.
The transforming experience has been reduced to getting 100,000 people to sit
together in a round bowl watching grown up boys kick a ball—the transforming
experience on the mundane plane. Four-sixes influence others. And they influence
others in this context; the influence is what is the transforming experience. The 4/6
with their group of buddies, male or female, mixed or otherwise, and there they are
with this, hey, why don't we all go canoeing next week in the Arctic. They‟re that
kind of force. They‟re saying, look, if we all did that, it would really be great and
exciting and fun. They‟re the engines of the transforming experience. Let‟s all try
this heroin together and see what it's like. They‟re the core of influencing the
transforming experience, and they have a pitch. It‟s the pitch that‟s so devious,
because the pitch is: this is going to change your consciousness.
I've had so much experience in the world of the underworld, the subcultures, the
people pitching their wares, telling you how this is going to alter your consciousness
, that this is the most incredible thing, how this is going to change your life. And
then look at the New Age, wow, do they have transforming experiences for sale.
They have wall-to-wall-to-wall-to-wall transforming experiences. And all it takes is
one not-self 4/6 to go into one of these things and to come out a soldier for Christ.
They come out the door and they go into their local room and say, this is it, this is
the experience, this is the thing, and this is what we have to do.
When you recognize that the transforming experience for most couples is a night out
for dinner or a movie, that we don't have shamanistic rituals and we don't have
stages of transformation built into our societies, that we‟re looking for transforming
experiences everywhere, and we‟re being influenced by these 4/6s, and they are not
pointing us in the right direction, because they didn't start off correct.
And not only that, but when you're dealing with a 4/6 on this cross in their first 30
years, you know that whatever they‟re influencing others to experience, it‟s the
wrong people, because they are the wrong group. They‟ve already made a primary
mistake and they‟re turning people on to an experience that isn't going to be
satisfying or fruitful. And of course, they‟re going to get the backlash for that.

The 6th line cycle, you have these three different parts in the life, but on this
particular cross if they survive, if you can reach them and they're on the roof, the
roof time for them is very transforming. The roof time is when they can begin to
start to accept their 63-64 component. And based on the experiences they've had in
their Saturn cycle, they‟re going to begin this process of reflection and discernment
that begins.
Now obviously, if you haven‟t had the right experiences or you have not seen what in
fact could be the right experience transformed in others because it was the wrong
others you were doing it with, you don't really give yourself much of an opportunity
to gain advantage from that. And remember that for every 6th line being, every
being that has a 6th line in their profile, the most important material years in their
life is the roof period. This is where they're there to take advantage of their 3rd line
theme for the Saturn cycle, learn how to take advantage of the material discoveries
that were there then, and for the transformation toward optimism in that whole
movement to turn it into a material gain.

The 4/1 is a Juxtaposition Cross of Experience. Everything about the 35th gate is so
deeply dominated by the imperative of the 35. I take the assumption that you all
are familiar with Design mechanics.
This is the 35th gate, it is pointed at
the 36, this is a manifesting channel,
it is an emotional manifesting
channel, and it is an emotional
channel rooted in desire and anger.
So, keep in mind how powerful this
35 can be.
Not only that, but when you look at
the chemistry, when you look at
codons, the 35 stands alone. It is a
very, very unusual gate and
chemistry, and it's because it is the
anchor to the world. I‟ve talked
about how maya is concretized
through the 62 that it's concretized
through the metamorphic gates from
the throat center to the ajna. But
one of things to be so clear about is

that the 35 anchors us to the maya, hooks us into it. And because we go through
the process, and we‟re never satisfied it holds onto us until we‟re dead. It‟s really an
anchor.
And everything about being here on Earth is to have experiences that expand your
consciousness. If you want to see something beautiful about the 35th gate, that is
the best way to understand. If you see clearly, the 35th gate is there to make sure
that being on the human experiential way is not simply mundane. It's not about
survival. This is not the spleen. It's all about seeing very clearly that we are here to
experience things so that as a result of the experience we grow in our consciousness.
That is the beauty of that‟s inherent there.
So, when you‟re dealing with the 4/1, you can see very clearly that the 4/1 isn't
going to pay a lot of attention to whether, in fact, the experience is transforming, it‟s
the experience that is everything. Now, that can be very useful if you recognize that
it's not universal. In other words, you can grab a whole bunch of people together
and my constant example is walking on hot coals, and you can influence them to
walk on the hot coals, this is a great transforming experience for you.
Now, know there are there are those that will really resonate to that and it would be
perfect for them. And there are others where it will not be perfect for them; it will
not be a consciousness transforming experience at all. It will be a Medicare hospital
investment, time and therapy, and all those other things. This is the difficulty with
the 4/1. It's not like walking on coals is a bad idea per se per. Some people need
that kind of transforming experience. But the 4/1 does not pay attention to that. It
says, well; you know.
I have a nice affinity with 4/1s. I‟m a 5/1; we‟re very close together as a frequency.
And there is this part of me that has always been like that; well, they don‟t get it,
okay. What to do. At least I‟m aware. I have to be because I‟m a 5. The 4/1 isn‟t
even aware that, it's just, here‟s the experience. And somebody comes over to the
4/1 and says that their feet have been seriously burned. And they hear it and then
they turn their head and look for the ones that are still walking. That‟s none of my
business. If their feet are burning, it‟s not my problem. My problem is to get them
to walk on the coals. This is the experience.
They can be very spooky. Four-ones like this, ah, this is the way and if you don't do
this you'll never be a woman, you'll never be a man, you‟ll never know, you'll never
find out that this is the answer. And funny enough, they never do it with you. It‟s
interesting. They never do it with you. This guy who is telling you to walk on the
coals, he's wearing his fuzzy slippers, standing on the cool grass, saying, oh, it‟s
easy, go ahead.

The Left Angle Cross of Separation 1
 5  47
The 5/1
The Left Angle Cross of Separation is not an easy thing. When you look at what's
coming next, I just want to give you a sense of the movement, when you look at
what's coming next, you have the 45 coming. Oh, is the 45 ever possessive, oh, is
the 45 ever concerned about: don‟t tell me about all these new experiences you want
to do to raise your consciousness unless I can profit from it, unless we can all profit
from it, unless it‟s good for the tribe, and so forth and so on, because this whole
quarter is about concretizing.
Every time all of these crosses are leaning towards this manifested, manifested,
manifested and the two most powerful ones are the 35 and the 45. They‟re the most
powerful ones because they are manifesting forces. The 35 with its emotional power
and the 45 with its heart center ego
power. You know very well that
when a 35 heretic shows up they are
going to send you on a wave of a
journey to find yourself. If you have
a 35 heretical master, that heretical
master is going to send you to an
experience that will take you into
the depths and then raise you up or
raise you up and smash you into
the depths, one or the other; the
emotional pattern.
And it‟s one of the strongest
messages that the heretic has. It
says, the experiential way, you learn
from pain, you learn from the
travail, the effort, all of those things.
But separation; what the heretic
knows is that every human being
has built into them the openness to
a transforming experience. And the great difficulty that the 5/1 has with
consciousness people is that because of that collective quality it seems like that
they're just throwing out all these generalized experiences.
But the 5/1 knows something else. It knows that the only experience worth
happening is the experience that leaves you absolutely alone. The only transforming
experience is what transforms you. It‟s your transformation. It‟s only for you and
you've got to live it, go through it on your own. It is the 5/1 on this cross that says
to you that God helps those who help themselves. This is another kind of process.

It is saying, look, I‟ll take you to the water. I‟m not going to drink for you. I tell you
that all the time. I‟m a classic 5/1. I say here, here it is, but I'm not going to
experiment for you. You experiment for yourself.
And you can see that in is whole era of the Cross of Planning, the way in which the
consciousness field has been expanded is that there is this generalized experiential
field, but at the same time, there are these heretical forces that are saying, look,
don‟t do it with everybody else, here is something just for you. Don't trust
somebody else to get into that place of consciousness transformation. Don‟t depend
on somebody else to get you there.
Now, remember this is the 35th gate, it is a collective gate. The keynote is to share.
You can‟t imagine how heretical the 5/1 is here. They‟re incredibly heretical.
They‟re saying yeah, you can share going across the river with somebody else, but it
will only be transforming for you. It may never be transforming for them. And if
you're waiting for them to be transformed, you‟re never going to be transformed.
This is heretical. And it is this oddity about the 35; it is a singularity as a chemistry.
There is at the peculiarity to it. We don't have a lot of 5/1 heretics on the Cross of
Separation that are teaching us that to be transformed in form means that you have
to have your own experience, your own personal transforming experience. It's very
difficult when everybody else is doing something; they're all grouped into the
experiences together. It is very difficult for the conditioned being to say, I don't
want to share with you, I want my own experience. I want my own formula. I want
to go through my own process.

The 5/2
LAC Separation 1
The 5/2 is really the Buddha the cave. It says what are you looking at me for? You
think that you're going to be able to get access to my light? It is my light. And the
fact that you light is only a projection. You want to see light around me. And so you
see light. So why should I give you any, when you've already taken it; go away.
The old Zen language tricks.
This is the 5/2 Separation. The 5/2 Separation says, I'm not interested in all of
those transforming experiences that are going out. Imagine trying to invite a 5/2 to
join you in a sweat lodge, this male trip that's become popular—a whole bunch of
flabby urbanites sweating together in one of these sweat lodges. I can't imagine
anything more grotesque, absolutely grotesque, absolutely. What a smell, the whole
thing, the hell with it.
I remember the first time I arrived in Sedona I was invited to one of those. I said,
no, no, not interested, thank you very much. I don‟t want to be there. I‟m a 5, I
don‟t want to be there. I‟m quite paranoid about what‟s going to happen to all those
beings when they go crazy from the heat. I don‟t want their transforming
experience.

So, when you‟re dealing with a 5/2, don‟t even send them an invitation. It's not like
you have to worry about whether they're coming or not; they're not. Not only do
they want their own transforming experience, they want a transforming experience
that is so special that maybe one day it'll be useful for someone else.
One of things that I noticed about the difference between 5/1s and 5/2s is that 5/2s
can always be the heretic for one person. When I say one, I could be a couple of
people over their life, three or four people over their lifetime. But they always have
this capacity, there is always somebody that has the chemical key that opens up the
2nd line unconscious and manages to get in there and manages to find out, wow, you
really did that? I didn‟t know that you do that. That's incredible, what was that like?
Well, it transformed my consciousness. And the one thing that one person has to
recognize that the 5/2 will tell, the 5/2 will say, don‟t you tell anybody about this.
And particularly don‟t tell your mother. Nothing would make them more paranoid
than if that story got out.
So they‟re very, very selective about who they're heretical for. Again, at the not-self
level. But if you really have a 5/2 that‟s self-motivated and awake, this will be their
magic. We don't expect them to go out there. We have suckers like me, these 5/1s
that were designed for this trip. The 5/2s are designed to be of a heretical value in
specialized situations, in practical situations for just those right people. So, when
you‟re dealing with a 5/2 Separation, if you're lucky enough to meet one like that as
a kid, there is somebody that will take you into their magical world and they will give
you something that can really transform you, open up your consciousness.
I think a lot of you may jump to conclusions about this term: opening up your
consciousness. Teaching a child how to read is a form principle that opens up their
consciousness. There are so many essential experiences in life that expand our
consciousness. So, I don‟t want you to get carried away with just my humor and the
esoteric and all of that stuff. I really wanted to see that we're talking about the
essential experiences.
Remember, the right angle Cross of Consciousness is only going to serve us well
when what it ponders is what is real in the world. In other words, it has to have a
solid basis of experience before it can come to reasonable conclusions. So, it‟s
important that we have this 35 energy regardless of whether it's in its right angle,
juxtaposed or left angle configuration, the 35 standing on its own in its chemistry
driving everything towards experience. The generalized experiences, we have to
transform all of our children, it‟s against the law not to. We have to teach them all
how to read. There are these generalizing transforming experiences that are rooted
in what the right angle brings. But the left angle says, look, there are other
transforming experiences, experiences that can transform your spirit, experiences
that can transform your form. There are all these experiences that can be there for
you separately.
The abstract process is very misleading. You look at the human experiential way and
you think that this is a collective sharing experience. And whenever you look at the
human experiential you always see the binary walking alone. There is always the

sharing that looks like it's taking place. But every 5th line knows that that‟s not real.
Every 5th line knows that the quality of the experience is always individual and
separate. What is transforming for one being means nothing to another.
I remember one day in the early years I visited a friend of mine and he was one of
these meditation gurus, and he had stuff going on here for years. And there would
be 40 or 50 people and they‟d be meditating in the backyard. After awhile you‟d see
about a third of them were asleep. And it‟s sort of like, well yeah, I'm sure it was
restful for them.
A transforming experience is not a collective thing. And of course, we keep on trying
to make it so, because that's what the right angle wants. The right angle doesn't
understand that via transpersonal karma what the 5th line does is that it understands
that there are unique transforming experiences. What a mess the world would be in
if the Voice visited everybody today. Planetary fried soup for breakfast; there are
certain transforming experiences are really personal. And this is the 5th line heresy.
It says, yes, yes, yes, yes, we are equal but some of us are different. It's nice that
we have equal transforming blah, blah, blah.

The 6/2
LAC Separation 1
The 6/2 at the unconscious level is very democratic. Oh, yes, well, maybe—when
they‟re 3/2s, there is always this, well maybe what's transforming for me really can
be transforming for you even though I saw that it wasn't, but it was for me. It‟s like
this, well, maybe it could be, and maybe this could be of value to you.
The 6/2 has to embody transforming experience. And I don't think that there is any
better description of what a 6th line being is supposed to be. And I don't think
there's any activation of the Sun in a gate that has more pressure than to be a 6/2
on the Cross of Separation. If you‟re a 6/2 on the Cross of Separation and you have
not had that defining experience that transformed your consciousness so that you
could escape the burden of your first 30 years, that you could find equilibrium in the
optimism of your roof and come to a point where you can come off that roof as an
integrated being, well, you're really going to suffer. Usually they just kill them off—
disease, premature senility, all kinds of nice things to punish them.
The 6/2s are here to be the embodiment of their authority, their unique,
differentiated authority. They don't care about what the other sees or doesn't see.
They‟re not here to reflect and engage in the observer/observed game. They are
simply here to be the embodiment of separation. The highest wisdom you can reach
is that you get to a point where you get to the furthest extremities of the duality.
On one side of the duality we are absolutely alone; absolutely, absolutely,
absolutely. Nobody gets into this box. No matter how well you know your design,
my design you‟re never going to get in here. You‟ll never know this thing. This thing
is totally separate from that thing and those things and whatever. They are. And in

the absolute there is no other place to go with our consciousness than the
recognition that we are absolutely differentiated and unique, separation.
And the moment that you get to that far end over there of separation, you
immediately see that you belong to everything. And you can‟t belong to everything.
You can‟t be one with everything. You cannot be part of the wholeness until you get
to the extreme. This is a fundamental duality. We live in a dense illusion of
separateness, yet nothing is separate.
So the ultimate experiential process is that experience that brings you to such a
deep place of separation that you recognize your connection to everything. It‟s why
I love going around the wheel. You go around the wheel, you hit all of these points,
they‟re all interesting, they‟re all different and yet the magic that they all fit together
into this whole. And despite what we can see in anyone's life that lives on any cross,
regardless of what they're experiencing, they‟re part of this whole vast orchestrated
magic.
Six personalities make a lot of mistakes in the first part of their life. And if you‟ve
got a 3rd line personality and you make a lot of mistakes in the first part of your life
you‟re much more resilient that the 6th line being who makes a lot of mistakes in the
first part of their life. It‟s very, very difficult to discover those defining experiences
that illuminate the separateness. And the tendency in so many 6/2s on this cross
because of what happens to them in the first part of their life is to end up being
deeply dependent on the other. There is nothing sadder than seeing a role model
being dependent on the other for an example. And they don't last long; they don't,
they can't. After all, there is enormous pressure on anyone who has a 6th line in
their profile. There is an enormous pressure on the mutative process.

The 6/3
LAC Separation 1
When you‟re a 6/2 and particularly a 6/3 on this cross and you‟re differentiated and
you‟re separate and you‟re operating is an example, you realize something. If the
expansion of consciousness does not provide for what you need it was a waste of
time. There are so many people that claim to have transforming experiences that
awakens some kind of insight into their inner nature or whatever. But in fact, the
only value of a consciousness transforming experience is to lead you to a place of no
resistance on the material plane.
It‟s my lesson that I always teach people about the value of being yourself. The
value of being yourself is that you reduce the resistance. And in reducing the
resistance it is easier for you to accumulate the material that you need. This is the
form principle we‟re talking about. This is civilization. And the form principle
operates on material. And material needs to be constantly replenished. It has an
enormous appetite, this manipulation of the material world, this insistence that all of
us as forms have to expand so much energy in order to maintain our material well-
being.

If the Voice had come to me and had given me some cosmic fairytales and some
mystical bullshit and stuff, I never would've told anybody. I never would have been
interested. What‟s so interesting about the knowledge that was given is how
practical it is in the real world, how practical it is on mundane plane. I could spend
my whole life teaching Design from the most mundane level of type and authority,
while at the same time knowing that this is the most extraordinary revelatory
interview of the nature of being that‟s ever come down the chute. And yet, that's
not what really makes it important. It just verifies it for those of us that insist on
needing proof.
But the thing that‟s so magical about it is that the transformation of the
consciousness is actually just about making your life better on the mundane plane.
And in making your life better and more efficient, in bringing less resistance into
your life as you decondition, it increases your material potential and increasing the
benefits you derive from your interactions.
This is what the 6/3 on this cross is looking for. It says, okay, that‟s really nice, I've
had a wonderful transforming experience, I feel very much alone, but I'm hungry,
and where am I going to get dinner. I'm hungry. So when you're up there on this
cross and you're sitting on top of all of this, the experience is everything, the
experience is everything, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But the experience isn‟t everything. It isn‟t. There are a lot of experiences that
aren‟t worth having. And of course if we don't have 3s that really make any sense,
because they are so messed up, we don't have people that are screaming from the
rooftop, literally screaming from the rooftop, you‟re spending your money on the
wrong thing. Don‟t waste your money on that nonsense. That isn't going to help
you in your life; it isn't going to make you a better salesman, Harry. It isn‟t going to
bring home the bacon.
Oh, how I love the mundane. There is nothing I like better than washing dishes; Mr.
Hu in his kitchen washing dishes. We have a dishwasher; I will not use it. I'm a
freak. There I am washing the dishes, and with two children you know how many
dishes you get all day long on. It‟s wonderful. It‟s absolutely delightful. There is
nothing like it.
There is this assumption that awakeness is some kind of a white robed nunu, in a
lotus position and fluffing away in the flower patch. And it isn‟t; it‟s doing the
dishes. It's filling up the car at the gas station. It‟s taking your kids to school. It‟s
dealing with birth and death and life; ordinary life; simple life, basic life, family, love,
friendship, all of these things are part of what we see that is life around us. And we
forget that. Those that think they're on some kind of path, they life their noses to
those things. They think they have to be aesthetes in the Himalayas. It‟s not true.
And of course, this is the magic that's possible when the 6/3, high up on this
experiential: oh, aren‟t we terrific, we did it. And it‟s looking over there and it‟s
seeing the 45 with its accounts book. We have a minus this month. No, I don‟t care
that you walked on coals, you idiot. Do me a favor; just do your job better.

How many husbands and wives have had to deal with their parents coming back
from that big weekend, that transforming esoterically weekend. And on Monday
morning it‟s the same problems—we need this, we need that, we‟ve got to do this,
we‟ve got to do that. And you see right away that none of those experiences are
transferable to the mundane plane.
I used to tell the story about the lama, this young lama who was very brilliant and is
able to get to the position of teacher and he‟s only 17 years old. And before they
would give him a posting they sent him off to New York City to work at
Bloomingdale's wrapping gifts. It‟s a big department store. It‟s an apocryphal story,
but it really is the point. The point is that if you cannot bring what you learn in this
classroom into your day-to-day life, this is useless knowledge. What I love about
Human Design is that its application is tediously mundane, right down to the
minutiae of the mundane plane, because this is the maya and the maya is mundane.
That‟s what maya is.
So, there is a magic that is there when you see this movement from the 35 to 45
and it‟s never really what you think. It‟s simply reality raising its head. It's the
reality of the tribe saying, the collective, these people are nuts. They‟re out there
fluffing around and we‟re down here planting corn and dealing with the real world
and the real problems. And in our world the only transforming experience that we
applaud is that you got promoted at work, that you got a bonus from the boss. That
you got that second job, thank you, honey. Fatten up that old bank account so that
we can have that vacation, that “this,” that “that,” and the other.
I'm not interested in a global ashram with all kinds of people in tutus with gooey
looks in their eyes hanging out and waiting for the next word of wisdom, these do-
nothings, these bums sitting there on the floor waiting wisdom. They left behind
their children, their friends, their families, their jobs. It‟s here in the world every
day. The deeper you are in the mundane plane, the more comfortable you are in
this mundane plane, the healthier you are. It is our maya. In the embrace of the
maya is everything.
So, at the end of this process with all of this pushing to experience this, experience
that, this is going to make a difference, and this is going to bring you the revelations
you need, and this is going to do that, the judge of all that is can you survive with
this knowledge. Does this knowledge help you find your value, your purpose, what
you need, your material balance and on and on and on. It‟s the money, honey.

Introduction
The 45 has a difficult position. It has to be very, very concerned with the material.
So it needs a great deal of yin in order to ground it on the material plane. And yet
the only way that you can truly be in control of material is if you know how to make
material grow. In other words, you know how to bring in more material, motivate
others for more material, whatever the case may be. Think about the nature of the
45. This is Gathering Together; this is the only throat gate expression of ego
circuitry. It is the only voice the tribe has. After all, most tribal communication is
tactile. The only voice of the tribe is a voice that says “I have or I don't have.”
There is nothing more possessive, which is something we will see when we get to the
juxtaposition.
And yet, at the same time the 45, despite the fact that it's there to gather the
material also has a responsibility as the ruler of the tribe. This is the expression.
This is the potential manifestation of the tribal ego. All 45s are born with a sense,
earned or not, of entitlement. They all assume that they‟re kings or queens
somewhere inside of them genetically. And that having and not having is going to be
a major question in their lives. If you come into this round and you incarnate with
your Sun in 45, you are going to be driven on the plane of material as power. This is
material as power. And this is why you have these necessary yang aspects. That is
the application of the yin, the way to penetrate with the yin.
I always find it interesting to look at the four gates of rulership and think about what
leadership really means. When you look at the 26, the polarity of the 45, you're
looking at rulership through bullshit, rulership through salesmanship, rulership
through jingoism, rulership through nationalism, rulership through fanaticism,
rulership driven by the tribal sword.
When you look at the 22nd gate you can see that rulership to be truly mutative must
be willing to listen. And if you don't know how to listen you can never truly know
how to rule. And the other thing is, the magical gift, the polarity to that 22, the 47,
one of those truly important keys to understanding what rulership is is the ability to
make sense out of nonsense. Ah, such a gift. To be a ruler that can make sense of
the nonsensical, to make sense out of the irrational, to make sense out of blunders,
this whole “making sense out of” is one of those key ingredients.
And when you look at rulership in that way, the only ruler that most of us want to
trust is the 22. Those are the rulers. And you see when we have already been there
with our 22 ruler, if you listen too much, the listeners will overwhelm you. The
speakers will overwhelm you, you lose out on rulership. Rulership is all of this. And
when you're dealing with a 45 you're dealing with the concretization of rulership. It
can be as simple as having a thing on your desk that says the buck stops here, or
drinking out of a mug that says I'm the boss. This is typical 45.
If it weren‟t for the 45 we would never have titles. Never, never, never; you wonder
where titles come from—the Duke and Duchess of whatever—this is a 45 trip. As a

matter of fact, you can buy these things today. You can buy titles. It‟s up for sale.
It‟s a typical 45 game. You want to pretend that somewhere in your blood was
rulership, and for 45s that's enough. My great, great, great, great, great, great
grandfather was a butcher and his people loved him.
When the Voice told me about the WA, and the WA is a very strange thing, what
surprised me most of all was the accentuation on the 45th gate and this deep
potential within the 45 to be transformed from “I have” to “we have.” This “we have
or we don't have” is not something that is particularly easy for humans to get to.
It‟s very much connected to our mutative process deep into the future and what the
45 will mean in an entirely different vehicle and form, what the Voice call the Eron.
The 45 has a dilemma. And it is a dilemma that it shares in away with Manifestors.
The 45 has lost its power and it‟s lost its power to the 31 and it doesn't like it. And it
is something to recognize. The 45 is the blood ruler—the ruler dies and the son
replaces him, or a daughter. This is the tribal rulership. This is based on territory
and wealth and control. And of course, we have many examples of that in the world.
We still have kinds whose sons inherit their thrones, like Abdullah of Jordan. We
have dictators whose sons inherit their dictatorships like we have with Kim in Korea
and Assad in Syria, there are all kinds of examples of that manifestation of 45
politics.
But the 31 has grown an enormous power. This is the collective leader. This is the
so-called democratic model, even though the collective leader can be a dictator.
Still, we have moved towards the collective leader, as opposed to the tribal leader.
You can see that schism in the American Revolution from the English. They had a
mad king. It was obvious he was; he was syphilitic and crazy. He wandered around
speaking bad German. He was out of his mind; he was a nut. And the Americans
who were nothing but run-away religious fanatics who had settled in America, most
of them with Calvinist roots, they were really not interested in having 45-hierarchical
rulership. They wanted to have collective rulership. They wanted to be able to
choose their king.
This was a marking line with the French Revolution, the revolutions in Europe in the
1840s, there was this enormous movement in which the 45 began to lose its hold, so
now basically, most of those bloodlines that have remained are tourist attractions.
Buckingham Palace makes a lot of money. You go to the palace in Madrid and it
makes a lot of money. These are constitutional monarchs. They‟ve given up their
45 power; they accept the control of the 31 leadership.
So whenever you're dealing with a 45, I want you to understand something. There
is a part of them that hates the collective leadership process. I don‟t want to have
unions says the 45 entrepreneur. I want slaves. I don‟t want unions. I don‟t want
any collective bargaining. I don't care what they all think. I know what's good for
them. And of course, this is one of the themes of the 45—I know what's good for
you. At its most exalted, the responsibility of the 45 is that you're only allowed to
collect taxes if you will build schools. If you educate your people, if you give them
advantages over other tribes then as a ruler you‟re going to be praised. Any dictator
that'll put a chicken in every pot are going to be praised by the people.

The 1/3
Look at the chop. Where‟s the 1, where‟s the 3? They‟re yin lines. Something to
keep in mind, the synthesis of Human Design, there is a magic after you've looked at
a hundred thousand charts, God knows how many charts I‟ve looked at, there is a
certain magic, after all, where everything just synthesizes. All of these layers, all
these levels, all the things that I
teach, they come out of the synthesis
that's already that knowing in me.
And when I look at a chop like that
and I'm talking about a profile, all
you have to do is see. You can see
that it‟s very yin. It‟s very self-
absorbed; it‟s still in the process.
And the process of the 1/3, 45 is:
How do I get money out of them? No
joke; that‟s their job, after all. If
you're a 45 you‟re here to gather
together. They are gatherers.
When you look at the 45/21 you see
the original hunter/gatherer—the 21
hunter, the 45 gatherer—and what
we know is that we need both. We
need a balance of them; we need the
juxtaposition of them. And the
juxtaposition of the hunter with the
gatherer is the channel of materialism. Never forget that. The ruler in the 45 is the
one that must rule the material plane. Boy, do these people suffer on the material
plane. I know so many 45s that suffer so much from not having the material they
think they deserve. It‟s all relativity.
So the 1/3, the 1st line, you want to understand how this works. The 1/3 child on
this cross tries to figure out where the money comes from. I had this wonderful
experience with my daughter when she was five years old and I was divorced from
her mother and it was a period of time when she was living with me. There was a
dinner party at my house and there were some friends over. My wife, the one at the
time, there was a conversation going on about work and making money and what it
was like to make money. My daughter is a 45/21. She said, “My mother doesn't
work.” And all of a sudden there's silence at this table. She said, “She just goes to
the bank.” There are so many jokes that line. Let us understand the 45. For her,
this is where you got money. It's like, why are you working? My mother just goes
to the bank. There‟s an easier way to gather money.

Gathering Together
This is what a 45 wants to know. Where does it come from and how do you get it?
So, if you‟re a 1/3 you recognize certain things. A 1/3, 45 child is very likely to
participate in very, very—I don‟t want to make this a big deal—very, very minor little
thefts when they‟re small; the kind of thing where you see a nickel on your mother's
dresser and you take it. Money does grow on trees, and it‟s irresistible. It‟s like, it‟s
mine. I saw it, I got it, and it‟s mine, right? Did you take any money? No, no, no.
The 45 child when it‟s 15 saying, I want to go to Harvard. And what it would cost to
send that child to Harvard is more than the father earns. This is the 45 sense of
entitlement, aside from the fact that it‟s failing high school.
So one of the things about the 1/3 is that the 1/3 is going to go through this trial
and error process and it‟s very frustrating for children. Money is fascinating. I have
watched with incredible—I don‟t know how to describe that—to watch the way in
which my children learned how to see money is such a strange thing to watch, the
way in which it becomes a force, and then to try to figure out how does all that work.
What is it really, where does it come from? After all, to a child, it‟s very difficult to
understand that money is nothing more than energy converted into a formula. They
don‟t get that. They really don‟t.
And one of the things that the 45 has to learn is that it has to recognize that money
isn‟t something that is just there to be gathered, that there‟s an assumption that it‟s
going to be given to you, that there‟s an assumption that you deserve it. The
cruelest thing for the 45 is to recognize that they have to work. Oh, that‟s cruel.
It‟s like your daddy owns half the world and in order for you ever to have the chance
to be the Chairman of the Board you have to start off in the shipping department and
spend 20 years working your way up the ladder. For a 45, this is the right to kill
your father. It‟s mine; I want it now.
So the 1/3 can discover all kinds of ways to gather. It‟s one of their gifts. And
remember something about the 45 as a rulership gate in this quarter. It‟s not about
how you rule. It‟s not about making sense of things for the people or listening to the
people or motivating the people. It has nothing to do with any of that. Nobody can
be a ruler without enough money; no one at no time ever in the history of humanity.
Money is power. The control of resources is power, absolutely. I control the
resources of Human design knowledge. Oh boy, do I make money from that. Don‟t
you forget about what the whole material way is about. Rulership isn‟t about style
here. People with the 45 and they think they‟re born to be a ruler. They speak the
ruler‟s language. Money; it‟s all about money. At least it is in terms of how we see
things today.
I love geo-politics and I follow it literally globally, and to see the extreme of this
philosophy. In American politics, George Bush has raised one quarter of a billion
dollars for advertising. How do you compete with a billion dollars worth of
advertising? How does anybody compete with that? Jesus, if the devil spent that
much money on advertising he‟d do better than the Church. That‟s a fortune, truly a
fortune. And it will probably keep him in power. You really have to understand—
why do you think these guys in the Third World don‟t want to give up once they‟ve
been President. Their pockets are full. They don‟t want to give up filling up those

pockets. So they hold an election so that they can become President for life, so that
their son or daughter—it‟s usually a son—can inherent it and go on.
It‟s money. And whoever has the most money has the most power. How sad; what
to do. It‟s in the program, after all. If you have any complaints about the way the
world works, it‟s not us. It‟s not like we can do without that. I just want you to
understand it for what it is.
So the 1/3 is going to go through a process where they‟re going to be deeply, deeply
upset by the fact that every time they try to figure out how to gather they run into
problems, it doesn‟t seem to work. It ends up costing them more than they get. I
know so many 45s who go into businesses in which they‟re always putting in more
than they get. They don‟t know how to do it. This is one of the things about seeing
what it means to be tribal. Without the support, without the 21, without the tribe
behind them it doesn‟t work.
And this is one of the things where you have to look at the 1/3 and you have to
understand something. You have a 1/3 on this cross, don‟t focus on the material;
focus on their education. The best rulers are here to serve the consciousness of their
people. This goes back to the soul of the I‟Ching and what it means to be a
principled ruler, what it is to be a correct ruler. This goes back to the ideal of the
European enlightenment, this idea that you could have the enlightened king, the
enlightened prince, this dream of humanity that rather than ruling because of power,
one is ruling because one truly cares about the people.
And we know that if we take away our cynicism, that in most cases it is a mix of
these things. And so many people who enter into the political realm, the rulership
game, enter in quite naïve, truly wanting to be of service to humanity and how
quickly they‟re corrupted by the process, because the process demands that if you
don‟t have the resources nobody is going to pay attention to you. It‟s not about
controlling the hearts of the people. It‟s about controlling the pocketbook of the
people.

The 1/4
RAC Rulership 2
All 1/4s obviously are very much conditioned by the nature of the environment that
they're growing up in. And one of the things to see it in the context of rulership is
that whenever you're dealing with a 1, whether it's the 1/3, the 1/4, the 4/1, the 5/1
that the theme here is education. It has to be education. It's the only thing that will
save them. One of the most important things for anyone that is born of the Cross of
Rulership is that they are well-educated. If they're not well-educated, if they don't
get a balance in their education, they‟re going to be very distorted in the way in
which they use their power. And it‟s an essential balance that they need.
If you spend a lot of time educating them you‟re going to have less conflicts with
their need to be in control. Remember that all 45s are born to be conditioned by the

21st gate. All 45s dream of being in control. And 45 children would like nothing
better than to be able to control their parents, control the way they work and control
their money. After all: I need, give me.
These are not children that you can successfully ask to do things. These are not
children that are going to appreciate chores and earning money by doing their
chores. This is the kind of child where it will say to you, if it could, all right, I‟ll
accept this offer to do chores, but let me find a friend of mine who will do it for 10%
less than you're offering me so that I can make a profit on their labor, because that's
what they would really like to say. I don‟t want to do that. But I‟ll train somebody
how to take out our garbage. I‟ll train them how to cut the lawn. I will offer them
the education and in return, well okay, I take my share. After all, they have
something to do.
Now their parents would not appreciate that. At least most wouldn‟t. It‟s not the
point with them. It'll make things worse with them. These are not children that
need a reward system. It is going to be ineffective. What they really need is simply
to be focused on the fact that their natural rulership is in their smarts. This is what‟s
so important as a conditioning element for these children. When they talk about,
and they will, oh I wish I had one million dollars, or I wish that you were rich,
Momma, or I wish—all of that stuff. Your thing with them is it's not about that. If
you really go deep, become really smart and do really well in school you'll see you
are going to find your power.
And it's this movement towards the educational side. Remember the 45 is two
things. It gathers together, but in order for it to be able to continue to gather
together it's got to give something back. That‟s the whole dilemma with the 45. The
45 can never see anything as all mine. They can‟t. That‟s where the root of the
“we” is. It always has to give something back.
So, when it comes to education, that taking in, this takes them to that side of the
giving back, that they get educate others, that they can teach others. And this is
where the 45 is beautiful, because they have a real power of being able to bring
together their tribe, their group, their friends, their circle, their whatever and be able
to give them the benefit of that education, that training, that direction, all these for a
price. But that's okay.
But the moment you don't focus them on that, and after all, we're going to have a lot
of these in the world, and so many of them are going to be the Third and Fourth
World. It‟s not like they're going to have those advantages. I can't imagine that a
45, 1/4 little girl born in Bangladesh is necessarily going to get an opportunity to
have an education to be focused in that way. She‟s going to be totally obsessed with
finding ways to make money because she lives horrendous poverty.
The moment you move the 45 to the material side early in their life, the moment you
start making deals with them, the moment you start creating this “you‟ve got to
work for this and you‟ve got to work for that,” boy do you have problems. You‟re
going to have children that are obsessed materially. You‟re going to have children

that are unreliable materially. They‟re going to be driven by a need for
possessiveness to have things that don't necessarily need, all of this stuff.
So, the real key for the 1st line is that you just move them towards the education.
You want power? Be smart. Smart people are the ones who get rich now, and that‟s
true. It‟s the smart ones that get rich now. It‟s the ones that transform their ideas
into something, that each individual mind now is one of the most important business
assets in the world. And this is a way in which we can enrich the 45s life and we can
give them a whole new direction. But again, remember so many 45s are coming into
the world and they're only going to the power side, the material power side of what
this gate is about.

The 2/4
RAC Rulership 2
The 2nd line is the line of the Democrat. So the 2/4 says I don‟t want to rule. I don‟t
want to get into all of that. I would like to have the power. But I really don't know
how to give anything back. This is the whole thing about the not-self 2/4. The not-
self 2/4 doesn‟t know how to give anything back. It‟s a depleator of resources. It
stays locked away in its environment and it does the best it can to find resources
that will keep it going. It‟s very clever at being able to get just enough resources
just to be able to maintain its leave-me-alone state.
A philosophy of let the other rule can be quite dangerous. And there is no way that
you can take the 2/4 on the Cross of Rulership and you can point it towards the
great rewards of study. That is not going to work at all. And I think it's true for all
2/4s, that there was a piece of advice that they need to hear as soon as they can
actually hear it. And that advice is don't worry, the call will come, whatever it will
be. And it's true.
It‟s one of the things to see about these children. They are not going to be caught
up materially as long as they have the basics of what they need. If they don't, that
may be an engine of calling them out and then of course they can get very involved
on the material plane. Two-four children in the Third World are out there working;
they‟re called early. They‟re enforced to. In the West we have a very different
relationship with our 2/4 children. In most cases, they‟re not forced out into the
material world. And they learn how to gather together in a very special way, a
natural way.
Often when you meet a 2/4 you wonder how they survive. They have their way.
These are the kind of people that will write a book about how to visit Europe on one
dollar a day, how to stay overnight in a five-star hotel for three-star rates. And
that's the magic of the 2/4. The ultimate magic of the 2/4 is that I can have
anything that your money can buy and I can get it cheaper. And I don‟t have to give
anything back. You can bet I'm not going to give the same kind of tip to the guy
who drags my bags that you would, and so on and so forth. It‟s a very different
game.

technologies we have, and that 2/4s, 2/5s, 6/2s, 5/2s have a tendency to be behind
closed doors, and in this age behind closed doors in front of computer screens that
there are very tricky things that can be done. It was like that bank embezzlement
that took place in Germany somewhere, some clerk in a bank, and basically what he
was doing was that he was taking one tenth of a percentage point off daily interests,
off of savings accounts that were all in the bank. Now, it was so small as a fraction
you didn‟t see it. Nobody noticed. He was taking in about 600,000 deutsche
marks—it's an old story—about €300,000 a year and nobody noticed for years and
years. Nobody noticed.
Now, that‟s a 2/4 crime. They‟re sneaky bastards, you know. You don‟t know what
they‟re doing behind those doors. And if you‟re looking at the world of viruses you‟re
looking at 4s. And if you‟re looking at the world of computer viruses you're looking
at 2/4s, and I know a number of 2/4 hackers. So, this is just a sidebar into
understanding the 2/4.
Again, the not-self will lead to many things. I just want it to be clear that when it
comes to the 2/4 on this cross it is not easy for them to really participate in what
that energy is. There is this pull back for them. And because this is a child that can
be directed to its power through its educational possibilities, the only thing that's left
open is that material becomes everything for them. And of course, that's just as
unhealthy.
So, the reality is that when you're dealing with a 2/4 here, the one thing that you
have to be able to do is that you have to be able to randomly support them as
they're growing up. That‟s very important, that randomly. In other words, there is
no set pattern to it. There is no reliability to it. There is no promise of any more.
But this is one of the things that will keep a 2/4 from exploring how to bring in
resources in a way that is not healthy.
The other thing is to recognize that ultimately 2/4s as they mature, one of their
great gifts is to understand how you can get resources out of something. There was
a productivity advertisement, I thought was hilarious. One of these international
satellite networks, and it was a story of a guy that worked for a company in
Albuquerque, New Mexico that bottled olives, sold olives to people. He was the head
of some kind of productivity department in the business and the company had a
contest to see who could bring in new efficient ideas. Now, if I've ever seen a 2/4
business acumen this was it. His idea was take one olive out. Hey, they won‟t care.
Like the bank thief, they won‟t care, take one olive out. What‟s so amazing to me
that this is advertised and publicized. The company made an extra million dollars a
year.
This is 2/4; this is what a 2/4 can figure out. Ah, you don‟t have to do any more
work. You don‟t have to say new and improved. You don‟t have go into
developmental costs. Overnight; take out one olive, man. Everybody's happy; he

got a raise. He even got his face on an advertisement. And I think, are they nuts.
Do they not understand what this principle means?
I'm a coffee lover. I used to by a tin of coffee like this, and it was full to the top.
Now, these tins are still the same size. They‟re all still the same size. None of them
are filled to the top. Some of them are only half full and you‟re still paying the price
plus inflation over 20 years for the damn tin. These tines are made of gold. It's
amazing. This is 2/4 rulership materialism. Sell them the same can, put a little bit
less in, they don‟t notice.
Try this, go to the coffee shelf, get all the cans, and look for, because you have to
find it, it‟s the law, they have to print it, look for where they actually tell you how
much is in these so-called 1litre cans or whatever name they give them. It has
nothing to do with the size of the can; it‟s supposed to contain that amount. And
they‟re all different. And there are fools out there that say, sure.
Have you ever thought about the price of fuel? Living here in Europe and driving a
car is really a huge investment in the state, not in keeping your car going, mean the
taxes are about 80%, so you end up paying fortunes. It‟s amazing to me how
distorted that is. Everybody's watching the crude oil prices and you see the crude oil
price go up a fraction and the gasoline price jumps up a fraction, everybody is
screaming. But nobody is screaming about 80% that the government is taking. It‟s
like with cigarettes. I‟m not a moralist; I‟m not here to pay for the medical care of
people who get cancer from smoking. That‟s not my job. I‟m here to be a
consumer. And I am punished for being a consumer. I have to pay for all of that.
It‟s all taxes.
This is what the 45 does. It‟s why I give you these examples so you really
understand this is what the 45 does. The 45 says, okay, give me a lot, I‟ll give you a
little back. And what I give you back I want you to appreciate that I gave it to you,
that you still get gasoline. We let you put it in your car. We give you roads to drive
on. Don't complain to me. So, when you‟re dealing with the 2/4 I want you to
understand that one of their gifts is the natural finding out unusual ways to bring in
the material.

like, well, I don't ever have to go out. I don't ever have to see them, the beasts.
And I'll just find some way to just get all to come in. After all, the power of the 2/5,

that. The 2/5, that 5 at the unconscious level is very, very, very powerful because of
the innocence of the personality. If you've got a 5 at the unconscious level, the
personality takes a long time to recognize what actually happens when you meet the
other, how powerful this force is in the background.
The 2/5 can teach you all kinds secrets in a way. And yet, at the same time, how
difficult it is for them to be able to transfer what they know. And one of the things
about the 2/5 is that the 2/5 can do very well materially, but again they have great
difficulty, like the 2/4, they have great difficulty in knowing how to give something
back. It tends to just simply be this material percentage business. They're always
trying to make more out of the material that's there. How do we turn a pound of
cocaine into 30 pounds? Well, we add this chemical and that chemical and a little
baby powder and whatever and we put it all together and we sell it for the original
price.
I don't mean to keep on stressing criminality, but I want to do understand that some
of the most successful enterprises in the world are criminal. It‟s true. And the
criminal world is the only part of the material world that‟s still run by the 45 system.
If you're dealing with the head of the Cali Cartel, you're dealing with a 45 archetype.
Mess with me; I cut off you parts. This is a 45. And the gangsterism that's in the
world, whether it's emerging countries in the East, whether it‟s kleptocracy where
you have rulers that are just basically thieves and bandits and gangsters themselves,
that I want you to recognize that it‟s not about impugning anybody who's born with a
Sun in the 45, but it's really just about seeing the practicality. For every dollar that
is made on the white market there's a dollar made on the black market and don't
you forget it. And it doesn't matter whether you're living in a western first world or
not. How much of the Italian economy is black; I still think it's more than the white.
After all, they‟re the godfather of European-styled gangsterism. It is everywhere in
the world.
And for us to be able to understand, for example, for criminologists to be able to
understand, for those people that are trying to hunt down the Al Qaeda financial
circuit, this is where it's all being developed. This is where all of this is at work. And
you have to see that. Some of the great geniuses of making money are criminals
and bandits. There is always two ways. And one of the things that I've grown to
understand in my life, not simply through my knowledge, but through the fact that
I've associated with both sides of the street, is how different and similar they are.
They both require certain kinds of hierarchies, but the innovativeness goes always to
the bandit side. You can see that.
Government agencies in all of the Western countries are always one step behind the
criminals, always. After all, if we were a step ahead none of us would ever have to
have virus protection. We‟d be way ahead of the hackers. No, we have to wait for
the hack in order to find the cure. We have to wait for somebody to have their
identity stolen on the Internet and the money gone before we begin to think about
how we're going to confront that.
There is something that fascinates me about the genius of black materialism. The
United States spends a fortune on illegal drugs. They spend a fortune. And most

illegal drugs are sold on the street for small amounts of money. America does not
have a broad currency. It's not like here where you can actually use a €1000 bill.
The United States has a $100 bill; that's the top floor. And even that top floor, I
know it's often impossible to just have a $100 bill in your wallet and get anybody to
change it. You go in and you buy something for 10 bucks and they say do you have
something smaller. Most of the drug trade is based on $1 and $5 bills.
Think about this. They have 18-wheel rigs on the highway; big, huge trucks that
normally carry furniture and moose‟s and whatever. These things are filled with
dollar bills, tens of millions in these trucks. And you know what; somehow
mysteriously these elephants get back to South America. How do they get across
the borders? How do you move all of that currency? In the underworld, the
question isn't how to bring the stuff in; it‟s how you get the money out. What do
you do with a billion and a half one dollar bills? In my time in Arizona they had
busted one of these trucks. It‟s just money, bales and bales and bales of $1 bills.
So, when you think about materialism, the great innovators are on that side,
because they're forced to it. They‟re forced to be smarter than the white ones. And
you can see all the time that the black side is always trying to clean itself up by
penetrating the white; laundering, they call it.

The 3/5  26  47
RAC Rulership 2
The whole thing about the 3/5 is that they‟re here to discover. In this progression,
this is the first material personality. The natural materialism of the 3rd line obviously
is going to peak when you're dealing with it in this context. The 3rd line within this
chop, this is yin, this is the 45, this is pure materialism, and this is the material gate.
It‟s all about possession.
So, when you're dealing with a 3/5 on this cross you‟re dealing with a deeply
material child coming into the world. Not only that, the paranoia of that child is
quite different, the paranoia of that child is the disappointment they have with their
parents if their parents aren't rich. If their parents aren't able to provide for them in
the way they wanted to be provided. Yet, the thing that is so clever about them,
and I don't mean to put this just on the black side with money laundering, is that
one of the things that the 3/5 gets to grasp is how you convert money into power; in
other words, who you buy.
Three-fives make mistakes, big ones. You're a politician and you pick up a hooker at
a local bar and you end up getting photographed through an open window while
you're having a good time, and your reputation is about to go deep down. There's
only one way out; buy your way out, buy silence. It‟s one of the things about 3/5s is
that 3/5s get into trouble and when they get into trouble it‟s their reputation that
suffers. You cannot be a ruler and have a ghost in your closet. And 3/5s are very,
very good at knowing that because they have a problem themselves.

A 3/5 ruler is the one that bugs the telephone of their closest adviser, or the wife, for
that matter. The 3/5 wants to have inside information because of the pressure to
fulfill the expectation, the expectation that they can have power, hold onto power,
and not fail. Three-five politicians have a tough time. The projection on them is that
they're going to be superb, which means they have to be sneaky, sneaky, sneaky
clean. And if they‟re not squeaky clean, and don't show me any 3 that‟s squeaky
clean, because I will not believe it. To be able to prove that they‟re squeaky clean
they‟re going to have to deny a lot of things and try to hold on to their reputation.
You know if Gary Hart was a 3? This was a classic example in America of somebody
who was quite popular and young and fashionable and was going to run for president
about 10 years ago. Then he got caught in a photograph with someone who wasn't
his wife sitting on his lap in a boat in a harbor. It was all over. You‟ve got to be
squeaky clean, and particularly if you‟re a 3/5. If you're not squeaky clean, oh, boy,
big trouble.
So, one of the things that the 3/5 understands about power is that it's not enough to
have money, you also have to have reputation. And this is one of the real themes of
how this works. Now, reputation can be both legitimate or not. You can go for a job
and claim that you have had degrees in this and that and the other thing. You can
claim all kinds of stuff. You can also earn it. But reputation is everything. This is
the kind of person that in order to show you how powerful they are they will give you
testimonials from others. Yes, he‟s a wonderful man; I would vote for him any time.
The whole thing about that 3/5 capacity of recognizing through its own trial and error
and again, all 5th lines, when they fail the expectation, all can have problems with
their reputation; all of them. But here in rulership, the 3/5, this inner recognition
that their failure leads to a loss of reputation drives them to recognize more than
anyone else that reputation almost by itself can create power and bring in resources.
And you can see that when the media machine tries to crank somebody up. They try
to build up an image. And then you can see the press go diving in, digging in the
various corners to see if there's any dirt to see if they can smear that reputation. All
politics in the West is about reputation smearing, and this is a 3/5 process.
At the dark side, it‟s about maintaining the false reputation. No, I'm not the head of
the Cali Cartel; I‟m a cattle rancher. I just raise cows. That‟s all. There are my
children riding on the horses, see. Not only that, you can see that—the godfather,
classic, classic this scene of this brutal gangster sitting there and all these people
coming and him doling out the blessings; this reputation. And the reputation that,
yes, he's bad, but, he helped my Aunt Louise, he looked after little Johnny's broken
leg. He brought help to Mrs. Whatever. He‟s a saint. Robin Hood—this is a 3/5 at
its very best. I‟m Robin Hood. I steal from the good to give to the good.

The 3/6
RAC Rulership 2
The 3/6 is trouble. There is a lot of confusion about what's what. In other words,
what is this all about? There is no grounding of the study, the 1, it‟s not there.
There is none of that natural ability to be able to deal with the material. When
you‟re dealing with the 3/6, it's a 3/3, after all, and this is the deep conditioning of
the whole process. All you end up with is having and losing, having and losing,
having and losing and it's very difficult for them.
When you're looking at the 3/6 on this cross, you are looking at the underlying
theme that is a revolutionary attitude. In other words, the 3/6 on the material plane
is likely to spawn ideals of communism and all kinds of things. This is not fair. The
material way is not fair. Capitalism is a horrible thing. Everybody is suffering. All
the promises are broken. How am I ever going to get it together in this life, and on
and on and on and on.
Most 3/6s are very resilient. It‟s really built into them because the resiliency of the
3. But because the 3 is so deeply connected to the material, the material
circumstances for these children, it can be devastating for them and deeply
confusing. And out of that can come very, very powerful revolutionary forces. The
kind of forces that say we‟re going to take it all and distribute it to everyone. Yeah,
yeah, we know what happens. They get the same disease; it‟s always the same
disease.

The 4/6
RAC Rulership 2
The 4/6 tends to make good rulers. One of the things about the ruler is a sensitivity
to the 22, and this is the end of that cross. And given that we‟re dealing with the
basic voyeur who has social gifts that these are rulers that will pay attention. And
what I mean by that is that in any kind of communal enterprise, yes they are going
to be influential, but at the same time, the distance between them and the others is
minimalized because they tend to take a backseat. Despite their influences, 4/6s
like to be around the outside.
The difficulty is particularly from the age of 20 to 30 when most of us are conditioned
that we have to go out into the world and we have to make a living one way or
another, this a very difficult stage for the 4/6 because they‟re in the 4/3 situation.
And what that means is that their material group, the group that they‟re going to
work with, the associates they‟re going to cultivate, the friends that they‟re going
dream of doing something with, chances are that's not going to work. And of course,
that's going to lead to problems. Most 4/6s really come into their own on the roof.

exchange for the 6-36. If you understand that transition you'll know that when the
4/1 is going mine, mine, mine, trouble is brewing, crisis is brewing, and conflict is
brewing. This is what they‟re for. It‟s what they‟re all about.
This Left Angle Cross of Confrontation is a time bomb—confrontation. The moment
that power is material it‟s going to lead to problems and crisis, it just is. And the
interesting thing about this configuration is that making sense out of things and
listening has been replaced by
conflict and crisis with the same 45-
26. So you have to understand that
there is a materialism here, but that
materialism is translated into
making money is nothing but a
confrontation. This whole material
business of getting things into form
is trouble. There isn't a single
human being that hasn't had a
material conflict in their life with the
other. It‟s in the program. People
fight about money and jobs and
worth, and on and on and on.
But one of the most interesting
things about the 5/1 is that the 5/1
heresy is you think that you‟re the
ruler. Now remember, this cross is
still the 45. It still has the sense of
entitlement, but it's not the ruler anymore. It doesn't have rulership, so it doesn't
like these rulers. Everybody thinks that the relationship between the right and the
left is simply that the right does research and the left is propaganda. But you also
have to see that there are tensions between the right and the left.
There is a real tension in the left here. It seems like the right has everything.
They're the ones that rule. Why are they ruling? I‟m the one with transpersonal
karma; I‟m the one here as a 5/1 on this cross that really understands other people.
And so, one of the things that‟s born in this Left Angle Cross of Confrontation is just
that; what makes you think you're the boss, what makes you think that you can run
my life. And of course that's never pleasant. It isn't.
This is the cross of the coup d'état, the military that takes overtakes the
government, or whatever. It‟s like how dare you, who the hell do you think you are?
I‟m just as capable of being a ruler. You do not want this heretic to be your ruler.
You really don‟t. This is the kind of ruler that says, look, Louie, I have this explosive
belt, put it on your body and go into the supermarket and die. I don't want to follow
that kind of ruler. It‟s nothing but problems, crisis and conflict. And of course these
are very, very paranoid beings. They‟re paranoid about those who rule. I don‟t want
to propagandize that these are holy rulers; that‟s what the 5/1 is saying. The hell
with them, I can rule, too. They don‟t last long.

And they‟re much too paranoid. It annoys the hell out of them, but there‟s not much
they can do about it because of the way they‟re raised. And again, because you
have a 1st line at the unconscious level that the only thing that really protects them
is how well educated they are. And one of the things is so interesting about this
cross is that where they‟re the most effective is when they're finding out how bad
the right angle has been. If you‟re going to have a hacker in the 2/4, the one that is
going to solve the problem is going to be the 5/1. In other words, they‟re going to
say yes, they do hack, but I have power, too. And let me show you what my power
is. My power is that I can heal that, that I can cover that over so that they lose their
power—confrontation, material confrontation.

The 5/2
LAC Confrontation 1
The 5/2, because it's going to be inside, and when I say inside by the way that also
includes the office. It's not just about being locked away in their home. It includes
their little cubbyhole or whatever it is that is part of their world, but this reticence of
letting the other in. Again, the 5/1 and the 5/2, the 5/2 has this gift of
understanding the unusual ways in which rulership is abused. It's very interesting.
It's almost like the 5/1 and the 5/2 on this cross want to censor the results of what
the right angle is doing because it doesn't really like the research. It doesn't really
like the fact that they‟re rulers, and confrontation is not.
This establishes one of the basic archetypes of the material plane, that there is
always an inherent conflict between rulers and those that are ruled, always, always.
We don't like it when it appears that our rulers are taking advantage of us. That is,
those of us that operate in the collective systems. And when we are operating in
tribal systems, if it weren't for the 5/1 and the 5/2, there would be no one to
challenge them. And in most cases when you challenge a tribal ruler you really have
to stand up to them. It really is confrontation.
There‟s something else as well. The 36 is a mysterious gate to me. It is a gate of
penetrating the surface. And penetrating the surface is what the life experience is
about. It is a gate of innocence in a way, a gate of inexperience. And one of the
difficulties for the 5/1 and the 5/2 is that because they don't have the experience of
being a ruler, and because they're driven by desire to be able to be the ones that
gather they often find truly unique directions. All right, I cannot deal with the rulers
here because they control everything, but I can find a way to get around them. I
don‟t want them to tax me. I‟ll open up an offshore account. I‟ll get around them
somehow, and I‟ll fight them in the courts for my right to be able to do that, and so
forth and so on.
In other words, they can develop all kinds of ways that are the result of being driven
by the experience and the desire to get to that place. And of course, we know the
experiential way is fraught with problems, that things breakdown and out of that
comes the potential for discovery. And remember that the moment they figure it out

they‟re a 26. The moment they figure it out they can transmit it, they can put it out
there.
I've tried over the last several months in the Daily View to remind people fairly
regularly about the power of Pluto in the 26th gate and what this really means to us.
We are entering into a new age, truly a new age, a new age of transmission. The
other thing is, yesterday a quite frightening editorial in the International Herald
Tribune about the bird flu, which is also a Pluto in 26 phenomena, and they're
expecting by next year that will cross the human line and they're expecting that
they're going to have the largest pandemic since 1901. It‟s spooky.
So when you're looking at anyone who has this cross, this 26, I also want you to see
the new generations of people coming in on this confrontation through the 26th are
going to use these new technologies for transmission to move things out. I see so
clearly because my ascendant in astrological terms is in the 26th gate; it‟s where my
Jupiter is. And I‟m having this transit of Pluto over my ascendant into the 1st house,
leaving the 12th house, the 1st house. It‟s one of these things that I understand in
my own nature is that the whole direction that I'm taking is entered into this new 26
realm, this collective transmission realm. They all use it.
People talk about globalization, but Al Qaeda is one of the most globalized
organizations in the world. And they‟ve done all that networking through the net.
And they‟re really globalized, this brand new structure. It‟s the way I run a business,
it‟s globalized. It‟s through different interconnections. There is a whole new
material plane opening up. And one of the great areas of confrontation, one of the
great areas of material heresy are all of these new applications that we're seeing in
the 26, that we‟re seeing in the way in which information is transmitted, the way we
pay for information. It‟s all very different. It's a whole new process.

The 6/2
LAC Confrontation 1
I think it‟s very difficult to be a role model on this cross, to be a 6/2. The 2 doesn‟t
like confrontation, particularly half of these beings that are going to be unemotional.
For the emotional ones it‟s going to be different. For the emotional ones, obviously,
they‟re going to have a very powerful 36.6 force in them. But to see clearly that
because of the 3/2 phase, these are people that are scared by confrontation in their
youth. In other words, they think there is something that they believe in, that they
want to stand up for and they get smashed down for it. They make that move that
they think that is really the thing for them to do, the experience that they think that
will lead to the expectation and they get smashed down for it. It becomes very, very
difficult for them to be that role model.
As I said, if they are unemotional you know very well that this is a very, very difficult
cross configuration because their not-self is going to be oriented towards non-
confrontation, avoiding confrontation, avoiding truth. The 26th gate, I don‟t mean to
give it a hard time. It‟s me, I understand its nature. The 26th gate is incapable of a

great deal of misinformation, disinformation, and lying. And when it's part of your
cross, if you're not operating correctly, it‟s not just about clouding what other people
get. It's about clouding what you see within yourself.
So, to be a 6/2 on this cross and to go through the difficulties of the 3rd line theme
that it goes through the first part of its life, this is not going to be a healthy force.
And it‟s not going to be a force that‟s really ready to be an example of what the ideal
of confrontation is. The ideal on this cross is that the other confronts you, not you
confront them. It is the power of being a pure role model, to come off the roof off of
this cross—I don't know anybody here, so I have not seen that, I would like to see
frankly what that's going to look like. Because one of the things to see is that
whenever we're getting to the end of the process what we're doing is that we're
looking ahead. When we're looking ahead here, we're looking ahead to one of the
most instrumental gates. We're looking at one of the key mutations in humanity and
this is the theme that‟s going to launch us into the world. We're going to enter into
Eden, we‟re going to enter into paradise and be thrown out.
And so, the confrontation that's building is a confrontation with the responsibilities of
purpose. The first eight hexagrams are the process, the inherent process. In this
case, the inherent material process that is the form principal. But remember that all
these quarters are described through their purpose, purpose through form; first the
form, then the purpose through the form. So we are moving towards that purpose.
We have yet to build Eden. We have yet to have grown the trees of Eden. We are
on our way. All of this is about building the infrastructure of form. And the great
glue of the planet is money; it‟s material.

LAC Confrontation 1
So, the 6/2 and particularly the 6/3, because in looking at the 6/3, the 6/3 says I
don't want confrontation. I don‟t want to fight with you God. You don‟t have to send
me out into the world, do you? Do I really have to go out in the world? Do I have to
do something with all of this? Isn‟t it enough that I just take it in? Isn't it enough
that I just survive? No, no.
And it is the dilemma of the 6/3, and particularly since in dealing with the 3/3, and
again the materialism and the problems of not feeling like you're adequate of
suffering the martyrdom. There are so many Generators who are 3s on this cross, if
you could measure the depth of their slavery, it's incredible. This is the bicycle
driver in the middle of some Third, Fourth World environment saving a penny a day,
working 16 hours a day and never ever, ever, ever having enough. And all you‟re
looking for is why should this all be a problem. Why is it necessary for us to have
this confrontation? Why can't we just be placed here on Earth to be at peace in the
form? Why can't we just be giving forms that don't need to be fed? Why aren't we
given forms that are just all right, no problems?

I was disappointed because some ruler was controlling it. Some other was always
controlling it. I never got to have my chance. Every time I try somebody knocks me

Introduction
For me, the 12th gate, like its polarity, the 11th gate, is extraordinary. It begins with
the chop itself. You can see that here in this hexagram lies a perfect balance
between the yin and the yang. And if you look at the 11 on the other side it‟s simply
reversed with three yang lines as the lower trigram and the three yin lines as the
upper, the mirror. For me the 12th gate is a deep, deep symbol of what the purpose
of mutation is all about. I‟ve taught over the years that the 12th gate was a gate of
one of the most important mutations that took place 80 odd thousand years ago and
this is the mutation of the larynx. It allowed us to articulate. And of course, you see
this in the in the juxtaposition cross, you actually see a cross of articulation, in that
sense.
So, when we're looking at the 12th gate, you're looking at one of the formative
processes. In other words, one of the most interesting things to see is that as we‟re
moving through with all these principles of bringing things into form what we‟ve left
behind, this focus on the real material itself, when you get to the 12th gate, you‟re
really getting into something else. What you're getting to is the ability to be able to
take advantage of the forms, and take advantage of the forms for something else.
By the time you get to the 12th gate the most important form of all is created, and it
is our ability to be able to articulate, to be able to express ourselves correctly in
language and the result of that expression is transformation. The result of that
expression is mutation. Because of this, no form is allowed to be stable. All forms
are in flux. Anything that a human creates it will recreate and recreate and recreate.
It will go through all kinds of variations, and the variations will lead to mutations.
This is the Cross of Eden. Okay, we can know how to create material, isn't that
enough? And the ultimate question is, I am alive, isn't that enough? And being alive
is really the Eden. It is this magical oasis of form, magical oasis. It's life. And the
moment you enter into this Cross of Eden, the first thing to understand is that Eden
is never something you‟re allowed to enjoy. It‟s such a bitch. Really, think about
that, you arrive in Eden, everything is wonderful, oh, I love the form principle, look
at this, there are palm trees and wonderful fruit and look at him or her; there are all
these wonderful forms around. We can sit under the trees and watch the sun rise
and set. We can make love. We can eat grapes. We can be blessed here. It‟s so
easy and perfect and the sun is warm. It sounds like an ad for Ibiza. It‟s wonderful,
but that‟s not what the form is for.
The fact that we've been endowed with the capacity to be able to create and recreate
and manipulate form isn't so that we have some perfect Eden where we can sit back
and do dick. That‟s why it's sold as a religious epiphany. Eden‟s later; we call it
heaven. You want paradise? Live and die first, and then we‟ll give you paradise,
which is such a joke because paradise is a form place, so they say.

I have a lot of empathy for those that are born on the Cross of Eden because I know
that in their life that they're going to have to suffer being thrown out. That‟s what
Eden is all about. It‟s this taste; it's just a taste. And one of the things that all
people who carry the 12 of their design carry is a snake in their back pocket. It‟s a
snake. It says, there are things to learn, there are things to know, there are things
to do. Never mind about the lamenting that you had to come here in the first place.
Never mind bitching about the fact that you didn‟t have a rich daddy. Go out there
into the world and see what's there. This is Eden.
And one of the most extraordinary things about the Cross of Eden is that not only
are put out into the world, but being put out into the world is the ultimate mutative
act. In other words, no matter how well we create forms, they will never be the
forms that will keep us insular. Because a form in and of itself is not enough. You
can be a 2/5 deep in the form principle, but you're never going to be able to spend
your whole life defending the world from you. It's going to touch you. It‟s all going
to touch you.
The 12th gate says something very special. It says there is no such thing as
innocence. That's what it says. The collective likes to believe in innocence. But
when you're dealing with these deeply, deeply individual mutative gate, this is a stop
codon. It puts up its hands and says so far and no further. It‟s also the gate of
poetry and music, all kinds of beautiful forms of articulation. It‟s such a joke for me;
a lot of people listen to my recordings because they like my voice and don‟t hear
what I say. The music of the 12th gate, its ability to be able to turn language into
song, into music, into poetry, and all o that is a subversive, mutative capacity.
It‟s one thing to understand about individuals, they will only be friendly with you if
they think they can mutate you, at the genetic level; otherwise, they‟re not interest,
because after all, that's the only sociability they‟re given and this is the key to
individual social ability. And it's the freak that was thrown out of Eden. It says, hey,
you know nothing now. You don't deserve this now, go learn something, go figure
out how all this works and then we will give you a reward.
So, when you're dealing with people who are on the Cross of Eden, what you know
about them is that they will toil in the fields for a long time. They will be immersed
in the world. They have no choice. They will be immersed in the world. And they
are the ones that are here to define our distance from innocence.

The 1/3
Think about the 1/3. You‟re a 1/3 Cross of Eden, you find out right away that this
world that you've come into is not an innocent world. Your mother is not the
Madonna. There‟s no question about that. You find out right away that is a world in
which you are going to be thrust out on your own. One of the deepest metaphors of
the Cross of Eden is that this is about the development of a human individual. It is
the essential form. It is the self-enclosed illusion of separateness.
Each of us, regardless of our circumstances, by the very nature of the way life works
are thrown out into the world. And you can see this in many of the individual gates.
If you go to the 8th gate to have this
fledgling, once it‟s strong enough it
has to leave the nest, there's all this
stuff. It is about this movement
away from innocence. It‟s why the
only gates that deal with innocence
and the spirit are individual. It's all
mixed up in it. And everything about
this is understanding that the further
we move from innocence, the closer
we get to it. This is the magic. You
move further and further and further
and further and further away. I
can't tell you how far away I was
from innocence when I met the
Voice. You move further and further
and further away.
You can‟t get any further than
nihilism. This is the travail of the
1/3. The 1/3 wakes up on this cross
and says, ah shit, this is awful. What is it going to be, man, 50 years and a gold
watch. This is it. This is the movie. Yes. The greatest teacher of the mundane
plane is this cross. This cross says it‟s all mundane; please, please what do you
think you‟re here for? You think you‟re here for a free ride? You idiot. You‟re not-
self, you idiot. You were not-self in the garden. You think we‟re going to keep some
not-self cretin hanging around here sucking up all the fruit? You get out there,
because innocence is ignorance—the ignorance of the world, the ignorance of
mechanics, the ignorance of life, the ignorance, ignorance, ignorance, ignorance.

I like these Eden people, because these Eden people, you can tell right away,
particularly the 3s, you can tell right away. It‟s like, yeah, I know what life is, don‟t
tell me about purpose. I‟m working here on this plane. Cross of Eden people have a
tremendous capacity for intellectual development. You have a child with a 1st line
personality who is on this cross, they have an incredible potential intellectually.
They‟re the ones who have really been sent out to find out about the world. And if
you‟re a 1/3, you know what you‟ve been sent out to find, that so many beings as
they move away from innocence don‟t move in the right direction. But the world of
experience is vast and diverse. We know that through the 35 here. It‟s vast and
diverse. What it is saying is look, look, there are wrong ways to go.
So many beings that are on this cross are always looking for paradise. They‟re
utopians, the not-self utopians. They‟re the people in the new age that turn my
stomach the most. They‟re the ones who keep telling me that things were better in
Egypt 5000 years ago. I like the Internet. I like the advantages of modern life. I
know what it is to live deeply primitively. I know what it is to live without. I know
the stink of the old world. Don't preach to me that it was better back then. It‟s like
saying it would have been better never to left Eden. But, you know, that's like being
a cow in a pasture. If you‟re going to be a cow in a pasture, ok, be a cow in a
pasture, but do me a favor, don‟t have a neo-cortex, just be a cow, just munch.
That‟s what Eden‟s for. It‟s pasture land for sheep and goats and cows. It‟s not for
humans, it was never for humans. It's a joke, a bad joke, but it's a joke. We
weren‟t thrown out of anything. There was nothing to be thrown out of.
The fact is that this is the myth. The myth is that we started off innocent. Well, the
truth that all Eden beings know is that we started off stupid, we started off ignorant.
We started off deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply limited. Do you realize that it wasn't
until about 3000 years ago that men even knew how babies were made? It‟s
staggering. Think about how staggering it is the moment men found out that that's
how you made babies, they took over. You don't have to go back very far to see
universal ignorance at work.
There is some German philosopher that said the past is the future we‟re racing
towards. It‟s a great line because it‟s so true. We‟re racing towards these things,
trying to get there, trying to get to the place of innocence. So what do we end up
with when we finally get our consciousness cranking? The last 2 or 3000 years has
been filled with messengers and Buddhas and all kinds of people telling you how to
become innocent again. You know enough now, now get rid of your mind. Too
soon; not yet, but we‟re getting there.
Everything about the nature of Human Design is the fulfillment of the promise of
myth of the garden, the tree of knowledge. And as mythology it is an important
mythology, because what it‟s really saying to us is something very, very deep. This
self-reflected consciousness as it operates through form, our only liberation can
come from is understanding the whole thing. And in understanding the whole thing,
transcend it. What a miracle it is that we know how things work inside these bodies.
How clever we are. This is the Eden journey.

What I notice most of all about the 1/3s on this cross is that they don't think that
there is a paradise that they can reach. They think that they‟ve been disadvantaged
by the ignorance that produced them, their parents, and the world that they entered
into. It is, after all, a voice in the throat. And it is a voice that says I know I can if I
want to. I know I can if I'm in the mood. I know I can try if I‟m in the mood. It is
one of the deepest things of Eden beings. If they‟re not in the mood they will not
try. This is a gate of caution. It‟s a stop codon. And with them there is a position
where they‟re simply saying look, every time I've been promised it's turned out to be
a lie—1/3s—every time I been shown that this is the way and I seen the flaws, I
know that the dream at the other end is not for me. And this 12th gate becomes
something else. It becomes a surrender to helplessness at its deepest level. That's
its potential.
The 28th gate in the individual process points us towards our purpose. But the 12th
gate points us towards the helplessness of life. How helpless we are. It‟s its
ultimate articulation. It‟s what you hear in poetry. You hear this cry of helplessness.
It is an underlying theme of the magic the 12th gate.

The 1/4
RAC Eden 2
One of the things I really notice about the 1/4s on this cross, and I've actually met a
few of them, they‟ve all been subject to very harsh Eden experiences. That is, their
parents got divorced. In most cases you'll see that in this day and age most Eden
children are children of divorced people. In other words, this is the thing that will
throw them out into the world. This is the thing that will break up the paradise. The
bond that is there between the parents, the illusion that there is love in the house,
and so forth and so on, and all of this breaks down and you're sent out into the world
with one parent or whatever, you're sent out into the world, you have to take
different responsibilities, the failure of paradise to work.
It‟s so interesting for me with my son, who is only known his parents being together,
which is different from my daughter that went through a divorce, and different from
many of my son's friends who are part of divorced families, how different the
frequency is, how much more secure these children are, how much more comfortable
they are with the relationship between their parents. When you‟re dealing with
children whose parents are in conflict, the children are always trying to stop the
conflict in order to hold on to the paradise, and the conflict is deeply distressing for
them because it‟s so threatening. And one of the most common things in the 1/4 is
this shattering experience, the shattering experience where the basic platform of
family breaks down. It suddenly breaks down.
Now, it's not just divorce. It can be, for example, the breadwinner becoming
redundant, being fired, being laid off, suddenly the cash flow into the household
changes, suddenly the whole dynamic of the house changes. They may have to
change the house they‟re living in because they can't afford the mortgage. It's this
kind of thing that Eden people get to deal with very early in life. They get to see

that the material plane is not stable. They get to see that there is no guarantee that
just because material is there that they‟re going to be able to hold on to it. You can‟t
hold onto paradise. They‟re putting up a parking lot; something like that.

The 2/4
RAC Eden 2
It‟s deeply shattering to be a 2/4 Eden and have your life fall apart when you're
young. After all, the one thing about 2/4s is that their home life as children is
absolutely essential for them. They need to have a reliable home. They need to be
able to feel protected and sheltered within the home. They need to have that space
where they feel comfortable, that they're going to be left alone. And one of the
things about Eden is that it's not allowed. And you‟ll find a lot of very uncomfortable
2/4s on the Cross of Eden because there are constantly people trying to pull them
out. Normally that 2 personality is resilient enough in its defense mechanism that it
can keep away a lot of the extraneous calls. But a 2/4 on this cross, no, they're
constantly disturbed by being pulled out of a comfortable environment.
Think about it this way, if you have a 2/4 and they‟re in a house and their parents
have invested in the furniture for the house and they‟re going to leave it basically the
same for the 20 years the child grows up, the child is very secure in that
environment. But if you have a 2/4 on the Cross of Eden, all of a sudden the mother
can decide to redecorate the whole house, move the room of the child to another
area, and re-design the whole thing. That 2/4 goes nuts. They‟ve lost all the
continuity in their life. It‟s not like it's the same house anymore, things aren‟t where
they‟re supposed to be, there something wrong.
This is Cross of Eden. And of course, as a child in which they have no way of
articulating what is in fact are their genetics, what happens is they internalize that
and they internalize that through their type. They end up being angry or frustrated
or bitter or disappointed in their parents, in life. Why change things, says the 2/4,
leave it alone. You want to go in and paint the room, no. No, don‟t paint my room,
leave it alone. Don‟t come in here because then you‟re going to move everything
and you‟re going to touch everything and you‟re going to shift everything, and I
don‟t want you in here. It‟s very difficult for 2/4s on this cross, very difficult.
As a matter of fact, they get so many calls that they never know which call is truly
for them and in the end they‟re simply confused. The other thing is that if you have
a 2/4 in your life and you change the environment too often they're going to get
sick. One of the things about the 4, we know that the 4 is infective. We know that
the 4 is the carrier, the 4 is the influence that gets it out. But remember, they get it
out with their friends; they get it out with a set community. That set community of
their parents, they kids they go to school with. This is something that is absolutely
essential for them. Even though they‟re a 2/4, they have to have those contacts;
they have to be able to move their influence out. Now, because they‟re a 2
personality, you know that it's going take the time to integrate with the group to
bring that 4 unconscious out.

So think about a 4 on the Cross of Eden and the parents change their house, change
neighborhoods, change cities, and drag the kid to another place. It‟s very, very
difficult for them to get that 4 out. It‟s difficult for them to go into a new school and
start this process all over again of trying to deal with their shyness and having to
deal with trying to find someone they can bond with. So what happens is that they
end up internalizing all of this potential to pass things on. And if you hold it long
enough it‟s going to make you sick and then you‟re really going to be thrown out of
Eden. You‟ll be thrown into the sick bed, into the hospital, whatever the case may
be.

The 2/5
RAC Eden 2
You go up to a 2/5 sitting under a palm tree in Eden and you say you have to go
now, they say, get out of here. I don‟t want to go; you go. Tell me what happens,
but I‟m staying. What do you mean you‟re staying? You can‟t stay; you‟re being
thrown out. Well, this is all an illusion and I‟m going to pretend I‟m staying. It‟s this
absolute refusal to accept it. Have you ever seen these people? An archetype of this
is you‟re the child of an entrepreneur who has made hundreds of millions of dollars
and it all disappears in a bubble, overnight. Overnight you go from being very
wealthy to being ordinary middle-class. And there is the child who is a 2/5 on this
cross still acting like nothing has happen. What do you mean we don't have enough
money? It‟s like nothing has happened. It refuses to admit it. Twenty years later
they‟ll still be carrying that same “nothing has happened.”
And of course, it negatively affects their reputation, because other people see right
through them, see right through that 2/5 phoniness. And one of the things about
Eden is that Eden on the 2/5 is the source of pretension. There is a great deal of
pretense here. The pretense that, well—remember they‟re hidden. They're not
going to bring you home to their shabby apartment. This is the kind of person that
will literally go into debt in order to cover their body in what appears to be wealth
and they will go home to poverty. And never bring anybody back because they don‟t
want anybody—it‟s a 2/5, after all, hidden away and creating this impression that
they never left Eden.
And it‟s more than just material, in that sense. It is the way in which they express
themselves. You can't forget that this cross is rooted in the 36.6; it leads to crises
and problems. There is a great deal of phoniness connected with being thrown out
of Eden and how you cover up for the loss, how you deal with being thrown into the
world.

RAC Eden 2
This is Adam and Eve. This is the heart of the Eden myth when you come to the
3/5; it‟s the heart of the myth. Adam is the 3 and Eve is the 5. And you can really
see that everything about the nature of the 3/5, it‟s here when you're looking at the
Cross of Eden, this is a 3/5s greatest place. The whole story of the 3/5 is that. You
blunder, your reputation falls and you run away. And here it‟s, you‟re limited, your
reputation needs to grow, go out into the world and discover. And don‟t worry about
the fact that life is going to be nothing but pain. You‟re always going to have the
projection that things could be better. And not only that, the moment you go out of
Eden, everyone who leaves Eden has the opportunity to be a saint, has the
opportunity to be a savior, has the opportunity to be the general, to be the therapist,
to be all those exalted 5 line themes. And it‟s the whole story of what the 3/5 really
is—discovery through trial and error; and in discovery, the ability to be able to
universalize.
When you throw a 3/5 out their only response is, what else to expect. It‟s like well,
this is natural. It‟s not like they‟re turning around and saying to God, this is a
mistake. They‟re just going, all right, let‟s see, ok, we‟ll figure out something along
the way. And this is the basis of it. In all honesty, it is the only way for me to
recognize respect for the 3/5 as a profile, because it is a very difficult profile. Again,
all of you must remember that as I describe all these things, I describe them as not-
self. So you're always getting the hard end, you're always getting the extreme;
you're always getting the dirt. And yet, at the same time to really be able to see
that if you exalt the 3/5 on this cross you have our whole process; our process is
discovery through trial and error, and as we discover we let everybody else know.
This is what it is to be human; this is the heart of our process.
It is why I often feel so dismayed at the nature of the not-self 3/5 because the not-
self 3/5 suffers so much. And because there always lies within them this potential to
universalize basically the story of the expulsion from Eden has been interpreted by
the not-self 3/5. It‟s just punishment; the loss of grace, born in sin; Jesus. If there
was ever a 3/5 principal it‟s born in sin. This is classic not-self 3/5. The only reason
that life‟s a bitch, the only reason that I suffer is that there must be something
wrong with me cosmically and mystically. That's basically what it is. I did
something wrong, I‟m being punished. The ancients that called the Earth the planet
of suffering, this is the 3/5 not-self phenomena.
There isn't anything worthwhile to discover other than being able to stay alive.
There isn't anything here that leads me back or leads me to what is perfect. You
can't imagine how many utopians are 3/5s. This island is full of 3/5 runaways from
just about every country you could imagine. They‟re just runaways looking for a
utopia, looking for a way in which paradise can be found on Earth, and all along been
so deeply pessimistic that it doesn't exist. It doesn't.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
There are two things in the mythology of the garden. There is Tree of Knowledge,
and there's the Tree of Life, and this is what the 3/5 embodies. The Tree of
Knowledge belongs to Eve; it belongs to the 5th line. But, this life force, this driving
yang life force, not yin life force, but yang life force, the yin life force is the cow in
the pasture. The yang life force is the killer monkey; that‟s us. Here we go. Beat
them, whack them, kill them, and eat them. I was saying this morning, a wonderful
joke that my daughter mailed me of a billboard in Saskatchewan, Canada, in the city
of Saskatoon. On this wonderful billboard is a wonderful prosaic scene of mountains
and pastures, and there is a huge elk, a big elk standing there. And there is this
wonderful line. It says: There is enough room for all of God's little creatures. And
underneath it says: Right beside the mashed potatoes.
This yang force; if we were not penetrators on the material plane we would not get
to the knowledge we need. We just wouldn't. No cow is going to carve up another
cow to see how its intestines work. I want you to really grasp that. When you see
cows in surgery doing that, let me know. I would love to see that. They don‟t do
that.
The 5 doesn‟t care. The 5 says: Let there be cows. And the 3 says: How do they
work? It‟s all a discovery thing; how do they work. So you kick the cow and you see
what it does. You kill the cow and dissect it and look inside, ah, this is how cows
work, this is us. It‟s one of the things about recognizing the 3/5 what that really
represents. There are these two strains. The form is not just for form. It‟s here for
a reason. It‟s here to be used, it‟s here to be developed, and it‟s here to be
sophisticated. It‟s to be used as a fuzzy object and as a penetrating object. It's the
massage brush and it's also the knife. It's all of these things.
All of has to be discovered and what really has to be discovered is how does
everything work. The myth is very clear. The myth says you have to do the whole
nine yards. You have to get the whole thing. You‟ve got to figure out the whole
story. You have to penetrate to the core. You have to do the whole movie. And you
see that we've been doing this endlessly. There isn‟t anything that we‟re not
embarrassed about peering into. There isn‟t anything that we won‟t dig into to check
it out. It doesn't matter where it will go. We‟ll send machines to other planets to do
that.
This is us. And one of the things to be clear about is that every single discovery
transforms our form. There is a great line of Mohammad. He said: Paradise is under
every woman's foot. It‟s a great line. The simplicity of the purity of just fertility,
because that's all Eden represents, is fertility. But the fertility isn‟t enough. There's
so much fertility on this planet, but that's not what we're here for. We‟re here to
fulfill the ultimate form principle. And the ultimate form principle is that you can get
to a point where artificially you can create any form. You want me to make you a
cow; I‟ll make you a cow. This is what we‟re here for. We‟re here to understand the
entire form principle in depth; the whole cookie.
As I said, we‟re at the end of an era. The 2027 is going to change the rules of the
game. I do the best that I can to encourage all 3/5s in my life to recognize the
power of discovery that‟s in their hands. That if they can operate correctly, they will

enter into those things that go wrong that will reveal those essential truths that we
need to know and the Cross of Eden is where it starts. But the other thing is that
this is the last gate of this half of the quarter, this is the end of the process.
The end of the process is realizing you have to go out in the world and do something
with all this stuff. And by the way when you go it helps to be articulate. It helps to
be able to mutate others into doing something with it. It helps. This is Civilization;
after all, it is the building of civilization. Civilization is based on the message, on the
word. It's all the word. The whole myth of Eden is in the 12th gate. It‟s the mutation
that brought this. There was no Eden before 85,000 years ago. This mutation
brought Eden. You look at the polarity in the 11th gate, the gate of white magic, the
gate of: oh, I have an idea.

The 3/6
RAC Eden 2
There are so many false Eden‟s; there are so many false prophets. The 12.4, the 4th
line is the line of the prophet and the prophetess and is the voice in the wilderness.
And this is the build up to it. You get to the 3/6 and the 3/6 is saying: I feel like a
cow in the pasture. And isn't there anyone that can be my shepherd. One of the
most interesting contributions that the 3/6 makes on the Cross of Eden is that it
introduces the recognition that when you're in the world you need help. You need
guidance, you need direction. You need all those things. It‟s really important. It
suddenly dawns on the 3/6 because nothing works for them. Nothing works; not-
self, nothing works, nothing works and just up the next step is this 12.4, just the
next step. There is this prophet that is saying, hey, it‟s over there.
You want to see the source of influence? The whole nature of the 4th line can be
found in the 12.4. This mutated the 4th line more than anything else. We know that
the 3/6, obviously if it can be raised correctly, if it can be guided correctly—
yesterday when I did the Daily View I talked about the 3rd line, and as always
whenever I do the 3rd line I get so much mail from people talking about their 3rd line
experience, what it‟s been, how much of a difference it's made in their lives not to
consider their process from that negative perspective. And it's only the not-self that
leads us into the hands of prophets. Please understand that. A 3/6 that‟s awake
isn't waiting for a prophet to show up. They say: What the hell do they know? I
have my own deep, deep, deep experience. I don‟t need you to tell me which way
the wind blows.
But in the not-self, with all that dysfunction, with all that inability to really have the
successes that you need. Remember this is the Quarter of Civilization; it‟s all so
damn material. If you‟re thrown out of Eden and you go from Eden to something
better you're not bitching about the fact that you got thrown out. I'm deeply
grateful that my father who was a wealthy man considered me to be a profligate and
gave me nothing. I don't mind having been cut off. That was great for me. Go out
in the world and do it yourself. That‟s my nature anyway. Good for me, I would
have pissed his money away. It‟s not like I would have done anything.

The 4/6
RAC Eden 2
By the time you get to the 4 you get to the real influence here. And the real
influence here is that you have this archetype that has taken over and is telling
everybody where to go. Why do you think we need these beings? It was one of my
first things. I thought, what am I going to do, be a shepherd? All the shepherds I
know have hemorrhoids. They sit on cold rocks all day. Why do I want to be a
shepherd for? I‟m going to attend to my flock. Who came up with such a
cockamamie idea?
I have both my Uranus‟ in the 12th gate in the 1st line. I have a harmony to this.
And here I am with my damn flock, Jesus. And then I only have a flock because
people are attuned to flock-ness—that‟s a nice new word for the English language.
He suffered from flock-ness. You can only say that in English. It‟s really a flock;
turn it into something even cooler. Anyway, I've been dealing with flock-ness for
years now. And is one of those funny things, it‟s like, why do they need it? Because
it‟s in the mutation. And it‟s from a mutation that for almost the entire 85,000 years
plus that the mutation has been existence it was always to the benefit of
Manifestors.
This 4th line theme of the 12, remember the 12 is part of the same stream as the 55
and ultimately will mutate and this line will mutate with it. This will not be the line of
prophets and prophetess‟ anymore. I can guarantee it. But, it is now. And it's one
of the essential ways that human beings are moved. The 12th gate has the power to
mutate the stranger. It has the power to transform them. And so what you get out
of the 4 here, in looking at the 4/6 configuration is that you have built in one of the
most influential positions a 4 can have. Not only do they have a natural influence on
those that are around them, but they have prophetic influence. In other words, they
not only can have an effect they can actually become a leader, they can become the
guru in the ashram, they can become the prophet in the wilderness, whatever you
want, but everybody else accepts that that's a viable role. It‟s so interesting. We
are designed in the not-self to need prophets. I‟m not a prophet.
The true self requires no prophets. That‟s not what the true self needs. The true
self is not in the flock. The true self is just another unique vibrating illusion of
separateness; nothing more. It is one of the deepest things that is so obvious to me
about the way the world operates. And this is the whole purpose business. This is
the end of the right angle. This 4/6 is saying, hey, this is the way. This is what
we‟ve learned in our research. This is what I‟ve seen as the great voyeur, but now
I've not the great voyeur, I‟m the great seer. I am the see-all, be-all; I‟ve seen
where it is.
You can see these children as 4/3s how they get their friends into so much trouble
being their prophet. But Johnny said that if we broke in the window and took the jar
that nobody would complain, that we wouldn‟t get caught. He said we wouldn‟t get

caught. If Johnny told you to jump off a bridge would you do it? Don‟t you
remember that from childhood, there were always those kinds of people? They
would get you do things that you really wouldn‟t do. They‟re the prophets.
And built into all of us is this instantaneous cow mechanism. All of a sudden, there is
this sort of dumb downed cow mechanism. All of a sudden you get carried away on
somebody's prophecy, and it is idiocy, absolute nutty stuff. And there you are doing
your cow, you lull, you eat the grass until it all blows up in your face. Oh, I don‟t like
prophets. I really don't. You never know what they say is true. These are not
logical beings. Just the fact that they tell you they know something, anybody with
an individual gate will scream “I know” when they're deeply wrong. You can‟t trust
that. But the not-self loves it.
Let me be fair to 12.4s. If you‟re a 4/6 on this cross, one can only hope that you‟re
properly raised. And if you‟re properly raised, then ultimately in going through the
three cycles of your 6th line process you can finally get to a point that you're not a
jerk, and how nice. You can finally get to into a point where you stop thinking you
need to tell everybody what to do. You can finally get to a point where you realize
that you may not even know what to do. You can finally get to a point where the
only way that you‟re influential is that you live your life as yourself and you let the
cards fall where they may. The 12.4 has this enormous potential for disruption in
our day and age. It really does.
It is written in the Bible in the Book of Revelations that when the Earth is really in
trouble we will be overwhelmed with false prophets. Well, we are overwhelmed with
false prophets. And we are in the last 13 or 1400 years of our existence. We are at
the end of days. In geological terms, a thousand years or so is nothing. It's
nothing. It's maybe a half minute, and not even that, it's probably about 20 seconds
of the Earth's life, relatively speaking, but it‟s soon. And the false prophets are
everywhere. And they are influencing everyone. And there are all these sheep that
are following.
I remember the first time that I went to California to introduce Human Design.
When I was sitting in a hotel room just at the edge of Beverly Hills, all of this
around, and the person who was organizing my tour brought me in a local esoteric
magazine. Now, it wasn't a magazine. It was thicker than the Bible. It was in a
format that was enormous. It had hundreds and hundreds of pages. It was one of
these freebie things, and every page was filled with literally dozens and dozens—
there must have been 100,000 prophets in that package. And they were offering
things; it‟s scary. You have never seen such unbelievable diversity of nonsense in
your whole life. It was a nightmare. And this person says to me, would you like to
advertise in here? You can‟t imagine how fast I said no. It‟s a time of false
prophets.
It‟s something for us to grasp as well in saying so to see that because this is all the
Quarter of Civilization and material principles, that one of the basic material
principles of the 4th line is to be the prophet, is to influence the others to follow them
blindly, not challenged them, that this is the way that humanity has developed to

this point. Now, I have harmony to the 4th line, I understand this process, but it's
not the purpose. And this is the point here. This is not the process.
We have to get to purpose. And when we get to purpose what we realize is that it's
not about being led. It is about fulfilling the potential of your own for in your own
way according to your own nature. And you will see that when we get to the end of
this process and we get to the Cross of the Four Ways and we get to the close of the
quarter you get to Retreat. You get to no prophet touches me. I am my own
prophet, I am my own authority. I have my own truth. I am I am; and that‟s the
core.
So at the end of this right angle process you‟re really at the end of the building of
the form principle. That is why the prophecy is off. It‟s not in the purpose section.
It‟s still in the process section. The process says that in order for form to spread
there has to be mutative spokespersons for the new forms. There has to be those
that drive you to the forms. There had to be somebody that said, look, we cannot all
live in this cave anymore. Out there, outside, let‟s build little pretend caves and live
in them. It's getting crowded in here, is smells. Let's go build a new form. And
what we‟re going to see is that in order to be able to build a form it‟s very different
than living with the form.
When you look at the 12—the 4/6, 4/1, 5/1, 6/2—what you‟re really looking at is the
deepest and most powerful directionally mutative forces we have and they‟re all
messed up, every single last one of them. It‟s not like either any one of them are
right. Some people need a prophet, some people cannot afford to ever have a
prophet because it isn‟t going to work for them. In some ways education needs to
be streamed, needs to be controlled. It‟s always has been; always will be. But the
basis has to change.

We enter into the juxtaposition of the 12th gate. This is about articulation. That‟s
precisely what it's about. These are unusual beings, in a way. They‟re very good at
being able to mutate somebody with somebody else's thing. There are so many
43/23s. The world is full of 43/23s. The more of them that I've met in my process,
the more I realize that they couldn't articulate their way out of a paper bag. This
explanation of the 23 as we saw already how difficult it is to get to a point where one
can translate the inner acoustic into a viable explanation of the new.

But one of the real gifts of the 12 is that the 12 can hear the 23 choke and gurgle
over trying to express itself and immediately know how to articulate it. That 4th line
of the Prophet is the voice that articulates the wishes of God and angels and demons
and whatever. These are prophets of doom and prophets of gloom and prophets of
hope. They‟re the articulators. And they don‟t truly care about what they're
articulating. It's always to me the
most fascinating thing about the
nature of the 4/1 and why their
environment, their culture is so
important to them. They are not
questioners at the personality level.
They do not question. Their whole
role is to be shift merchants to
move the information, to be able to
articulate the right angle
experience and to be able to
influence small groups through the
capacity of being able to articulate.
They‟re moved by poetry, even
when poetry is describing
something mundane. And why?
Language is a formula. Sounds are
formulas. Sounds deeply impact
us. Articulation is about magic.
It‟s about the magic of the mantra.
It is about the magic of word chains. It is about the magic of how one can be
changed in one's life by hearing the word. So, the articulator is very powerful.
However, they themselves are often deeply, deeply insecure because it wasn‟t their
research, study or investigation.
Remember with the 1/4 or the 4/1, they take on the prevailing platform, and they
only use their 1 ability to be able to ensure that they can deliver the platform, not to
question it. And even when the platform is attacked or threatened they will not use
their 1 to say hey, maybe they're right. No, they will dig deeper and deeper to find
more defenses for their position.
So the great difficulty with the articulators is that most of them are voices in the
wilderness. And most of them are voices in the wilderness because they are not
articulating what is clear and obvious to them. They‟re not articulating something
that they have a foundation in. They‟re simply mutative forces. You could call them
pitch men. The kind of person that you see on television who is telling you with
great earnestness how wonderful a product is. They are able to articulate the
slogans, they are able to articulate the message, but you know that even though
they're advertising Coca-Cola, they drink Pepsi at home. That's the truth
underneath.
So this is the 4/1 and this is the thing to recognize about them. I had a buddy of
mine years ago, in the late 80s we made music together, we had a rock band

together and we wrote music together. One day he walked into my room where I
was sitting and I was playing some music and I was singing of my songs and my
songs are basically about my experiential process, and he said to me, it must be
tough to live up to those lyrics. And I thought that there is a perceptive concept.
It‟s one of things about the 4/1; it's very difficult for them to live up to their lyrics.
It‟s like the preacher that is so powerful in their preaching but beds down with
prostitutes at night. They‟re so powerful in their articulation yet underneath, whoa—
the paper, the paper—you breakthrough underneath and you say, wait a minute you
were just articulating morality, propriety, all of these things, and look at you, you‟re
drunk, sleazed out.
That‟s why I don‟t trust prophets. I don't trust anyone who speaks for God. I never
would have gone into the world and said I spoke for the Voice, here's my story. My
thing is here‟s Human Design, try it out. This is not the prophet representing
something because after all I know the not-self world. This is the time of false
prophecy and both the 4/6 and the 4/1 carry this false prophecy into the world with
great strength and articulation. There are so many voices that you can hear out
there, and so pervasive and so persuading. Ah, the 4/1 prophet that tells you that
wearing that vest of bombs is going to get you into Heaven and into the arms of 70
virgins. Well, you've got to be a good articulator to get that across. This is really
the influence business. Influence peddling is what 4/1s are really good at.
Jesus I‟m really hard on them today. Well, tough. It tells us something about their
childhood and their parents and what's necessary. Every time I go through any of
these processes I realize it's all in the hands of ignorant parents. This is a battle for
us to transform parenting, for us to transform the consciousness of parents to
liberate their children.

The most important result of the right angle‟s experience of the leaving Eden is the
left angle's recognition that everything of value for us will be dependent on what we
know and how much we know. And not the knowing a damn prophet, that is not our
knowing. The prophet says, I spoke to an angel. Yeah, well. In Berlin years ago, I
stayed in the house of a channeler, a crazy, crazy woman, a blind channeler. I
stayed there a couple of days and I was doing readings in there and taught a course

That basically ended our relationship. I‟m a 5th line being, I don‟t like prophets, and I
don‟t trust them. The 5th line says, I‟m practical, show me. When the Voice showed
me logic I said okay, I‟ll be a nut for you. But show me something practical, show
me some logic. This is the whole thing about education. Yeah, prophecy is very
nice, but you claim you're the only one who knows. I want to know. I want to know
how it works. When I know how it works then everything is okay, and we don‟t
need you.
This is a universalizing principal. Education is a universalizing principle. Everyone
has the right. One of the deepest things that I feel about the mundane plane is the
denial of education to females in the world. It‟s one of the greatest tragedies that
we have in our modern world. There are approximately 400 million little girls that
are not allowed to be educated on
this planet; they‟re just not. If you
deny a female child an education you
deny their children an advantage.
You slow down everything. You
cannot change the tribe.
You can see that in the Taliban in
Afghanistan and this whole
movement that basically you want to
keep your women ignorant. Strip
them of all their power, make them
illiterate, and don‟t even allow them
to go out in the street without a
guide. And this is not a knock
against Islam. I don‟t have any
opinions. This is just about the
obvious. Education is a universal
right. Anyone who defies that
universal right is sick. And their
sickness is something that is
contaminated all of humanity. The education of males is mostly wasted. The only
things that they are interested in learning about as a whole are not very impressive.
But the reality is that we deny females the right to education.
Now look at the 5th and 6th line up here. Yang; education that was exclusively for the
yang; and yet, it is a universalizing principle. And yet, the yang dominated it. You
can see that. You know how recent it is that a female child has a potential for any
kind of education, with the exception of servitude into convents and religious
institutions, where what they were taught was just perverse anyway. Nothing has
been more detrimental to the development of this planet than the denial of female
education and it's been going on ever since stupid men figured out that they were
responsible for impregnating women. And we lost the matriarchy, and we got this
ridiculous patriarchy. It is ridiculous.
No choice; what to do. We have to go through this stage, but it‟s so obvious how
deficient it is. I never realized in my not-self life how stupid men are. And I didn't

realize that the great mystery of women for men is that men don't realize that
women know that they‟re stupid. It‟s the thing that terrifies men the most—she
thinks I‟m stupid. And it‟s true, and every woman knows that. There isn‟t a woman
alive who looks at her man and doesn‟t say, shit, he‟s stupid, because it‟s true. And
then the men steal all the educating. I mean, it's unbelievable.
So when you're looking here, we have a real problem here. I am a real heretic
because I am the mother‟s son. I‟m not the father‟s son. I am the son of a bitch;
I‟m the mother's son. I look out on this crazy world and say, jeez, we have done an
enormous disservice to the female spirit to the detriment of humanity. And the cure
is here. No other place in the wheel. I don‟t care where you look, no other place in
the wheel, here‟s the cure. The heretic that wakes up and says I will not do this
anymore.
My wife and I have a foster child in Bangladesh, a little girl. And if it were not for us,
she would never be educated. Now, it‟s not to setup that up as any kind of big deal.
All of us can afford such things. I think it costs $20 a month or something, it‟s
ridiculous. But you know, without support, without the ability of the collective to
recognize the importance of this, these children are denied and their children's
children are denied and the string of ignorance goes on forever.
It‟s one of those things that we have to come to grips with. Look at the politics. It‟s
like looking at the new Spanish government. You can really see the difference
between the right and the left. Here is this new Leftist government in Spain and
they‟re introducing their new—and there are all these women with power. This is a
time where you're beginning to see that the yin is beginning to regain its power.
And what did that? The stupid men found out that they caused pregnancy. So the
smart women now know how to prevent it, and it's all over. Then the sides can start
balancing out again in the way that it's supposed to be.
So when you're dealing with a 5/1, what you're dealing with is the inherent paranoia
of the yang for the yin. So here in this configuration of the 12th gate, it‟s the yang

and have to deal with men who are not-self. And the moment that you reveal to
them what it is that you know, even the surface of what it is you know, and how fast
they run away. There is nothing more terrifying to man than a woman that will look
under his skin. So the yang‟s paranoid. So the yang figures out all kinds of ways to
try to limit the education of the yin. This is the not-self of this. This has to be
awakened.

time for 2/5s and 5/2s than in the era that we live in now because of the technology.
The same thing could be said of the 2/4. In many ways the same could be said of
the 6/2. In other words, this shyness, this “leave me alone,” this hermit no longer
has to be truly a hermit. You can be virtually present. You could live a virtual life.
You can virtually integrate with others.
I've never communicated with so many people. But to do it virtually makes it
possible not to deal with auras. You don‟t have to deal with the complexities of the
rituals that we go through we meet each other, talk to each other, say good-bye, all
that stuff. It‟s just when you get an email from me, you know what I mean. How
short can he make it? How crisp can it be?
It is like my favorite poem of e.e. cummings. He said, Adam had him, Eve grieved.
And that‟s the movie here. Oh, this concretization of education is really something,
grounded into the form. We have to be educated. If we‟re not educated we're
always going to be slaves of the prophets. We don't want to be slaves of the
prophets; not at all. Not us out there on the 5th and 6th, no.

You get to the 6th line and the 6th line is standing up there on the roof and it‟s saying,
I love everybody. It sees the 15 on the horizon—there‟s humanity out there. Ah,
yes, we have to educate them. That‟s what it‟s all about. All these killer monkeys
down there, they need to learn something. Let‟s teach them something.
The 6/2 goes through its 3rd line process. And in going through its 3rd line process, it
is not properly educated. It can‟t be. That 2nd line underneath doesn‟t want to learn
anything. So it ends up with a rough-and-tumble experiential education. And when
you're looking at the 6/2 and the 6/3 here, what they‟re saying is don‟t listen to the
bloody prophets. Forget all of that. And forget about those heretics that want to
educate everyone universally. I'm taking my kid out of school; I want them to learn
how to build machines like me. Experience is the best teacher, experience is the
only teacher. It‟s all these teaching methods. And the 6/2 says, when they get to
the point where they're deep on the roof, I didn‟t have to go to school and I‟m rich.
There wasn't anything back there in school that was really useful for me today. I
have forgotten most of the things that I learned in school. It‟s one of the things you
hear all the time. I just learned what I had to learn by being there in the world. So
we get these strains of what the whole educational process is.

But it's only when you get to the 6/3 that you actually get to that place that says
none of this education stuff works. I tried the prophet, and the prophet led me
astray. I tried to learn what my grandmother taught me and it didn‟t work. I tried
to learn from experience and I kept on falling flat on my face. I don't want to be
educated anymore. I just want to be in the flow. That‟s all. Make it easy. I see
that flow over there. It seems like humanity knows where it's going. I‟m just going
to join the flow.
What it really looks like is how ignorance can get lost in the world and be safe. If
you're a Spanish speaking person and you decide that you‟re going to immigrate to
the United States and you go to Little Havana in Miami you‟re never going to learn
how to speak English. Your ignorance can hide in the density of the world. And so
many 6/3s follow this educational example. It‟s like nothing really works so just get
the flow, find your way somehow into where everything is moving and maybe by
osmosis you pick up this, you pick up that, a little of this, a little of that. Who
knows, you might meet a prophet along the way. Mother might show up and tell you
how it all works.
I make a lot of jokes about Buddha, and most people think I'm just being nasty for
the sake of nasty. But, if you don't embrace the material, if you don't embrace the
yin, if you don‟t recognize that everything, including the yang is only a mutation of
the yin, that males are only mutation of the female, it's the truth; and to recognize
that until we honor the yin framework, there is nowhere to go. There is no growth in
the form. And we don't get to that special place. It says in the Bible that God
created man and woman in its own image. And that‟s where we‟re going. That‟s our
job. Global Orchestration Directory: God. We are here to create life in our own

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Here we are in the 15th gate, the Vessel of Love, and we know that the 15th gate is
the love of humanity. It is the gate of extremes; it is part of the universal principle
of the channel of being in the flow. All life forms are associated with this channel. It
is the basic logical program for life. It is patterns in different rhythms. And the gate
of extremes, the 15th gate, is the extreme that creates the nuances for all the
potential patterns. It is a vast diversity.
It is not a manifesting gate. It‟s not a throat gate, and yet, this 15th gate sitting in
the Quarter of Civilization, this gate has such incredible magnetism. I‟ve talked
about how the magnetic in the magnetic monopole can really be found in its
accentuation in the 15th gate. The 15/5s bring people into their flow because they
have an accentuated magnetism.
So, this isn‟t a throat gate, but this is a gate that magnetizes material. Think about
the form principal. The essence of form is us. If I were to take a biological journey
around the wheel, this whole throat thing would be the thyroid journey of
development. You would see this whole process of how we can manifest as a
biological form. And yet, at the same time, we cannot possibly do that alone. We
cannot be successful alone. That if it is not for our ability with our self-reflective
consciousness to be able to create strategies we have nothing to gain and nowhere
to go.
So this 15th gate acts as an engine of bringing the forms, humans, together and to
bring them together so that we can create greater form enterprises. Where the first
eight hexagrams give the material itself, these eight hexagrams show you what can
be done with the material; and all of that in preparation for duality; all of that in
preparation for the fact that life, despite everything, is about bonding, that ultimately
reproduction, that the secret of life, that the process of being is “go forth and
multiply.”
Here we have the go “forth and get the knowledge.” We're moving towards duality
now; we're bringing our purpose to duality. In other words, we‟re moving towards
this greater union with the other and it begins with the 15 and its work. Here we
have the Cross of the Vessel of Love. Now, remember that it's also the cross of the
vessel of potential hate. And that the 15th gate can be as much the hatred of
humanity as it can be the love of humanity. And pulling people into the flow of
hatred is something that is evident in the world. We see that every day.
Unfortunately, we‟ve had to see that in this country. You see it every day, to be
pulled into the flow of the hatred. So don‟t get stuck in any kind of single
perspective on this.

The 1/3
When the 15s are 3s they have a problem and the problem is that they pull the
wrong people into their auras. It‟s always that. They‟re always pulling the wrong
people in. And they are magnetic. It's not like the magnetism is a choice. It isn‟t.
So, the moment they‟re out there in the world as Vessels of Love with the 15, they‟re
just magnetically pulling the wrong people into their aura. This is what distorts their
life.
We are so subject to the conditioning
of our aura, that the not-self 15/5 is
really open for trouble. I have two
children who are 15/5s. I've
watched what a dilemma that is.
That you just pull people in; there is
no discernment, there is no
selection, there is no rejection.
There is, just well, if you're attracted
to me, you must be okay for me. If
you're attracted to me, you must be
okay for me, if you're attracted to
what I do, you must really want to
do it with me, and so forth and so
on. This is the ultimate sharing
channel: let me share my flow with
you, which is basically: let me share
the direction my flow is taking us and
you can go along in the flow.
And a 1/3 doesn't realize that this is just a force pulling others and it ends up
blowing up in their faces. The other thing is that any child that has this whole
channel is disruptive to it‟s family's life, because it‟s pulling everything into its
particular flow and changing the mechanics of the way in which the energy works.
But there‟s something deeper here. The 15th gate is about time. The only way in
which we can truly understand patterns is that we break the patterns up into little
parts, that the flow of life is a flow over time, that everything about being in the flow
is about being in somebody else's timing. So, what happens with the 1/3s is that
they bring the wrong forces into their life and it messes up their timing and
everything is timing. If you‟re correct and you‟re a 15 you‟re going to be in the flow.
The timing is going to be right. Oh, have I learned this mystery about timing. I‟m
an Arian, I‟m an archetypal Arian, I‟m an Arian ego Manifestor. We are not noted for
our patience. The things I‟ve had to wait for, the people I've had to wait for. There

are people in my life I wait years and years and years for them to get to their shit
together. What it takes to recognize that you can‟t push the river.
So the most devastating thing for a 15th gate person, no matter where you are in the
cross, is timing. If others are messing up your timing, you‟re going to miss the boat,
you‟re going to miss everything, and 1/3s blow the timing. You can see the 1/3, 15.
There they are, they get up in the morning, they walk out, and they have to have to
catch their train. They meet somebody on the street; they‟re pulled automatically
into their aura. They have a three-minute conversation, they get to the train, and
the train is gone — blown the timing.
You pull out of your driveway, you‟re in a hurry, you have a really short drive, it's
only going to take you a minute, and as you‟re coming out of your driveway there‟s
your neighbor, waving, moving towards your car, you have to roll down the window
because you‟ve pulled them in. You say good morning, how‟s you blah, blah and you
go fine, and then you pull out and you‟re in a hurry and a huge truck moving at one
kilometer a day is in front of you taking up the entire road and no matter what you
do, no matter how hard you honk, no matter what‟s going on, you‟re not going to get
there on time. Your timing has been messed up.
Wherever you go in this gate you‟re dealing with the not-self and messed-up timing.
You‟re too fast, you‟re too slow. You don't get it. You miss it; not in the right
timing. And obviously that's a conscious thing; that‟s something that's going to
come out of the nature of your design. There is no other way.
How influential we can be when you can see inside of a pattern all of its many
possibilities. It‟s a great gift. It is the entry door into understanding the vast
diversity of life itself. Remember that the 15/5 is the core potential definition of a
single cell. You‟re looking at a single cell people. It's quite something to think about
them that way. They‟re pulling everything in into a very, very special flow. And
each cell, part of the cell imprints is that it imprints a unique rhythm. And we know
that when you distort that rhythm you have real problems. The real distortion of
cellular rhythm ends up being cancer where you‟re producing too many, and all of
this stuff.
The other thing about the concept of the cell is that everything about the cell is
about division. A healthy cell is going to divide on a timed pattern. And one of the
things about the way in which the 15th gate works in terms of humanity is that
basically rather than being a cell that it is dividing, it is a molecular structure that
grows. In other words, it's another level of bringing together. But you can tell in the
building of molecules that their value, even though they can have very similar
infrastructures, you add a little of this or a little that and you change the whole end
result.
And so everything about the 15 is this molecular structure building. Take all the
single cells; start bringing them together and eventually you can build an organ.
This is the magic of the 15. Bring these units together; keep on bringing them in.
In astrophysics we called this accretion. In other words, if you look at the asteroid
belt between Mars and Jupiter it experiences two things. It experiences destructive

contact, one object bangs into another and they smash apart. And it also
experiences accretion; one object bangs into another and joins it.
So for example, we know that most of the solar system is the byproduct of accretion.
In other words, under intense heat, materials bonding together to form what
ultimately would be the solids and the gas planets that we have. So, one of the
things to recognize in the 15th gate is this dualistic quality. And here you have the
love/hate. This is not the hatred of breaking the structure of the molecule; this is
the love of bringing the molecule together so that there's this uniform direction.
From biological point of view, G center gates are very aware of how really fragile life
is if it‟s rule by the not-self. And the deepest knowing of the higher self is rooted in
its biology—the liver. We pay very little attention to the mystical quality of the liver,
and also to the understanding that where the vast majority of cells in our body are
reconstituted on a seven-year cycle, very few liver cells are. The vast majority of
liver cells never, ever, ever reconstitute. They don‟t go through a seven-year cycle.
They don‟t, which is why when you start destroying liver cells, particularly through
the abuse of alcohol, there is no way to replace them. They will not naturally
regenerate. They don't.
And what that tells you about the knowledge inherent in the higher self is that the
higher self recognizes that you can‟t afford to make too many mistakes or you‟re
fucked. And the 15th gate knows that. It knows that deep, deep, deep within itself.
It knows that. It knows that there are only a few of these cells that can actually be
replaced on a seven-year cycle. Most of the cells of this liver, they cannot, so let's
get in the right flow. Let's be in the right flow, in the right pattern in then everything
is going to be okay.

The 1/4
RAC Vessel of Love 2
If you want to keep a 1/4 child happy you make sure that the timing is always
consistent—when they eat, when they play, when they go out, it‟s breakfast time,
it‟s bed time, it‟s whatever. Timing becomes so important to them. If they grow up
in an environment that has a stable time framework, they will apply that in their own
life, and they will have a very steady timing system.
But the moment that they‟re raised in which there is no consistency, feeds on their
extremism, that there is no consistency in the timing, that's when they start missing
things. It's the whole thing about humanity. You have this expression in English:
Missing the boat. So many human beings miss the boat, they really do. There you
are, everybody on their fractal, everybody having a geometry, and if you're not
operating correctly you're not going to be where an intersecting geometry can
happen that can transform your life if along the way the not-self drags you into
something that's not correct for you. And nowhere else is it a greater sensitivity
than here.

It‟s only when you can bring everyone into a structured timing that you really have
flow. How chaotic would it be if I said I'm having a course today, come when you
want—people straggling in, people going out; no flow. And my flow would constantly
be broken by people getting up and moving and coming in and sitting down, and
saying I missed something and sticking a microphone in my face. It just wouldn‟t
work; there‟s no flow.
Timing is everything. So, one of the things to understand about the way in which
the beginning—this is the beginning of purpose, remember that, how do you get
humanity to take advantage of the form principal. You put them on a schedule. You
give them a rhythm; you give them a pattern that they can flow through. The
rudimentary education in the past was if you were truly privileged you could hire a
tutor for your children that would try to teach them everything. And then you see
what happens when you get to the 15. When you get to the 15, the 15 says, wait a
minute, wait a minute, isn't it going to be a lot easier if we use that same tutor to
teach 40 kids in the flow. As a matter of fact, why can't we teach thousands or
millions that way?
And of course, this is the basic principle. If you bring everybody into the same flow,
there are many benefits. Obviously you have a very complex aura that is
established, you‟re able to take advantage of everything that's in the bodygraph
because everything is present. You can bring people completely into a process
together and place them in the flow.
And the great work of the cycle that we‟re in, that‟s coming to an end, this Cycle of
Planning that inherent in this Cycle of Planning has been this capacity to bring
humanity into a very, very organized era. The 15th gate has never been so
powerful. Look at the world we live in. Everything is a schedule—trains,
entertainment, you name it, you stand upstairs and it's three minutes after one and
you're saying, you're screwing my flow, I'm hungry. It's all schedules and timing.
Everything is; education, all these things. And we‟re constantly organizing people
into that flow.

After all, the 2/4 awakened is a powerful, powerful missionary force, a deep
influencing force, those that place us in patterns that give us our patterns.
Think about work. To go back to the beginning of the Industrial Age the work day
was about 12 hours; slowly, but surely, there were forces that moved us towards a
healthier pattern, a more survivable pattern. And though some of that was initiated
by the ego and its demands for rest, the ability to transform the flow of everyone,
this is a 15th gate process. It is the Vessel of Love that says you only have to work

eight hours a day, five days a week. You only have to put in 40 hours. This is the
flow.
And this is the potential of the 2/4. The potential of the 2/4 is to go along and be
very democratic with everything until the moment of awakening comes, the moment
of the call, the moment of answering the call, and with its potential for influence to
infect everyone with a new flow, a new rhythm, a new pattern to move through.
Remember, they‟re magnetic. Nobody suffers more than a 2/4 who‟s a 15 who‟s a
not-self. They‟re so magnetic and their personality is going, gee, what do they want,
why are they bothering me.

The 2/5
RAC Vessel of Love 2
Whenever I come to the 2/5, there's always a part of me that pauses and
remembers I have to, otherwise I would treat it with too little respect. I always
remember the power of the universalizing principle of their unconscious. And I
realize how intensely difficult it is for them in terms of the way in which they are
treated by the auras that meet them, how uncomfortable it is to have this paranoia
about what people may be seeing in you. The 5 understands is that others are
looking in the window of the 2; they understand that about themselves and they
don't like it. They don‟t like the fact that people look in and see something in them.
Unlike the 2/4, the 2/5, when somebody sees something in them, it immediately sets
off their practical paranoia trip. In other words, when they see that that's what
they're going to expect, if I don't deliver that I'm going to be in trouble. And one of
the things about 2/5s is that they are very, very magnetic. And they are often in
real disarray in their life. They‟re so magnetic and yet they‟re so hostile to being
seen, to being known. They don‟t want to others in their flow.
It‟s very sticky for the 2s on this cross, particularly with the Sun in the 15. They‟re
always going like this, they‟re always going like this, and they‟re always going like
this. It‟s the Vessel of Love, pulling everything towards them, pulling everything
towards them. If you‟re a 2/5 and everything is coming towards you, it‟s like, where
do I escape? I don‟t want them in my flow. It‟s very difficult for them. And of
course, most of them do the best they can not to influence other people, not to
impact other people, not to be called by other people.

sounds nice, but a mob is in the flow, too, held together by the dynamic magnetism
of that flow. And when you‟re in the flow, you‟re in the collective. And when you're
in the collective, you don't actually mind ending up killing people.
I think about Rwanda, I think about 800,000 people that were hacked to death in a
number of weeks, what kind of flow that is. And that mob was in the flow, they were
all in the flow, just mindlessly moving along. And it's one of the great risks of the
15/5. Whenever you see anybody that's carrying this channel, understand that.
They have an enormous power to pull things along with them. So you kind of hope
that they're okay. You kind of hope that maybe, maybe, maybe.
And of course, when you're dealing with a 3/5 and you're dealing with 3/5
magnetism they attract the wrong people. They attract people that expect them to
do things that they can't do, that they fail at, that they feel victimized by and their
reputation is ruined, and don't follow that person, don't go with them, don't hang out
with them, they‟re going to take you down the wrong path. They‟re the evil ones.
So many 15s get a reputation in their life of being evil. That‟s cute to me. These are
the ones that if it weren't for him you wouldn't have fallen apart in your life. Look at
how many people this person has destroyed, blah, blah, blah. But again, it's one of
the things to recognize that‟s inherent in this. All of our potential for what is
incorrect, what is evil, what is wrong, what we morally see as criminality, what we
morally see as misdirection, what we morally see as the prophets of horror. It‟s all
not-self, but it‟s from here. This is saying that human beings have to be concretized
to the flow. They have to be brought to the flow through magnetism. And we know
that ultimately that magnetism is going to be expressed in this quarter. And then we
will see its expression.
It‟s really nice that as soon as a baby is born you can get the info back to the parent.
You have to start working on 3/5s as soon as they take the first breath. You have to
pretend that you don't expect them to be a great baby. You have to be prepared for
them being a problem. You have to get ready for all the things that are going wrong
and then you‟re going to raise a healthy child. And again, it‟s our attitude towards
our children. It‟s the way in which we can nurture what is correct for them and take
them away from the negative.
If we take them away from the negative the depressing part about going through the
wheel is you get to see how much of what's intended to work correctly doesn't. It‟s
very easy for me to describe all the negatives in the journey around the wheel. I
must tell you it would be an ordeal for me to describe only the positives. I honestly
don't know what most of them look like. The only one I really understand is Clarion,
because it‟s me. But then again, what is to be expected of the awakened profile on
a cross, that's not what I'm talking about. It‟s not the dysfunction that I'm
describing to you. These 3/5s that are coming in with the Sun in the 15, they‟re not
discovering essential new magnetic flows. I need a 3/5 that is going to find the
monopole for me. I'm not holding my breath for that movie.

The 3/6
RAC Vessel of Love 2
Extremism is one of those things where it's just so obvious that these are beings that
don't have a flow. And their deepest magnetism is the magnetism to anarchy. The
3/6 on this cross are, whoa; even the 3/5 on this cross, their first Saturn cycle is
probably the only time they get. I wouldn't make book on how long they‟re going to
live. I wouldn‟t, particularly in the Third or Fourth World conditions.
But, what you‟re looking at here is that because of the 3/3 phase and because this is
all about finding a flow—remember that the 15 is looking to be fixed by a pattern.
So this 15 is always looking for patterns. And there's chaos in this 3/6 because it's
constantly moving from one frequency to another. It‟s very destabilizing. And of
course, this is collective channel, it's about sharing their inability, this is bonds made
and broken, bonds made and broken, bonds made and broken. Not good for their

The 4/6
RAC Vessel of Love 2
All 4/6s that are Sphinx or Vessels are good positions for them, given the benefits in
the beginning of their life that they don't really mess up with their friends. In most
cases, funny enough, the 4/6, that 6th line that has to go through its 3rd line phase
early in life, the tendency of parents of a 4/6 is to be concerned about their
relationships. In other words, it's actually something pulled out of the not-self
parent anyway. I don‟t like the kids they‟re hanging out with. The difference in this
is that it‟s other parents that are concerned about your child being a negative
influence on their children. Most of the time when you're dealing with a 4/6 not-self
parent it‟s always that they‟re looking at the other kids—hey, you‟re hanging out
with the wrong kids.
These parents get it the other way. They end up getting telephone calls from the
parents of friends of their child saying, we‟ve told our child that we no longer want to
deal with—do you know that your son smokes marijuana? Do you know that he has
been turning on the kids? Do you know that he‟s been playing spin the bottle with
my daughter?
So, it‟s a quite a different thing and it‟s a good thing to warn parents of children who
are 4/6s on this cross that their children have to be careful about who they bring into
their flow, who they attract. And to recognize that these children have parents. And
as the parent of the magnetic force you can get sued. Suing jokes are only funny if
you‟re American. Seventy percent of the world‟s lawyers are American. Isn‟t that
interesting? They have 1/30th of the world‟s population and 70% of the lawyers.

On the roof the 4/6 is one of the wealthiest positions. If you‟re correct as a 4/6 on
this cross with your Sun in the 15 and you manage to get on to the roof reasonably
healthy, you have enormous power to do well because of the magnetism. Anybody
who has the 15th gate in their design has a magnetism that they can work with, a
magnetism that can be very valuable to them, whether you have the whole channel
or not, whether the G is defined or not, you have the 15th gate, this is a special kind
of magnetism. And if you‟re operating correctly regardless of the configuration in
your design, it adds to your magnetic quality.
It also means that you‟re attracting forces that you are not looking to attract. I‟m
glad that I don‟t have that because then I don‟t end up in that situation. But if you‟ve
got it, then that‟s what you‟re going to get. And remember, it‟s a very important
force in your design.

All juxtapositions, after all, all right angles are quadruplicities, all

Every juxtaposition cross, the 64 juxtaposition crosses are unique.
There is only one of them. There is only one Juxtaposition Cross

protect us from what is not correct for us, to prevent us from falling into the wrong
flow, into the wrong pattern.
Everything about the Cross of Prevention is all about this deep, deep protection. And
why? Look at how the unconscious has shifted. When you‟re looking at the right
angle it's the Beatles singing love, love, love, love. And then all of a sudden comes
the 17 and the 18; uh oh. The two most critical gates in the collective process—the
great gate of challenge and judgment, the gate of opinion and judgment.
So, one of the things you see is that
the moment you bring the 17 and
the 18 into this mix, this is all about,
okay, how can we protect? How are
we going to be able to protect
everyone? Let‟s create flows where
if everybody is in we‟re safe. Let's
prevent people from entering into
the wrong things. Well, that would
be wonderful. It would. I would be
very nice.
The 10th gate is the gate of behavior
in the world. It doesn't matter what
you are as a 15, you have to live it in
the world. The 17 and the 18 are
deeply, deeply collective. Together
with the 15 they are demanding that
we change the way in which we
operate in the world. And of course,
the way we‟re supposed to change
the way we operate in the world is going to be a whole bunch of extremes. How do
we prevent the rich from getting richer at the expense of the poor? It gets to every
level you can imagine.
Something about an ounce of prevention; it‟s all about preventing things. It's all
about being prepared. It‟s all about organizing humanity into a safe flow. But this is
the most powerful big brother cross you‟re ever going to meet. It really is. It is this
clutchy “you're in my flow.” It's the: only with me are you safe. Only I, in following
my flow can we prevent the forces of evil. To watch the Lord of the Rings—let‟s all
get in the flow and prevent evil from taking over the world. You know how much of
that is going on right now? The Cross of Prevention is just flying. Let's prevent the
pornographic decadent Western society from ruling the world. Let's prevent it, let‟s
all get in the flow and prevent that. And only if we get in the flow together are we
going to be able to prevent it. And how do we prevent it? We destroy their flow.
I can‟t imagine anybody in Madrid at the Atocha Station feeling comfortable standing
there getting ready to get on a train, no matter what the odds are of that ever
happening again there. You break the flow, you break the rhythm, you create
anxiety, and you begin to destroy the magnetism. How quickly in this country the

conservative party lost their magnetism. It was like, whoosh. And there was a
whole new flow moving through the streets. We will prevent this. No more, it will
never happen again, we're going to prevent it.
Remember, this also collective political. It leads to leadership. We‟re going to
prevent this from happening again. We‟re going to take our troops out of Iraq.
We‟re going stop antagonizing anybody. We‟re going to prevent by being in this
flow. And the other side is saying we're going to prevent these monsters from
destroying our lives and making it decadent, so we're going to be in the flow against
them. And it‟s magnetic. It‟s so powerful, the 15/5, it is so powerful.
My eldest son, Loki, he‟s a 15/5, very lucky. Our villa, our casita, we have an extra
little place and he‟s out of the house. He‟s in his casita. And how different it is the
moment he comes into the house. The moment he comes in the house everything is
on his flow, everything is in his rhythm whether you like it or not. They‟re very
powerful beings.
So when you're looking at the world you have to see that up 5/1s out there right
now are making big trouble, both sides. We‟re going to prevent the Democrats from
winning, we're going to prevent Republicans from winning, we‟re going to prevent
the left from winning, we‟re going to prevent the right from winning, we‟re going to
prevent this, we‟re going to prevent that, and all of it is for your well-being because
love humanity—our version of humanity, our side of humanity. And what better gate
that the 15th gate to express the pure dualism of all this.
It‟s a cusp gate. It puts one foot in Gemini and it puts the other foot in Cancer. Now
in the world, I watch it every day, the newspaper; the Internet is nothing but
prevention systems. And all these heretics that are telling you how to prevent this
and that, how to prevent getting diseases, how to prevent from being broke, how to
prevent this, how to prevent that. There's all this: come into the flow, join us, this is
the way. It is practical provisions in revolutionary times. The only time a 5 is ever
useful is when you need them. If you don‟t need them they're not useful. It‟s all a
matter of the timing. It's nice as a 5 that my practical revolution seems to be useful.
So I seem to be the right time.
It‟s one of things to understand about prevention. It‟s all about time. And the vast
majority of these beings are not going to prevent anything. It's just those few
heretics, how powerful they are, how frightening they are, just to see what happens
to people when they get mobilized in the streets—some prevention. When you see
this on the other side through the 10 it seems so nice. In the Quarter of Mutation
it‟s sort of like, wow, it‟s so pretty, it‟s really sweet. You get down here in the nitty
gritty of Civilization you get down into the matter. It‟s not so pretty, because we see
what the results could be because we live in a duality and the not-self is going to be
magnetic this way and it‟s going to be magnetic that way and it's going to pull
people along the way.
How do 800,000 people—I do not understand this from the point of view of just
being a being—how do 800,000 people get destroyed not by German efficiency, but
with machetes. Do you know what it is to kill 800,000 people in a couple of months?

Do you know how many people you have to kill every day? The Cross of Prevention;
we‟re going to prevent these people from ever bothering us again. We're going to
ethnically cleanse them. We‟re going to remove them all. And there is the mob
going “yeah.”
So, there‟s something to understand about the power of the magnetism of the 15th
gate. It takes away your reason. You don‟t realize what you‟re doing. How can
you? In Sierra Leone when the revolution was going on there in the guerrilla war, it
was decided that the best way to punish people so that they wouldn't join into the
militias was simply to cut off the arms of the males. They cut off thousands and
thousands of limbs. It was a few years ago—Cross of Prevention. Well, they won‟t
raise their hand against me again.
When you‟re dealing with the form principal—why do you think there is all this fear of
the dark and all this evil crap? The form principle is frightening and horrifying when
it's incorrect. It is magnificence when it's correct, but it‟s horrifying when it‟s
incorrect. And one-quarter of the wheel is form principle. And every single one of us
carries form principle in us. And when our form principle is incorrect we‟re ugly and
horrible and horrifying.

The 5/2
LAC Prevention 1
The 5/2; I truly don't want to know what they want to prevent. You have to
understand that from my perspective as a pure individual I have a deep, deep
mistrust for the collective. I really do, because I know from my history what the
collective is capable of. I know what the collective is capable of in the false illusion
of serving the greater good that so many are going to be disadvantaged at best and
destroyed at worst. It‟s the way the flow works, after all. The flow goes and it says
if you‟re not in you‟re out. If you're not with us you're against us. There is no half
way. It‟s all black and white. And the whole thing about the 5/2 is that you know
that the 5/2 has all these plans about preventing things.
Five-twos on this cross belong in the CIA, these kinds of investigative, dig
underneath, find out what the real flow is, get the dirt subversion—to get underneath
and try to pull things into a different flow; in the spy game to turn somebody. Five-
twos are great turners. You know nothing about them, they go to their office every
day in their simple suit and they go home at night and they‟ve got their spy kit.
They‟re going to bring you into their world so you can help them change the flow.
What you see in the 5/2 is cells. Does this ring a bell in our terrorist world? You see
cells, secret cells being developed with their own timing systems, their own patterns.
You'll notice how these cells all have extended programs. None of these cells are
waiting around for a spontaneous moment. Terrorist cells are given a program. The
ones that destroyed—bin Laden airplanes—Air bin Laden, take it to your office—
anyway. One of the first jokes I heard was: fly United, it takes you straight to your
office. It‟s so funny, the black sense of humor that comes out of such horrifying

events. Though, I don't know any Rwandan jokes, thank God, because I don't even
think my black sense of humor would put up with that. It‟s a little too much for me.
But there is this subversiveness and there is this timing and there is cell thing, and
to bring that all together you can see that did the not-self 5/2 is going to be very,
very good at these secret programs, these secret flows bringing in with their
magnetism just the right ingredients to be able to do their damage over time.
There‟s great planning involved in all of these things, all of this effort years and
years and years of working things out to finally get to that moment where you have
your impact and you try to disrupt the flow of your enemy. You try to prevent your
enemy from feeling comfortable. That what terrorism does. It prevents you from
being relaxed and feeling safe. And the moment that a government cannot provide
safety its citizens begin to deny the power of the government.

The 6/2
LAC Prevention 1
When we get to the 6/2 and the 6/3 in this experience I want you to see very clearly
that because they're looking to the next gate, they suddenly have a problem. It‟s
like, wait a minute now, if I look back all I see is throat. It‟s like, it‟s all throat.
What‟s this over here? In other words, that movement of looking forward is that
they‟re going to be looking at the 52. And in looking at the 52 they‟re down, down,
down into the root, into pressure. Oh, the 15 hates pressure. Oh, do 15s hate
pressure. Can I say that strong enough?
If you‟re a 15/5 and somebody says to you “hurry up,” if you're holding a gun—they
hate, hate pressure. And so there‟s the 6/2 sitting up there saying, I‟m supposed to
be a role model for prevention; I'm supposed to be a magnetic role model pulling
people into the flow. Pressure, oh, that‟s depressing. And worse, you‟re a 15
looking at the gate that pressures you to be focused. You‟re the gate of extremes
staring at the gate of focus and it is precisely the same circuit; it‟s horrifying. It‟s
like; you‟re going to take away my freedom.
Once you get into the form business, once you get into the flow business you get
into the freedom business. Nothing takes away your freedom faster than having
people pull you into the flow, because once you're in their flow, you'd better do what
you‟re told. And you give up your freedom. It's an illusion anyway, but it hurts,
illusion or not. So, the 6/2 is standing up there saying aha.
The only thing that saves a not-self 6/2 is that they have such a wild ride in their
extremism on their 3rd line theme that they never get wise enough to even recognize
how much trouble they‟re in. And what‟s even funnier, if that‟s not enough, is that
those that are in control of the flow are the greatest prisoners. Do you know what it
takes to hold people in your flow? Talk about the need for pressure. If you don't do
what you‟re told, we‟re going to sue you, kill you, fire you, drop hot wax on you, I
don‟t know, whatever it takes.

And not only that, but if you're in charge of the flow, you‟re a prisoner to keeping
everyone in the flow; otherwise, you‟re a failure. It‟s such a trap for them. The
moment you‟re in a body you‟re not free anyway. I don‟t know what all this stuff is
about. I'm certainly not free. My personality, my consciousness, my passenger
consciousness is sort of free. It‟s free of the illusion of being controlled by the body.
But the body is already a form principle law that says you're body is in a specific flow
and there's nothing you‟re going to be able to do about that. You‟re going to live as
long as this rhythmic cellular complexity operates and then it will die and you go with
it and there's nothing you can do about that.
Everything about the form principle is robbing humanity of its freedom. It‟s what it
does. So the 6/2 is one of those examples that has to learn to be an example of
giving up your freedom. And in giving up your freedom recognizing that there is
nothing more powerful as a magnetic force than giving up your freedom—Nelson
Mandela, Lenin—not John—Vladimir. Go into jail for a while, it‟s really good. He
gave up his freedom for freedom. He gave up his freedom for truth. Don‟t ask him
personally what he had to give up.
But you really have to see that this is one of those—those 6/2s in this configuration,
they‟re the ones that have to see—oh, I know what life is; life is not being free. If
they can get to that place, it‟s a great wisdom. It's not about saying, oh, woe is me,
we are not free; it‟s oh, woe is me, we have no choice. It's okay. It's not like the
lack of freedom is because we can be free. I promise each and every one of you
truly that if you want freedom there is something you can do: die. At least the
illusion ends. But other than that, the flow is a trap; we‟re all trapped, none of are
free. It's all an illusion.
And it‟s the 6/2 on this cross that has to see that. Ultimately, they‟re the example
of: this is how life works. And of course, it often leads to what can be some of the
saddest commentary you hear, which is I was only following orders. I was only
going along with the majority. I was only going along with what everybody else
said. I wasn't free to say no. I wasn't free to make a difference, I wasn't free to
stand up and protest. It is just one of the things to understand about human beings
and the way we work and not to be surprised that societies can become evil. All it
takes is the right catalyst.

much that it sees that it is all a trap, that they‟re going to be stuck, it‟s that it
doesn't appear that any of the traps work. It‟s like, if I‟m not going to be free, what
kind of a cell do I get? Am I at least going to have some privileges in this lack of
freedom? What are the advantages of surrendering to not being free? What are the
advantages, because boy, when you get to the pressure—I mentioned that years and

of these gates where you get locked up so you can focus. I have people that I have
known in my life who have gone to prisons for things and it was a transforming
experience because they had nothing else to do but focus.
This is supposed to be us. I wrote a song years ago called Prisoner of Destiny. This
is us; we‟re prisoners inside of these vehicles with the destiny to see what it brings,
what‟s going on in the form world, how does it all work. So, this is something that's
very special here, this is one of these fundamental ingredients that are there in
humanity. This is the gate of humanity. And to really be able to grasp that the
great question for humanity is in order for us to evolve, in order for us to work
together, we in fact have to give up our individual freedoms. Now you know that's
not my teaching. My teaching is that everyone has their own authority. I‟m a
heretic, after all.
And the heretical position in the material plane, their heresy is: give up your
freedom, baby, because there is none. And go with the flow because this is the way
of the world. It‟s another time now. And I come from another place in the wheel.
And this old message, if I could wake up these beings, if I could wake up these
15.6s, if I could, maybe, we'll see, then we might have a chance, then we can really
have an engine pointing us in a different direction about the nature of what freedom
is because there is no such thing so why have it. Let's remove it from the maya.
We can do that.
You'd be surprised at how many things have left the maya. Have you ever thought
about that? If you go back into our history how many things are lost, forgotten, that
was done that nobody knows was even done? I‟m not talking about UFO fancy
science-fiction stuff, I‟m talking about ordinary experiences, ordinary processes.
This theme of freedom is deep in us. It is one of the deepest sicknesses of the not-
self is the assumption that they need to be free; of what, I do not know. There truly
is no freedom. And yet, when I look at the 15 and I see the way in which the
collective moves us, I recognize that the collective invented prisons. There are no
prisons amongst the tribes. They don‟t need prisons. If you cause trouble in your
family you get into trouble. You're immediately dealt with. And if you‟re really bad
you‟re simply ostracized and you're never allowed back in. It‟s very rare that you
see real severe punishment within the tribe; it‟s all blood.
But the collective? All the collective does is build prisons. It's amazing how many
prisons there are the world, it‟s amazing how many human beings are in cages. It‟s
unbelievable. I think it is 1.3 million in America. That's a lot of people in jail, no
freedom. This is one of our fundamental themes. We have a deep, deep obligation
whenever we're dealing with Vessels to recognize that the Vessel of Love is not
something that flowery and wussy. You hear this name and you think, ah, it‟s the
Vessel of Love. Yeah; I never forget what's there in the Vessel. I don‟t, I can‟t. I
have the 10, I have the 25, and I know what it is to carry Vessel energy. And I
know that it's not so nice.

It's so obvious that there is this other side to it. And it‟s also so obvious that this
illusion of love, which I describe as the monopole holding together in its mono-ness
pulling everything in, pulling everything else towards it, that this is the very essence
of the imprisonment, of the loss of freedom. And do you know who the jailer is? It‟s
the magnetic monopole. From the moment that the magnetic monopole disengaged
from the design crystal and lost its connection to love and its source, it's been
putting us in prison ever since. And the only time it releases us from prison is when
we die, so can go back to the design crystal and be happy.
We all have our prisoners. We all have our personal jail guard; it‟s our monopole.
So if you want to be in a prison in which you're well looked after, you‟ve got nice
facilities and privileges and good food and good sex and enough money to spend, all
of that stuff, be correct, just be correct. I live in an absolutely gorgeous jail myself.
And I‟ve been telling my guards for years that he‟s doing a really good job. I seem
to get all the things that I need and I don't mind being a prisoner. And it is the way
in which our psychology must go. And it means these beings have to be transformed.

A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
We start with the 52nd gate. Remember something about the presence of a format
energy, the presence of the format energy is one of the deepest conditioning factors
that a human being has as a frequency. If you have a logical format of being
focused and concentrated you can force somebody else, literally, to be in that
frequency. You can bring them to that focus and concentration even if they didn't
want it. That‟s how powerful a format can be. If you look at somebody whose
design is incredibly freaky, very individual, a 43/23 with an 8/1 and they‟ve got
whatever, and then you just stick in the logical format they stop being a freak.
They‟re pulled towards the collective, they‟re focused on finding their place
individually within the collective instead of waiting for inspiration and being
melancholic, there they are trying to work out a pattern. And it's all because the
format is there because the format changes the frequency.
One of the things to understand biologically about how powerful formats are is only
in the six format gates, that is, we‟re talking about the channels between the root
and the sacral, do you have the potential for depression. In other words, if the
frequency is not working correctly, you're going to be depressed as a result. So,
when you're looking at the 52nd gate, the 52nd gate is Keeping Still Mountain.
The frequency is a lock. It's a lock frequency. You can go to jail on this one. You sit
locked; you get to focus forever. And one of the first things to see about the whole
business of matter is that you've got to be focused on the matter being of service.
You're not going to find a more collective cross than the Cross of Service—the 18,
the 17, the 52, the 58—this is as collective as collective can be. When I see
somebody wearing a hat that says Cross of Service I go like this. I‟m a freak. I
want to hide from all of that, because this is in an enormous pressure.
Again, I want you to keep in mind as we're going through that we‟re also looking at
the biological genetic story. And that the form that we're really talking about is this
form, because everything else is just an extension of it, everything else. Tools are
only extensions of our hands, after all. One of the things that it tells you is that we
are here to be of service to the form, this form. One of the most important purposes
we have is that we have to be of service to the form to be able to maintain the form.
And why? Because the other side of this cross, at this 90° angle, you have to be
able to make love to somebody and reproduce. So, looking after this form is an
essential ingredient to get you to a place where you're strong enough, fertile enough
to be able to reproduce to be able to keep the whole genetic movie going, to make
more forms. But they‟re not going to get to that manifestation without the pressure.
We‟re talking about the adrenaline system. We're talking about the most powerful
force we have in our vehicle. It's more powerful that the sacral, it just doesn‟t have
the sacral‟s density of responsibility. And you can tell how powerful it is, is that like
the two pressure centers, they‟re as far away as possible from the throat. When you
talk about Manifestors they‟ll never say to you, I‟m a root Manifestor. They never
say that. They‟ll say, I‟m an emotional Manifestor, I‟m a splenic Manifestor, or I‟m

an ego Manifestor. But if it‟s connected down to the root they never says I‟m a root
Manifestor. It would scare everybody if they were identified with that.
So, we‟re under pressure. Basically, one of the things I want you to understand
about logic is that logic is very utilitarian. It's all about facilitating the smooth
pattern forward in the form. This is also a place of our genetic evolutionary
movement. Remember, there's no mutation that takes place in the body that in
essence does not begin in the root. That‟s where the 60th gate is. And within the
60th gate all of our genetic history is held. This is where all the recessives are, this is
where the whole story is, this is where all the dormants are stored. And it is not so
much that they are stored, but the specific energy, the pulse energy that‟s potential
out of the 60th gate can actually initiate that in its contact with the 3rd gate. The
root center is an extraordinary thing.
So, when dealing with the 52nd gate you also have to realize that one of the things
that we see very clearly is that there are certain frequencies that are primary
frequencies for form. And one of the basic form principle frequencies is stillness.
There are only two kinds of hunters. There is the primitive hunter that runs all day,
it runs and it runs and it runs and it runs and it runs until it finally runs down its
prey. And there's the hunter that sits in a blind carefully, quietly looking at the
Internet, drinking tea having a smoke, passing the day, it has a little radar system,
catches a blip, has an automatic sighting device. He doesn't even have to pull the
trigger other than just move its mouse. Stillness.
Every day when I get up and I come here, I guess it's because basically I‟m a 1st line
person and I'm always in awe of the most obvious things, the most mundane things,
I can't help it. I get into my car and I start driving and I realize that I'm still and I
think how clever we are. There I am sitting perfectly still and I‟m moving through
space. This wonderful machine is just moving me along and there I am in my
stillness.
You can't imagine how important that is for the development of our consciousness.
There‟s something inside of us that said why is that idiot running all day to chase
that gazelle? I don‟t want to run all day. It‟s why I have a neo-cortex. If I was
going to run all day I don't need a neo-cortex—self-reflected consciousness. If you
get this box and you fill it with light then put it under pressure and get it all right.
That sounds very nice. Put it under pressure.
And something happens. If you have this big neo-cortex up here you don‟t want to
run all day, you really don't. You want to stop, look at the sky, think about how
horny you are, what you want to do, where you want to go, what life could be. This
is the 52nd gate. It says, hey, sit still and think, and think about the pattern. This
animal you've been chasing, you fool, always comes behind us. After all, you only
start chasing it when you see it go by, right? Instead of chasing after it, why don‟t
you surprise it? Think.
The greatest discovery of humanity was agriculture. Think of all these gatherers, the
idiots. This is the idiot variation of the hunter, right. There is going to be food on
the trees 800 kilometers north, let‟s move. Yurts and camels and dogs and bears

and off they go. Well, it‟s been a bad year, let‟s move on. Somebody with a brand
new neo-cortex and the pressure of the 52nd gate said, I don‟t want to go. Why can‟t
we just stay here? How does this work?
This is the whole thing about being focused and concentrated. I had this wonderful
experience when I first came to the island. There was a guy I met the very first day
on the island. Somebody had said to me that he was somebody who knew a lot of
spiritual teachers over the years and met all kinds of people, Rajneesh and many
others actually, quite a collection. I had met him my first evening there and I asked
him whether he learned anything. He looked at me kind of funny and he said the
only thing I know is seeing, seeing, seeing. And I thought at that time, he didn‟t
learn very much.
I understand now that he did. It‟s one of the magical things that the 52 that brings
into our life is that there are layers of what can be seen in the moment. And there
are layers of what can be seen in front of you. There are all kinds of seeing. The
one beauty of stillness is what I tell people when they come to Ibiza the first time, I
tell them if you go sightseeing here don‟t do it moving. If you‟re walking through a
valley and it‟s beautiful and you want to just look at it, stand still. If you don‟t stand
still first of all you‟re going to hurt yourself because while you‟re looking at
something there is a stone that is going to sneak up on you and it happens all the
time on this island. It is this stillness that is so magical because it is the stillness
that focuses our pattern system. Being of service is revealing the pattern.

The 1/3
When you start with the 1/3 you start with something that‟s perfect. It‟s perfect,
because it‟s going to realize right away that the pattern of running after the antelope
is stupid. It‟s going to be hungry and sweaty and it‟s going to hurt. It‟s going to
have a 3rd line experience with why do we have to do it this way, isn‟t there an
easier way?
And that stillness, the concentration that it can bring, remember it‟s not so much
that you‟re focused like this, it‟s about seeing that there is a stillness towards seeing
things within the pattern context. That‟s where the focus is. The focus is on just
patterns. You begin to recognize that the animals that come by this way a certain
time of the year and they actually come back. You begin to see that the plants that
you fed off, that you thought there was no more of, the next season they were there
again. So, how did they do that?
And in that begins a whole process. And the moment you can understand where the
animals are going to be, before the animals even know that they‟re going to be

there, you can capture them alive, you can domesticate them, you can change the
world. And it all begins with the 1/3 here. This is 1/3 heaven. They can be of
enormous value in society, in collective society.
The greatest problem with the 1/3 being is that they are so insensitive to what is
different. They‟re very insensitive to what doesn‟t fit in to the collective. After all,
you have a deeply, deeply collective cross. And one of the things to always see
whenever you look at cross configurations if you see that three arms or more, three
or four of those arms are in one circuit, then you know that you can look at the rest
of their design and anything that‟s not in those circuits there‟s going to be an inner
conflict with it.
Think about this person on this cross and they happen to have only individual
definition. This is going to be very, very difficult for them, and they‟re going to be in
conflict with themselves. They‟re
going to be very insensitive to their
own individual impulses. These can
end up being very repressed beings.
This is a wonderful cross name, but
it doesn‟t mean anything. It doesn‟t
mean anything unless you‟re
correct. This is just as easily the
cross of disservice, disservice to
oneself, disservice to humanity.
And not only is it disservice, but in
that sense out of depression,
stillness can turn into frenzy.
Like all 1/3 stories here is an
example of how important it is,
particularly with the 3rd line at the
unconscious level to be able to help
these children to understand their
process and understand that they
are under pressure. And they are
under pressure to be of service, but the way in which they‟re under pressure is
focused through the 52. These are the kinds of kids that you give puzzles to work
on, and pattern things. You give them the kinds of things where they have to enter
into their stillness.
And remember, it‟s not stillness in which the mind is passive. This is not meditation.
This is pressure. This is the stillness that activates the greatest form that we have,
which is our neo-cortex. It‟s the only thing that‟s makes a difference. It‟s the only
thing that makes a difference between us being killer monkeys instead of just
monkeys. It‟s the only difference.
All children on this cross with the Sun in the 52nd gate are going to be disadvantaged
by parents who think that their children should be supremely active. After all, we do
have these generalizations at work that children need to go out and exercise, that

they have to be out playing with their friends, that we get uncomfortable if they
spend too much time in the house, we think they need fresh air. Fifty-twos could
breathe inside of a tunnel all their lives and it wouldn‟t bother them. Really. If you
ever go into the study of somebody that has their Sun in the 52 and it is wintertime
and the doors have been closed, it‟s like stepping into an airless vacuum and they
don‟t notice.
It isn‟t about that. It‟s very important to see it has to do with the parent. If you
don‟t accommodate the 52 stillness you‟re going to get the depressive frenzy. So,
instead of having a child that can easily sit and go through whatever, its puzzle, its
mental focus journey, instead of that you have a child in frenzy in the outside world,
running around from one thing to another.
And of course, this becomes a concern for the parents and so forth and so on. And
children that are disturbed at the root level, this can demonstrate itself in such a way
that these children end up being abused in the sense that then end up being given
medications that aren‟t correct for them, that these are not psychological problems,
that these are physical. This is one of the things about the way the not-self works.
Remember, if you have an open root center, the not-self strategy is to race through
things to get rid of the pressure. This is where the frenzy comes from. And it‟s not
just the frenzy in the 52; it‟s the frenzy in the 53. It‟s the frenzy in the 60.
I have the archetype of that. I have the 60th gate 1st line in detriment, my Mercury.
And in that line you can see where frenzy is, it‟s right there; the inability to just be
able to be just still. So throughout the root system, when you‟re looking at the
format gates, you have to see that there is this underlying theme of frenzy. You‟ll
also see that even when you‟re dealing with abstract there‟s stillness, but there is
stillness in the abstract process, instead of frenzy in the abstract process. We‟ll see
how they‟re all connected to each other. The root is so powerful.
The right angle on the Cross of Service is so much about simply putting beings under
pressure to deal with the fragility of the form which means become more efficient at
building forms, find ways to compensate for the deficiency in forms, and most of all,
the right angle is the beginning of something spectacular that you can only see in
these pressure gates in the root.
My little vignette of getting my car and the awe of being still while moving, what
moves me is an internal combustion engine. What moves me is something that is
placed under pressure. It is a form placed under pressure. And that form placed
under pressure opens up the possibility for humanity to transcend its physical
limitations, to build tools that are far, far more precise, advanced and sophisticated
than our opposable thumb, to be able to travel into space, to be able to do research
deep within the body; all of these things begin with form under pressure, physical.
So, one of the things that comes out of these root gates is our modern world and our
whole movement in humanity towards that modern world, because one of the things
that fragility in the body brings is that it brings all kinds of new contraptions to deal
with the fragility of the body. And from the earliest days of human civilization you

see attempts to find ways to assist the fragility of humans to heal sickness, to mend
broken bones, to extend the length of life, all of these things.
The Cross of Service at this level, along with the crosses that follow today, all of
them have this underlying theme of needing to benefit humanity and needing to
compensate for the fragility of all form, and particularly the fragility of form under
pressure. We know that a mountain is not really fragile, and we know it takes a
cataclysmic event to make it fragile. But then again, it is not a form under pressure;
we are.
We are under enormous pressure because it‟s the pressure that brings us life. It‟s
this pressure. It‟s not just this coming together of the yin and the yang; it‟s not just
the form and the light. That the only way that the form and the light fuse, become
one, become the transcendent juxtaposition is that it all has to be placed under
pressure.
It‟s like big bang physics. Nothing comes from nothing. Something comes from
pressure, always. Before the start there was pressure. It is the essence of the life
force. And if you really want to touch not the local life force, the sacral, but if you
really want to touch the transcendent life force it‟s in the root. This is the pressure.
And it‟s only when this form is under pressure, it‟s only then that it works. People
don‟t realize that we live in a pressure world. What do you think the atmosphere is?
We measure the weight of the atmosphere on our body in pounds per square inch.
And if you‟re going to be a diver diving into the sea, boy are you going to find out
about pressure in a hurry. We are under pressure. Our whole world is under
pressure; under pressure and heated.
And you go into any early laboratory in the 16th century and you have exactly the
same principle. This is us. It really is. And you can see here in the Cross of Service
is this beginning of this recognition that because we are fragile we can transcend
anything; because we‟re fragile. If we were mountains, that‟s the joke in this game,
if were mountains it wouldn‟t matter. What are you going to do, prepare for
something that makes come only once every 85 or 200 or a million years? It doesn‟t
matter. It is because our form is fragile that our role in the pattern is to perfect it;
the Ubermensch, superman, the perfect being, the ultimate being. That‟s my trip; I
sell you that all the time—be correct. Be correct; it‟s just a pattern, I tell you. Go
out and experiment with it, go out and experience it, see that it‟s reliable, see that
it‟s worthy.
And the first thing that I say to you is that you‟re useless, you‟re not-self, you
deserve to be abused, and you‟re fragile. We‟re going to strengthen you.
Conditioning has taken advantage of your fragility. It‟s all in this.

The 1/4
RAC Service 2
So, the 1/4 is going to be very much in need of the kind of educational guidance that
puts it into that comfortable stillness, focused mode. It‟s so important to it. And
again, it‟s going to be the cultural values of the family, the level of the understanding
the family can have. After all, you have a 1st line personality child, you always have
the potential in a child like that that educating them is the most important thing
you‟re going to do any way.
But particularly when you‟re dealing with a 1/4 on this cross not to be one of those
parents that say I‟m going to train my son or my daughter to be the next world-class
athlete. It‟s not what it‟s all about; it really isn‟t. They need to be focused and they
need to be focused in the logical process in their stillness.

The 2/4
RAC Service 2
In this day and age if you want somebody who's going to do incredible logical
research for you find yourself a 2/4 and wake them up, because the 2/4 Cross of
Service can really be of value on the material plane. There is no question about
that. Not only can they really be of value, but their greatest gift is that once they
are called to service they have enormous influence. This is one of the places where
my metaphor, the missionary for the 2/4 configuration, is something you can really
see; in other words, this sudden awakening from one state into its polarity.
If we‟re going to be secure in this life we need the illusion of a secure future.
Nothing creates greater anxiety in a society when it doesn't know whether or not the
future can be secure. Everything about humanity is about this binary illusion that
keeps us sane. That is, for the not-self this illusion that there is a tomorrow and it‟s
going to be okay because we know the pattern, and the illusion that there was a past
and it was all right, and we‟ve left it behind. These are illusions that hold us
together.
And so when you're looking at the 2/4, one of the things about the 2/4 is that they
are the ones that can point us towards the pattern of the future. They‟re the ones
that can tell us, look this way is all right. This is the way that will be of value to you,
whatever way that happens to be. When you're educating a 1 on this cross, you can
educate them to the fact that what is good for the majority may be hell for the
minority. This is something the collective refuses in its genetics to even
acknowledge.

When you're dealing with a 2/4 for there really isn't anything you can do. In other
words, they are not easily educated. And if they don't see in the natural
environment around them a concern for those that are left off the gravy train of life,
those that are disadvantaged, those that are unhealthy and poor and those that are
unfortunate, if you don't do that, then you're going to have forces that are going to
emerge that will only provide certain services for certain beings. It will become
something that is restricted.
It is one of the most difficult things about having a collective cross and having any
other kind of circuit configuration within that in terms of your characteristics,
because despite the fact that the collective can be cruel in that sense, even if it is a
hundred people voting on a law and a 99 vote that it should be, there is still that one
being. It‟s like the Nazi laws in regards to those that were retarded, this idea of
sterilizing. As a collective principle it makes perfect sense. It does. If you‟re the
collective and you're looking after the gene pool of the collective and you‟re
concerned, this is a Cross of Service issue. Let me be of service to humanity. And
the way I can be of service to humanity is to make sure that we take out of the gene
pool this problem. We‟re not killing them; after all, we‟re just sterilizing them.
Now, from the collective point of view, and by the way it's still going on in countries,
there was a scandal about that in India. This guy that was running this bicycle
company and he was only giving the rider‟s jobs if they would commit to sterilization.
It still goes on. This is the collective and from the collective perspective if you‟re
only collective and somebody says, oh, that‟s terrible, you look at them and think,
what's the matter with you, what do you mean terrible. This is not terrible.
I have a favorite movie of mine, it‟s called Swordfish. This movie is about a
renegade do-gooder. There‟s a wonderful scene in this movie where the good guy
and the bad guy are sitting together in a hijacked bus and the bad guys says to the
good guy, if you could save all the children in the world by killing one child, would
you do it? And of course, the good guy says, no we can‟t do that. And while he‟s
still is sort of saying no, the bad guy is saying, and ten children and a thousand
children. Would you kill a thousand children so all the children on earth would be
healthy? Now, if you‟re collective, the answer is obvious. Yes, of course; not my
kid. But yes, of course, let‟s do it. Any individual when they hear that they go, are
you nuts? You would pick me. I don‟t want to be the sacrificial lamb. This is not my
game.
So you have a real dilemma on the Cross of Service. I like to put the Cross of
Service in perspective. I like you to recognize that this is collective service. And
beware, we are a totality, we need the balance of the tribe and the individual and the
collective, and only when they all agree is it something that's going to be correct.
You cannot have a law without a loop hole. And the collective doesn't like loop
holes, it screws up the pattern. You don‟t want to mess with the pattern.

The 2/5
RAC Service 2
One of the things, again, about all 2s, is that when you‟re dealing with personality 2s
there is going to be this powerful pressure on them because we‟re dealing with a root
configuration and it‟s a much more powerful pressure than the 2 normally feels.
Somebody who is 2nd line profile with this Sun is really going to feel the pressure of
the call. Nobody in the collective is supposed to be outside of the collective; it‟s not
allowed. And everybody has to be of service. The collective can‟t stand it if you‟re
going to be a draft dodger. The collective can‟t stand it if you‟re going to jump out.
They want you in. Which makes it very difficult for 2/4s and 2/5s on this cross to
say, hey, I‟m Democratic, you provide the service. It doesn‟t work well on this
cross. The other one says, yeah, no, no, it doesn‟t work that way, I‟m not going to
do it unless you do it. It‟s a totally different thing. You get a lot of negative
problems out of all of this.
The other thing about the collective is to understand is once they put a pattern into
the maya, they tend to forget it, ignore it, and not upgrade it. And so they put
ridiculous laws onto the books that long after they become redundant they‟re still
there. I remember in the 60‟s I think in high school we had some kind of a thing
about learning about the law and stuff like that. And we had some kind of research
to do. And I remember looking into the law books of the City of Montreal and
realizing that there were still laws from the time of horses that were still on the
books, and there was a law that said you couldn‟t tie up your horse on the main
street. And it was still on the books. And there was nobody riding down the main
street on a horse.
The collective does that, and then, if you‟re stupid enough to ride a horse down the
main street some jerk in the collective says, hey. You really have to see that about
the collective. Once the collective puts a pattern to work they assume that
everybody is going to follow it. It‟s hilarious. It‟s like Iraq; Iraq is such a great
example. The collective is going to layer a nice pattern that says this is how you
become a State. How sweet. But the tribes there, you think they‟re going to play
that collective game? They‟re not going to play that collective game, are you crazy.
Only somebody who is purely collective can believe for a moment that that
collective—it‟s like Afghanistan, Karzai, the emperor of Kabul, and then there is this
vast country of marauding butchers and dope dealers. They go to the UN with this
very sweet umbrella. You see, we‟re collective here, we have the vote. It‟s so
funny.
And the collective lives in a fantasy world. That‟s the danger for me of the Cross of
Service. Teach your children well. Just because the sign says that the bus is going
to be there, doesn‟t mean it‟s going to be there. Check it out and see for yourself,
life isn‟t like that.

So, one of the responsibilities for children who come in on this cross is that you need
to give them a balanced perspective because these are the children that if you‟re an
old hippy father and you like to smoke a little puff once in a while, this is the child
that calls the police and has you arrested. They told me in school that this is against
the law. And you always told me that if I did anything bad I‟d go to jail. Well? Bye,
Dad. And then the next day the kid wakes up and says, jeez I miss Dad. It‟s too
late, boy, it‟s over.
So when you‟re dealing with the Cross of Service remind them that yes, we do need
their contribution, we do need the patterns. It is an advisory that all parents of
retarded children should have that they shouldn‟t promote their sexuality. It‟s not a
good idea. It isn‟t. It doesn‟t mean we have to sterilize them, but the only way that
you can meliorate the lack of sensitivity in the collective is that you have to educate
it to what happens to those that are left of the pattern and that for the collective to
always understand that logic can never see that.
It‟s the same way that abstract never understand the limitations that logic has.
Logic has to learn from the abstract. Logic has to see that patterns, yeah,
interesting, but remember patterns are always a projection into the nether and the
nether doesn‟t exist. It‟s just a pattern, after all. You have to wait and see whether
or not the pattern works, whether or not the pattern is reliable, whether or not the
pattern is consistent and who suffers as a byproduct.
All of these medical revelations, all of these new chemical patterns and they pump it
into humanity with this projection that this pattern is useful and then you get
thalidomide babies. And there are all of these people that have suffered so terribly
because of it. And this is the risk of the collective pattern, the assumption that the
pattern is always reliable. It‟s like Newton saying now I understand the world. Well,
ok, but wait for Einstein, baby, you‟re going to be in your place; you‟re relative. It‟s
all relative. The collective has to understand the principle of that relativity.

There is nobody more dangerous than the 3/5 on this cross. Look out, because the
3/5 operates service based on revenge. Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord. This is
a 3/5 God on the Cross of Service. You ruin my life, you ruin my reputation; I‟m
going to fix that.
Three-fives have this incredible ability to be able to discover, after all. It's their gift.
But before they can get to that gift the first thing that they discover is everybody
around them is disappointed with them. That everybody around them thinks that
they‟re a failure. So, how do you become of service? You try to create collective
patterns that are going to protect you; that are going to protect you from
discrimination, that are going to protect you from losing your reputation, that are
going to protect you from the consequences of life.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2

You know what the 3/5 invented on this cross invented? Insurance. The bastards.
To live in North America is to have contact with eight million insurance
representatives in a lifetime. They call you at dinner, they call you at lunch, they call
you at work, and they contact you through your employer. Let me be of service. If
you fuck up and you ruin your reputation by dying, we‟ll look after your children.
This is a classic 3/5 remedy.
And where you see this is the best and the worst is something that we call medical
insurance. Do you know why it costs so much to go into a hospital and be carved
opened? The doctors have to pay a fortune in insurance. In the United States of
America 90,000 people a year have a surgical implement left in their body after
surgery. Can you imagine? And that‟s a statistic from the late 90s, who knows what
it is now. And that doesn't tell you the size of the implements that were left
behind—scissors, sutures, knives, kitchen utensils. Oh, let‟s just sew it up.
This is the insurance. If anything happens to your form—car insurance, sales—it‟s all
here in the 3/5 on the Cross of Service. I don't like these people. I‟m allowed to say
that. Every once in a while you have to get off on somebody‟s cross. I speak of the
not-self. That saves me. It‟s a redeeming factor in my life that I am bigoted
correctly. I mean, this is real political correctness Human Design style. If you‟re
not-self, you are open to abuse; simple as that.
So the not-self on this cross, thank you very much, but I gave at the office. I don't
want anymore. I don't want your kind of service. Now, of course, a lot of people
need it. I do. I know what it's like to be caught without insurance and how expensive
it is. I understand all that. However, this is their service. And what's so interesting
about it is the underlying principle, because this is what I'm getting at through all
this winding around, the underlying principle is the maintenance of the ability to be
able to keep the pressure up. The fact that the breadwinner disappears doesn't
mean that the family no longer can have the financial security to bring the children
to a place of maturity that they can meet in the Quarter of Duality and make more
children.
In other words, this is one of the principles that we see and it tells us something
about understanding the pattern. What the 3/5 discovers is that the form, all forms
are fragile; all of them. They discovered that if Louie built something there‟s going
to be a storm in the next 10 years that is going to flatten Louie‟s work. This is what
you get from concentrating and watching the pattern. You begin to watch the pattern
and you realize that the human body is fragile. And you realized by watching that
there are children that become disadvantaged because they lose their material
resources.
I make fun of this, but after all, it‟s an extraordinary service. It is a service that
maintains the continuity of the form. And of course, we end up with all kinds of
insurance. And one of the most important forms of insurance that the 3/5 initiated is
having as many children as possible. If you want to see a “go forth and multiply,”
this is the “go forth,” the multiply will come in the next quarter. Go forth, go forth,
go forth; and for most of human history the only resource a family had were its
offspring. The only resource you had were your children. They would work with

you. They would help support the family. And you can still see this in the Third and
Fourth World, this combination of your children are your resources, and the fact that
your children can die very easily so you need to keep replenishing the resource.
So when you're looking at the pressure on humans to overpopulate it‟s here. And
overpopulation brings enormous profit to the insurance business. One of the most
extraordinary depths of research that the insurance industry does is that they spend
billions and billions and billions of dollars every year just on the programming is
mortality tables. This is trying to figure out how to make money on death. What is
the fragility index of an adult male who is 40, doesn‟t smoke, blah, blah, blah.
In other words, this is all Cross of Service 3/5 discovery. This is all about finding out
that the form is fragile and the answer is we‟re not necessarily going to be able to fix
the form, but we can certainly make more and we can certainly protect ourselves in
the case that the form breaks down. There isn't a building built in the world that
doesn't have insurance. It‟s a constant. This is the way in which you keep on
maintaining the flow of the pattern. You have to keep on funding the pattern, so you
end up with trust funds. You end up with foundations that set up a pattern of
infusing money into services for humanity.
This is the way it works. So, out of that, this is what the 3/5 brings, so you can look
on both sides of the coin. You can see the negative of that collective process; you
can also see the positive of that collective process. We‟re always dealing with this
fundamental binary.

The 3/6
RAC Service 2
The 3/6 doesn‟t in its not-self recognize the vulnerable and fragility of the form until
it experiences it itself and it does. There is the myth of Jonah and the whale. Well,
if you want to meet a Jonah, you meet a 3/6 on the Cross of Service. They‟re the
ones that say, hey look, we just built a new cable car, don‟t go on that first ride with
them. Don‟t do that. Don‟t get into a car with them and say to them are you
insured and they say, nah, it‟s ok. Don‟t do that with them.
And if you have a 3/6 child on the Cross of Service, you‟d better be of service.
You‟re really going to have to look after this child. It‟s going to be very, very
vulnerable to fragility. These are the kind of children that easily break bones. It
takes a long time for the bones to strengthen, that kind of thing, because anything
that I can describe as a nuance in a nature in any of these crosses is a biological
association at some level.
It‟s a very difficult 3/3 phase in which you don‟t really have the advantage of being
prepared for the fragility so somebody has to prepare you for that. So this is a child
that rather than just getting scrapes and bruises, can be hurt in those scrapes and
bruises and really have to deal with the pain and the shock of the fragility. It‟s a
shock for a child to realize that a house can fall down. It‟s a shock for them to see

that. You bring in a child on this cross with this profile and you show them a picture
of a storm and a house being knocked down, that‟s about as frightening as anything
can be.
And the first moment that they see that human beings deteriorate, fall apart, break,
get disease, collapse, they become deeply, deeply, deeply pessimistic about what
this whole process is. And of course, their reaction to that is that they become the
kind of beings that become over protective, risk adverse, staying away from what is
totally unnatural for what it is to be a 3/6 which is to be totally involved in risk
taking; totally involved, after all.

The 4/6  58  18
RAC Service 2
Depending on its associations when it's young, remember the tendency of the
collective only wants to be of service to its own kind. Where you really see that is in
politics. So, for example, the collective right only wants to look after those that are
wealthy, basically, in hopes that those that are wealthy will eventually look after
those that are poor. But their main interest is to look after the special interests.
And basically what to get in a collective configuration, a collective cross is you get
this tendency towards only these collective solutions. So, if you have a child that is
a 4/6 they‟re going to spend the first 30 years of their life in a 4/3 mode. And what
that means is that whatever their associations are going to be, this is going to be the
collective that they want to serve, which means that they may not be of service nor
recognize how to be of service.
Remember, the advantage of voyeur is that the voyeur is allowed to be in but be in
on the outside so that they can see what's going on, that they have a larger
periphery of any of the other self-absorbed right angle crosses. And because they
don‟t have this totally self-absorbed prospective, they get this larger view, which
means they can be of service. They can see with that larger view what everyone
needs. That everyone needs a change of pace or whatever the case may be, they
can see something.
Obviously, if they are limited to a specific group and the group isn‟t correct for them
then their attention and concentration, their collective approach to a pattern is not
something that's going to be respected generally. And it's not going to be easily
transferable to any others that they can influence. The other thing is that all 4/6s,
their success is deeply determined because the 4 is the personality with the people
that they know, with opportunism. Who you know is where you can go in this life,
for the 4. And so, for the 4/6 on this cross, again, this is a parental thing, the
attention to the associations your child has.
And it's not about restricting them. Remember, the 6th line being, as a 3rd line phase
needs to learn through mistakes. Otherwise, it's never going to get the proper
maturity, but it also has to be protected from being devastated by mistakes, because

they‟re really incorrect, and it's really the incorrect group. You can end up getting
caught in a collective tunnel that alienates you from the rest so you end up in some
kind of bizarre punk movement as a teenager and all your focus is on the service of
that and maintaining that pattern and being of service to that pattern. When it falls
apart it can be very painful.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Stillness
 58  48
The 4/1
When you get to the 4/1 you get to something that's totally different. Juxtaposition
is often like that because it's a medium for transference or shifting. We have a
change that is taking place underneath and the change is that have left behind the
17 and the 18 and we have gathered
in the 21 and the 48. Underneath
this stillness is this powerful,
powerful hunter. We‟re back to the
hunter story. Remember the hunter
racing along. This is where the
hunter learns that the greatest
secret in life is that everything is
going to come to you. Everything;
and this is the only thing that truly
brings stillness to the spirit. This is
one thing that is clear; everything is
going to be there. You're going to
meet everything. It's all there. And
in fact whether you‟re fragile or not,
the truth is there's nothing you can
do about anything.
This is the wonderful story of the
King that is told by its wizard that it's
going to die the next day. And the
King doesn't want to not be King. So the King dresses up as a pauper and sneaks
out of the castle and goes into the countryside. After wandering for hours and hours
and hours and is exhausted, in the night he finds a small little hut. And he goes
inside the hut and he lies down and he goes to sleep. While he's sleeping a
thunderstorm comes over the mountains and lightening hits a big tree right beside
the hut and the tree falls on the King and he‟s dead. What to do.

It‟s like you think you think you‟re going to outsmart the forces. What the wizard
didn't say to him was, remember this is something I teach you often, the wizard
fooled him. If you don't ask a wizard the right question you're really in trouble. The
wizard said to him: you‟re going to die tomorrow. That's not the point. Where am I
going to die tomorrow, where‟s the place? The wizard didn‟t like the King. The
wizard could have said: don‟t sneak out of the castle and go to a hut. Idiot. That‟s
the place. Now, I‟m not going to tell you at all. There are real strange things in this
juxtaposition, very, very strange things.
All of black magic is in the 48th gate, so the moment that you enter into any cross
the carries the 48th gate there is all this: how can I turn straw into gold; the roots of
alchemy, all of the black magic systems, all of that is rooted in the depths of the 48.
So, the moment that you have his shift into this stillness, you also bring in this 48 at
the unconscious level. It's a very, very tricky little place, because one of the things
that it is, is that it says, well, for the collective life works in a certain way. But, if
you have depth you can look underneath, and you can see how you can play and
manipulate with that.
And of course, this is a place where secret knowledge, dark knowledge, can be the
instrument of the 4/1, to be of service to the forces, never forget the 54.4, to be of
service to the forces, to be of service purely for oneself. And yet, at the same time,
recognizing something that the 4/1 unknowns that despite the fact that it seems like
nothing is ever really perfected, there are secrets, there are things that would
change the collective if the collective knew. And of the collective doesn't know you
can manipulate them with it.

Demands, oh such a pressure cross. If you‟re going to start off with all of this root
pressure you need a spokesperson—the 5/1 on the Cross of Demands—you must,
you have to, you will. Human beings are fragile and so is their space. The heretic
demands forms to control the forms. In other words, one of the things that you get
when you get to the left angle is that the left angle looks at the right angle and it
says all that collective pattern stuff is fine but what about enforcement. It's really
nice that you can write a good law, but who is going to sterilize all of those kids?
You think that their parents are going to do it voluntarily with kitchen knives? Who
is going to do this?

So, the left angle says we need to be in control of these fragile beings. This is where
the collective service becomes a collective demand. In other words, is so good for
you, you have to do it. It‟s so good for everybody that you have to do it. James
Joyce, I‟m so glad he's dead,
because he could not tolerate being
in Dublin today. The guy smoked
two packs a day. You can't go into
a pub there and have a cigarette.
It's against the law. Oh, what a
collective law. Now, the collective
law might come out of the right
angle, but I guarantee you it's all
left angle son of a bitch walking in
the door and saying, hey, you‟re not
allowed to do that. The law says
you‟re not allowed to do that.
The heresy is that, I told you the
right angle collective, once it
accepts a pattern it doesn't want to
be reminded anymore, it will just
keep following the pattern. It tells
you something about the collective.
So, it‟s not good at enforcement. It
isn‟t. It‟s like all of the wonderful laws that have been enacted in Western countries
to protect the environment. They‟re great laws, many of them. It‟s like the Kyoto
Treaty, great law, great collective law. Wonderful, thank you very much. However,
let's talk about implementation, and then have a totally different story.
It‟s my impression—somebody asked me, they were thinking of moving to LA and I
said my experience of LA is you get up in the morning, you breathe a few times, you
put scotch tape on your tongue and you pull off the particles. The laws are great,
the laws are really good. But the one thing the program understands about the
collective is that the collective will not focus on enforcement. So you need the Cross
of Demands. And you need these heretics who are going to stand up and they're
going to enforce laws.
And one of the things you discover about collective laws is that people will vote for
things they've actually don't really like. So they‟ll vote for higher taxes to pay for
their school in then they get their tax bill and they‟re pissed. So there has to be the
enforcers and this is what you get. So obviously, if you have a little enforcer, you
know right away that the paranoia is perfect. Here is a 5/1 paranoia that‟s really
perfect. But you‟ve got to remember these are kids.
They get into a lot of trouble in school because their natural tendency is to tattle.
Anyone who's not collective hates tattling. If you‟re tribal and somebody tells on
you, you and your friends go and kill them. If you're collective and somebody tattles
on you, you're full of shame and remorse. And it's expected to be tattle on because

it's a sharing medium. If you're an individual and you‟re tattle on, oh, how dare they,
how dare you, you little worm, you rat.
So, it‟s one of the things about these children is that what you have to be clear with
them about is that they have to learn how to discern when it‟s really necessary for
them to tell. If you see that your friend is about to stick a knife into somebody, it‟s a
good idea. Or if they‟re practicing shooting, you might want to say something. But
again, these children have problems with them.
The other thing, because it's a 5 and because it is the spokesperson for all of this,
these are children that can very early feel left out from the general flow of others.
They can really feel left out because they're not trusted. They‟re not trusted because
these are the ones that really uphold the collective law. And interestingly enough,
the rooting of that is this one non-collective logical gate, and that's the 21. The 21
says we understand that if we're going to be good hunters we cannot be running
after the animals. We won‟t have enough to eat.
It‟s the 5/1 on this cross that points out to you that you‟re not dressed correctly
when you enter into a restaurant. Excuse me; did you just see this man who just
came into the door? You‟re a customer in a restaurant and you call the maître d'
over to—did you see this man come in here, he‟s not wearing a tie. These are the

The 5/2 is one of these curmudgeons, I don't if there is any translation for that—
grumpy, bitchy, pissed kind of person, a snarler. You finally get into their space;
you have to be very lucky. When you're knocking on the door, either they‟re looking
at the monitor because they have a camera, which in this day and age a lot of them
will have, and they look and they think, what do they want? What do they want
from me, do they want anything, I don‟t know, maybe I shouldn‟t have anything to
do with them, maybe I don‟t answer and they‟ll go away. And at some point maybe,
maybe they‟ll let them in. And then they come in. And the moment they come into
the environment, the moment the conversation begins, you can hear the 5/2—I don‟t
like that world out there, nobody does what they‟re supposed to be doing anymore.
Nobody pays attention to the law. Look at that graffiti on the front of my house.
Nobody has any respect anymore, nobody, nobody, blah, blah, blah and they go and
on and on.
And what they‟re going to lay is every collective rule that they notice that people
don‟t obey. Come over here, look out the window, look at this light over here,
they‟re not waiting at the light. Look at that woman with her child walking across
the street and the light is red. She should be arrested for jaywalking. If you really

community. They‟re never going to do anything for the world. Last time they did
anything was 10,000 years ago. Nice people.
Fortunately, only a few get to hear those delightful insights on the nature of the
world. And yet, so that I‟m at least a touch fair to them, they often can be very
inspiring in being able to see the pattern that results from a law not being paid
attention to. And whether in fact, that creates a positive or that creates a negative.
Certain things only are brought to the consciousness the moment somebody tries to
make them a law. We know that in our Western societies that when changes are
taking place in constitutions and things like that, that what that brings up is people
are trying to see what the consequences are going to be both ways; 5/2s are very
good at that. They have very, very deep insights into the way in which the pattern is
working because it's not working.
In other words, that every pattern has an anti-pattern. And this is what you can find
in the 5/2. The 5/1 thrives off the anti-pattern because that gives it its heresy. It
says, look, here‟s the pattern, you‟re not obeying the pattern. If you don‟t obey the
pattern you are going to be burnt at the stake. This is 5 transference on this cross—
you‟ll be burnt at the stake if I don't obey the pattern. And I will be burnt at the
stake if I don‟t tell you because I‟m not worthy if I don‟t tell you.
When you get to the 5/2 you get this ability to be able to see that the anti-pattern
may be positive. There are 600,000 Americans that are serving time now for
smoking or selling marijuana. Ultimately, perhaps, if there are enough 5/2s that
see the anti-pattern, they‟ll realize that this is seriously not productive considering
that it cost $27,000 a year to keep a human being in incarceration in the United
States. If you add up 25,000 times 600,000 you will see that the taxpayers of the
United States are being deeply burdened. Now, that is a heretical anti-pattern
insight. In other words, that‟s the value of the 5/2 in this kind of configuration.

Whenever we‟re dealing with the 6, again we always have to see it‟s the roof of the

most provocative instrument on the wheel. It is what the Bible called the goad; that
prod. The 52, the 5s, they say you have to follow the pattern. But it doesn't mean
that even because they point it out to you that you're breaking the law, that you are
not doing the right thing, it doesn't mean that has power over you. It doesn‟t.
And of course, the 6 realizes that and realizes that in prodding, if you can‟t with
heresy get them to recognize that they're out of place in the collective, then you‟re
going to have to coerce them, you‟re going to have to prod them. You may have to
beat them and whip them. You may have to jail them, you may have to castrate
them, you may have to cut off their arms, you may have to do all kinds of things and
the 6 is up there saying, oh Jesus, well, could you just leave me alone for a while.
I'm not even on the roof yet.
When you‟re looking at the 3/2 and you‟re looking at the 3/2 of Demands, most of
that is internalized. They realize that the world makes demands on them and that
they don't have the ability to fulfill those demands. Their pessimism is about their
inability to be able to deal with and live with the pattern. And there is a basic
hypocrisy here that shines in this hexagram. It‟s the hypocrisy of lip service. It‟s a
lip service that says yes, yes, yes I believe in the pattern; no, no, no I do not follow
it. I don't seem to be able to, I keep on failing.
And ultimately when they get on the roof they become very good exponents of being
wise hypocrites. Yes, it‟s a very good pattern, I think it‟s really an excellent pattern;
no, no, no, I don't do it. And of course, they don‟t publicize the “no, no, no I don‟t
do it.” They say, “You go do it.” The assumption is if that they‟re going to be
correct, they‟ll be able to come off the roof as it. In other words, they‟re going to
embody whatever is correct within the collective pattern. And given that, they're
going to have a great opportunity as a 6th line truly to take leadership control

Introduction
So we come to this wonderful, delightful, sweet, innocent, delicious gate, the 39.
Now, this is not a format. And yet, at the same time the 39th gate is truly a gate of
startling potency. I have talked about it over the years, I talked about it when we
did the 12th gate, there was a mutation that took place, a mutation of the larynx
about 85,000 plus years ago. That mutation in the larynx took place in the 12th
gate. I've been talking to you ever since I began teaching of the mutation that's
coming in 2027 and this is a mutation that's in the 55th gate. Both these gates, the
55 and the 12, are gates that are part of the stream that finds its pressure source in
the 39th gate.
So, one of the things to keep in mind about the power of provocation is the power of
provocation is a deep, deep power to promote far reaching mutations; mutations
that ultimately function through the social mutative delivery system of the 12/22.
However, the 39th gate has enormous potency because of this. It is quite a pressure.
Over the years I have dealt with many, many people who have the Right Angle Cross
of Tension and the not-self Cross of Tension lives up to the name of its cross. And
wherever you look and you see Cross of Tension people you are going to see the
tension. You‟re going to see the tension in their body, you're going to see the
tension in their communication, and you‟re going to see the tension in their lives.
You're going to see the tenseness of everyone around them. And you‟re going to see
for them this is often a very, very uncomfortable life, a life in which it seems like
everyone else is annoyed with them.
We saw the 52 that the form is fragile and the form needs to be driven towards
excellence in order to protect its very fragility. And that very drive towards
excellence, the collective excellence, the collective perfection, is the only thing that is
ultimately going to bring us our reward which is a future that is free of fear. And
yet, we know that needs to be prodded because it simply isn't going to happen
naturally because collective laws are rarely obeyed in the sense that collective laws
need to be enforced, otherwise, most of their potency would disappear. So the
enforcement of the collective law is in the hands of this cross. And yet, this cross
has very little collectivity to it—the 48th gate. The 21 is tribal. And then you‟re
dealing with two very powerful root individual gates, the 39 and the 38.
One of the things to realize is that if there is going to be prodding, everybody has to
be prodded. The collective has to be prodded, the individual must be prodded, and
the tribe has to be prodded. And all of that responsibility to bring enforcement is in
the hands of the Cross of Tension. Now, there is a very simple way to understand
what this cross is for. And there is very simple thing that you can tell anybody that‟s
on this cross. The whole purpose of this cross is fulfilled by bringing tension to the
harmonic gates of the cross. The 39 is here to provoke the 55. It‟s here to provoke
the spirit. It‟s here to provoke the mutation that we will lead to rave children. The
38th gate is here to provoke the 28. It‟s here to provoke the 28 to seek its purpose
in life. It‟s an essential ingredient. Without the provocation there will be no seeking
of purpose.

The 21st gate is here to provoke the 45 to gather better, to redistribute education
and knowledge better, to provoke it to take its responsibility as leader of the tribe.
And the 48 is here to provoke the collective, to advance its skills, that in advancing
its skills it has an opportunity to reach a place in which it can finally be satisfied with
the correctness in the pattern. And the moment that the Cross of Tension is not
doing that job is the moment that all that tension resides within the vehicle. And
these people suffer. It has to get out.
So, it's not like Cross of Tension people are—if you're up there in the assembly line
and you're getting ready and you‟re pulling in a crystal for the old Cross of Tension
it‟s like, ok, but you know what this is going to mean, this is going to mean
problems. People don't like to be provoked. They don‟t like to be pushed. Why me?
Tough luck; someone's got to do the job.
So, here when you‟re dealing with 39 you're dealing with a very, very specific
responsibility on this cross through the 39. The whole focus of this cross is the 55.
And that can tell you something. What it can tell you based on everything that we
know in Rave Cosmology, the mutation that is coming in 2027, what took place in
1781 with the movement of the seven-centered to the nine-centered being, that all
of that is being provoked by this cross with the Sun in this place, all of it. They're
very important to us. And it is important to us that they are operating correctly, that
this pressure is operating correctly.
Now, what does it mean to be focused on the 55 and the spirit? When you're looking
at the 39/55, the channel of moodiness, what you know about moodiness is that the
moodiness is part of the chemistry, it's the melancholy. What you also know is that
you're dealing with an emotional system. The solar plexus is in movement, the wave
system of the motor. We know that the 55 is going to mutate away from that.
So, one of the things to realize about the 39, since 1781, is that all it has ever been
trying to do is fix the wave. And I don't mean fix in the sense of repair. I mean fix
in the sense that ends the wave, stop the wave, stop the wave, and kill the motor.
Killing the motor opens up the possibility for rave children. Now, what does that
actually mean in the way in which we live it? There is no channel more uncertain
than the 39/55. Uncertainty is the nature of individuality. You can never know when
mutation is going to come; we‟re not logical. You cannot base it on anything past;
we‟re not abstract. So there's no knowing when the mutation is going to be there.
When you‟re dealing with the 39/55 sexually, the 39 teases to see if the spirit is
there, not to get the spirit, to see if it‟s even there. And the moment that the spirit
is there, to then try to provoke it, try to provoke it out of its uncertainty. I always
use the example of the lover with the daisy—he loves me, he loves not; she loves
me, she loves me not—the uncertainty principle. If the 39 is doing its job right, the
daisy disappears and there is this shine of passion and love.
So what does that say to us about the role in the purpose of civilization of the 39th
gate? It is to bring a built-in evolutionary trajectory for the vehicle. This vehicle is a
form that is not only fragile, but it is not stable, it is an evolutionary mutative form.

And that the entire process of the 39 is to embody the mutated form. Think about
how that works. The 52 tells us that the form is fragile; we‟d better look after it.
The 39 says, yeah, I know it's fragile, but it's also evolutionary and it wouldn‟t be
evolutionary if it wasn't fragile. It was like understanding that there was no 88°, if it
was 90° there would be no life. We wouldn‟t have these changing profiles, we
wouldn't have the chain of life, we wouldn't have the spiral, and we wouldn't have
anything.
So everything about the 39 is telling us we are a mutative species, we are a
mutative form, we need to support that mutation, and the work of tension is to
provoke mutation. I told you the other day the mystical quality of the 45 is that
ultimately it‟s to be transformed. By what? The 21. The great collective mutation
still waits for the 48 to the 16. We had a mutation in the 38 a long, long, long time
ago.
This news that came out, the genetics of a gene that was discovered that had to do
with the jaw muscles and the fact the only difference between us and primates is
because of their very powerful jaws. They have much tighter structuring of the
muscle system. And of course that meant that there was a tremendous pressure on
the cranium, which didn‟t allow for any development of neo-cortex and that human
beings at some point 2.4 million years ago actually got some kind of a disease, some
kind of virus that mutated the genetic. And the very same gene is a mutated gene
in all human beings and it reduced the strength of these very muscles which changed
the way that we could chew, which meant we couldn‟t chew the way we way we used
to. And it also meant that the brain had an opportunity to be able to expand. This
was a 21 mutation.
So, when you're looking at the 39 and you're looking at this Cross of Tension, this
Cross of Tension could easily be called the cross of provoking continued evolution.
But after all, that‟s too wordy, so screw it; we‟ll call it the Cross of Tension.

The 1/3
It is the gift of the 1/3 to be the true mutative profile. It is the beginning of the
profile chain and as such demonstrates to us at the unconscious level that there is no
such thing as a solid foundation. That‟s what the 1/3 learns. It learns right away.
There are relative foundations, and they are relative in terms of time, construct, and
quality, on and on. But there is no absolute as far as the 1/3 is concerned. I have
had an enormous influence on 1/3s. And my deep influence on 1/3s is that I've been
able to present them with an absolute, the absolute of the maya that cannot fall
apart, which is deeply impressive to them. Because the whole thing about the 1/3 is

that the 1/3 learns that the moment it comes out of the womb is that there are no
absolutes.
That's very important, because what it means is that only the 1/3 naturally
recognizes that not only is mutation and evolution something that's possible and
likely, it's obvious. This is discovery at its deepest level. This is the discovery into
the foundation of what it is to be a form, that our forms are mutative forms, that the
mitochondria in our cells once lived outside of them, after all. Even our cells are the
byproduct of a symbiosis that took place billions of years ago. We are an evolved
construct in the maya.
One of the things that the 1/3 can grasp very early in life is this principle, this
principle that, yes, there is no real foundation, but there are many ways of seeing
what a foundation actually is. There
are many ways of seeing that
foundation doesn't have to be a
word that is an absolute—4,217
years ago God created the Earth.
There are Christian fundamentalist
who will tell you that the only
reason that we have found dinosaur
bones is that God is trying to trick
us. I love that. This is not
somebody who came in with their
Sun in this position.
When you think that this is
Cancerian and you think that this is
yin, you also have to see something
about this, and I think that basically
the men should leave the room, but
anyway, they can stay, I guess.
Basically what this means is the
advice that I gave my daughter. I
said to her, look for potential and shape it. You're never going to find what you want
as a finished product. And every woman knows that deep in her soul is a need to
shape the creature she‟s stuck with.
It‟s deep, deep, deep in their soul and it‟s right here in the 39th gate. It‟s in the 39th
gate that says even they can evolve, even they can mutate because every woman
knows that when she carries a fetus in her womb, that from the very first day until a
moment of transition it all starts off female anyway. The male is a mutation of the
female. So, deep in the female psyche is an understanding that what needs to be
shaped in this life are men.
We're moving towards duality. We're moving towards purpose. So while women are
born recognizing that men can be mutated into decent creatures, men are born
imagining that they can mutate Mother Earth into a better planet, or more efficient,
or whatever. It gets shifted back to the yin, by the way. The men on this cross,

Cancer men are odd anyway, but Cancer men on this cross simply want to do to the
mother what the wife or the lover is doing to them, being shaped; it‟s their revenge.
I‟ll shape the Earth instead.
So, 1/3s, I love Cancers, I‟ve been married to three of them, I know them so well,
deep, deep, well. There is a profound deep matriarchal force that is found here.
This is the root of manifestation. It is the pressure of manifestation. It‟s the
pressure on you to grow up and be a decent being. It‟s the pressure that is there on
the yin principle itself, that they are the instruments of that form and its mutated
capacity, and to be able to nurture it, and all the rest. And to realize that they can't
do it without the other and the other is a stick of wood that needs to be fired up, that
needs to be pushed and prodded and provoked and driven.
You have a 1/3 child on this cross, they‟re going to drive you crazy. The great
privilege I have in my life is my son Jeeva. He‟s got the 30 to my 41. He‟s got the
19 to my 49. He‟s a 39/55. He‟s got the 22 to my 12. He is an emotional
conditioning atomic bomb. And he still lives. And I don't explode when he comes
into my aura. You can‟t imagine with his 39 what a provocation that is. He‟s a
cosmetic dentist (sound of a drill). And what I love most of all about it, because it
doesn‟t bug me, is the twinkle in the eye when he is provoking you. There is this
twinkle, there is this glee that says “I can mutate you”—he‟s a 3/60 as well—“I can
mutate you any day of the week. I can mutate you right now, this moment.” This is
the power that‟s here, this extraordinary power to mutate.
One of the things that people don't understand about the tension is that if you don't
resist the tension that you get from these beings, they‟re driving mutative forces
within you. They‟re helping you find your spirit. They‟re helping you find your
purpose. They‟re helping you gather together. They‟re helping you find your skills.
Oh, it doesn't feel like that. This is that horrible voice somewhere in the background
that says this is going to hurt me more than it hurts you. Yeah, yeah. It‟s not
comfortable to have them do that to you; but, that's what they're for.
This is a deep, deep dark force. You‟ve seen that throughout civilization. If you
want to see the deepest, darkest feminine force, you‟ll find it here, because this is
the feminine force that never lost its power, never gave it up to the patriarchy, never
surrendered it to the father, have always seen the father as their own son. That‟s
how powerful they are.
And yet, when you see them in life as not-self it‟s tragedy, milquetoast and
weaklings and clingy people afraid of mutation, afraid of transformation, beaten
down for their provocation. A 1/3 child is going to provoke its parents—you made a
mistake, you made a mistake, you made a mistake—whack, whack, don't tell me
that. Don‟t talk to me that way. I know better; I‟m older than you.

to let them know that if they don't have the right friends, it‟s the same thing with the
4s—the 2/4, the 4/6, the 4/1—we‟re going to see that here on this cross that if you
don‟t have the right friends you're going to end up friendless. And nothing is more
painful than a 4 being friendless. It doesn't matter whether they have a 2 in front of
it, it doesn't matter what any of the configurations are, a 4 is a 4 is a 4, and they
need their community, they need their opportunities.
But the moment that you‟re a 1/4 and you‟re as provocative as this is, then you
really have to see that you‟re provoking your friends and they‟re not going to like it.
Oh, he‟s so pushy. Oh, she‟s so pushy. And of course, for the child in its
psychology, they don't understand what's going on. They don't understand indeed
they are pushy, but that‟s not a fault, it‟s a gift. And if they learned how to use that
gift—education—learn how to be discrete, learn when to say things, learn how to say
things, learn how to get that mutative information across, be a little more subtle,
don‟t scream in the fancy restaurant that you‟re taken to when your father picks up
the wrong fork, don‟t scream “that‟s not right, don‟t you know how to use a fork.”
Oh, death; indigestion for a week for that father, never go back to that restaurant as
long as he lives.
The embarrassment that you can suffer as a parent with one of these; they‟re very
provocative. So education is very important for them to understand what they are
like. In other words, I don't tell my kids to stop pushing my buttons. I don't tell my
little one to stop pushing my buttons until he's gotten me to a point that I'm not
apoplectic with rage. But I will give him enormous leeway. I‟ll tell him something,
and he‟ll totally ignore me, waiting for that “I‟m going to get him.” And say, no, no,
no. And he‟ll keep on doing his thing. It will go on and on and on, because he will
ride that attempt to provoke as long as he possibly can.
It‟s one of the things for them to know it's not that I object to him provoking me, I
object to him provoking me for too long, that‟s all. He knows there is a time limit to
what I can handle. All right, you‟re good at this; good. And he also knows that so
often because I know that he would provoke me endlessly, endlessly, he knows that
at certain times he can say things to me and I will respond immediately. It‟s like,
“I‟ve got him now.”
He mutates me into being a more considerate father. It‟s so easy for someone like
me to be absorbed in my process in my studio and then there's a little voice in the
wilderness somewhere in the house screaming, “I‟m hungry.” And I know the
moment that I hear that, that if I don't get up and get the little guy some food, he
will not go get it himself. He will keep on calling intermittently. He will begin to
sound like some poor Biafran; there will be these cries and moans and groans, his
outrage. And no matter what I try to do, I know it's not going to stop until he's fed.
I have tried things like: go get it yourself. It doesn‟t work.
After all, he‟s here to provoke me, not the other way around. It is impossible for me
to provoke him. I tried, you can‟t. As a matter of fact, it‟s terrible, because if I try
to provoke him he‟s better than I am at this game. He immediately turns it around
on me; I don‟t bother. He‟s the boss, right? He mutates me into being a more
considerate father. I‟m very aware of that. I go upstairs; I make his sandwich,

RAC Tension 2
You don‟t really know if you want to call these people, because the chances are that
when you see something in them that you think is worthy, you're going to pay such
a price for waking that up in them. After all, they are the ones that are the
mutative forces. And there you are knocking on their door trying to pull them out of
their “leave me alone,” crank up their 4th line opportunism, get them out the door to
do their thing in the world, be the great mutative force.
Every time they go out the door they're going to meet all of these not-self beings
that have the 55th gate and the 48th gate and the 16th gate and the 28th gate and
hate their guts. And they're going to come back to the person who talked on their
door and they're going to lay that at their doorstep: look at what you did to me.
How dare you. Look at what you did to me. Look at all the trouble you go me into.
Everything was fine at home. I was going along in my nice little process, living out
my nice little 2/4 mutation.
Why do you think that the New Age principles that we've come in contact with over
the last 50 or 60 years about how human beings can be mutated by these kinds of
experiences; it's rooted here. And if you look at the study of any master you'll see
that all masters provoke you through the spirit of this cross, all of them. And if
somebody was wise enough and had the time they would be able to categorize all of
the teachers that have ever come on this planet and be able to put them on their
proper position on this cross. In other words, in essence to be able to see that this
is the archetype of provoking mutation.
Now, I‟m naturally a 48. Both of my Neptunes are there. This is my way. The way
in which ultimately my provocation works is that I provoke you to the depth of
recognition that's very profound. It‟s my ability to take you down into the depths of
a mechanical reality, to actually give you the mechanical depths, and in doing so
provoke in your skills. And more than anything else my work is to provoke new
skills. Human Design analysts and teachers, the way in which all of the skills on the
planet can be redesigned through Design, how this depth represents a complete new
background and a complete provocation to the skills that exist on the planet.
If you're a Freudian or Jungian, if you're somebody who still thinks that neutrinos
don't have mass your skills have been eliminated by the presence of Human Design.

If you're an astrologer you‟re being provoked by the presence of Human Design.
There are all kinds of provocations that come out of this kind of depth, because this
kind of depth changes the skills. There are other teachers that bring you mutation
through other aspects of this cross.
So again, to see how powerful it can be and how powerful it can be in a 2/4
missionary. And yet, at the same time to recognize that the moment you‟ve got a 4
and you send them out into the world as a provoking force, that the very allies that
are the basis for success for them can be turned off by their power, turned off by
their provocation, not be ready to accept the provocation. If you‟re correct,
everything is different. Oh, how I would love to see in this time, because after all,
this one of the engines of the 2027 mutation, how important it is in this time to have
correct beings that come in on this cross and not simply at the 39 level, but come in
on this cross on all of its arms. It‟s an instrument of our mutative process.

The 2/5
RAC Tension 2
The 2/5 often mutates alone. They‟re people that go through very deep, personal,
hidden processes. Now, every once in a while, they can be very heretical in the
sense that they can take that personal mutative process and bring it outward. But,
the 2/5s on this cross, and I‟ve only met a few, they‟re physically crippled. I don‟t
mean that in the absolute sense of that word. Their body is preoccupied.
It‟s one of the difficulties with the Cross of Tension is that because you‟re dealing
with the deepest form principle and because you‟re dealing with provocation to form,
that when you don‟t operate correctly, you really suffer in your form. And it also
means that the form itself can become very mutative, which means that you can
have things inside of your body that are not going to be healthy for you, particularly
if you‟re 4s and you‟re going to incubate things that are going to become viral.
There is a lot of suffering on the Cross of Tension people.
I think the physical body that suffers the most on the Cross of Tension is the 3/5.
When you‟re looking at the 3/5, because you‟re going to have this deep 3rd line
personality conscious experience of being rejected for your provocation—after all,
think about it. You‟re a 3, you see something that‟s not right, and remember that on
this cross your genetic predisposition isn't simply to take it inward and say “I made a
mistake,” this is about prodding the form in others. It's immediately seeing the
mistakes in others and pointing it out. And it's not pointing it out with the benefit of
service.
As much as the 18 can be provocative, it has a logic. The 39 has no logic. It
doesn't. So it doesn't have a nice way of saying, look the pattern is like this and
you‟re slightly out of the pattern and could we realign you inside the pattern. No, it‟s
this screaming, that‟s not right, you‟re messing up again, Dad, says the three year
old. It drives you nuts.

And of course, the 3/5 recognize it‟s all, like the 1/3, it‟s all just plain propaganda.
Nobody is growing, nobody is mutating. You meet a 39 and you ask them what life
is and they‟ll say “growth.” It‟s one of the classic 39 responses: growth. This is a
growing experience. We‟re growing. I love that. And if I‟m growing, then you‟re
going to grow, too. And if you don‟t grow I‟m going to pump you full of stuff to
make it grow. It‟s like these people who are afraid their kids won‟t get big enough

The 3/5
RAC Tension 2
The advantage of the 3/5 is that it can lead us to the secrets of what mutation is,
because if you understand this cross you also understand that you're dealing with
four mutative channels. You're dealing with four archetypal mediums for the
mutative process. There's a great deal that can be understood in that, there is a
great deal that can be deduced from that. And to see as well that despite the fact
that in circuitry we see that only in individuality is the mutative medium, that there
are mutative forces of transference from the individual to the tribe and the collective
and this operates through the 21 and the 48.
So, we‟re dealing with a very, very powerful force. These things need to be exposed.
The archetype for me of 3/5 consciousness is Darwin, this discovery of not only that
we evolve, but we evolve relative to our environment. And of course, relative to our
environment is also the evolution of humanity. Intellectual development of humanity
varies depending on the climate and the results of the climate on how we had to
adapt. If you have to build a building and reside within it and cut yourself off from
the sky, you have a different consciousness than somebody who lives basically
outside. And it begins a long process of changing the nature of the consciousness,
mutating the nature of the consciousness.
It's one of the things about cold climates and why most of what appears to be the
genius of humanity originates in colder climates. But it originates in colder climates
because you're closed in. The stillness of the 52 begins to take over. And the
moment that you‟re closed in, the moment you spend more time on the inside is the
more time you have in reflection; it‟s the more time you have to develop strategies
because the amount of time on the outside becomes limited when you can do and
get the things that you need.
They had a mini ice age in England the Middle Ages and it got very cold. This was a
classic example of form mutation. In that era the nobility lived on the higher floor
and the servants lived in the main area the castle. The reasoning for that was that
of course the heat was rising. But when the mini Ice Age came, that was no longer
efficient. They had to create enclosed spaces above and below and heat from the
bottom up, and the bottom turned out to be warmer than the top, which is why if
you go into the English countryside into a two-floor house take a room on the bottom
floor because it gets chilly as you move up.

And of course, that created something else; you had to invent the staircase. And
inventing the staircase changed their idea about the way in which we could design
buildings in terms of levels and on and on and on. It also was a time in which indoor
games were invented, games like chess became popular, the art of creating
tapestries and all these kinds of things. In other words, we have form mutation.
And form mutation is driven by a 3/5 frequency. It is a deep recognition in discovery
of first the fragility of the form and the mutative potential of the form to dream of
how the form can best be dealt with, how we can best compensate for the fragility
and the evolution, how we can plan for that.
And of course I'm not just talking about us; I‟m talking about what we create. In
other words, what we create is the need to create with a mutative vision to
understand that times are going to change, to understand that if you're going to
place a lot of structures in an enclosed area, then you have better plan for the
movement of traffic before rather than later. You‟ve got to be able to see that the
form needs to be changed. And then you have to provoke it. This is not just going
to happen.
It‟s so easy for Cross of Tension people to say, there is something coming down the
road we should be ready for. And the others are nodding their head. It doesn't
mean they‟re going to do anything about it. It‟s like my broadcast today for anyone
who has the 44th gate to understand that they are a potential bridge and they‟re a
potential bridge for bringing a major epidemic into our lives within a matter of six or
seven months. Now, it would be great if everybody on Earth who had the 44th gate
could understand that, could understand what that means, to take precautions
because the precautions are not a big deal. It would save us a lot of time and
energy. The fact that I know that doesn't mean anything. The fact that I put it out
on the airwaves—well, it‟s not like I'm reaching millions of people, I'm not.
So there is going to be somebody out there that is going to act as a bridge, they‟re
going to be the one—Typhoid Mary—they‟re going to be the one that‟s going to bring
a new influenza into the world and then they‟re going to have the 44th gate and
probably going to be the 4th line and we could have prevented it.
So, one of the things that all heretics know is that it‟s great to bring a heresy, but
boy do you need foot soldiers, you need the provokers.

about a product that needs to mutate every 10 years? There is no profit in that.
How about a product that mutates every six months? When you're looking at a 3/6
on this cross you know they invented the upgrade. This is the 3/6 classic
contribution on this cross. Yes, yes wasn‟t that product wonderful three months ago,
you need an upgrade. It‟s like having the Microsoft platform. Every other day there
is an upgrade—security upgrade one zillion, 9 trillion—the 3/6 upgrade system.

I would love to see all these awake 3/6s with their Sun in the 39 giving us all these
fabulous upgrades. I for one would like to have a larynx upgrade. It would be
wonderful. Somebody comes over with some delightful machine that goes (sound),
and gets rid of 45 years of smoking, it cleans it all out. I wouldn‟t mind a lung
upgrade, a kidney upgrade, give me an upgrade; I‟m ready. After all, that‟s what
we‟re working on, we‟re working on upgrades. Let‟s upgrade the form. Let‟s clone
it, bone it, hone it; I don‟t know. It‟s upgrade time.
And this is a 3/6 because the 3/6 recognizes something. It recognizes if we are
mutative, we‟re always mutative. We can just keep on mutating. We can just keep
on developing. And then we get the frenzy. This is our civilization. You can see how
frenzied it‟s become. Look at the amount of new forms that have emerged since the
Second World War and compare that to humanity‟s first 80,000 years. It‟s like, wow,
talk about frenzy, and talk about upgrades, a gazillion upgrades. Just the costumes
we wear have been going through seasonal upgrades since Noah. It‟s an ongoing
business.
You could make a lot of money shaping forms. After all, the fashion business is a
3/6 on this cross. Let‟s upgrade their costume—upgrade, upgrade. Look at these
magazines with all those pictures. This is the provocation, particularly when they‟re
very expensive things they‟re wearing. This is the provocation. Their provoking you
and they‟re provoking you to upgrade. And if you don't upgrade you‟re left behind.
If you‟re not wearing what‟s in—if I hadn‟t bought my son an iPod I would have been
war criminal number one; no choice. And he's got three 39‟s, my oldest son. Not
only do I get a 39/55 little one, I‟m married to a 39. I know all about this. I live in a
perfect environment to truly be a master. I have a test every fraction of every
second of every day. The gods know quite well that I have just the perfect prison
guards. They keep me in line, keep my frequency clean.
So, you can see here that the 3/6 can be deeply valuable. And when it comes to 3
combinations I do like to show the good side, because we don't even have to
contemplate the bad side. And the negative side of the 3/6 on this cross is that
these are beings that appeared never ever, ever, ever, ever to be stable in anyway.
It's the extreme cliché of the ladder stapled, but it's worse. These are people that
are constantly mutating. They‟re Jewish one week and they‟re Muslim the next week
and then they give it all up for ostrich farming and then they give up the ostrich
farming for gay marriage and then they give up gay marriage for trucking and it
goes on and on and on and you look at them and you think: problems. Where‟s my
next career? And you can't imagine how provocative they are to anyone who knows
them. What are you doing this month?

They‟re always looking at the other and because they are always looking at the other
they are able to see whether or not in their group there is this fertility, whether there
is this mutative potential or not. And if there's ever a 4/6 that has deep, deep, deep

influences as a potential, it is here in this configuration. In other words, this is one
of the ways in which the tribe can be influenced by individuals, it‟s one of the ways in
which the tribe, which is very resistant to mutation, that the tribe can actually take
on mutation. And it begins with these small communal groupings around the 4.
Now, because the 4/6 is on the periphery it gets to see that potential. The difficulty
for 4/6s is that in paying attention to what's around them, they may not see their
own sterility, they may not see their own lack of mutative potential and drive. So,
the dilemma again is what's going to happen to them in the early part of their
process and what kind of background they're going to grow up in.
So many of these crosses are deeply different depending on your class, your state
with kings in this life. The form principle is something that can be explored in a very
broad way if you‟re part of western society. The form principle does not have that
kind of depth in many societies. And of course, those societies become deeply
resistant to this provocation. And then you get the anti-form principle.
It's one of things to see about the 4/6 is that the 4/6 brings this potential of the
deep mutation, the kind of people that got into deconditioning people that were
taken over by gurus, they were going to de-conditioned them. And basically, it‟s
about de-mutating. In other words, it's about creating sterility. Now, that‟s a key
for you to understand that this aspect of the 39 is more powerful than its mutative
provoking power on the positive side. That's why we're becoming sterile, all of us.
That‟s why sterility is in the planetary program, and it is very powerful and it's
growing more powerful all the time.
When you see fundamentalism, when you see retros, when you see any of those
Atlantians, these are de-mutation people. And the whole thing about de-mutation
people is that they are a microcosmic projection, if you will, of what is a
macrocosmic principle, that if you don't push mutation you get stagnation.
Now, you all say, ah, wouldn‟t it be nice if that wasn't so and we could all be fertile
and everybody gets provoked to mutation. People always say to me, well, what is
this “no choice.” They say I'm studying Design, does that mean I don‟t have any
choice. And I say, yes, no choice. If I don‟t wake up, does that mean I didn‟t have a
choice? Yes, no choice.
The form principle is inherently hierarchical, everything operates through fractals.
The fact of the matter is that sterility is supposed to win. The program knows what
the not-self is. It programs it. It feeds off of it. Oh yes, there‟s going to be those
rare, rare, rare 39s that are capable of provoking enough mutation so there is
mutation, this fine balance in the 39 between the right mutative energy to produce
rave children and the wrong mutative energy to kill off humans.
And then you wonder why the male fears the female. This is archetypal. It goes so
deep into our soul. It‟s so deep in our mythology. And it‟s something to recognize.
Transformation is never for everyone. Awakeness is never for everyone. It‟s not the
way things work. It will never be the way things work and we‟re never going to
wake up enough people to stop the sterility. But then again, if it weren‟t for the fact

that we were going to become sterile, then we wouldn‟t expand our consciousness
and intelligence enough to thumb our nose at it. You say that we are sterile; well,
we have transcended the form principle. I can make a human being in a cow. I
don‟t need you. Not only that, but I can design it. I can create it exactly what I
want to in my image.
This program is such a wonder. It has all these things, they‟re all woven together.
So you have to see that there's a lot of sterility potential in the 39 in a spiritual
sense, in the transformation sense, because that's part of the energy. It‟s cutting
down on a fertility of the human reproductive process, but also the human process.
The program knows that killer monkeys are a waste. They are a halfway process.
We‟re a bridge, particularly us that have been born since 1781. The nine centers
don't belong to us; we‟re just stuck with them. We‟re seven-centered creatures.
The last real humans were born before 1781. We‟re neither this nor that; we‟re the
transition to rave. And because of the way mutation works it‟s not that one
immediately dies off and the other suddenly emerges. Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal
lived together for about 200,000 years. It‟s not the first time; it won't be the last
time, but you have to understand the principle.
There is sterility, which means you're going to see this in these beings. And what
that means for them at a concretized level is that 4/6s are going to be beings are
very, very uncomfortable physically with their tension, because the tension doesn't
have a mutative outlet. And if they're not provoking, then they're really in danger in
the first Saturn cycle or in a Kironian phase they‟re really in danger of physical
damage, disease, premature death, all of those things that can be associated with 6th
line process.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Provocation

The 4/1
Juxtaposition—I don‟t even want to deal with this, but I will. The Juxtaposition Cross
of Provocation—only provocation matters, only cranking up the spirit matters, only
turning on the fire matters, only setting them flaming matters. And the sad thing
about it is that it serves no purpose. Right angle provocation always has a motive;
but, remember something about juxtaposition. The nature of the 4th color, the 4th
color has a problem in that it has something called transference, which means it's
very difficult for it to stay fixed, which is why the 4th line is a movement, a
transference field between the right angle in the left angle.

One of the things about the 4/1 on this cross is that it provokes for provocation sake.
It‟s like this artist that does stuff with dead body parts. It‟s like provocation for
provocation sake. I suppose at the extreme one could see that because of the very
nature of diversity all provocation is valuable and that any mutation that is prodded
along in the end can be of value, I suppose.
However, I am not here to be an apologist for the not-self 4/1 on this cross. I'm
really not; they‟re heavy. Because when you get provoked by the right angle, the
right angle is actually saying to you, I‟m provoking you but if you pay attention to
this provocation it‟s going to be
better for you. In other words, there
is some value directly attributable to
the provocation itself. But the 4/1?
No. It‟s like being provoked for the
sake of being provoked. You never
know. Maybe it's useful, maybe it
isn‟t. Who the hell knows; it doesn‟t
matter.
The underlying reality of the 4/1 is
that this is a very, very, very, very
fixed force demonstrating that all life
is mutative, period. That‟s what it‟s
here for. And it‟s here to make sure
that we are all deeply aware of the
mutative process. It‟s so interesting
to me that the 39 is where you have
the anti-mutation, the anti-
provocation, the polarity to fertility.
There is this question about what is the value, after all, of constantly mutating if
each mutation, in fact, doesn't really resolve anything, but simply opens up for
another mutation and another mutation and another mutation. And one of the
things that the 4/1 on this cross understands is that mutation in and of itself cannot
be seen in isolation as the be-all, end-all, end-of-the-road finished, over gate.
In other words, the motivation of the right angle is mutation that's going to bring
you concretized result. And for the 4/1, mutation simply serves mutation. In other
words, just keep on keeping on; just keep on provoking, keep on mutating, sooner
or later we're going to all see that that's all that life really is. It‟s just form changing,
period.

The Left Angle Cross of the Individualism 1

 38  57
The 5/1
I have a deep attachment to the Left Angle Cross of Individualism often to a point
where I sit back and simply enjoy it without paying much attention to what it really
is. Everything about my work is the exaltation of the individual. Everything about
Human Design is about getting to
the point where when you
recognize the essential truth of
differentiation you recognize the
unique contribution that every
individual makes, how beautiful the
individual is, how extraordinary the
individual is. And again, I'm not
speaking of the individual in the
circuit sense; I'm speaking of
separate units of beings.
Then comes the Left Angle Cross of
Individualism and you wonder why
you bother. They are the strangest
creatures because they are
individual. Even for a freak like
me, pure freaky individual
definition, Left Angle Cross of
Individualism, I look at them and I
think, God they‟re freaky. It‟s like,
wow, how do they survive. How is there even space for them on the planet? They
are extremely provocative. Underneath is not the 21-48 anymore; underneath is the
51-57, this shocking, penetrating potential of ego, this bravado egoism of the 51,
and the penetrating awareness of the 57. There is nothing more penetrating than
the 57, which is why this left angle will lead to the Cross of Penetration. And that‟s
what they really do to you.
So, here is this penetrating, provocative individualism. And you think, is this what
it's all about, is this where we are going. But they are the embodiment of how the
not-self, despite itself, can remind you of an essential truth of nature. We are here
to mutate the individual. We are here to be mutated as individuals.
The 5/1 is very paranoid. And one of the most interesting things about the 39.5 is
that it looks out at the world and it thinks, what‟s their problem, the whole world,
don‟t they know how things work; it seems so obvious. And it doesn't matter what
anybody does in the world. There is this sense of „they just have to do it like me.‟

that it is the only expression in the wheel, these two variations, the Sun in 38, the
Sun in 39, only two variations in the whole wheel of the genetic predisposition to be
incredibly different. And the moment these beings are different, they want
everybody else to be like them. And they will provoke the hell out of anybody who
isn‟t like them. This is not “I want to be like you.” This is “You have to be like me.”

The 5/2
LAC Individualism 1
My favorite is the 5/2 on the Cross of Individualism. You honestly don't understand
how they survive. You truly do not understand how they can even stay in a body.
You don‟t get it. They‟re so odd. The only thing that saves crosses of individualism
is if they have a lot of collective definition. It‟s like they can sort of mask it. No, I'm
not really, I'm not really, I‟m not really. But a 5/2, with a touch of individuality in
their design, ah, are they weird. And they will do the weirdest things. They will
make the weirdest things; they will eat the weirdest things.
It‟s the kind of people that get up in the morning and throw half the pantry into a
blender. And what comes out is the most disgusting concoction you have ever seen
in your life and not only that, God forbid you‟re a guest in that house because they
have a glass in your face—drink this; be like me. Oh, my God they‟re weird.
I met one, just one; I don‟t want to meet any more. I don‟t want many more living
examples. I know several on the other side and they‟re really weird. I don‟t even
want to talk about them. At least these are concretized weirdness. The others are
un-concretized weirdness; very different. At least you can see that these people are
bizarre and weird.
The thing that is so magical about them is that you don't want to lock them up. You
don't want to kill them off. There‟s a sense of wonder about them. How do they
make it in the world? Who let them in? How did they ever get through school?
There are some that you would meet and you‟d look at them and think, my God, how
did they get here. How is it that nobody killed them? How is it they didn‟t die along
the way? Ah, they‟re such creatures.
And there is this wonder in the rest of us, this kind of aha, aha. I‟ll never forget the
look on my son's face. I was living in Sedona. And while I was living there they had
a crazy guy. They called him The Waver. This is a guy that walks up and down the
street and he waves at all the cars going by. The cops don‟t do anything. And the
tourists drive by and they wave back. This guy has a strong right arm. He‟s got a
heart that‟s never going to give up. He‟s pumping blood in that heart.
He‟s walking and waving and I‟m driving along in the car and Loki says, “Hey, there‟s
somebody waving at us. Does somebody know us?” We had just arrived in town. I
said no, that‟s what he does. This is a collective child. This is what he does? And

this. And then he said to me, does he get paid? I said no, he doesn‟t get paid. And
he nods his head; that job‟s out.
They are very bizarre creatures. And what they do is they teach all of us that hey,
you can get away with being really different. I noticed that the first time I came to
the island, because when I first came to the island, one of the first things that
happened to me in my deconstruction process was that I put a longee on my head
and tied it around and I looked like some 12th century Arab with an Arab headdress
and I was Ra. What was amazing was it didn‟t seem like anybody cared. Oh well,
nice to meet you. Ok, there‟s room for creatures like me.
My favorite image, I had a little Italian Mobilette, a little Chow, and there I am on
this Chow in an Arab headdress with Ambuja, my wife, sitting sidesaddle on the back
of the Chow. And we‟re driving along the main street in Santa Eulalia, and the
German tourists are there with their cameras going like this. And nobody cared.
This is the magic of individualism. She‟s a 39.5, she is Cross of Individualism; they
are bizarre creatures. But it empowers you to your own bizarre-ness. Hell, if they
can get away with it, I can get away with it. And then you notice that human beings
don‟t care. They don‟t.
One day—you can‟t do it any more here, but you could when I got here in the 80‟s—I
see a guy driving by in a car—well, calling it a car is really generous. It had no
doors. It was so decayed it had what I assumed was a license plate from the last
century. There is a guy inside, you know that he‟s really in trouble and he‟s driving
along. Nobody cared. This was the magic that you found in a place like this. You
could be anything and nobody cared.
That‟s the magic empowering thing for humanity. We‟re afraid to be different.
We‟re all afraid to be different. Every child is afraid to be different. To stand out
means that you could be picked on; to stand out means that you have to take the
heat. We‟re all conditioned with our openness to be just like everybody else. No,
no, these creatures show us and they suffer, after all. It‟s not like that was a choice
that you come into the world that way. You come into the world way, that‟s the way
you are.
But it is this empowerment. This is the heresy. The heresy is you can be whatever
you like. You can be yourself and nobody will mind. They just won‟t. They‟ll just go
on with their lives. It‟s like, oh, ok. Nice to meet you; away you go.

the abstract process and you get to this whole trip, the whole life of this. And this
whole thing where you don‟t know what's going to happen and you build a house and
it gets knocked down and you invest in your body and it falls apart, all of this. There

The 6/2 individuals, again here is a classic example of the power of this. I've never
met one. I know 5s, I know 5/1s on the other side and I know 5/1s on this side, I
don‟t know the 6s. Ideally, this is a classic place to be a role model. It's even easier
for them to find their role as a unique role model because they‟re already configured
to be different.
But remember, you're still dealing with a 38-39. That difference is provocative.
And if you're not going to have a healthy 3rd line phase at the beginning of your life,
it‟s very unlikely that you're going to you love being different. It‟s like children who
have strong individual definition in their design; they‟re not comfortable with that.
No child growing up was strong individuality is comfortable. They're trained in
collective social environments, there is a lot of pressure to conform, and it‟s often
very difficult to be different. Children don't like it.
And you can see this inherent fear in all of us to be unique, the fear of standing on
our own two feet. So, theoretically the 6/2 on this cross can be an enduring
example for all of us; in other words, an example of the beauty of being an individual
example. So often there is the hypocrisy of their lives, the hypocrisy of trying to
look ordinary in the world. And then going into the retreat of their 2nd line
unconscious and living out their unusualness behind closed doors, but hardly a viable
example.

The 6/3
LAC Individualism 1
I have sympathy always or empathy is probably a better word for the 6/3 process.
How difficult it is to not really be of the hexagram and always be pointed beyond
where you are. It creates in itself its own pressures. This is this energy that's
necessary for this bridging phenomena to go from the 6/3 to the 1/3. And you can
see in that bridge that unlike the bridge of the 4/1 to the 5/1 you can see how this
bridge is an unconscious bridge but a very unstable unconscious bridge. It's a trial
and error unconscious bridge. It‟s like the 6/3s mistake becomes the 1/3 start.
There is this continuity in the 3 theme, in a mutative theme. And if you think about
what we've learned from the 39 you will see that all 6/3s and 1/3s in their
relationship together are creating these mutative bridges where this jump can take
place from the 6/3 to the 1/3 consciousness.
I enjoyed watching 1/3s—you don't see it very often, but Randy, a friend of mine
and he‟s a 6/3, and I have a lot of 1/3s in my life, he was babysitting my children
this morning—the relationship between the 1/3 and the 6/3 is one of the magical
relationships. It‟s like the relationship between the 4/1 and the 5/1, there is a very
special relationship in that sharing of the foundation. And with the 6/3 and the 1/3
there is this sharing of the mutation, this movement of the mutated field.
By the way, the 4/1 gets it two ways, which makes their job so difficult, because
they have this personality bridge with the 4/6 and then they have the unconscious
bridge with the 5/1, so it‟s something that makes this juxtaposition, juxtaposition;

we don't speak of the 6/3 in the same terms because of that. But yet, still to
understand the 6/3s job is to bring the mutative potential of the fulfilled hexagram to
the mutative foundation of the next hexagram.
The not-self 6/3 on this cross can quickly discover that you could not invent your
individuality, and that's what they try to do. In other words, they try to redesign
themselves all the time in order to deal with the trial and error that is this deep
theme in their life, only to recognize that you can‟t—it‟s like people that I meet who
come to Human Design and they say to me, I've been working on myself for years. I
hear that a lot from people. I have moments where I'm not very respectful and I
remind them that they been polishing the not-self.
Basically, with most human beings what they call working on themselves, this is
what they do. They polish that not-self. One of the interesting things about the 6/3
on this cross is that they're always trying to polish the not-self discovering ultimate
that it doesn‟t work, which leads naturally into a new beginning, a fresh beginning.

Introduction
We love new and improved. Human beings love new and improved. And the
moment that you move from the 6/3 and you enter into the 53, what you‟re getting
is new; I don‟t know about improved, and new in only a certain sense, new in the
sense of beginning.
All the way up to this point, remember telling a story at many levels. We have seen
a number of things in entering into this zone after the 15. We saw the necessity in
the 52, this focus that was necessary. We saw that the focus isn't enough, that we
need to provoke and prod. Because the collective solution is not enough, it won‟t be
adhered to, we have to enforce it; otherwise, we cannot develop the form. And we
realize that because the form is fragile and because we are mutative we can keep on
adapting and through adaption enhance our potentials.
And then we get to the 53 and the 53 says, stop talking and start doing something
about it. All of this is very nice—patterns, collective structures, the straw bosses
that are going to push us, the individuals that are going to show us, but hey, as Allen
Ginsberg said, I‟m going to put my queer shoulder to the wheel. Let's put our
shoulder to the wheel. That's what the 53 is all about. The 53 says, come on now,
let‟s do it.
There is nothing more revealing than to see a 53rd gate hanging by itself in
somebody's chart. When you see a 53rd gate just hanging there by itself it‟s the
opposite of the 52. The 52 says: be in jail. The 53 says: be free. It‟s quite different.
The 52 says: stay very still. And if you stay very still it's going to focus your
consciousness. And the 53 says: don't stand still for a moment, because if you stand
still you‟ll have to focus your consciousness. I won‟t focus my consciousness. All I
want to do is do. All I want to do is be a human. I don‟t want to think about being
human. I don‟t want to wonder about being human. I don‟t want to think about
experiences, I don‟t want to wonder about experiences, I don‟t want to do anything
with them other than start. I want to start now.
Oh, penetration, what shit they leave behind. They‟re really good at starting, but
starting is only starting is only starting. It‟s only starting. It‟s not continuing. It is
not finishing. It‟s starting. I tell people with the 53: be a starter, don't ever be a
finisher. This is really good to jumpstart things and here, if we see it in its cross
dimension, terrific; when you see it personally—no, no, no, no, no. In its cross
dimension it is obvious, we do have to get it started.
And the only way that that evolution works and mutation works is that we live the
experiential life, that we enter into the human process and all the stuff that comes
with it. And the moment you enter into that process, guess what; you can‟t wait for
it to end. But we don‟t want to talk about that. I don‟t want to depress you. We‟ll
wait until we get to another part of the wheel, like the 54 on the other side that
says, ah, thank God it‟s over. It‟s nearly done. That‟s the ambition for the end. I‟m

ambitious for heaven. I‟m even ambitious for hell; anything to get out of the wheel.
The wheel starts here.
I love that tarot picture of the wheel, all the creatures on the wheel. There‟s
somebody down at the 53rd gate going (sound of grunting), get it going. If you don‟t
get this damn wheel going, nothing is going to happen. Mutation takes place because
we are in the flow of the program as a whole. We have to get to certain places
before mutations kick in, we call that time. I know that's place; but nonetheless, we
still have to get there.
You have to get in the process; you have to get into the whole thing. You can‟t think
about Rome when you‟re still living in a cave. You have to get out of the cave first.
This is getting out of the cave. Rome is in the 42. It‟s a long walk, a long trek, lots
of things to be learned along the way.
This is one of the basic maternal principles. And that maternal principle is that you
move that child towards going out in the world. You get them going, you give them
life. The 53/42 is the channel of the midwife, it's a channel of maturation, it‟s a
channel of life coming into the world. It is, in its essence as a format, the frequency
of being human. Logic is not the frequency of being human; logic is the frequency of
life forms, all life forms.
But the format out of the 53, this is the only human frequency, this is pure
humanness. And so when you get to the 53rd gate, what you're getting to is
something so essential to grasp. This is the yin ready to manifest. You can see that
in the double yang at the top. It‟s really getting ready to stand out there.

The Right Angle Cross of the Penetration 2

The 1/3
So we begin with the 53.1, Cross of Penetration, 53, 54, 57, 51; all those 50s. Now,
penetration has to be understood. Somebody who is on the Cross Penetration has
the ability of being able to penetrate anything on the surface. The Cross of
Penetration can never go deep; never. It isn‟t here to know the middle or the end,
only the beginning.
The true Cross of Penetration is that if you‟re going to go out ice fishing, you bring
out one of these penetrators to cut the hole in the ice, but not to do the fishing, not
to explore the depths. They‟ll shatter so fast. After all, I am a mutation out of
penetration. The left angle of penetration is the Clarion; these two variations. So I
understand it. But, I don‟t have the 53-54. I traded it in for the 61-62. That‟s quite
a different mix. And I know these penetrators. And I know how much they would

love to be Clarions and they can never be Clarions because they‟re penetrators. The
only thing they‟re here to do is break through the surface.
Nothing suits a 3rd line being better than a cross that says “let's have a new
beginning.” You can't imagine how penetrating a 1/3 can be. Oh, my goodness, my
goodness, my goodness. And if they‟re a male and they have a dick, 1/3 penetrators
will penetrate anything, alive or
dead, moving or stuck. Penetrate,
penetrate, penetrate, and nothing
happens, it‟s just penetration. It‟s
like getting a needle, but no goods.
You put a need in, you take it out,
and you don‟t get anything. You
just get the needle prick; you get
the pain, nothing else. I‟m going to
cure your disease, have a needle.
But you didn‟t put anything in. Hey,
I only penetrate. What do you want
from me? Somebody else has to fill
in this hole.
You have to understand what they‟re
like. If you understand what they‟re
like you can forgive them in real life.
They‟re here to start things going.
That's their magic. Their magic is
that they can penetrate you, that
they can give you kick in the ass. They can get you going. They can even get
themselves going for a few minutes until it wears off.
These are beings that operate best on the surface, this very, very superficial plane of
the mundane and its forms. And there their magic is wonderful. In the country of
the blind, the one-eyed man is king. In a world that lives on the surface, the
penetrators seems profound, they get to penetrate the surface. The last person on
earth that is willing to wake up is somebody on the Cross of Penetration. And when I
say willing, I‟m talking genetically. It‟s even risky for them, because after all that‟s
not what they‟re here for. They‟re just here to get it going.
The 1/3s are great at this; they‟ll penetrate and penetrate and penetrate. But
because they don't understand that that‟s what they're about, they assume they
should go further, they assume it‟s their failure that they can‟t. They suffer because
they can open up a door, but they can never truly go in and stay there. And out of
that comes a kind pessimism that is biting, a sense of recognizing truly the worst of
what they see and covering it up by living on the surface by choice, in the sense of
the not-self.

RAC Penetration 2
Any time you take the values of the 4th line and you associate it with penetration you
know right away that you've got a very, very influential force. Please understand
something about penetration. It is really valuable. It is something that is necessary
in this chain that we‟ve been looking at.
But again, the way it works as a generalized frequency is so different than how it is
lived out in somebody's individual design. How difficult it is to have somebody on
the Cross of Penetration come into any kind of esoteric program, the demands of
them that they‟re supposed to go into the depths and whatever. It‟s not for them.
And yet, it doesn't mean that they're denied awakening. To awaken to your role on
the Cross of Penetration is to understand that is your gift, get them going and then
walk away. Crank them up and set them on the road. Hit that magic button and fire
them up. Most penetrators take advantage of their gift one way or another. And
given the nature of the not-self we know that it can tend to be very manipulative
because they can penetrate so easily.

RAC Penetration 2
The 2nd line is already on the surface. This is the whole thing about shyness,
shyness is a barrier. It‟s a barrier that says you can't reach me. It a barrier on the
surface, it's a barrier up front. And then you combine that with penetration. One of
the things that the 2/4s are really good at is if they are awakened on this cross they
know how to break down that barrier. This is the kind of being that can discover
ways of getting around problems in infertility. If you look at the 59.2 you can see
there can be problems in reproduction.
So when you're dealing with a cross like this, there is always the potential of being
able to penetrate an understanding of a form principle. The most difficult thing is
that it is here in this gate that the not-self strategy of the root center originates; this
being in a hurry to be free of the pressure. This is a gate of freedom. This is a gate
that once it starts something it feels truly trapped, would like to get the hell out; if
you‟re a 4 that's very difficult.

And wherever you look in the Quarter of Civilization, you will find the anti-materialist
direction. You'll find the anti-side. Everything about the form principle is the
recognition that it's necessary to have tension. This is dynamic tension.
The 2/5 isn't interested in starting anything. The idea of starting anything is so
frightening. And it's interesting because when you look at the negative of the 53 it
becomes a positive of the 52 and you know the frequency is all messed up. The 53
says before I start anything I'm going to focus and concentrate; what a joke. Then
you end up with focus and concentration frenzy that produces nothing. And people
who start thinking about this thing and that thing and move to the next thing and
the next thing and the next thing.
The 53 is the person that's always starting something. I‟m starting my yoga class
and then you see them the following week and I'm starting my jungle gym class, you
see them next week and I‟m starting my chess class. At some point you say to
them, are you doing all these classes? No, I left that, and left that. I‟m starting this
one. They never say I'm going to my class. It‟s always “I'm starting; I‟m going start
this and I‟m going to start that, I‟m going to start the next thing.” If you add up all
the things that they started in their life it‟s really extraordinary.
If you can‟t live according to your nature, it doesn't actually matter what cross you‟re
on, you‟re going to get stuck in the characteristics. It‟s easy to be able to think that
if I look at the cross I understand the person; but in fact, that‟s not true, it‟s really
not true. You can understand the not-self configuration that the cross and its
quarter focus will bring, but only within the context of the characteristics. And it‟s
the characteristics that have to be transcended. Only when the characteristics are
transcended can you live out the role of your profile. How difficult it is with certain
configurations to get to that place.
It‟s not easy for the 2/5. Think about the 2/5 child, really think about the little 2/5
child, like the 3/5 child, think about these children. The moment that their parents
deal with them there is this expectation based on that 5 unconscious that there is
something special about them, that there's something that‟s going to be wonderful
about them, that they are really going to be an answer of some kind, and they‟re a
fuckup. The parents don't get what they expected and the child immediately absorbs
it all.
Two-five children are very paranoid. And so they should be. People looking into
them, people expect things of them, and they're naturals and don't know how they
know what they know anyway. So, the not-self of this creature is just penetrating
away; starting things and they don't work and giving up.

through a kind of a communal martyrdom. I can't tell you how many bad ideas were
initiated by 3/5s only to discover that yes, there was something decent in there, yes,
if I'd only seen that beforehand. And when you're dealing with penetrators they have
no idea what lies ahead.
Remember their role in the program, their role in the program is to get out and start.
That‟s their role in the program. That‟s okay. We do, we need to get our whole
process cooking. Let‟s get out there and be human. But again, at a personal level
it‟s very, very difficult. And the 3/5 is going to suffer, its reputation is going to
suffer, the 3/5 on this cross will never hear the end of it. It's a 3/5 calling up its
parents and saying to them, hey, I have great news, I‟m getting married. Yeah,
well, let‟s see how long it lasts. The others didn‟t last very long. Don‟t expect a
present, it‟s a bad investment.
The 3/5 reputation is made very, very young and on this kind of configuration, it‟s
difficult. Whenever you see a 53 in somebody's chart remind these people that they
are great starters, and if they want to stay with something it means that somebody
else has to do the staying for them. Somebody has to hold the process together;
somebody has to take the process to the end.

The 3/6—oops, sorry; I can‟t imitate their “oops.” It‟s a wonderful “oops.” What to
do with a 3/6 penetrator. You penetrate the wrong things. You penetrate the right
things in the wrong way. You penetrate the wrong things in the wrong right way or
whatever, all the combinations. It‟s just penetrating and penetrating and
penetrating and unfortunately this can be very promiscuous. And I don't just mean
sexually promiscuous, I mean promiscuous with who you do things with, and the
things that you do, and the things you get into. It‟s just like, well, all right, let's try.
Nothing seems to work. If I start this maybe, if I start that maybe; this is a very,
very, very, very depressing cross on the not-self.
I know very few people who have the 53 who don't suffer from imprisonment
depression. Because even if you‟re in a solid relationship, if you have the 53 there is
always a part of you that says, I want to be free, I want to be free, maybe they‟ll die
tonight and then I‟ll be free. I want to be free. Maybe if I act really badly they‟ll
leave me. I want to be free. This is the 53rd gate.
It‟s the 53rd gate that is totally beyond its depth after the start. That's why the 53
goes to the 62. The 62 says you start it; I‟ll work on the detail. Don‟t worry about
it. It‟s all okay. There is somebody else to take over. You‟re just the spark. That‟s
all right. Well, be a good spark. It‟s very hard for 53 to be a good spark. Thank
you for starting this; now, go away. Because everybody else is supposed to be there
for life; everybody is supposed to be in it until the end. If you‟re going to start
something, finish it. It‟s the human experiential way.

The 4/6
RAC Penetration 2
The 4/6 really get very quickly into the wrong relationships when they're young;
typical 4/6 wrong friendships. It is very difficult for the 4/6 on this cross to be able
to fulfill the potential of its personality. They're not very good at continuing their
relationship. They‟re very good at starting. As long as they stay on the edge in a
voyeur configuration, that's okay and it won‟t be a big deal. But the reality is that
it‟s very difficult for them to grow and mature within a relationship; that means
personal relationships as well, but particularly with their community or 4 influence
group. It‟s something that's very difficult for them. They can only just penetrate.
This is ideal if you really want to live out the voyeur, the true voyeur where you just
penetrate enough to peek. You don‟t get right in; you‟re really on the outside
looking in. So in that sense, this could be something that is functional for them, but
I personally feel that the 53, this cross is very, very difficult cross to carry. I have
friends of mine, people I care about, who I've known in my life, who are on this cross
and I see how painful their life is.
I have a friend of mine, he was born a couple of days before me, lives in Germany
and he‟s somebody that I knew, particularly my early years, and somebody who
wasn‟t a designer, he was just something that came into my life at that time. He
wanted to penetrate things deeply. And you could see that he was like a child with
water wings on, and the child see a kid diving under the water and the child wants to
do the same thing and it can‟t. Every time he tries to dive down the water wings pull
it back up.
And I saw that he was starting all these different things. He was studying this, and
he was looking at that, and he was looking at the other thing. He was very good at
that surface; he had all these little surface bits. But the penetrating, he couldn‟t get
there. And I could see that it was painful for him because he did not accept that not
only is that what he is, but he has no right to go deeper.
Everybody thinks that if you wake up you wake up to some extraordinary depth.
The gods have a much better sense of humor than that. You wake up to all the
possibilities. You wake up to the possibility of being the perfection of shallow.
What's wrong with the perfection of shallow? Nothing; it‟s the perfection of shallow.

can prefect the surface, it‟s just as beautiful as perfecting the depths. It‟s all the
same movie.
The moment that these beings understand that they don't need to get down to the
root, they don‟t, the hell with that. Master what it is to be there be there on that
surface. Master what it is to be able to penetrate perfectly just the pinprick and
nothing else, and how incredibly valuable then these beings become, incredibly
valuable, for others. It triggers them, gets them going, pushing them into starting
something they can‟t do.
What a great force that they can be and so in a way unselfish if they‟re awake that
they will send others where they cannot go. This is Moses, standing on the hill and
pointing at the promise land, the promise land that Moses could never live in, but the
people could live in. That‟s a penetrator. It‟s a penetrator with grace. You open up
the door and say, here, have a beginning. And by the way, if you want to know
where I am I‟m going to be back here opening doors. No, I don't want to come with
you; I don‟t want to get into all that muck. I want to stay up here on the surface
where everything is full of light. It‟s bright and shiny and we can all pretend that

have a friend that they‟ve suffered a loss, a death in the family, their parents,
somebody died, their lover died, whatever, this is the person that will come up to
them and say, ah, get over it, get on with your life. Get going. Life is nothing but

Civilization is like that, this quarter, sort of yeah, okay, you know; but, you can see
how tied we are to the wheel, lashed to the wheel, super glued to the wheel. This is
the form principle. It can be so cruel if you're not correct. It‟s why Human Design is
so liberating because it liberates you from the constraints of the form. You don‟t
have to struggle with the form, you can simply go along with it, allow it its way.

The Left Angle Cross of Cycles 1
 54  32
The 5/1
Let‟s get to the Left Angle Cross of Cycles. It‟s odd, because when you come from
the left angle like I do and you get to penetration, I‟m an Arian, the next thing after
penetration on the Aries/Libra side or polarity, that‟s the Clarion. And here, in the
up and down, the penetration is followed by cycles. This is the difference between
right angle and left angle. In the right angle you‟re going to have these four
variations. But the left angle is two separate binaries. So there are two Left Angle
Crosses of Cycles. Here we‟re looking at the one with the Sun in the 53.
It‟s the most important teaching that we get in Civilization from a 5/1, the heresy of
the 5/1. And the heresy of a 5/1 is it‟s all nothing but cycles. And the deeper you
go in understanding the nature of cycles, the more you're going to see the
helplessness, the closer you‟re going to get to the spirituality that allows you to
surrender to the form.
I don't think that anything has been as revealing for me in my own process of
investigation and study, particularly in my first 10 years, than in looking at cycles
and watching cycles as they affected me, cycles of all kinds of things in my life. You
can see very clearly that we are designed to move through a transforming program.

And that how mutative we‟re going to be is simply our relationship to the program
that transforms us. And that because everything is in cycles, there is always a
chance for us. It doesn't mean we never miss out, in a way. It always means
there's another turn of the wheel, there‟s another chance, there is another
incarnation, there is another chance to meet Saturn, there is another chance to meet
whatever. It‟s all cycles.
Not only is it all cycles, but that is not a concept, it‟s not concept at all. It is the
concretization of what the life process is. And that every activity is an aspect of the
cycles in life. And that the whole thing in life is go through the cycle. And because
it‟s a cycle, there‟s a promise. And the promise is if you go through you can come
back. That‟s its deepest mystical promise.
For me, when I first started in Design
there were certain things in my mind
that I felt that if in my lifetime they
could be substantiated it would allow
me to see both the validity of Human
Design, but more than that; the
chance for others to see that out of
this matrix so many things can be
understood. One of the most
extraordinary things is the nature of
incarnation. You can‟t understand,
make sense of, or know incarnation.
We‟re not designed for that. But I
am convinced that you can prove it.
That‟s something else. And you can
prove it because of the nature of
cycles.
One of the things to realize about the
53rd gate is that the 53rd gate brings
us as its real expression to the nature of sequencing that life is built on sequences.
That those sequences, whether they are genetic sequences, cellular sequences,
molecular sequences, whatever it may be, whether it's concretized on the surface as
cycles in the way we understand, it's all the same thing. It is a life sequence.
And so, at the very basis of the 5/1 here, is the expression of what life is on the
abstract plane, what it is to be human, what it is to be human is you come and you
go. The essence of being human is that there is a beginning and there is middle,
and there is an end. Remember, this is the left angle. It isn‟t as stuck in this
surface as the penetration. You‟ve moved along.
Because we have been unable to prove cycles at one level, has led to our belief
structures, our concepts about what continuity is in the life force. On the other side
scientifically we have grown to see, particularly in the last 400 years all kinds of
cycles and have come to understand basic things about life itself, that life itself is all
about various cycles, cycles of birth, death, decay and birth, all of the lifecycles on

the planet. And the more that we see things are cyclical the more obvious it is that
so existence, that so is the life force and the consciousness force.
I actively pursue proving incarnation, which is about proving the validity of
sequencing from our perspective. And here in this gate is where it all begins. If you
don‟t have the Left Angle of cycles you don't get it. You just don't get it. As we
move towards the end of Civilization, form has to be reminded of something, that
form is always available. And basically when you're looking at the 53 the symbol I
would like you to keep in your mind is the symbol of the house in the country in the
dark, you‟re trying to find it and there‟s a candle in the window. It‟s that candle in
the window that calls us. And this is the beauty of the potential of the 5/1.
It reminds us that there is always going to be a place that we return to, it reminds us
that there is truly no beginning or no end. It‟s the closest we get in the configuration
to the expression of the alpha and the omega. This is all there in this 53. Most 53s
are depressed. They‟re depressed that they're not free; they‟re depressed because
they think that one cycle should end so that they can start another, instead of
realizing that we are not in control of that. What begins ends when it ends; nothing
more, nothing less.
This is also a deeply, deeply superstitious configuration. Fives are paranoid. There
are certain crosses where the 5/1 is superstitious. This is one of them. And it is the
fear of the cycle. It‟s like somebody who's afraid of their Saturn return, afraid that
they‟re going to have a midlife crisis at their Uranus opposition. There is a paranoia
about the cycle: uh oh, here it comes again. And all that buildup to a potential
disaster so there is fear in that.
Now, there‟s a good reason for that. Paranoia in the 5 is not misplaced. I would not
like to give up mine. I'm in no hurry to give it up. It makes you very alert. It‟s very
handy to have. But the thing is that we should be paranoid about cycles, because
it's all about cycles and what goes around does come around. It is what it's all
about; pay attention.
There are people in the world who should know better, who don't understand that it's
all the cycle, that no matter how far away you think you are it‟s going to come back
and get you. So, rightfully so there are those who are very aware of it. And one of
the essential ingredients in Eastern karma, not karma as we know it in Design, but in
Eastern karma is rooted in this. All the really ancient religions are rooted in this
quarter, the form based, the deep form-based religions, not these conceptual
religions with these can‟t-see-them, can‟t-touch-them gods. This is concretized
gods; this is when the gods were visible. This is where the gods are physical, where
they touch you, where they are their most human. Those are the gods I like, the
earthy gods, really earthy. They have problems, they fight with their wife, don‟t like
their kids, they eat them for breakfast. I like these kinds of gods.
The moment you get into monotheism it‟s spooky. They don‟t go to the bathroom,
they don‟t have lovers, they have a conversation once an 18 millennium with
somebody; boring, boring creatures. I'm much happier with Civilization gods,
they‟re quite impressive. And you meet them here. And the superstitions are there.

The 5/2
LAC Cycles 1
The 5/2 has a secret collection psychoanalysis. There's so much bullshit in this left
angle. I guess that‟s what I‟ve been dealing with in trying to describe it. The right
angle is under so much pressure and it is so uncomfortable. It's got a start, it can‟t
go any further, and we know that, it can‟t go any further with the rest. So what is
the left angle do? The left angle says: that‟s okay, there is a middle. There is an
end. There is a middle. There is an end. Just get started, just get started, just get
started. What a trap. What a sales pitch.
You really have to understand what a trap. The left angle says once you get started
it‟s ok, don‟t worry. If you keep on digging you will reach China. Don't worry; just
dig. Don‟t worry about the rest of it. Don‟t tell me about your problems; just dig the
hole. We‟ll eventually get there, I promise. It‟s all going to be okay. It is a cycle.
This is the cycle of life. You have to start; if you start you‟ll see, you get into it.
This was the old arranged marriages. Just start, you‟ll see; yes, he‟s ugly, but it‟s
okay. You‟ll begin to see after many years that you might find something attractive.
You might get used to it. You may discover love along the way. It‟s life after all.
You‟ll see at the end, it will be okay. The fact that it‟s going to be terrible, we won‟t
discuss that, this is life after all, it isn‟t meant to be easy.
Cycle propaganda, oh, cycle propaganda is great. When you have your Kiron return
you enter into your cycle of flowering. I‟m really good at that, too. After all, this is
the way in which we goad people towards fulfilling their potential. We‟re all part of
it; we‟re all instruments of it. I do not look at this from above it. I‟m deep in it;
we‟re all deep in it. This is our maya and in the maya all of these things work this
way.
Cycles are important. You have a seven-year deconditioning cycle. You have a 3 ½
year educational problem. You have to go through this cycle to get to the next cycle
and that cycle leads you to the next cycle and that one leads you to the next one.
And all you have to do is start your experiment today. It‟s an archetype. I learned
well from my neighbor of penetration. It‟s an archetype. Hey, you have somewhere
to go, oh, good, and when you get there you‟re going to be enlightened. Thank
goodness it‟s sort of true; otherwise, I‟d be in big trouble. Otherwise, I‟d be in a six-
year business. And on the seventh year you would no longer see me anymore.
Where did he go? Is the cycle over? Something is wrong here.
So I want you to keep in mind the salesmanship that‟s in all of this. I don‟t know how
most of the world deals with being ignorant. I guess you don‟t notice. If you don‟t
notice how beautiful it is here, how special it is to be alive, to be human, the

perfection of what it is to be oneself, they don‟t know all that stuff. And this kind of
propaganda is the only thing we can do under such circumstances. We live on a
planet that is densely not-self, a planet that is emotional generative, that rises and
falls on a wave of frustration that permeates the entire planet. We need as many
cheerleaders to consciousness as we can get. Even if it‟s bogus it doesn‟t matter, we
already know that. Send somebody on the way and maybe they find a way,
whatever the way may be, wherever the way may be.
Nobody ever came directly to Design except a few young people. Most people came
here through some circuitous road through the New Age boondoggles. What
fascinates me the most is that if you strip away the not-self on the planet you don‟t
really get what you think. So much of where we‟re going demands that the not-self
stays in place. One of the things I know about transforming humanity is that it‟s not
about transforming everyone. It isn‟t. Not now anyway, maybe in a couple of
centuries, maybe after the split, maybe after all of that it would be possible. But
some of the most essential ingredients for the mutation that is taking place is the
functionality of the not-self, it‟s quite predictable. There are so many people starting
so many stupid things because they think that when they finish it they‟ll get some
kind of reward. What to do.

The 6/2
LAC Cycles 1
Six-twos have a very important job. They have to see that there‟s that 62nd gate
that‟s just around the corner. And while they‟re there saying it‟s just a cycle, it‟s
okay, don‟t worry that you‟ve gotten in and you don‟t know where you‟re going, it‟s
okay. Life is going to take care of this, this form principle has somewhere to go, and
the 62nd gate is all about the detail of it.
Not only that, but we are coming to metamorphic gates, the 62, 56, into this deep,
deep, deep metamorphosis that takes place in the nature of the world and the more
beginnings we have. Remember something, that the ability to substantiate the maya
is in the 62nd gate, because the 62nd gate brings the language of the maya. And it‟s
the language through our communication that solidifies the presence of maya.
Sitting here in the 6/2 chair and looking over to see that 62 over there, one of the
things you notice is that the maya is only going to be detailed based on how many
things have been started. Oh, what a tiny, porous, wussy-like maya we had 20,000
years ago. There was no alphabet, there were rudimentary languages. You had
vocabularies of maybe 75 words. You had a maya that almost wasn't there. We
can't imagine that. We can't imagine that it all. I don't think that most human
beings have a capacity to recognize how illusionary this density actually is. If you
were in some little tribe 20,000 years ago your world is so tiny. It‟s not simply that
the maya isn‟t dense, the maya is so restricted. It‟s a tiny little zone with a few
ways of describing that and the rest is just, what‟s going on.

And look at the maya we live in now, wow, dense, dense, dense, it‟s so dense that
none of us are able to take it all in. It‟s the first time in human history—if you take
me back a thousand years I could probably in 20 years understand everything that
any of the leading thinkers in the world understood. It wouldn‟t be a big deal,
actually, if you leave out the religious bullshit. But now? Most human beings are
only able to survive with appliances that they don‟t know how they work. The maya
is so dense that we are forced to be relatively ignorant of its density.
So, the magic of the 62 is dependent on the work of the 53. More things get
started; more details are available, the denser the maya is. And remember, in order
for us to truly transcend the maya we have to be able to have all of its contents.
This is steady state. When there's no more mystery, then the game is over and
we‟re intended to get to that place, we‟re intended to understand the nature of
being, we‟re very close, we‟re very, very close, tantalizingly close with a small
window left, basically till the end of this century, because we had to take in account
those are born just before 2027 who will live to the end of the century and into the
next. This last window of being able to get to the point where we truly understand
everything in the maya, the way the maya works, because in order for us to survive
our sterility that the not-self that this quarter brings, we have to understand the
nature of being in order to re-create it.
The 6/2 is here to be an example of the acceptance of the cycle. This is the
beginning of abstract way. And think about the abstract way, if you focus on the
46/29 you find the secret of the abstract. The secret of the abstract is: the
existentially involved in your experience to benefit from it later. If there was ever a
motto for the 6/2 on this cross, that‟s it. Yes, you stepped into something that may
be over your head, okay, it‟s all right, wait and see. Trust in yourself.
The moment that the 6 can gain the necessary experience in a healthy way with
their young, they can trust in themselves. Most people think that these keynotes of
trust and leadership that go with the 6 are really about the outside when it is, in
essence, first about the inside, to trust themselves, to trust their own leadership, to
not be afraid when they step out into the world.
But we know what happens to them, we know what happens to all 3s. In Jovian we
have the Global Incarnation Index survey, a survey of all types, incarnation crosses.
I'm watching and waiting to see all of the crosses and all of the profiles collected by
people with an interest in Human Design, seeing the whole wheel fill up with those
beings. And when we get to that place, we‟re not there now, then I can go a layer
deeper, and then a layer deeper, and then a layer deeper.
What I'm looking for is 69,200 Human Design incarnations. And then you have the
beginning of transformation. That‟s the beginning. And until that time, the not-self
is going to continue its process and to see very clearly that in the general sense it
doesn't mean it's bad. After all, the not-self got us all here. It‟s just the program.
All of our characteristics have been walking along on the journey.
Awakening is not for everyone. Knowledge is, potential is; actualization isn't. This is
something that the 6/2 clearly recognizes. It knows right away, it can tell. It‟s hard

for all 6/2s in this era not to be able to rely on hypocrisy and enjoy their life without
risk, and benefit from their accumulated experiential wisdom without risk. Well,
those days are over.
All 6s, particularly 6/2s, have a hard time on their crosses. It‟s not easy, it isn‟t at
all. Most of them only realize what's been going on when they're on the roof. That
means that there are all kinds of correction in their process that is necessary. A
reassessment of what they've been through, a releasing of the anxiety of what
consistent problems and failures have brought to them in their life. I genuinely
recognize the difficulty of being the forefront of a mutation, and all 6th line beings
are.
The sweet thing about the 6/2 on this is that they‟ll always remember your
anniversary. I remember when we met, dear. It was 16 years ago today. Oh yeah?
Don‟t say that, by the way. Say, oh I knew that, dear, I remember. It's all cycles.

The 6/3
LAC Cycles 1
The 6/3 sits there and says, okay, it‟s all cycles and we need lots of them and I‟ll
keep on doing it until I die. What else to do. If you‟re a 6/3 and you‟re on the Left
Angle Cross of Cycles, go for it; and they do. I always take pleasure in anyone who
has a 3/3 phase and survives it. The drumbeat and the trumpets; they all deserve
the medals, send them ribbons and flowers. And of course, on cycles it‟s the same
thing, racing through things, racing through this to do that to get to this to do that to
go there.
It‟s probably the idiots that invented motor racing. It‟s something that I cannot for
the life of me figure this out. You‟re driving around in circles. I‟m an Arian. What
am I going to do, spend my afternoon driving around circles, and doesn't that ruin
your inside wheels? Who wants to do that? It‟s not like they go around once, that I
could understand. They do it 75 times. Some of them die doing it. I‟ve never seen
such idiocy in my whole life. And they pay people a fortune for that. It‟s insane.
And then you realize we‟re nuts, all of us. The not-self is really a loony tune.
250,000 people sitting around eating hot dogs watching people drive around in
circles for hours in the stink, in the noise. It‟s like, why are you doing this? I don‟t
understand it. I don't understand the skill either. I don‟t get it. Anyway, that‟s my
relationship to cycles. Do you know what you‟re doing?
This is our life, around and around and around and around, on and on and on, it can
be deeply depressing. It always fascinated me that people who are interested in
incarnation are so excited about it. I don't want remember all those lives. I'm
convinced that most of them are awful and that I was glad to get out of them. It‟s
not like, ah gee; I want to savor all of those. We‟re protected by the forces that it‟s

not so easy for us to connect to all of that. That's why it was so natural for me to be
a nihilist. It was like, okay, just once. You come in, go out, it‟s over, that‟s it, okay,
it‟s all random, pot luck, okay.
I‟m astonished that I actually know there is incarnation. That is perhaps one of the
most amusing things for me, is the continuity of life. And there is no greater
exponent, because there is a joke. And the joke is that to recognize the cycle of life
doesn't require profundity. It‟s so obvious. It‟s right there on the surface for all of
us to see. And it‟s so clear about what to do; just go through the cycles, surrender
to the wheel, don‟t start dreaming that you should be on another spoke, just be
there.
One of the most magical things is the acceptance of just being here; nothing more,
nothing less. Not asking for anything, not looking for anything, not needing
anything, just being, just sitting around and saying, okay, I‟m in the box, looking out
the windows. It‟s another day, it‟s another movement. What else? It‟s their
deepest teaching.
And that 6/3 is saying that if you don‟t believe me we‟re going to show you the facts.
We‟re going to tell you the whole detail of what it means that life is cycles. And the
first thing to understand about the cycle of life is the birds and the bees. So let me
explain to you what that all means. The cycle of life begins with understanding that
we are here to reproduce life. And the 6/3 said, oh, oh, wait a minute now, it
includes that, too?
The cycle of life and the recognition of the cycle of life brings us deeper and deeper
and deeper into the most difficult thing of all: duality. Yes, Civilization is a difficult
quarter, because you see the material arm. But don't think that Duality is so sweet.
In Duality we‟re confronted with the fundamental dilemma of life, the yin and the
yang trying to get along with each other. In all of this is the pointing towards that
because the fulfillment of the form can only be realized through reproduction. There
is no other way, at least given the way in which the program has operated up until
now. As we will see, because we are deeply involved in mutation, the rules are
changing. And they‟re changing rather rapidly. And the whole cycle business is
changing; it‟s all compressed and faster.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Maya, I love the maya. I can‟t express to you how much I enjoy this illusion. I have
my design Earth in the 62. I‟m deeply connected with the language of maya, with
the recognition that detail information substantiates the maya and that the more
information you have, or the better information you have the easier it is to penetrate
the mechanics of maya.
The 62 is a throat gate. It‟s a throat gate that actually expresses what we call
thinking, logical thinking. I think therefore I am. So here in the 62 is the potential
to enrich the maya with the goal of getting all the details. And remember that the
only reason we're looking for all the details in the logical sense is that we want to get
to a place where we can transcend fear, we want to get to a place where we know
that tomorrow is going to be relatively safe for us.
In order to have details you need to have a predisposition to collecting them and
using them. Certainly on this cross the 1st line has a natural and deep resonance.
Whether you're the 1/3, or the 1/4, or the 4/1 or the 5/1, the reality is that this 1st
line here in the 62, the foundation of the maya is in the detail. It's all in the details;
it's all, all in the details. This is the only place you find a formula. Life is a formula.
Cycles are formulas. Being is a formula. All forms are formulas. It‟s all formulas.
The one thing we know about the universal life process is that it is logical, rooted in
the 15/5. We know it‟s all logical. So, ultimately the secret to life is logical. Oh,
experience is interesting, but that‟s simply to provide entertainment; the human
experiential way. But to understand the mechanics you have to know the patterns,
and you have to know the patterns as they operate theoretically and you have to
know the patterns as they operate in practice. And then you can see. Ah, the
detail; how wonderful it is to be able to express things with the right detail. You get
people to understand. And this understanding is something that is very liberating.

The 1/3
If you have a 1/3 you know right away that they know and they‟re going to find out
when the detail is wrong and that's what‟s what they‟re going to get from their
parents from day one. If you have a child, like my little one who is around 5, they‟re
the kind of children at that age they ask you very unusual questions. And they ask
you very mundane questions that often parents don't really understand. Like when
your child says to you why is the sky blue. It isn‟t like every parent knows the
answer to that.

Now, if you do that with a 1/3 who is on this cross, oh, their feeling about you, I
want to tell you is going to be deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply diminished. You don‟t
know Mom why the sky is blue? How come? What‟s the problem? You‟re not smart
enough? Didn‟t you ask your mother? Didn't she tell you? This is really about
understanding the world.
Remember this is a throat gate. This is a throat cross—throaty, throaty, throaty.
They‟re going to ask, ask, ask what‟s this, how does this work, why does it work this
way, what does this do, when does it do it. I get questions from my 1/3 sons,
sometimes I just shake my head. It‟s like, do I really have to answer this? And then
you try to find a way to answer it so that they can understand it. What‟s my spit
made of? My little one asked me
that the other day. And it‟s like, all
right let me see if I can put this
together for you.
This is one of the things to
understand about 1/3s anyway, and
particularly this throat business. The
62 is going, all right, I want the
answer now. I want to solidify my
maya, and if you don't know the
answer my world is less secure, and
I don‟t want to be insecure, I want to
know the details. I want to know all
the details. I want to have the
details.
I‟m a 1st line 62 and the one thing
you notice about it is how obsessive
it is. It‟s obsessive. And the part of
it that is so obsessive is the order
that comes with it because it‟s not just detail; it‟s where the detail fits. Right now
the air conditioning people are in my room, and you know, I'm in a state of near
collapse. They touch things; they move things, the bastards. Things are moved.
Nobody should move anything in my order. This is the obsessiveness of the 62.
Don‟t touch anything; nothing. Look; don‟t touch.
This is the thing that comes with the detail. It‟s this, put the detail in its right place,
put everything in its right place and then you can see how the thing really works.
Oh, 1/3s can be a delight, but they can be very obsessive about their space. It‟s all
maya; all illusion.
They‟re the ones that need to break through the illusion. Again remember, don‟t lie
to your 1/3 children. And if you tell this 1/3 child, when your tooth comes out, put it
under the pillow, the tooth fairy is going to come. What‟s this tooth fairy look like?
Where do they come from, these tooth fairies? Where to do they live? Do they have
houses? How come I‟ve never seen them before? Have they visited here before? I

lost a tooth last year, where they here then? Do you know any of these fairies? I
never met a tooth fairy, where do you meet them? Do they have a telephone? Can
we call them and tell them to come while I‟m up? They‟ll drive you nuts. Don‟t
bother to tell them that. Tell them when they lose their tooth I‟ll give you a quarter.
Everything is ok, no problem. They may ask you how fast they‟ll get the quarter.
And can they do anything they want with the quarter when they get it. Yes, yes, yes
all day; next? Don‟t ask me any more questions.
People with the 62—I know. It‟s unconscious, I‟m innocent. Probing questions,
endless—they‟re just trying to frame the maya and as they get the details they put
things in their places, this order that is in this channel of the organizational being.
Details are no good unless you can organize them, otherwise you cannot make any
kind of logical presentation. That‟s the point. Logical presentation, get your details
across, back up your illusion. The maya works this way. That‟s their thing.
Oh, can they be insecure, because basically very few parents can really answer their
questions. There are just too many of them. There are too many of them and it
gets embarrassing. Certain parents really—you have to understand. Not-self human
beings, undefined egos, you‟ve got a mother with an undefined ego and the child
asks her how something works and the mother can‟t answer it, there is a part of her
that suffers. And she also sees in her little 1/3 child‟s eye this look of: she‟s not so
smart, eh. She doesn‟t really get it, does she? After awhile it‟s like, we know what
they are; we‟re not going to ask them tough questions anymore, we‟re going to tell
them what the details are. We‟re going to tell them what the facts are. Did you
know Mother that the sky is blue because. And Mother goes, yes, yes, of course I
knew; oh thank God he told me! He didn‟t ask.
One of the things that I stress about this is that there are very special linguistic skills
that come with having either the 62nd or the 56th gate. And of course, we‟re going to
be moving towards the 56. These are very powerful metamorphic gates. The ability
to be able to express detail is one of the essential ingredients in humanity‟s search
for what is provable and what is going to protect them and what is going to keep
them from fear.
So, one of the things to keep in mind whenever we‟re dealing with throat gates in
civilization is also to recognize that so much of the way in which the concretization is
moved is verbally. And nothing is more powerful and more persuasive than
somebody that seems to have the facts and is able to express the facts in detail.
When you get somebody to say “I understand” you have locked them into a pattern.
It‟s very different than getting somebody to say “I believe,” it‟s very different. You
get somebody to say I understand you‟re getting them to accept a fixed pattern. So,
this detail gate is very powerful. And we know that, we know that in our lives that
all human beings resonate to somebody who says “here are the facts.” You can see
that in the new age where the moment that there is somebody that thinks they have
real detail and real facts to support some kind of whatever that there is all kinds of
excitement about that possibly. We need detail.

It‟s so clear to me, as a 62 myself, that one of the most—it‟s like doing this course.
I‟m doing this course in order to elaborate on the detail. Elaborating on the detail
ultimately can lead to somebody having a deeper understanding and recognizing the
pattern and so forth and so on. It‟s part of the educational process. It‟s the
foundation of the way in which we communicate with each other. And it‟s through
our communication that our intelligence is expanded.
You can see that in nature in a very rudimentary sense. In other words, you can see
the mother of any young—I‟ve watched dogs and cats raise their young and you can
see that there are certain behavioral things instinctive things that they pass along to
their young in order to give the essential tools of survival.
But in fact, what makes humans so interesting is that we want much more detail
than just that. As a matter of fact, we have so much detail that has nothing to do
with anything really, just the stuff that is out there. And this is our process because
it is only through language when we all can share the same kinds of terminology that
there really is a possibility for an expansion of the global consciousness. Whether it
was the telegraph lines or radio or television or now the internet, basically what
you‟ve seen is a progression in this process of bringing everyone to the same detail
at the same time. And if everyone is in the same detail at the same time we have
this density of the whole emerging.
I always participate when I can, usually in the summer, for example, there‟ll be
broadcasts, some famous pop music, and you know that there are going to be a
billion and a half young people all over the world watching this thing. And it‟s so
interesting—I have a child who is interested in that—and just to sit in on that for a
moment and with my kind of consciousness to recognize how powerful this is, all of
these forces linked into a net somewhere. It‟s what I do with the Daily View where
there are different people in different places in the world that get to hook in.
And this is the way in which the maya enforces its density. The deeper that Human
Design penetrates into the world, the easier it is for Human Design to penetrate into
the world. It‟s the maya. The more detail, the easier it is to fit into the maya.

Maya is an illusion. So we have to be very careful with our 4s, we know what
happens to them that based on the cultural environment, the way that they are
raised that they can end up with platforms that lock them into a frame. And they
lock them into a detail frame. If you ask your parent a question as a 62, and they
give you an answer you trust it if you‟re a 1/4. If you‟re a 1/3 you‟ll do research.
I've had that. I‟ve had my son ask me something, I just babble something out and
10 minutes later he‟ll walk into the room and say, hey, you know, that wasn‟t right.
My response to that is why didn‟t you look it up in the first place. What are you

When you‟re dealing with a 1/4 they‟re not going to do that. They‟re going to have a
parent that says here's the detail. These people are subhuman because they look
different. Then you have somebody who thinks that that's a detail in the maya. And
as a 4, it‟s very difficult to go against that, very difficult to change that. It's a
perception in the illusion. And they influence everyone else.
I had this frightening experience as a teacher here in Ibiza in 1983 and it was a
funny situation because all of these children that I was teaching like Gennaro, his
generation, all of their parents were friends of mine. So I knew their parents
socially. We were a subculture; there were all kinds of things going on. You got to
know people relatively intimately. And then I would see their children in class and I
would realize that their children were just saying the same things their parents said.
I would ask them an opinion about this or that or something or whatever and I would
hear their parents. And then I thought, oh my God, my own children. It's like, what
are they going to say?
When you're dealing with a 4 and you're dealing with this powerful social mechanism
you have to recognize something. Your child is carrying you out into the world. You.
They‟re carrying the impressions into the world, it just does. And when we're
dealing with 4s we have to be very careful, not all parents are ready to censor their
prejudices and their preferences for the benefit of their children. In fact, they try to
coerce their children, whether consciously or unconsciously, into carrying exactly the
same flavor of the maya. And then we end up with generation after generation after
generation of prejudices and hatreds and all kinds of things that after all are only
illusions that are inculcated.
One should be very careful about maya, and really be clear that we need to have our
details and having our details means that we need more than one perspective. We
need a cross-section. We need to be able to measure things carefully. This is one of
the keys. And of course, when you're dealing with the 1/4, you‟re sending out a
very powerful force that isn't going to be open to any other kind of detailed
descriptions of the maya. Not only that, they‟re going to order the framework of
their life within that context.

The 2/4  61  32
RAC Maya 2
When you have a 2/4 how difficult it is for a 2/4 to go through the 1 process of study
in order to be able to have a firm grounding in the detail. And most 2s are distorted
in their upbringing because they're expected to be 1s. Here is a classic example of
the natural. Now, the natural is going to find their own detail. Not only that, the
natural is going to create maya. If you pull the 2/4 out of its cave don't be surprised
if it brings new words with it. It‟s one of the most interesting things about the maya,
the maya is built on words, it‟s build on sound formulas.
When I was sitting under a tree all by myself in 1987 and I had a personality
crystal/design crystal in my head it was not in the maya. It wasn't in the maya at

all. It was in my illusion. It was in my personal, very intense little maya. But it had
nothing to do with the maya. It wasn't in the world. It didn‟t matter that it was in
me, it wasn't in the world. And you can tell it's in the world because people know
these words. All of a sudden the words have density. All of a sudden words have
density because they are also supported by detail. And the detail adds to the density
of the maya. And you go on and on and on. This is part of the process of bringing
any theoretical information into implementation and into the reality, and so much of
it is done in communication.
The 62nd gate and the 56th gate are clearly, purely communicative gates. These are
language skills. So one of the things about a 2/4 is that you may not have that
direction as a parent to force them into some kind of deep study, but what you can
do is take advantage of whatever their natural gifts are, because they are going to
have their natural gift. And that natural gift is that if you really scratched that
shyness barrier, you have a very powerful articulating force. In other words, you
have somebody who has the ability to bring out the detail.
Now, remember, this is a 4 at the unconscious level, 4s are deeply influential. A 2/4
that finally decides to speak its mind will really get the attention of people around it.
One of the powers of the 2/4 when it‟s called out is that you know by meeting its
aura that this is not natural for it; and so therefore, it must be really important and
really impressive and really something to accept being influenced by.
All the of the 2s—2/4, 2/5, 5/2, 6/2—relative to the Sun in the 62, all of them are
going to be deeply concerned about their personal maya, their relative maya. The
archetype of this is a 2/4 because of the nature of the real hermit quality of the 2/4.
Their internal world has to be filled with detail. And one of the things that you get to
see about 2/4s on this cross is you're going to see clutter.
One of the funniest things that I've ever seen is how many 17/62s I know who are
the most disorganized people I've ever met. And yet, they're organized in another
way. A friend of Human Design who just had a very, very serious accident in
Munich, Wolfgang Schubert, I hope he‟s going to recover, do all right, he‟s a 17/62
and I can remember the first time I went into his apartment in Munich and I walked
into what he called his office and I have never seen anything like that in my whole
life.
I‟m just a 62, no 17, for me order is everything. I walk into this office and there is
stuff everywhere. You talk about a desk you would have to dig for half an hour
through paper to get to the surface of the desk. There was so much stuff on his
desk you could only see half of the computer screen. He wanted to show me
something and he is going like this. And the amazing thing is in all of that what
appeared to be is all relative. What appeared to me to be a hopeless miserable
intense dysfunctional goo, he could find anything in it.
When you look at the 2s with the Sun in 62, what you will notice about them is
clutter. And of course, if you're a parent, that can be infuriating. However, they do
know where everything is. They have their own detail system. Now, that makes
them very interesting. It makes them interesting because these are the kinds of

people that can find things in a different way, can discover facts in a different way,
and can see the hidden details underneath the surface clutter. In other words, there
is a tremendous potential in all of that.
But if you look at the surface only and you keep on screaming at this child: clean up
your room, how can you find anything. But I can. Unfortunately with children, there
are many things that are hidden in that pile that you really need to take care of—
food. You don't want the eggs—my little son, we discover some food that he had
placed very constructively under his bed, there are armies of ants roving through.
You obviously have to pay some attention, but not to break that kind of nonlinear—
this is organization in another way, there is another methodology that is possible out
of that. It's the same thing with the maya. Words—I love words, language is such a
trip. It‟s so magical that—think about what a dog hears when he hears humans.
They don‟t know what the hell's going on. It‟s all relative, after all. They don‟t have
any neocortex; they‟re not going to reflect on the nuances that are there. They‟re
into tonal streams and respond to tonal streams. You can say to a dog, I am now
going to take out a knife and cut your little throat, and they come up wagging their
tail.
The mystery is what we do with language. Language is really incredible. And one of
the things that we do with languages is that we may clutter on the surface because
the real meaning is underneath. It‟s one of the great things of language, the double
entendre, you say one thing, but you're really saying another. All of this is a 2
business. The 2/4 says something to you and it opens up a whole can of worms,
because you think they said something else. Well, maybe they did. Did they mean
to say it that way? Were they trying to tell me something?
This whole business about you never really get the whole story from somebody, this
is the influence of the 2, the sneaky details, the details underneath, the ones that
just go biting in, break through the barrier, hit you. Obviously, there are a lot of
positive dimensions to that because there is so much detail that‟s hidden. There just
is. If you look at these modern encryption systems and what antiterrorist Internet
sloggers have to do to piece together thousands of bits of innocuous this and that‟s
and come up with some kind of recognizable formula that they're about to blow up
your kitchen.

The 2/5
RAC Maya 2
The most interesting thing about a 2/5 in this particular case is that this is really one
of those kill-the-Buddha archetypes because they truly can understand things and
have details they share with no one. They can go to their grave with stuff like that.
Paranoia is a great teacher. If you grow up with a 5 in your profile and you don't
end up being too fucked up, you will discover that paranoia is a great teacher,
because you're not paranoid for nothing. You‟re not born to be a certain way for
nothing. It's not like, okay, be paranoid all your life, but there is nothing to be

paranoid about. That‟s sick. If someone puts a gun in your hand, sooner or later
you are going to use it. If you‟re given paranoia sooner or later you‟re going to
appreciate it.
One of the interesting things about paranoia is that the paranoia, because it's
transpersonal, the paranoia is not only, what do they want, but do I owe them
anything. Is there something in that whole connection that perhaps I'd better, yeah,
maybe I could—there is a paranoid about what happened before. And it's not
conscious. It is in a few of us. But it‟s not the kind of thing you‟re actually thinking
that way; this is all about the way in which the aura works.
The one thing about that is that this kind of paranoia leads to a great deal of
understanding about the psychology of humans. You begin to understand something
very basic about people, is that whenever anybody is moving towards you, they want
something. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. This is a choiceless world;
you‟re on a geometry towards something. You‟re going to bump into it. There is a
purpose in that.
And the 5 recognizes that right away. Five understands that it is going to have to
deal with things moving in its direction, so it tries to figure out what to do with
them—can I slough them off, do I actually have to deal with them, and if I do have
to deal with them, how can I deal with them so that they don't bit me back, how can
I deal with them given the practical whatever. So, one of the things about the 2/5 is
the 2/5 is the hidden master. This is a woman with an ordinary life, she could be
mother with kids or whatever, but there are other people in her life, very few but
they‟re there who have an ability to break down that barrier so that they can be
intimate, in a sense, with her and she is the one that can provide them with real
understanding.
Whenever you see a neighborhood, you're always going to see there are always a yin
and a yang guru in any neighborhood, always. There's always that woman that
another woman will go to looking for some kind of guidance. It‟s the same thing
with the men, but it‟s different, though. Men are never that obvious in their
neediness because it reduces their sense of potential effectiveness. There‟s nothing,
nothing worse than a needy male, even though males are needy. It's like there's
something wrong with the shape. I was shocked when I came to this island. I never
met so many yin men in all my life. I wasn‟t use to that—these soft, squishy, follow-
behind-their-women men, very strange.
Anyway, 2/5s can be very special, in that sense, like the 2/4. They know the detail
that others don't know because they don't approach through formula. Remember
that the details that the 1s learn are details that have been constructed by the
collective already. It‟s not like they‟re learning anything new in the detail. That's
what makes the 2s different. Because they don't have the same relationship to
formal pattern structure, there is a tendency for them to come up with natural
patterns, natural patterns that are not necessarily grasped by the traditional
structure. And in that, they are able to see different kinds of details, to be able to
look inside.

It‟s like these crazy characters that write computer programs in order to take all the
words in the Bible and look for some kind of pattern. Well, I want to tell you, you
can find patterns in anything, it‟s all fractals. However, it's interesting what you get,
if you know what I mean. It's like the games I play with anagrams. It‟s not like I
take an anagram seriously, but then again, I don't take it not seriously. It's just
interesting. Formulas are interesting. If you‟re a 62 you‟re always playing the
formula game.
So, what you see with the 2s is there is always the possibility they can be called out,
because what they discover naturally as a pattern, as understanding, as detail and
their gift to articulate it can be very valuable to others; the 4 for their close
community; the 5 as a universalizing principle.

The 3/5
RAC Maya 2
I guess the most interesting thing for me about the 3/5 on this cross is not so much
what detail they get or they don't get. But their way of learning how to explain
detail. We all had that experience, if you take a survey of children and you ask
children what their favorite class is the vast majority will not say mathematics or
whatever. There is certain detail and people that present detail tend to be truly
boring. And we all know that. When I was a school teacher here in 1983, and I'm a
weird guy, they were not bored with the mundane things that I did, because I made
detail fun.
Now, there are very few human beings that know how to make detail interesting. In
fact, most detail is only really interesting to select streams of thought. So, if you're
studying something, if you're into something, biology, you will read all the boringly
presented material on biology, because that's the way that it works. Particularly at
the university level I had professors who were numbing in their boringness. You
wanted them to be abused or something just to give them a sense of—there are
people in front of you, you idiot, may be you can try to entertain us while we have to
go through this slog.
So, the nice thing about the 3/5 on this cross is that the 3/5 tries to figure out,
through its trial and error, every time it tries to present the detail people yawn. It‟s
like when I talk physics with my dog. It immediately yawns. And 3/5s, because
they are bound to fail, and because this is an articulating voice, this is all about
learning how to get the detail across so that they can succeed—I have to deliver the
detail in a different way. And they‟re great explorers at that. This is a 3/5 process.
Here I am displaying detail in a new way.
Imagine what it would have been like if there had been no photocopiers or whatever;
Human Design never could come into the world before it did. It would have been
seriously disadvantaged by the lack of 3/5s beforehand that have plowed along and
discovered there are ways to maintain the interests of those who have to be fed
detail. The detail of this course, I have to tell you stories, I have to make you laugh,

otherwise it's like, oh my God, I‟m going to die. If he tells me about 3s one more
time I‟m going to kill him. And when you teach logically all you ever do is repeat
over and over and over and over again.
You look at any teacher in a public school who has been teaching 15 years and I'll
show you somebody who is hardwired. They‟ve been teaching the same thing the
same way with the same everything. And then you wonder why children—when you
get a teacher and it‟s their first year, you're blessed as a kid. That teacher comes in
with joy, comes in with the spirit of, I'm going to enrich their little lives; 10 years
later, ah.
The 3/5 understands the nature of entertainment. Three-fives are one of the
sources of comedy for us. We like nothing better than seeing someone else fall on
their face. This is humanity. Laurel and Hardy—I grew up as a kid—wasn‟t it funny
when Laurel would swing around whack the ladder into Hardy‟s face. It‟s amazing,
human beings—the guy has a whole ladder in his face, we don‟t care. We don‟t care
with the piano drops on him. We don‟t care when he puts his head in a door and
somebody slams the door in his head. We don‟t care. It‟s not our head. If you‟re
not a 3, you don‟t mind what they go through.
I find 3s deeply entertaining, thank you very much. Well, they are. They bang into
things and they fall down and they get back up. Christianity is the great 3 religion.
All right, okay, I‟ve had enough, no more—cosmic pessimism. But it's funny. It
really is when you recognize the choicelessness. After all, what‟s funny for me, I
have a black sense of humor, the not-self 3 is desperately funny.
So what they end up in their suffering is a potential to find different ways to get the
detail across, and different ways of expressing the detail. It was like watching the
two sides of the 60s civil rights conflict. On one side you had blacks and whites in
America who were really not too happy with each other. And then on the other side
you had comedians who were making jokes about it all. And the comedians making
jokes about it all did a much better job. It's one of the things to understand about
getting basic understanding across to somebody else is that just feeding them the
detail isn't necessarily what it's all about. That's only satisfying for some. And the
3/5 understands that one of the ways in which they can avoid failure in getting their
detail across is to find an innovative way to discover a way to get it across. Good for
them.

The problem with the 3/6 is that their understanding is always changing. So, it
depends on when you meet them in their life, but you don't want to meet them on
the cusp when their understanding changes, because it's usually because of you.
But this is something to keep in mind about the 3-3 phase is that not only are you
going to make mistakes in your understanding, but you're going to misinterpret the
detail. And then you‟re going to try to express that, and you‟re going to try to

express that in a way that's fraught with the potential of failure anyway. And then
given that you‟re a 3, you do it at the wrong time in the wrong place with the wrong
people. And then you wonder why nobody thinks that you're clever. Nobody thinks
that you know what you're talking about, so forth and so on.
Remember something about the fear of the ajna center. Those gates that are
pointed from the ajna down to the throat, they are fear gates, deep fear gates. And
recognize the pressure that's on all of us mentally, this thing about the open ajna
center, the strategy of the open ajna center, trying to pretend that it's certain about
things, the great fear of us as mental beings is that we won‟t be understood, that we
will not be able to make sense, that nobody is going to know what we are talking
about.
And when it comes to the 62 when somebody says, I don't think you know what
you're talking about, I don't think you really understand this, I don't understand
what you are telling me, I don't think your thinking is correct, they‟re devastated.
It‟s horrifying. So, if you‟re a 3/6 and you have your Sun in the 62nd gate and you're
messing up on that, this is more than just the normal 3 suffering the martyrdom.
This is infecting the whole way in which the not-self mind is going to operate.
One of the best pieces of advice that you could ever give a 3/6 on this cross is to
remind them of something that it might be a good idea for them to test things before
they just jump in. And it might be a very good thing for them to practice how to
explain somehow before they actually jump into doing so; in other words, for them
to really see that they need to discover how, because it's all discovery for them.
The other thing is that the detail that the 3/5 and the 3/6 can come up with, the
skills that they can develop to get detail across, this is very lucrative. Think about it.
Every once in a while you get a book that comes out that is written by a layman on
science. Somebody writes a book telling you about all the recent trends in physics.
And the book becomes popular. The author of that book is making five to ten times
more money than the scientists who did the discoveries. Have you never thought
about that? The scientist published all his details. But they're not entertaining.
They‟re streamed to a closed intellectual grouping.
The 3/5 or the 3/6 cleverness is, let me take all that boring detail and repack it. Let
me reorganize it. Let me put a new shape around it. And in this way I can get it out
and I can even benefit more from it. I should not leave out the fact that the same
forces that can do that are also forces of plagiarism, forces of intellectual property
right theft, all kinds of things, this repackaging, the repackaging of somebody else's
concept as your own concept. This is something that‟s quite common, this cross—
the other side, the black side. And when you're dealing with Civilization, to
recognize it's always there.
Every time somebody does anything, there is always somebody who claims it‟s also
theirs. This is true all over the planet. You have people every year that they give
out of a Nobel Prize in science, there's some guy somewhere, some women
somewhere claiming that they were part of it and they were left off, and there's

always those that claim that somebody else took their concept and so forth and so
on. This is very much something that is there.
The positive side is that of course they can often, because they do discover another
way of delivery, they can be very effective. Here you can see the transition from
reading somebody's handwritten manuscript, to going into a movie theater. It‟s just
another way of delivering information and discovering a way to deliver information in
a very powerful way, and make money at it. Nobody has ever made more money
from the butchery of and presumed execution of Jesus than Mel Gibson. You just
repackage it and you put it out there. And Jesus doesn't get any royalties.

The 4/6
RAC Maya 2
The 4/6s are really very good at trying to get people to understand how they can
work together, often for the benefit of the 4/6, but nonetheless. This is where group
detail comes in. And in many ways this is where we get all kinds ways in which we
look at group configurations, whether that's human beings group together or
animals, this is about interrelationships. And it's about the detail of
interrelationships.
Remember, we‟re also moving towards Duality. This is a place in the 4/6 where part
of their focus on the detail is about how we operate on the social realm. This is the
first conscious 4th line. And as a first conscious 4th line, we know that the orientation
is going to be towards the delivery of the data rather than its research, and the
delivery of the data to that closed group.
So, one of the things about the 4/6, because of what it learns in its 4/3 state,
remember throughout this I talk about the danger of the 4/3 stage for 4/6s that they
hook up with the wrong friends and so forth and so on. In fact, on this cross that's
not such a bad idea in the sense that one of the things that they need to learn about
is that they need to learn the different ways in which groups deal with each other to
understand group dynamics, and in understanding group dynamics to be able to
understand how to influence that.
Now, if you take that to a science level you can see that understanding group
dynamics can also lead to the understanding of how bacteria works, how viruses
work, how we are infected as groups, what the chain is in that process. You can
begin to relate to the way we connect. Remember, this is part of the logical stream
and the logical stream is all about the aura rooted in the 15th gate as this magnetic
aura-creating force.
So, the 4/6 also has a recognition of influence in that sense, not necessarily in the
language of aura, obviously, but in the sense that they have some kind of influence
and they begin to try to understand how that influence works and then, because
they‟re a 6 with a 3 phase they try to see a way in which they can take advantage of
that knowledge. The 4/6 on this cross that goes up onto the roof, this is somebody

that whether it's as a consultant for groups, whether it‟s for labor groups or this or
that, whatever the case may be, all kinds of group work, they can be very good at
getting detail across to a group and they can also be very good at taking the detail in
from a group in order to be able to understand them better.
So this is a very interesting line. If you look at the harmonic gate in the 17, the 4,
you get the personnel manager. In other words, this is the other side of that
process, to truly be able to organized humanity and to organize humanity in cells.
This is a word we've heard a lot over the last hundred years. It‟s a word that has
been associated with underground movements, terrorist movements, whatever.
But I would prefer that every time you hear somebody say “cell” you think penta. If
you think penta you‟re really going to understand what this driving force is in this
configuration of the 17/62 through the 4th line. In other words, we are intended to
be organized in small groups, not huge groups. Remember, this is collective. The
collective understand the principle because it is a genetic law that we bond into these
pentas between three and five beings. This is the basic dynamic of family. And all
of this in Civilization is pointed towards the Duality that results in productivity.
So, this whole 4 here moves into something very, very special for us to understand
that when we can bring understanding to a tight enclosed group we set the
foundation for collective organization. And one of the things that we know, those of
us that have participated in penta courses, is that you know the pentas, in and of
themselves, because they need to demonstrate their effectiveness, that pentas are
deeply influenced by other pentas. It is natural for pentas to have directions and
approaches that balance and that are familiar to each other. They don't like
exceptions. So, if you organize in detail a cell, that cell is going to keep multiplying.
And it‟s going to keep multiplying and multiplying and multiplying until it becomes a
collective whole. The thing to recognize about this kind of cellular structure is that
it's not based on blood. It‟s based on concept; it‟s based on common understanding,
not common blood.
So this is the trick of the collective. They know that they have to obey the laws of
the small group of the cell. But they build the cell differently, they build the cell
through understanding and through the influence of details and out of that you can
build a collective structure. Anytime you see a scientist trying to add something to
the maya, some kind of discovery, you will see beside their name the rest of their
cell. You'll see the rest of the scientists that helped them in their research. You‟ll
see their names written there. And this is the indication that within this
understanding group we all have the same understanding, we all agree with the
same details, we would like our cell to be contagious, and we would like you to join
us, because that‟s what it is.
And out of that, if you get enough cells that keep on adding ultimately you go to
point where it breaks out cellularly. It‟s the cancer model. In other words, you end
up with very rapid exponential movement. It didn't take very long for certain

form around it and all of a sudden it's a universal principle. It‟s very powerful how
quickly it can get into the collective and this is the role of the 4/6.

The 4/1
The 4/1, juxtaposition, detail for detail sake. The detail is what's important is the
influence of the 4/1. The 4/1 says socially, it says that detail is what‟s important. It
doesn't really matter what it's about. What the 4 understands is that if you have a
cell form, if everybody goes to the same level in the detail together, you bond them
deeper and deeper and deeper and
deeper together in their purpose.
You can see that in politics where
basically politicians as they move
around have a cadre of a couple
hundred beings. It‟s this moving
cell where everybody is in the detail
at the same level and therefore
they're demonstrating its
effectiveness. And one of the things
that baffles humanity the most are
the purveyors and salespeople of
detail—detail for things that don‟t
matter, more detail than you need.
I am so fed up with remote controls.
If there has ever been useless
detail, it‟s in a remote control. It's
insane. There are buttons on my
remote—and not one, I have so
many remotes. You have to turn the satellite, you have to turn the thing on, and
they you have to hook it to that and then you have to turn the TV on and you have
to change it. Not only that, my satellite and my TV don't even like to share the same
volume. There is a lot of detail we truly do not need. And yet, we are in a very,
very powerful detail era. It will come to an end in 2027.

The 5/1
What a great name, obscuration, to obscure, to guide people away from the truths.
You can see that very often the right angle and the left angle have a serious
disagreement about the direction of the hexagram. You can see that in certain
crosses where the left angle looks at the right angle and thinks, are you crazy. You
want to tell the people the truth?
No, come on, do you know what
kind of trouble you‟re going to get
into if you tell them the truth?
That‟s terrible. Don‟t give them all
the detail.
Now, if you want to see where the
heretic gets burnt, where the
archetype of the heretic is being
burnt, it‟s here, because this is pure
unadulterated black magic. And
what I mean by that is that here is
the strand of detail and the 5th line
says, here are these two little bits,
this is all you need.
I was disappeared person in 1983. I
arrive on this island and I'm
surrounded by whiz-bang fuzzies,
they‟ve been all over the planet,
they‟ve been with gurus and this and that and everything else. I was given a couple
of books in my first days. One was really great. It was Nisargadatta‟s I Am That.
The other was an Alice Bailey book. I don‟t know if any of you have the misfortune
of having to plow through Miss Bailey.
So, I open this thing up and—we have long lost the art of being so obscure. And she
would say things that were so infuriated. She‟d say, this past paragraph, which by
the way no human being alive could understand, if you are a student on the path you
will the discern the direction that I am taking you to. And I‟d go, how do I get on
that path, honey? How do I get to a place where the gibberish you just unleashed
suddenly becomes palatable?
What is interesting, though, deep inside all of that are wonderful gems, but that's
what obscuration is all about. You could have distilled the book that I read into three
succinct paragraphs and everything would have been fine. When I first began to
meet all these weirdoes they all had these books that were written by obscure

writers about obscure things obscured. Read the average look on the Kabbalah, this
for me is one of the most hilarious things of all.
The ancient Jews created their first holy books, the first five books of what they call
the Talmud; these are the books of Moses and that was the law. It was all the law,
but they had crazies then, too. And the crazies wanted to interpret Moses‟ law. And
eventually those interpretations were gathered together and became known as the
Zohar. The Zohar was a mystical interpretation on the law that was written. By the
time you move forward to the eighth or ninth century a rumor begins to move
around in the Mediterranean and the rumor is that the Jews because of their
understanding in the Zohar that the Jews are controlling the world. So it becomes
one of these things to figure out how they do that and the myth comes that they do
that out of the Zohar.
Spain, in the south, one of one of the great cultures of the world and a melting pot
and in the 12th century you had in the South under Moorish rule you had Islamic
scholars, Jewish scholars and Christian scholars. The Christian scholars were Jesuits.
There was one Jesuit, I don‟t remember his name, one Jesuit and he translated the
Zohar into Latin. And from that Latin translation of the interpretation of the mystics
on the five books of the law came the tradition about modern people think is the
Kabbalah.
Now, I want to tell you it has nothing to do with anything. Concepts of the modern
Kabbalah are an enormous joke and there are all these people running around—yes,
if you go into some mystical rabbinical school in Israel today where you have the
Hassidic Jews, the ones that have all these curls and whirls, they‟re still buried deep
in the Zohar trying to figure out what the mystics said because everybody else
thought they had the power of the world and they‟re in there going, where is it. We
can solve the Palestinian problem. They haven‟t found it.
Obscuration—and then you have all these people—I see ads in esoteric magazines all
the time there are people teaching Kabbalah. So, what are they teaching? They‟re
teaching the French translation from the 16th century of the Latin translation of the
Aramaic, which wasn‟t understood really well, based on the original book. And then
the Kabbalah was resurrected in the New Age by MacGregor Mathers who was a
weird dude who founded the Golden Dawn and he translated the French into the
English. So now, you have this wonderful line and the people say, well, the
Kabbalah, this is really something. And then all of them are saying hidden here, if
you're a student on the path you should be able to discern the meaning. Bless their
hearts.
Obscuration is quite a heresy. After all, wherever you stand on the wheel there are
places you look that you don‟t like. I don‟t like obscuration. I don‟t like beating
around the bush. I don't like hiding the truth. I think that everything has to be
revealed. So obscuration for me is a kind of funny thing, but I understand its power.
It is very seductive and I guess that's ultimately what the best side of it is. It‟s often
attractive to human beings only because it's obscure, only because they can't really
see. It gives them something to search for. It is them something to study.

And every time that the obscura is presented, please understand the strategy. The
strategy is we don't really know how to fill in the detail so you truly understand what
we‟re saying, but maybe because we've turned you on you will. You know how many
people have tried to interpret Mathers? It‟s really insane the way that works. And
yet, out of that can come all kinds of interesting detail.

The 5/2
LAC Obscuration 1
I don‟t need to tell you that the 5/2 is the most obscure of the obscuring forces. It‟s
so paranoid, to tell you the truth. If you‟re a 5/2 kid on this cross and your mother
says to you, did you go to the bathroom today; shall I obscure that? I have never
seen the logic, and obviously there is logic to it, I have never seen the logic of hiding
the truth. This is one of the things that we deal with in the political context all the
time in all kinds of countries in which there are actually people who will say, no, no,
no, we can‟t tell them this. What do you mean, you can‟t tell them this?
And of course, the truth is all we‟re looking at here is the deep manipulative quality
of Civilization that demands that our purpose is to get things into form. And if you
give them all the details, you may not get things into form. If you tell them that
they‟re probably going to get radiation sickness and leukemia from working at the
plant you won‟t have any workers. It just won‟t work. And then you don‟t get the
plant built.
So, it‟s one of those things to see that when you‟re dealing with the 5/1 or the 5/2
on this cross that these are the ones that say, yeah, it‟s better that they don‟t know.
It‟s better that they don‟t understand. If they really understood they would have
power over us. There are so many people who do not want to tell anybody anything
that will give them an advantage. Why should I teach anybody Human Design? So
they can look at me? Do you know what I mean? It‟s like; I don‟t want them to see
inside of me, I don‟t want to tell anybody. Let‟s keep it obscure. No, no, no, you
can never know yourself.

I guess in some ways for the 6/2, if you‟re healthy enough, if you get through the
first part of your life, if you get past the roof, if you come off the roof as a 6/2 on
this cross, basically you can disappear. These are very, very obscure examples.
There is no need to be that shining principle. As a matter of fact, you can be the
hidden example. You can be the example that‟s simply not obvious.

There are also advantages. The whole thing about the material and the whole thing
about this detail is that this is where you get this knowledge is power crap. These
are beings that really assume that if they have the detail it gives them an advantage
over those who do not. Now, we know in the relative sense of the way things work
that yes there is truth in that.
So, you get a 6/2 that‟s on this cross and they have a detail that they‟re operating
out of, the way they‟re living their life as themselves. And somebody says, how
come you're so relaxed. Instead of telling them the detail—well, you know, I
understand myself and the way I work and I've experimented for years with my
design and blah, blah, blah—they don't do that. They don't do that at all. They will
give you some kind of the obscure explanation. Well, many years ago I had a
strange experience; they‟ll just throw it off.
Why tell them? It gives them an advantage, why should I give them an advantage.
I‟ve got enough troubles in this life, leave me alone let me deal with my own stuff.
So, they can be very cold in that sense. Remember, that the 6 is the archetype of
the fool on the hill, the one that when you truly are desperate you can go to. So
many people can‟t go to the 5 because the 5 can be so threatening as a heretic. But
they go to the 6. They figure, okay, I know they don't like being asked, but maybe
they‟ll tell us.
A 6/2 here, that‟s the a classic story of the guy that‟s crawling up the side of a hill to
finally get to his guru and he gets up there to the top and there is the guru and the
guru takes a little sign from behind his back and it says: Eat at Joes. What do you
mean eat at Joes? Give me a break; I just crawled up this whole mountain.
Obscuration. Can you imagine that guy is going to spend the rest of his life going,
what did he mean by that? What was that all about? Who is Joe? And what am I
supposed to eat. And where is it?
They‟re so powerful. I make fun of that. Half the gurus in the world do that. Half
the so-called mystical teachers in the world do that. It‟s one of their favorite trips.
The best way to deal with somebody who asks you something difficult is to say
something obscure. They learned that. They also learned that if somebody asks you
a deep spiritual question and you respond with obscurity, they‟re moved. It‟s
amazing to me. What do you mean? Please master; tell me what I should do with
my life. Did you have a good breakfast? They‟re fucked; this is it, it‟s over for
them, they sort of shatter down. They actually think they‟ve been told something
profound. The guy just asked him if they had a good breakfast.
The assumption is that hidden in that is something so important that will be
transforming in their life. So obscura can carry a great deal of power. And you can
never pigeonhole anybody like that. This isn‟t maya anymore. We left maya. We
have a different configuration here. We‟re slowly crawling into the law. So here it‟s
like, we don‟t have to give them all the detail. All we really want to do is just sort of
just get them to be able to do what isn‟t something that bothers us.

LAC Obscuration 1
The 6/3 recognizes something brilliant. It recognizes that to be obscure logically is
very difficult. It learns that. It learns that even if you‟re going to be obscure, even
your obscurity has to have some detail, and that the obscurity itself or working with
the obscure itself doesn‟t necessarily benefit anyone, but that you need a better
delivery system. In other words, if you want to take people away from the whole
truth, you tell them a story. Ah, the 56th gate, the great story telling gate. Let me
tell you a story.
There is nothing more powerful. And I want you to understand how obscura
naturally leads to the story. Remember that the power of the obscura is that those
who have to deal with it are drawn and forced to probe it to try to find out what the
message is. It‟s haunting. It‟s like going to a movie and you don‟t understand the
ending. It‟s a horrible feeling. It‟s like you‟ve been ripped off. You want to execute
the screenwriter. What kind of an ending is this? I don‟t want an obscure ending. I
don‟t want to walk out of the theater trying to make up 108 endings, just give me
the story, baby. Ah, the story.
And the beauty of the story is that not only can you tell them exactly what you want
to tell them, but you can lead them with the sense that you‟ve told them more than
they got. The archetype of this is the parable. How many human beings in the
Christian era have spent endless days of their lives trying to understand the
parables? Now, Jesus would have told you he was just telling a story.
There is a little boy and he is sitting with his mother and he‟s listening to his father
tell a story from his youth. And the father is going on and on weaving this story and
finally the little boy says, is that true? And the mother smacks him and he says to
him, you be quiet, it‟s just a story. This is the magic of stories. You don‟t know if
they‟re true. We never know if they‟re true.
Every time somebody tells you a story you don‟t believe it. But then there is a part
of you that says, well, yeah maybe. And if you really believe it you start looking
inside of it. Hey, what‟s in here? This is an interesting story. Ah, the magic of
storytelling. This is the abstract way. We‟re in the experiential way and the way
that the experiential provides you with details is it tells you the story. Oh, you have
no idea what happened to me yesterday. It was really incredible; there was this and
this and this and this. But what you notice about that story is if that you had had a
camera following that person through the whole experience what actually happened
is not what they‟re telling you. They‟re weaving together certain aspects of what
happened. And the rest is obscured.

The 1/3
We have four laws. We have traditional law, the 56, law based on experience; we
have the law of limitation, the 60th gate, the law that says that when you have a
limitation all you can do is fulfill the limitation or the potential of the limitation; we
have the 50th gate, this is the law
giver, this is the carving of law into
stone for the benefit of the tribe and
its education and security; and we
have the 3rd gate, the law of
mutation, the law of mutation
transcends all other laws. It makes
all other laws redundant, so it‟s the
most potent of the laws.
I have a 1/3 Cross of the Laws, they
assume they are authorities. They
don‟t even assume they are an
authority, they are the authority.
And if you have a 1/3 Cross of the
Laws, what you‟ll notice is as you
raise them is that they will do
everything in their power to break
every law, test the boundaries of
law, test the boundaries of authority.
To say “no” to my little one is to start a test. It‟s just a test. There is this
assumption: I am the law. And worse of all, they‟re mutative forces; they can invent
new laws quickly to replace your law right away. I have my law. My law says I do
not do that when you no.
You have to teach them that they are rules, which is quite a process. And they go
through a trial and error. One of the interesting things about the 1/3 on this cross is
that they discover very early what laws are realistic and what laws aren‟t. They
discover what laws are really, really firm. You notice that with your children. They
will see that certain rules are rules that really are going to be defended. And they
will also see that there are certain rules that you can kind of get around them. You
may be able to manipulate them. And this is part of their learning process.
It‟s very important that if you have a 1/3 child on this cross is that there are those
laws, that there are those rules that are defended, that stand strong, that are
reliable in the same way I tell you not to lie to your 1/3 children. For them, as a 1/3
on the Cross of Laws, if the rules don‟t stand up that‟s like a lie. Why did you tell me

this is the rule if you‟re not going to back it up? And if you‟re not going to back it up
then I know that you‟re weak. And that means that maybe you‟re weak about the
other laws as well and maybe I can keep on ripping down all of these laws and break
them all. After all, the 3 is an anarchist. If you create a rule for an anarchist and
the rule isn‟t legitimate, isn‟t correct, they will tear it down. They will, which of
course can get them into a hell of a lot of trouble.

The 1/4
RAC Laws 2
Remember this is so much about upbringing. The 1/4 child is simply going to bring
detail to the story of its own law, the law that it inherits from its family. So there are
certain rules in the house. For example, the rule is you take your shoes off when
you come in. So this is the kind of child that will never question that. They will
always take their shoes off; they will point out to others when they haven‟t. This will
be their way.
Now, remember something that when somebody asks them why should they take off
their shoes, and remember we are dealing with an articulating metamorphic throat
gate, a gate that says “I believe,” that one of the most important things for that 56
child is to be able to tell a story of why. You can‟t explain it in the detail. Well, you
know, I mean, you could have been walking out there and stepped into some dog
stuff and we don‟t want you bringing that into the house. It‟s a little story.
And those little stories are their ways of bringing out the detail, making sense out of
something. They‟re not trying to prove anything. It‟s not like saying, because of
that; you have dirt on your shoe. It‟s simply saying, look, if you walk outside the
chances are you can get something. We don‟t want that in the house. You tell your
little story.
These are throat children anyway, if you have a child on the Quarter of Civilization
and they‟ve got their Sun in a throat gate, articulating, speaking, communicating are
things that you have to encourage in them. It‟s so important for their development
to be able to manifest those skills, to be able to manifest that capacity to be able to
tell that story, to be able to understand and give others the detail.

laws are. And they will create the laws, very strict laws—don‟t move the chair.
They‟re the ones that put signs in the bathroom about what you should do with the

What‟s interesting about them is the potential of awakening. Like all 2/4s how
powerful they can be. And remember this power of being able to influence the cell or
the penta, and to be able to establish a collective sense. After all, this is a gate of
believing, it is a gate of belief systems. And it is the 2/4 based on its own naturally
laws that can transform those groups around them and to transform their approach
to what should be done.
Remember that the law is deeply mutative. Look at this configuration. You have a
3/60; it‟s the channel of mutation. One of the things that is so clear that the 2/4
and the 2/5 bring out so quickly is the recognition that things change, that laws can
never be truly fixed in stone. That all laws ultimately are malleable, that all laws
ultimately change because conditions change. They‟re always going to change.
What was the law 1,000 years ago in most cases does not apply today. We have
different conditions. We have different ways of dealing with aberrant behavior,
criminal behavior.

The 2/5
RAC Laws 2
No more natural place for a 5 than to be associated with law because 5s are so
deeply paranoid. And one of the things that will make them paranoid is, obviously
they are demarcations in the sand that says you can‟t cross this line. It will make
them very paranoid because if they do cross that line they‟re constantly going to be
paranoid about the consequences of actually crossing that line.
One of the things that is so interesting about the 2/4 and the 2/5 is that they know
how to break the law. And what I mean by that is that not simply that they‟re
criminals, because they don‟t mean to place all of them on this cross with this
configuration in that category, it would be nice. It‟s not that. They just have a way
of well, sort of sneaking around; tax loop holes and stuff like that. Finding ways
where you can just skirt along the edge of the law. You don‟t really break it; you
don‟t really bend it, you kind of just of slide around it.
The 2/5s are great at that. The 2/5s are great at doing things in their own space
that defy certain laws. And remember, when I speak of laws I‟m speaking of all the
laws. I‟m not just speaking about governmental laws that are on the books. I‟m
talking about social rules. I‟m talking about all of these various things that are there.
They will defy all of those things in one way or another in the privacy of their realm.
They‟re also the ones that if you call them out will scream the loudest about: there
ought to be a law. There ought to be a law against freaks like that. There ought to
be a law against people like that. There ought to be a law. They‟re great at that:
there ought to be a law. And of course, the only things they want laws for are for
things that keep people away from their door and stop making trouble for them, the
things they don‟t like to see in their paranoia, and the things that frighten them.

The 3/5
RAC Laws 2
This is a beautiful place for the 3/5 because the 3/5 here has the potential to be able
to discover scientific laws, the discovery of underlying rules of the way in which life
works. Remember, this is the human experiential way. And deep in the experiential
way, obviously are the underlying chemical and biological and genetic structures,
infrastructures that we operate out of. There is tremendous discovery possible here.
And there is a deep need in us to be able to share that with humanity; in other
words, the story telling of being, the belief. Most people think that it‟s logic that
really discovers scientific principles. But one of the things to be clear about logic is
that though logic is the underlying pattern structure, discovery begins on the
experiential way. First the experiential way; there I was in the jungle and I got
malaria and I was really sick. And you know, I just for some reason started to chew
on these leaves and gee, I got better. I brought some of these leaves back. Would
you like to check it out?
That‟s when it goes over to logic. And then the logic is grinding it up and mixing it
with chemicals and checking it against this and that and the other thing and trying to
figure out what it really does and getting down to its chemical basis and then
creating it artificially and selling it to you for a lot of money and punching it into your
body to keep you freed from malaria, too. It starts on the human experiential way.
So, the 3/5 story teller is a story teller that can tell you about the building of the
body, the building of the organ, the building of the cell. I remember years ago in the
States Reader‟s Digest, they used to have this—it was hilarious, comedians made fun
of it for years, I Am Joe’s Liver, would be the name of the article and there would be
this liver telling you all about itself. I Am Susan’s Gallbladder—who the hell cares?
But, those kinds of stories get you into the science, just like it‟s the science writers
who make more money than the scientist. They get you into; they get the reward.
Telling the story is a wonderful thing.
So, the 3/5 here has tremendous potential, it has this potential of being able to
discover the underlying laws. But we know what 3/5s are and we know what they go
through and we know what their childhood is like, so it‟s not like we‟re going to have
a scientific discovery every 30 seconds, but the reality is that given that you have
about 600 million of them in the world we have a shot. And there are about 50
million that are in this part of the world and there are probably 10 million that come
in on this cross. We have a shot that if there are few of them that were lucky
enough to have decent parents that didn‟t beat them down, that they could end up
truly discovering something of great worth for us in understanding the underlying
principles.

After all, right now, the astrophysical community is in great distress. The
understanding of how you can bring together the unifying principle of the totality has
been thrown out of whack because of the neutrino with mass. We have real problems
in coming to a point in our cosmology now where we can actually have a unified field
theory of some kind. And so, there are all of the demands on us right now to
discover the underlying laws and principles, what I‟m going to do starting tomorrow,
working on an underlying law of the way in which all life is sequenced.
This is the nature of most important work of our time. 3/5s are handy in that effort.
Handy because they will see what doesn‟t work, they can learn from their
experience. And whatever the 3/5 learns ultimately it has universal potential as a
good story. It‟s a good story to turn on others. Whenever the abstract really does a
good job, when the life experience gets translated into the appropriate parable, then
logic has an opportunity to really find things. It‟s not like they find it on their own.
That 3/5 being will have to have a lot of logic on their system for them to be
scientific in orientation. But still, recognize how important they are for us.

The 3/6
RAC Laws 2
Ah, all laws are meant to be broken, all rules are meant to be broken, all rules that
are made are made to be broken, there isn‟t a rule that has ever existed that wasn‟t
made to be broken. And if anyone is going to break them it‟s going to be the 3/6.
They‟re going to break them over and over again. They‟re going to break their own
rules over and over again. They‟re going to break other people‟s rules. They‟re going
to break rules that people didn‟t think you could break.
It‟s very hard to deal with these children. Talk about children that will challenge the
rules of the house, this is really an ordeal. And one of the things that you can do—
it‟s true for all 3s—if they‟re really having trouble with a rule, you ground them for
some reason or whatever, you really have to go to great lengths to describe to them
why that‟s of value for them to really see. After all, it‟s still the Cross of the Laws;
they are born to recognize that there are rules in laws.
The problem with the 3/6 is this deep, deep, deep, deep pessimism, to be so
pessimistic about the value of any rule. And the moment you put rules at these
beings its awful—here‟s another rule, and here‟s another rule, and here‟s another
rule—and it‟s exhausting for them. They really need the benefit of—and please don‟t
misunderstand me, you can‟t help them by giving them an avant-garde liberal
upbringing. That isn‟t the answer. An upbringing in which there are no rules and
everything is easy, that‟s not the answer. Then they‟ll just see you as being
dysfunctional parents.
No child asks for clearer guidelines than a 3. They don‟t want to be misled. If you
say, “don‟t do it or else,” you‟d better back up that “or else.” It‟s one of the most
basic things that happens with parents. Parents tend to use coercive pressure on
their children. There is always this “or else.” And the moment that you do that with

a 3, it‟s not like there is anything wrong with saying “or else,” but there‟s something
deeply wrong with not backing it up. If you can‟t back it up, don‟t make the threat.
And if you‟re going to say “or else,” make sure that it‟s appropriate. “Don‟t do that
or I‟m going to kill you.”
You really have to understand that the 3/6 child on this cross, you have to make
sure that your rules are just, that they‟re simple enough to be grasped so that that
3/6 can see, ok, yes, rules, stuff like that, they break down, they don‟t always work,
but there are some rules that do. After all, every 3/6 has a 6 at the unconscious
level. If they get to the roof, at least at the unconscious level there is a growing
equilibrium and balance to their pessimism in their personality.
And you can ultimately get them to a healthy position where they have learned to
see that a rule is not there to be obeyed or not, it‟s just a dividing line in the “this
and that.” That‟s all that it represents. And for me it‟s very clear that when you get
to the 3s and you get to them here in this kind of place, they‟re the ones that can
really awaken to an understanding that there is no difference between this side of
the line and that side of the line. It‟s relative.
And of course, the scientific principles of relativity and all of that kind of thinking,
where Newton‟s laws are turned into mush because there is a transcendent law that
will go beyond it. So that they can be very powerful, in that sense, and they can
only have that when they know. Yes, there are certain laws. For whatever relativity
was in the consciousness of Albert Einstein, he made it clear that God doesn‟t throw
dice. It may be relative, but there are underlying laws. There must be; otherwise,
there could be no universe.

The 4/6
RAC Laws 2
The 4/6 are ones that always have the potential of being very, very powerful
influential forces of small groups. They can be very, very powerful. They‟re the
ones that when they sit down with you at the bar and they tell you a story about
what happened during the day, you‟re right there with them. And they have the
capacity of being able to motivate you to respond to their influence.
Again, it‟s always going to be relative to inclusion/exclusion. One of the things that‟s
so interesting about the 4/6 in this configuration is that the tighter the configuration
the more powerful they are. If this is a 4 with two or three friends, so you have a
basic penta structure, they‟re enormously powerful. Their story has incredible
influence over that group.
There is a tendency from the time of obscuration to recognize that the whole truth
and nothing but the truth is only a rule and it can be broken. Who says that it‟s the
law that you have to tell them everything? In the United States they have laws that
protect information for 20, 25, 30 years. They actually put it right out in your face.
They say we‟re not going to let you read any so-called secret information. We‟re not

going to let you read any of these 20 year old documents for another five years
because we don‟t think you can actually handle that. It‟s there in the world. It‟s
always there.
So, one of the things about the 4/6 on this cross is that it can be very manipulative,
but manipulative through the story. You don‟t go in and say, look there is this car
around the corner and I want to go over and trash it. It doesn‟t work. It‟s not the
way you do it. You come in there and say, you know, I just pulled up, I had a
horrible thing happen to me, I‟m pulling into this parking space and this guy out of
nowhere backs into the space just as I‟m going in and won‟t get out. And not only
that, he actually got out of his car and threatened me and started to yell at me. The
guy was out of his mind.
Now, that may not be true at all. Why does it have to be true? What you want is
you want the group to go with you for protection and establish a new law—don‟t fuck
with me. And in establishing that new law, all of you together so you share the
responsibility you trash the car. Now, the fact is that maybe in fact he was down the
street when he saw this guy backing into the spot and saw that it was the only spot
and just annoyed him that this guy pulled in ahead. Not only that, but as he drives
by where this guy got in, he gives the guy the finger. The guy doesn‟t know what he
is giving him the finger for. The guy starts shouting at him. And then he drives on
and parks, goes to his friends and says, hey, this guy what he did.
You have no idea how often in the world every day somebody has to be punished
based on these rules; the power of the story. There is no detail; you don‟t need to
have truth. There are no facts. You can weave that story any way you want. You
see it every day in criminal trials. It goes on all the time.
So, it‟s something to be aware of the power of the 4/6 on the Cross of Laws.
Remember the 4th line of the 50 is corruption. They will corrupt you; they will bring
you to another law. Now, that can be positive. It can also be very negative. But
understand the principle of this deep impact on the closed cell and how powerful
both storytellers and fact deliverers are if they have that cell. The moment they have
that cell is the moment of the potential of what they want to deliver as metamorphic
information can take hold and ultimately be manifested.

Cross of the Laws, there is no 3 and 50. It‟s gone. It has been replaced by the 27
and the 28. And we have the 28th gate which is the great gate of risk taking and the
gate of purpose. And we have the 27th gate, and of course, the 27th gate is the gate
of nourishment, and it‟s the other side of the 50 that‟s gone away, that channel of
the tribal defense circuitry and channel of custodianship.
So, the theme of the 4/1 is whatever, stimulate them. And these are people that are
natural storytellers, but there is no purpose in the story. It‟s just a value of
storytelling. And I want you to understand that‟s a very, very important value. One
of the most important things about the contribution of the human experiential way is
that it offers the opportunity for all of to benefit from everyone else‟s experience.
It‟s why we live in a world of
biographies and autobiographies.
It‟s why we have a basic interest
and a basic curiosity about people‟s
lives. It‟s why you read obituaries.
There is a basic interest in us in the
process of the human life and what
goes on. And we love a good story.
They have television cable networks
now that do nothing but bios and
people watch it all day long, the
story about this person and that
person and the other thing. Human
beings love that.
Well, it‟s a great contribution to the
collective whole. In other words,
filling the maya with stories is
terrific. What it does is it reaffirms
that we have a past, it reaffirms
that we‟ve come from something and we‟re going towards something. And it
provides us with all the lessons that we need to learn along the way.
So, the 4/1 stimulation is great; however, if it‟s your child there is a tendency to tell
stories that they don‟t even have to be true, it‟s just storytelling. And children who
have the 56 are children that need stimulation. This is the gate of the wanderer,
movement, stimulation. It‟s an essential ingredient and these are children that are
going to need a lot of stimulation and these are children that are going to be natural
storytellers; very fixed. Don‟t ask these children for the facts, just ask for the story.
Just take in their story.

The Left Angle Cross of Distraction 1
 60  28
The 5/1
How interesting it is that the left angle of the 62 is obscuration and the left angle of
the 56 is distraction. And again, you can see how the left angle is going, ok, this
idea of having laws is very cool, I think that‟s really terrific. We need laws, if we
don‟t have laws we‟re not going to be able to advance our civilization, that‟s great.
But if you have people focused on the law all the time we are not going to have a
society that is going to operate
without fear.
And one of the things about the
heresy here is that the heresy is it‟s
not the law that matters, it‟s the
quality of life that matters. This is a
quality of life heresy. It says, I
don‟t care if there is a dictator, we
can still figure out how to party.
And if in the middle of that party,
while you‟re swooning and mooning
or whatever it is you‟re doing, there
is no dictator, there is no law, there
is no law against parties. None of
that exists because you‟re deeply
distracted. And oh, how nice it is to
be distracted.
Anyone who has lived under
dictatorship knows this. You know
that you need to find a way to distract yourself from the oppression that is around
you. And this is the way to do it. So, the 5/1 comes in and says, let‟s party, let‟s
have a good time, let‟s get out there, let‟s be distracted. What it‟s really saying to
you is something important. It‟s saying that life itself has a certain law to it; well,
many, it has many, many, many different rules, many laws. But the point is not
going from one law to another; the point is seeing the movement of the whole being
through the process. This is what‟s interesting.
And what‟s interesting in one‟s life is not so much whether you are on this side or
that side of the law, but what you do on this side or that side and what you fill up
this very short time with. Only the experiential way knows how fragile life is as a
whole, knows that at any moment, bang, you‟re gone, hence the quality of life. It is
what you do in your life that matters as a being rather than the constraints that are
placed there by laws. Don‟t let the government catch you. You are not allowed to
have parties. It is against the law to make people happy. It is against the law to

distract people from the truth. It is against the law to distract them from their
responsibilities in society. And yet, distraction is the only way that you get to
purpose. And distraction is really caring.
You don‟t want your children to be always focused on the rules. You want them to
enjoy growing up. You want them to be properly distracted. When you tell them
that they can‟t go out it‟s a lot easier if they‟re distracted by the television when
they‟re in. Then they‟re not constantly in your face with a frown and a whine saying
why can‟t I go out, nobody lets me go out, you‟re not a nice person. If you can
distract them it‟s great. And in the very distraction they can find something of value.
They can find something that can help them fulfill their purpose. It‟s a very, very
interesting cross.

The 5/2
LAC Distraction 1
One of the heresies that you really see here is often you‟ll see parents who will raise
their children in a very unique fashion despite the fact that the children go out into
an ordinary world, go out into a world that obeys various rules and regulations. One
of the things about distraction is that life is not about the rules. It isn‟t.
One thing on the Cross of the Laws that you can see is that it carries the 3/60. It‟s
so obvious that all laws are subject to mutation. They just are. And that if you hang
your star on any law the likelihood is that it‟s going to evaporate anyway. It‟s better
to be distracted with what it‟s all about to be here, the story. May you live in
interesting times. May you have an interesting life. May your life be full of stories.
There is no better wish for the other than that their life is rich with experience.
This is the whole point of distraction. Enrich your life, enrich it with risk, there is risk
in all this. But on the experiential way if you don‟t risk there is nothing to be found,
there is nothing to be discovered. And what‟s a story without risk? Most modern
cinema is action movies, filled with risk taking. How exciting it is for all of us. How
distracting it is. You go into the theater depressed and there is all this dari doo and
jumping and risking, risking love, risking life, risking everything. Ah, we love it. And
that distraction is perfect. You walk out in a totally different space.
So, one of the things about the ordeal of life is that part of the role of stimulation
inherent in the 56th gate is to stimulate us with life itself, to distract us from the
limitation of life, to distract us from the tensions of the “this and that” of duality.
We‟re being distracted.

The 6/2
LAC Distraction 1
Let‟s get to a 6/2. Oh, are they ever distracted. You can‟t imagine how distracted
they are when they‟re young. And they‟re always distracted from doing what they‟re
supposed to be doing. It‟s one of the things about distraction—yes, yes, I really was
going to come and pay my ticket today, but there was this beautiful girl.
I was a school teacher for years. I used to love the excuses the kids would bring.
Every level of distraction you could imagine and all invented. I remember one kid
saying to me, my cat got hit by a car and went through this whole long story. And I
see his mother a couple weeks later here on the island and I said, how‟s the cat?
She looks at me like I was nuts. I said wasn‟t your cat hit by a car? She said, my
cat wasn‟t hit by a car, where did you hear that? Oh, yeah, I was distracted.
You can always see that when kids know that teachers are about to give them a test
or something, there is always one kid there who will ask some kind of question
hoping that it will distract the teacher from the direction that they were going to take
and get the teacher to start telling some kind of story. And then afterwards, the kids
walk out and say, got him, oh, I distracted him.
So, the whole thing about the 3/2 configuration is that they‟re going to be very
distracted. If you‟re looking at a pretty girl while you‟re crossing the street, you
could get killed. It‟s one of those things to keep in mind about the quality of
distraction. And of course, this is different for parents of these children because you
say to the child that you have go do that. And as the child is moving in this direction
anything will distraction them. As a matter of fact, if there is nothing to distract
them, they‟ll look for distraction.
On the roof they can make a fortune from distraction. We already know scientifically
that the placebo effect is legitimate. In other words, if we give somebody something
that really has no properties in it that can truly help them get rid of their pain, as an
example, they will still reduce their pain. So there is an incredible placebo effect that
is possible when you are a 6/2 on this roof. That is, you can distract people from
their pain.
So many therapists, so many healers, the people I call the people that wear white
hats and do black work, are in the distraction business. They‟re distracting you from
your not-self pointedness and they‟re trying to get you to become some of the not-
self pointedness and trying to get you there by distracting you from what is really
disturbing you.
So many of the exercises that you see in the New Age, the physical things that
people are put through are simply distraction systems to try to draw them away from
their own limitations and try to bring them to a place where they suddenly realize
they‟ve transcended limitation. Distraction can be very useful that way. You can

distract somebody into crossing a line, a line they thought they would never cross.
So there is value in that. There are also dilemmas.
I guess for me the irony of the 6/2 off the roof on this cross is that it would be
fascinating to see what it would be like awake, what it is to be an example of
perfected distractedness that one never has an opportunity to be either observer or
observed because you‟re too distracted to be either. It‟s an interesting position.

The 6/3
LAC Distraction 1
All 6/3s have the same dilemma. It‟s all right to be distracted. But what is the real
value of distraction? And for them there is this sudden recognition of what that
value is because they‟re going to be looking at the 31st gate. Ah, the 31st gate. I‟m
a 7, I have three activations in the 7, when I smell the 31st gate I leave. I like my 7s
going out the 10 door. I don‟t like being conditioned by 31s.
This is the heaviest material conditioning there is. This is the expression of collective
leadership concretized in form. So, the 6/3 that is sitting back here on the 56,
they‟re sitting back here with this distraction learning because they‟re constantly
distracted in their 3/6 process, constantly distracted. And they realize the value of
distraction.
What happens to them is the discovery of the 3rd line process is that all on their own
through all of their up and downs they cross lines they never thought they could
cross and don‟t even remember how they crossed them. How did I do that? There
is this wow. The example of that is that most human beings in their experience of
driving a car will notice that there are occasions where you suddenly realize you‟ve
driven 25 blocks and didn‟t even know you did it. You‟re so distracted you didn‟t
even know you were driving the car.
I had that the other morning. I‟m driving down and I‟m distracted and I go right by
my normal turn, go right by the whole thing totally distracted and then you wonder;
how did I get here? How did I miss that? How did that work? So this is something
that the 6/3 really gets deeply. It‟s like, aha.
The whole business about travel in space, if you‟re Newtonian, even if you‟re
Einsteinian you‟re basically saying, okay you have to go from here to here. So there
is some kind of line. But the 6/3 looks at that problem and says, but what if you
took both sides and you did this. What if you just folded space? If you folded space
you could put those two dots so close to each other that you could walk from this
end to that end in a fraction of a second.

Now, this is what you get from distraction. It can be truly brilliant. It can recognize
that it‟s not so much that you break or bend or avoid any law, that the law itself is
pointless. You don‟t have to go from here to there if here and there are in the same
place. It‟s obvious to the distracting mind. All you have to do is fold the space.
All these people running around saying, okay you have to accelerate, you have to get
there, you have to travel there, it‟s very far, how are we ever going to get to

Introduction
So we jump into the 31, Influence, to put it in you. Oh, they put it in you. It‟s
always interesting for me that all politicians put their hand up, they put both hands
up, they put one hand up, but they‟re always doing this. It‟s always the same. Not
only that, when they put it in they grab hold of something. When we think influenza,
it gives you an idea of what influence is. It goes inside. Not only does it go inside, it
combines with you in there and brings you in line with it chemically. Oh, it‟s a
powerful gate.
It‟s the channel of leadership, the alpha, leadership for good or bad and when you
look at the 1st line that's exactly what you're looking at. Hitler, 31.1; it can be so
dark that nobody ever sees it. It can be so light that nobody ever sees it. But it‟s
one of the things to understand about the nature of influence is that it is physical.
And how do you become influential? You distract. It‟s what you learn from the 56.
And you obscure; what you learn from the 62.
Remember that the left angle is all about the transpersonal. How do you hook at the
transpersonal level, this deep hidden web of fractals? Well, if you want to be a
leader you know how to do it, you combine obscuration with distraction and you can
rule. And don‟t we know that's the truth. Everybody knows that's the truth. You
look at any leadership, democratic, dictatorship, this or that, they all operate under
the same rules—obscuration and distraction.
I thought it was wonderful, Saturday Night Live, last week—in the States they have
this 9/11 commission that is investigating why they couldn't stop bin Laden, and
Condoleezza Rice, which is one of the security advisors for Bush, there was all this
stuff about not wanting to testify under oath in from of the committee, and Saturday
Night Live had Janet Jackson who is in a lot trouble in America because her breast
was exposed at the Super Bowl game, there is a routine that they do in which she's
advised by Cheney that if she gets into trouble in front of the committee to simply
open up her blouse and show her breast, because the distraction would really work
and get her breast on the front cover of the newspapers instead of bin Laden.
All governments operate through laws of distraction and obscuration. There was
Jose Aznar saying, oh edit it. Let‟s distract them for a moment, let‟s obscure things
for a moment. It is the political way. It‟s not like they‟re bad or whatever. Don‟t
you get it? This is the way the program insists we lead.
Not only that, it tells you something that those that are lead are designed to be lead
by obscuration and are designed to be led by distraction. It tells you a lot about
humanity and the not-self. I can make fun of that, you get this kind of, yeah, it‟s
funny, I know it's funny, but then again, the regard that the program has for us is
revealed in this. Don‟t tell them the truth and if there is a problem distract them
from it so that they won‟t ask you the truth.

The 1/3
So, the 1/3 can be very, very, very cruel authoritarians. And they can be very cruel
authoritarians because the anarchy that they see from the time they come into the
world that their personality is convinced that the only thing you can do to end the
anarchy is to impose powerful leadership, being in the boss.
Any one that has the 1st line of anything wants to be the boss of it. But when you
have the 1st line of the 31, you are so naturally authoritarian that this creates
tremendous problems. These are
babies that bark at their mothers.
Obviously, they‟re going to find out
a lot about what authority is.
They‟re going to explore how you
influence the other. And they‟re
going to be very, very powerful as
children. It is very difficult for
31.1s, I've watched all my life, it‟s
very difficult for them to externalize
their influence. And most of it is
because of the nature of the 1/3,
that deep uncomfortable pessimism
with the instability of leadership,
the lack of strength.
When we look at leaders in the
western context we‟re always
measuring them relative to their
strength and weaknesses. It‟s why
most of us come from a tradition
where our ancestors were always dealing with only leaders who bore strength. The
bigger you were, the more power you had. They realized right away, these children,
that if you're not in charge yourself that you cannot trust anybody to lead you
properly, and so they end up being very isolated children wanting to run their own
lives. When you meet a 1/3 on this cross you know right away that they are going
to be very, very self-contained in their process. They‟re going to influence
themselves.
Now, this is the Cross of the Unexpected. On the Cross of the Unexpected expect
the unexpected. It doesn't have that name for nothing. And one of the most
extraordinary things about the Cross of the Unexpected it is a discovery cross.
Planets have been discovered on this cross. Many things have been discovered in
science on this cross. It is the unexpected, out of nowhere.

And this is also the whole thing about that expression about some are called to
power. Some are born for power, this kind of thing. These are beings that
unexpectedly could be of influence unexpectedly. It‟s not consistent. We don't want
to live in a world where everyone is a leader. That‟s not what the program wants.
Most of these beings are simply their own authorities—the kings in their own castles,
the queens in their own castles, the bosses of their little cubbyholes, the bosses of
their little departments, whatever it may be, this minimalized field of influence. But
for the 1/3 the opportunity to be influential is something that can only bump into
you.

The 1/4
RAC Unexpected 2
The 1/4s have another dilemma. All 1s, as we know, have the opportunity to study,
to study enough so that in their security they can be influential in what it is they can
express. Remember, it is a throat gate. It‟s a throat gate that says, “I lead, or I
don‟t lead.” It‟s also a throat gate that says, my way or the highway baby. And so
most of the time they only lead themselves.
Until you get to the 4th line personality here, you're not going to get to the potential
of leading others other than through the unexpected. And it is unexpected.
Basically the leadership is the byproduct of the research of the right angle. The right
angle finds something out; that finding out is the unexpected influence that they can
have. They may discover something that has an influence on generations to come.
And that discovery was simply their own trial and error process that all of a sudden
the unexpected popped out.
With the 1/4 they would really like everybody to know that they‟re an influence. But
they don't trust it. One of the things that we don't really look at as we go round the
wheel is that the personality aspects of these crosses are what we think of as
ourselves. And of course, the design is not. When you're going around here you
may have that personality in the 31st gate, but there are all kinds of unexpecteds
around. There are all kinds of things that can happen. And there is no real
consistency.
The 1/4 wants nothing but consistency, wants to be able to be able to exude its
influence in a consistent way and not to have anything unexpected show up. And
when you see the 1/4 here and you see the 4/6 and you see the 4/1 and the 2/4, the
four variations, what you're really looking at is the deep resistance to surprise. If
there's anything that the history teaches us is that the most influential of beings on
this planet have all been rather surprising, unexpected examples. It‟s never what
you expect. I'm not talking about our political leaders. That's another formula. I'm
talking about leading, leading in the form principle, those that influence others. And
here the influence can be deep and it's always unexpected.

Influence
So, the 4s are very uncomfortable in this configuration with surprises. They would
rather just focus on being an influence. After all, if you‟re on a cross that contains
the 31st gate and you‟re a 4th line being, hey, I‟m supposed to be home here. I am,
by my nature, influential through my 4th line, here I am in a gate of influence. This
should be the place where I have the most consistent influence.
And the moment they think that's the way it is, bang, the unexpected shows up. So,
the mother and father have set certain rules in the childhood and they get divorced
and a new force comes into the house and the rule changes and the 1/4 is totally
messed up; its foundation, this solid foundation—no surprises. That‟s why I want to
be the boss. I want to make sure that there are no surprises, none. If you're going
to go away, you tell me. You tell me when you're going away, you tell me when
you're coming back, and I don‟t want any surprises. I want to know how much it
costs before I buy it, I don‟t want any surprises. I want to know what it's going to
be like when I get there. I don't want any surprises. I don‟t want to be surprised at
all.

The 2/4
RAC Unexpected 2
When you get to the 2/4 here, you know what happens to them and you know it
wakes them up; they get surprised. It‟s like having the 2/4 and you manage
somehow to get them out of their house long enough to fill their house with people
for a surprise party. You‟re going to freak them out. And if you're responsible for it,
you have lost a friend. How dare you do that to me? They flip out. They don‟t like
surprises.
So, if you have a 2/4 child on this cross, don‟t surprise them. They don‟t like it.
Make sure they know what's going on. Don‟t think it‟s such a big deal that you‟re
going to surprise them with a special birthday present, you're going to get exactly
the opposite that you thought you were going to get from them. All that 2/4 child
wants is that they can be an influence in their life and that everybody obeys them.
You obey me, and if you obey me, then everything is going to be fine. That's all
they care about.
And if you‟re a 2/4 your world, your home, this is the place where your influence has
to be felt the strongest. You have to allow children who are 31s to display their
influence, you must. It‟s not like you allow them to take over your life, but you have
to nurture this in them so that they are not surprised. You don‟t want to be a 2/4 on
this cross and you have the 25th gate and you don‟t have the 51 and you have an
open heart center. You can be surprised and drop dead just from the shock.
Again, the unexpected is a funny thing. And we always talk about unexpected
leaders emerging out of nowhere. The unexpected hero—every time you get to the
playoffs in professional sports, there is somebody who during the regular season
everybody's ready to fire them and all of a sudden they come out of nowhere and

they‟re the hero. It is our principal of influence. It is the unexpected that has the
deepest impact.
So basically, what you're doing with these children is that you have to nourish them
towards that. The way you do that is you get them to practice their influence. And
in the 2/4, obviously, you have to call that out. They can be, by the way, deeply,
deeply influential; and again, influential to the cell that forms around them.
Most 4s in their social interaction are trying to influence the other without any
motive. It‟s just their nature to be influential. It is their nature to have this in their
social capacity. But when you have it pointed like this, this very gift that they have
becomes the reason for being with the group, it is to influence them, and to influence
them that there are no surprises, nothing unexpected.
What do you mean? Every Thursday night we all go to the theater and see the
movie together. And one of them says why don‟t we go Tuesday night and do
something different. Oh, geez, don‟t say that to this 2/4. That 2/4 will do
everything in its power, obscuration, distraction, you name it, everything in its power
to remind everybody no, no, no, no, no, Thursday's we go to the movies, and we
watch the movies together. And they will do everything to influence the group and
finally the group with say all right, maybe next Wednesday. Yeah, we can think
about that, we can try to work that out, but Thursday night movie nights, we don't
change that.
Now, if you raise that child recognizes how influence works, that same 2/4 can be
called to take advantage of that to work with its influence. In other words, well,
that's an interesting idea. What do the rest of you think, do you think—and all of a
sudden you take control of the leader. You take that moment of challenge from what
is your way and you slowly turn it into you‟re the one making the decision for
everyone. All right guys, let‟s go do that. But they have to learn that. If they don't
learn that, they're going to be very difficult in those situations, and threatened by
that unexpected, because the unexpected threatens their power. It threatens their
leadership.
Every time a country has an election—they really saw that in Spain. The unexpected
can really take the wind out of your sails out of nowhere. If it weren't for the
unexpected in the Madrid train stations this country would still be ruled by the right.
And this is the horror of all leaders that out of nowhere something's going to happen
and it's going to mess things up for them. They hate the unexpected. Imagine right
now at the White House that they find out that there are aliens that are about to
arrive, and you can see them talking to them, could you wait until after November.
Can I distract you to visit Neptune for awhile, because if I have to deal with you it
could affect the election.
And you know in this kind of the season where you have a buildup to any political
election you know that the public knows less about what's going on than at any other
time, because the governments are terrified that anything could be that unexpected
element that blows everything up and takes the winds out of their political sails.
They hate it.

The 2/5
RAC Unexpected 2
The thing that makes the 2/5s so interesting is that they can bring such an
unexpected something that they can be so disturbing, out of nowhere. Because
they‟re really hidden, the whole 2/5 thing we‟ve looked at, they‟re really hidden.
And yet, at the same time they can do the most unexpected things. It has enormous
influence.
Do you realize how easy it is for humanity to be distracted by the unexpected? It's
what we love. It says that mutation is at work. It says that archetype that you had,
that‟s bullshit. It can come from anywhere. There's no way really to be able to
control all of this, and then they get really nervous. Well, then I have to keep up my
level of influence. I have to keep on putting my thing into them as a counterbalance
against the potential of the unexpected.
As a matter of fact, if I influence them in the deepest possible way I can always
distract them from the truth. If George Bush turns out to be a transvestite serial
killer, there are still those in America that would vote for him. As somebody who
influences others you can influence a certain coterie so deep that it doesn't matter
what is revealed about you. It doesn‟t make a difference. They will still not do the
unexpected. They will stay with you. They won‟t revolt and turn against you.
So you can see how political processes function. It‟s why we're both dependent on
and detest our politicians, because they're trapped in these games and we all know
them. And we know that even if we were there, despite our comments, we‟d be in
the same game, because it is the game. It's the way that it works. It just does.
Influence is afraid to lose its power because the unexpected can strip it away. And
that‟s really what it's all about. When you're trying to influence other people you
don't want some unexpected fly to show up in the soup. You don‟t, it ruins
everything. But it only ruins everything if you're not-self. But it‟s one of the things
to understand that the not-self can't deal with things that way. For the not-self,
immediately it's oh my god I have to find a way to distract them, I have to find a
way to obscure it. Let me take my mistake and show them that it was really right.
Let me weave that into, well, what I was really trying to do is test and see how good
you are in observing as students.
Most people when they screw up they cover-up. It‟s one of the basic things about
the not-self, you blow it, and you cover it up. And you cover it up with obscuration,
you cover it up with distraction, you do everything that you can. Oh, look over
there. Yeah, right, point everybody in another direction, take them down another
track.
So you can see what makes leaders so uncomfortable and what makes anybody on
this cross uncomfortable. They are the Cross of the Unexpected, and they're

The 3/5
RAC Unexpected 2
The 3/5 Cross of the Unexpected, yes, I‟m all for it. The unexpected from the first
moment, all the things that the 3/5 goes through with its parents in any other
hexagram here it‟s magnified by eight zillion. Because it‟s not so much that the
expectation on the unconscious that the child is going to be so wonderful and the
disappointment of experience in its 3rd line isn't a kind of gradual entry into
recognizing your child isn‟t what you wanted it to be. No, no, no, it comes in deeply
unexpected accentuating moments. It‟s those moments where you‟ve been babbling
about how wonderful your baby is, your baby is going to be the greatest baby in the
world, and you're sitting there with your friend, and baby goes absolutely berserk,
absolutely berserk.
The unexpected is really funny. You honestly don't know what's going to happen. I
can remember showing up at the daycare in Bavaria to pick up my son who's a
provocateur and the unexpected is a funny thing. I walk over to get him and he says
who are you? And there are all these German hausfraus around as Jeeva is yelling
at me: you‟re not my father. And there I am—the unexpected can be devastating.
He‟s screaming, oh, no, you‟re not my father. And these women are all holding their
little children and there I am in black with sunglasses on grabbing this kid—you‟re
not my father. The unexpected is a killer to influence. You try to be influential when
the unexpected shows up, there‟s no way. It just gets in the way.
The 3/5s obviously can really present you with the unexpected and they can have
the unexpected devastation of their reputation. Rather than the normal slow
deterioration of the reputation that happens as a not-self 3/5, on this kind of a cross
they have these spectacular falls from grace. So they can go along and they‟ve
managed to work out their trip and then all of a sudden some closet opens up and
some skeleton falls out of that closet and everything collapses.
This is where blackmail comes from. 3/5s on this cross knows that everybody has an
unexpected skeleton in their closet; that behind every clean, crispy surface is a dirty,
dirty back drawer somewhere and that everyone has one. And it‟s one of the things
we notice about how you diminish influence, again the program, it‟s the program.
The program says, get the dirt on them. Find out that little unexpected thing in their
background. I understand that when you were 17 you were a communist. Get that
little thing there, that unexpected. Yes, I had a puff on a marijuana joint, but I
didn‟t inhale. And you had to tell that story because somebody had done it up.

It‟s one of those wonderful things about the dirt movie because the dirt movie brings
the obscuration distraction movie. It‟s so wonderful the way that works. What is so
interesting is the moralist who say, this is all awful. This is terrible. They should all
operate differently. Yeah; this is the form principle, honey. This is the way the
world works. This is the way leadership works. This is the way influence works.
People say, let‟s have a clean campaign. The best I can say is let‟s have a campaign
without shooting. That‟s the only concession that I‟ll make. But clean? You can‟t
have a clean campaign. We want to know the dirt. We want the unexpected. We
love it. And if you can‟t find one, create one.
Did you see that wonderful piece—John Kerry, the guy that‟s running for the
Democrats, he‟s a Vietnam vet who went against the war. He was giving a speech at
some college. At that same college that same day Jane Fonda who is hated by the
right in America because she went to Vietnam during the war, was also there. All of
a sudden a couple of months ago, somebody with their computer took a picture of
these two in the same place on the same day and put them side-by-side both of
them looking like they‟re speaking to an audience and put it up on the Internet.
All of a sudden the right wing had, oh, we got him. He was with Hanoi Jane. He‟s
one of them. Now, millions of people saw it on the Internet. And then finally the
guy who took the pictures said it was false and the company says they‟re going to
sue and blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, Fox shows it every day. When you put dirt
out, even it it‟s not true, it sticks. It‟s just the way that it works.
So, we get to a point where all of us realize in mature democracies that we accept
corruption as a way of life. We assume that people are dirty. We assume that
people are paid off. All we ask is that we don‟t flaunt it. It‟s true. All we ask is that
okay, okay, okay; you‟ve got your perks. The program is funny. The form principle
is funny. It realizes what it takes to move the not-self.

have a 3rd line mind. I know how uncomfortable 3rd line pessimism is for people that
really don't have that and don't understand it. It can be very, very, very deep and it
can be very uncomfortable.
From the deepest pessimism also comes the unexpected. And I guess for any 3/6
that is the ultimate magic, that despite the depth of their pessimism about the
nature of the world, the nature of influence, the way things work that there are
surprises and there are always surprises. And they‟re not a 4. It‟s like, okay, give
me a good one. And this is almost a prayer. It's like from my lips to God‟s ear. May

The 4/6 here is so deeply resistant to the unexpected and the surprise. And they are
very uncomfortable as voyeurs of chaos. And if there is ever a controlling force
politically that has real power politically, then you're looking at the 4/6. They‟re still
in their own trip so they can be absorbed by their own ambitions and live by their
own laws, and yet, they have a transpersonal influential capacity. And on this cross
their whole thing is let‟s eliminate the unexpected. Think about that. Let‟s control
everything.
There are places in the world, where the only way that you could really find out
what's going on is that you have to have a satellite dish because if you live in North
Korea and you turn on the one radio station or the one television station there is
nothing that is unexpected. Everything is controlled. They don't really know what's
going on. This is the ultimate influential progression; in other words, the hell with all
this unexpected stuff.
Here, really, when you're looking at the completion of the right angle it‟s really the
3/6 in this case, because the 4/6, because of its resistance to the change, the
resistance to the surprise that can cut its influence, it becomes deeply controlling of
the other. It watches how it works. It learns when it's a young how control can
break down and lead to problems, and that it works very, very strongly on getting to
a point where it can provide examples of control. And here, what you're looking at is
very powerful disciplinarians, the ones that discipline their selves, ones that make
sure that everybody operates according to what is expected of them. No

And one of the things about the 4/1 on this cross is that it reinforces the truth of
what the material plane has laid out for us in the way in which these forms are
constituted and that is that the vast majority of humanity are sheep. To be an
integration individual is to absolutely detest the dependency of humanity on those
few that can pretend that they‟re alphas, because what I've learned is that the
alphas are not-self anyway, and the
alpha is what's coming. The whole
thing about the 31.4 is that it
recognizes that everyone and
anyone can be influenced at any
time under any circumstances, that
humanity is deeply, deeply, deeply
susceptible to conditioning. Well,
gee, okay, we know that now. We
know how deeply susceptible
through this knowledge humanity is
to conditioning; it‟s incredible.
I haven't been able to express how
incredibly powerful the not-self
really is. If I'm going to be a viable
leader I also have to have a certain
amount of obscuration and
distraction. The deepest truths of
the way in which these eyes see is
that there are very few that are here
for the way. I mean the not-self is incredibly dense. Humanity is being led deeply
by the not-self, conditioned by the not-self. And that we can see that built into the
material realm is the absolute necessity for all human beings to be subject to and
sensitive to influence. And here I am in my chair preaching, you are your own
authority. I am truly a heretic, folks. This goes against everything that is there
inherent in the not-self response to the program.
There is nothing more terrifying in political circles than chaos. There is nothing more
terrifying in security circles then everyone's on their own. It's spooky. They don‟t
want that. But then again, the not-self does not understand the principle of unique
differentiated authority. They do not know the potential of what it is to be on their
cross. They‟re just sheep; sheep of the program, sheep of the conditioning of
others, sheep to their cultural direction and their civilization‟s direction and
everything else; a mindless bunch of monkeys.
When you're a heretic and the forces come to you and say to you that we‟ve got a
job for you, you look at them and think ah, Jesus Christ, why don‟t you just stop all
this bullshit, kill them all off and start again. Because you know when you step out
the door, you know when you carry knowledge, you know, hey, look at the world,
look at its density, look at the stupidity. I was born with nodes that point me at
beauty. This is an ugly planet—the spirit. And then you see, well, this is what the

how to run it itself. It‟s the program running us. It‟s the program running the not-
self.
I do transits everyday and people love to hear it because they're not-self. Transits
only impact the not-self. They‟re integrated into the true self. You don‟t need to
know which way the wind blows. You can just feel it. You need a weatherman; the
not-self always needs a weatherman. The not-self always needs somebody to hold
its hand, always needs somebody to point the way, always, always, always totally
dependent on the other. And this is the form principal.

manipulation. And the 24th gate is a
gate of rationalization. And one of
the things that the alpha is very
good at is rationalizing their
manipulation of the other to bring
them to what they feel is the right
direction. That‟s what they do.

GATE 31
Influence
The heresy of the 5/1—buried underneath the 31 is the 41. One can never forget
what this polarity is really all about. The 41 is the start codon. It is where the
experiential way begins. It‟s the pressure for human life. Its opposition is the
control of human life. This is what it's about. And the thing that's odd about it is
that the start is abstract and the control mechanism is logical. Something to grasp is
how difficult it is for logic to control the abstract. It's an incredible battle that takes
place.
Everything about the alpha is that the alpha is really trying to control you. This is
beyond influence. This is: this is the way. You don‟t want to have other people
projecting on you that you‟re the alpha if you don't have a solid foundation. And
most of these 5/1s run like hell and hide out. It‟s not like they really get to fulfill
that alpha role. And remember that what the 31st gate understands is that to be an
alpha is relative. In other words, the alpha is trying to do what the 4/6 can do and it
can't.
If you go back to the 4/6 on this cross, the 4/6 on this cross can be deeply influential
of the small cell. The 5/1 can‟t. And yet, because of the logical principle developed
in the research of this hexagram, it tries to, and it can‟t. Its heresy—because I like
its heresy—is because I‟m the alpha, I can tell who is special in my followers. And
this is their deepest seduction. Oh, without your talent I could never lead the
people, says the alpha to the other. Oh, they seduced them.
One thing about collective leadership is that without the cell nothing works. And
without many cells you don't have enough support and power. So you know the
alpha manipulates people through praise. Have you ever seen wolves in their social
interaction? You have one alpha, there is always an alpha amongst wolves and in
any given situation when that alpha appears every one in turn goes up to the alpha
and genuflects. The dog bows down. It shows itself to be vulnerable to the alpha.
Now, of course, we know that in human genuflection there's all of that.
Now, to get somebody to genuflect before you and to enjoy doing so, they need to
be praised. Standby friend, you are a valued servant of your king. I could not be so
powerful without you. By the way, you missed that little twist in the genuflection of
it. Yes, I am the alpha and you are so smart to have recognized it. You are so
talented to have seen that I am the one that can truly guide you. That‟s their trip.
Ah, sheep. How easy it is to say to all of them, oh, you're all so terrific. I do; I go,
you‟re mythology. Live your mythology. It‟s a 5th line trait. But here it‟s so slimy.
These are the coteries around leaders. Any live pictures of Michael Jackson going to
court and you see these creatures around him. These are the alpha‟s creatures.
Alpha leadership is like, whoa, it‟s like a gangster movie where you see all the
creatures around the gangster—Louie, you‟re the best killer I have. Then Louie
would do anything for you. And it's so amazing how many human beings will accept
any kind of role as long as they‟re praised. It‟s unbelievable.
Half of humanity is basically 3-ish, the 3s, the 6 with the 3, the 3 with the 3, 3-ish;
it‟s a new word. Half of human is 3-ish and if you‟re 3-ish you‟re into martyrdom,
mistakes, self-deprecation, beating yourself down. Do you know how sweet praise
is? Oh, honey, it‟s honey, it‟s sweet. This is what alphas do.

The 5/2
LAC Alpha 1
The 5/2 alpha has a real problem. It‟s paranoid about praising anyone because it's
afraid that that if it praises them too much it will usurp its role. General Luigi is the
best general we‟ve ever had. The next day Luigi and his boys take over and you‟re
dead. It‟s like whoa. The 5/2 knows right away to temper your praise. A little too
much praise may embolden the weak to think that they can challenge you.
This is the fear of democracy. Remember the 5 in its relationship to the 2. If you go
to the 7th gate, the 2 is the democrat and 5 is the general, the general fears
democracy. It‟s why so many generals try to pervert democracy. In Latin America to
be a general is the equivalent in America to be a lawyer. First you have to be a
general then you can be El Presidente. It‟s the same thing. And boy, are they careful
with their praise.
And then there are all these political analysts saying, well, the head of this
government, there are real problems with succession because every time he seems
to appoint somebody to be a successor they end up dead. You see that all the time.
Where was that—Malaysia, Mahathir, strange guy anyway, and there was this guy
that ended up in jail on buggery charges. And there was this guy, very popular, was
going to be the next prime minister, oh wow, he went from being praised to being
the boy wonder of the future to being dirt dog. He‟s still in jail.
So the 5/2 says, okay, but—the other thing is that it works the other way. This is
the sycophant that praises the leader. And this is the one that becomes the real
alpha and keeps on telling the leader, ah, you‟re the best leader, and then one day it
can sneak up and stick a shiv right in its back. These are the ones that are really
dangerous. These are the ones below who praise decline. The 31, if you‟ve got your
Sun in 31, you want to be of influence, one way or another.

LAC Alpha 1
Here we have an exalted possibility, the exalted possibility of being an example of
being and alpha which means that you don't play alpha games, you're a natural
alpha. People will naturally accept your influence; will naturally accept your
conditioning of them. If it‟s innocent, which is in the nature of the 6, if it is correct,
then that‟s something that could be quite beautiful.
However, let's be realistic here. We‟re going to have a 3/2 phase that‟s going to
distort all of this. There are going to be all kinds of difficulties in—everything about
the alpha is about praise. If you have a 3 you know you‟re going to be suffering
from lack of praise. All 3s suffer from lack of praise. One of my deepest exercises

as a father of 3s is to constantly praise them. And not praise them for the pointless,
but praise them when the opportunity to praise is there, and not to forget it.
It's one of those things about the 3 experience. So when you have an alpha that
knows no praise, you know that they‟re going to use praise one way or another. And
they will. And there is this tendency in the 6 to hypocrisy and the hypocrisy inherent
in being a false praiser. It can be very devastating for people. In most cases these
6/2s end up suffering more than anything else.

The 6/3
LAC Alpha 1
I like the 6/3 on this cross. I like it in the sense that because it's looking away to the
end of the process, it‟s looking over and it sees the 33 there, it says, instead of
spending all this time trying to force people to follow me, because that‟s what the
praise thing is about—remember, don't just take my black sense of humor—I play
with the not-self, I want you to see the darkness of this quarter, because in the not-
self it is truly a dark quarter. And yet, to realize something, something that I
understand, if I don't praise you in one way or another, it‟s more and more difficult
for you. Praise helps. It helps. It helps if you're trying to influence people. It
helps, it really does. We know that. Otherwise, we wouldn‟t be there. It works.
It‟s the false praise. It's the manipulative praise. And of course, those things are
inherent in this cross. So, somebody isn‟t correct, they‟re influenced by the not-self
mind, then this becomes an aspect that‟s very uncomfortable. And yet, if it's
correct, there are real advantages to that. This is, after all, the angle of positive
affirmation. This is positive reinforcement. What was his name in the States—
Norman Vincent Peale—positive reinforcement, positive, positive, positive even if it
was false. This is this principle at work, and people know that thinking positively is a
lovely thing. It is. It's a lot easier on your spirit than thinking negatively. The not-
self is better off if it thinks about nice things.
So, the 6/3 looks at all of this false praise, realizes itself that it makes so many
mistakes that it's so pessimistic about what praise is anyway. Finally, all it can really
see is the only way to lead is to take action. The only way to really lead is simply to
recognize that it is the life experience that is the leader. It‟s how we move through
life that creates the true alphas, the true forces. And it is only those that can show
us a way through the minefields of life so that we can go through unscarred that
really deserves to be an influence.
Remember that the 31 influence is logical, that the praise is praised rooted in you
completed the pattern; we‟re going to praise you. You're trying to complete the
pattern; we‟re going to praise you. You‟re struggling to complete the pattern; we‟re
going to praise you. But the 33 isn't about patterns. It's about experience, only
experience.

Introduction
The 33 isn‟t about patterns, it‟s about experience; only experience. If you have
something in front of you in your life, something you have to move through in your
life, and you are offered two teachers, one that will give you a theoretical possibility
of what will happen and one that will speak from their experience, almost all of us,
except for the contrarians would go with the experiential teacher. Now, remember in
the diversity, we will have those that will reject it and say, okay, what‟s the theory?
The fact is that the majority of us want an experienced leader.
You see that in politics. We‟re very, very nervous about can we trust somebody who
hasn't have experience. And of course, that becomes a problem of that maybe
they‟ve had too much experience. But whatever the case may be, it's very important
to see that the only way that you can measure leadership is through the lens of
experience, and that's what brings us to the 33 and to the final turn of our quarter.
The Right Angle Cross of the Four Ways for me is such a beautiful cross. And if you
look, those of you who like really interesting things, you will see that if you go to the
left angle, the left angle variations of the Cross of the Four Ways, their four arms are
not in the four quarters. That's something to think about. If you look at the left
angle here you will see that the four arms are not in the four quarters, but I‟ll talk
about that in a moment.
Remember that the ending of a quarter is always the Four Ways, and it's leading into
a specific focus on a certain way. The left angles here are very unusual, and limited,
in a sense, because of their configuration. But let's look at the right angle first.
The way of the 33, of all of the many, many gates that I look at and the gates that I
look at in relationship to my own experience as a being, I owe so much to the
genetics of the 33. It is a fascinating gate to me. It is a gate of the retreat, but it is
a gate that is truly the close of the human experiential way. It begins with the 41
and it ends with the 33. It‟s interesting for me because those are the only abstract
gates I have, which is the beginning and the end of this human process.
And what‟s so obvious to me from the perspective of the 33 is that it's only the 33,
again it‟s relative and subjective, it is only the 33 that really has the ability to codify
the past. This is a gate of remembering. It is a gate at some mystical level of
revelation, that is, a remembrance that transcends the mundane. But it's so
important to see that everything about the nature of the experiential way, when I
talk about how you need to be in the serendipity, you need to be in the existential on
the experiential way in order to benefit later through reflection, well, here‟s a
reflection.
This is the channel of the prodigal, not the alpha. The alpha says, look, I‟m going to
lead you theoretically into the future. And the prodigal says I‟m going to tell you
what happened to me in the past. The message of the prodigal is much more
important than the leadership of the alpha. We need to learn very carefully. It's not

about the theory, it‟s about the practice. It's the practice. We don‟t get a chance to
test our alpha leaders. We don't. We get stuck with them for four or five years, and
when we've really buggered up, we‟ve really buggered up and we have deal with it;
no test periods. After they‟ve been power a little while, we can look back and say,
ah, they‟re terrible leaders. This is the risk of leader, the logical leader.
So the 33 is very important in this context and because it‟s a throat gate, I guess it's
the thing that I like about it the most. 13s are funny. If you have the 13th gate and
you've got a secret, no one may ever know. And 33s don‟t like that. 33s like to
share secrets; 33s likes to get the secret out. It's the part about the 33 that I really
like. And it says, until we get all of it out we‟ll never be able to recognized who are
the right alphas, what is the right way.

The 1/3
So when we're looking at the 1/3 we are beginning a process of reflection and
nothing is better than being a 1 on a reflected cross; how nice. You can study and
study and study, you can be in a
perfect retreat, all of that is
wonderful except remembering that
at some point you‟ve got to deliver.
It‟s one of the difficult things about
having activations either in the alpha
or the prodigal, because they‟re
expressions of processes. It's
demanded that you get it out. The
rest of the collective demands it.
They're expecting you to deliver.
The 1/3 obviously is going to have
its mistakes. And remember
something about the Cross of the
Four Ways; it‟s bringing you to a
point of transition. These are
bridging gates. You‟re going to see
that because when you get into the
left angle you really see the bridge.
This is a bridging process. It isn‟t so
much about a way at all when you see it in somebody as an individual through the
activation of their Sun. That personality takes on its own quality.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 2
A Digital Book for Students
So, as we‟ve gone through and we‟ve seen from October until now, how different the
right angle crosses can be according to quarter, here you have a very, very, very
powerful distinction. These are very much retreat beings, which means that the
right angle is deeply, deeply absorbed and that the 2s in the right angle are almost
hidden. They‟re really deep in retreat. It‟s very hard to get access to them.
And yet, at the same time what you‟re dealing with is a font of—the 33rd gate goes
on a journey and it takes photographs and it takes photographs in order to be able
to reflect on the journey later. You could call that history, you could call that
sentimentality, you could call it all kinds of things. In our day and age, it is an
enormous potential that is open to these beings. In other words, in retreat and in
isolation they have access to the font of human stuff, all of the things that are going
on out there. And they are able to reflect, not simply on their own experience, but
the multitude of experiences that they can see.
1/3s have to be nurtured towards discovering differences in memory. And this is
what they're here to show us. If we are diverse and we are unique and we are
differentiated then there is no single history; it doesn't exist. It's why collecting the
collective history is essential. And that the more contributions we to history—for
example, the 20th century is better understood than any other century in history.
We have not simply artifacts. We have captured on devices the actual life itself. We
have a tremendous capacity to take an overview of a society of civilization, a culture
and to be able to see all it in all of its strengths and to reflect on larger movements.
It‟s like our ability with satellites now to see weather four or five days away. We
have the ability now with the density of our historical material to begin to get much
broader overviews of the way in which movements work in a planetary way in a
global way. This is what the 1/3 on this cross discovers.
The very first thing it discovers is that when it's about five or six years old that it
really has those cognitive skills that it comes back from the park with its mother and
there‟s somebody at the house and the mother is telling about something about what
happened in the park and the child realizes that the mother is not telling what it
remembers. And not because the mother is lying, it‟s that there are things that the
mother didn't see. It is things that she didn't mention. And the 1/3 child goes, is
she lying? Why didn‟t you mention that you fell down? It‟s like, why did you leave
that out?
And of course, what happens to these children is that they never trust other people's
memories. You meet a Sun in 33 and you tell them something that happened to
you. It‟s like, okay, sure, right, let‟s move on now. They learn so quickly that you
can‟t trust what anybody tells you. And out of that, if they study, if they get into it,
they begin to see that you need to have many different perspectives. Now in the
sense of mathematics, because we have science and discovery with 3rd lines, you
begin to see that in order to be able to measure an object at great distance you need
to triangulate. You need to have different perspectives, and then by having different
perspectives you can finally get a measurement. It‟s very important to the way in
which our consciousness developed.

The 1/4
RAC Four Ways 2
The 1/4 here is very stuck. We know that there is always a resistance in the 4, this
fixedness that is inherent in their nature. The difficulty is that they do not see that
other memories are valid. It‟s like the 1/3 child when the mother remembers
something that the child remembers differently it assumes that either the mother is
wrong or the mother is lying. But when the mother remembers something, the 1/4
will actually give up its version and go with the main version. Oh, no dear, you
didn‟t remember that correctly, the number was 999-9996; even if it‟s wrong.
I see 1/4s as being a very, very difficult childhood, because you‟re so dependent on
what your parents are like. You‟re not like a 3. I never worry about 3s with their
parents because they know their parents are idiots right from the beginning. They
figure it out right away. But the 4s never figure out until much later in life that their
parents were idiots. It takes them a long time. And it's crushing when they find out,
because that's not what they figured. They were going along with the platform.
They were going along with okay, this is all right. And suddenly they discover, oh
my god, he was such an idiot.
The 33rd gate is one of the most important of all of our memory gates. It's the
culmination of our memory process. You have memory running from the 54 through
the 32 to 44 up to the 26; it‟s a very important memory circuit. You have memory
in the 11/56. But the memory that‟s here in the 33/13, this is the essential memory.

The 2/4
RAC Four Ways 2
The 2/4s don‟t let you know, they keep it all to themselves. They don‟t want to let
you know. They keep their own personal little perspective about how anything
happened in the past. They‟re not looking to share it with you, they‟ll go about their
business in their 2/4 mode, not caring at all, and then finally somebody calls them
out, and they will try as best they can to control and influence you as to that specific
memory.
If you ever wonder where I get my generalized descriptions for some of these things,
the way in which I talk about the 2/4s being a missionary, oh is this ever the
missionary here. They can remember what they weren't even alive to remember.
They‟re the ones that will hold on to the memory that Jesus was walking along the
road to Damascus, and they‟ll remember that. And nothing is going to change that
memory about what happened in the past. How many weirdoes do we have on the
planet that want to tell us about all the extraordinary things that happen before any
of us could even write. I'm fascinated by that, this creation of memory.

And one of the things that we begin to see about the abstract process is that when
we don't have memories about things, we invent them. We invent them; please
hear that, we invent them. In other words, we make stuff up. That‟s us, we make
stuff up. We really do, all the time. It's so human. We make stuff up. We
embellish, we add. How easy it is to make something up, to try to fill in the gap, to
try to get something across. We make it up. We make up supporting stories for our
memory. We make up false memories as support for other false memories. If
you're looking for the depths of memory manipulation, you‟re here.
Now, of course I describe it with that tone and you think how decrepit and terrible
and awful, let‟s have them shot at dawn. This is the movie. It‟s the way that it
works; otherwise, it wouldn‟t be there in the program. We have many mythological
characters in our history, whether they are religious figures, whether they‟re
explorers, conquerors, this and that. We know nothing about these beings. We
know nothing about them, and we create these whole memories of them. We try to
actually them by creating false memories. We‟re so good at lying.
As a teacher, I learned years ago when I worked with kids, how creative children are
in making excuses. It‟s wonderful to be able to create such excuses. The one thing
that you have to be concerned about with the 2/4 is they‟re going to take their
subjective memory and try to make it the law. This is the way it was, this is the only
way that it was, which means this is the way it‟s going to be. That‟s the trip. This is
the way it was.
It's so fascinating for me that people praise creatures like Herodotus. He was an
ancient historian. One guy, probably had syphilis, lice, slightly deranged, lived in a
hovel-like corner of some edifice, he wrote the history of the ancient world. We have
people that believe all that stuff. You have had students of history who have studied
this guy forever, and yes, I'm sure that he heard stories, Mediterranean cultures,
sailors come in and they tell you a story. He had all these stories and we accept it
as history. One guy, some weirdo somewhere, and the whole planet is going:

really don‟t do that. What they‟re very, very, very good at is smashing holes in your
memory. This is one of these gates where the 2/5 Buddha here is really one of these
bubble piercers, blow up your bubble, blow up your bubble with remembering
something differently. The 2/5 can really be dangerous. There you are sitting there
telling some story, and you're going along and you‟re enthralling everybody and
suddenly the 2/5 said, wait a minute, you didn‟t do that. On Wednesday you were
with me. Oh, you want to kill these people, instantly.

Don't call them out, after you‟ve had your canoeing trip with them, don‟t invite them
to the bar to discuss it with others, because you won‟t be able to say anything all
night. The moment you start to talk about it they‟ll keep correcting you. No, no, no
we didn‟t do that first; we actually put the tens up. And then we went down, we
didn't do that, actually, don't you remember—shut up. It gets to the point where
you will never go with them anywhere again. That sends the 2/5 back to their house
and closes the shutters. It's not worth it.
Human beings just don't know what's happening to them. They‟re so stupid they
don't even remember. It is one of the great ironies are me that you can have a
traffic accident, a very simple fender bender in front of 10 people and every single
one of them is going to give you a different version; a same bloody event right in
front of them. No, no, first he went; no, no I saw; no, no I saw that. The 2/5 says I
don‟t want to be a part of that.
You have a 2/5 standing on a street corner and a car accident happens and they
immediately turn their back and walk away. They don‟t want to be caught. They
don‟t want to be the one that has to be the witness. They don‟t want to deal with
that. The policeman asks what happened. And they answer, and the policeman
says, are you sure. Right away there‟s trouble. I was here, I saw it. You didn‟t see
it; just write down what I'm saying. And then the driver gets out of the car who has
been accused by the 2/5 that they were responsible. And they accuse the 2/5 of not
seeing what happened. And the 2/5 takes the gun out of the policeman‟s holster and
shoots the driver.
Don‟t invite them anywhere. Leave them at home. Don't let them see anything.
They‟re probably blessed if they‟re born blind. No, I don‟t mean that. They actually
get so cruel. The not-self is so open to cruelty, it really is, delicious cruelty. These
people are wonderful. You can have a real satori experience with someone like this.
There you are in the middle of your glory and they go (sound like a drill). They‟re
perfect.
But they learn very young, (shhhhhhhh), because their first victims are their
parents. And they learn right away that if you‟re going to correct your parents
you‟re in trouble. The prodigal has a problem. The prodigal grows up realizing it
doesn't fit in. It‟s an archetype. It goes off into the world. It comes back as an
authority, an experiential authority. And when it comes back it expects everybody to
listen to its perspective, because it knows what they don't. It has experienced what
they have not. That crack from the 2/5 can be a great, great shatterer.
But in most cases, you know what‟s going to happen in their childhood. They‟re

and when you leave, what they're thinking about you, you don't want to know. You
really don‟t, it would be seriously depressing.

The 3/5
RAC Four Ways 2
We owe a lot to the 3/5s in this particular configuration because they're the ones
who have enough nerve to say that somebody has lied about memory. In other
words, they're the ones that cut through the propaganda; they‟re the ones that strip
away the false background material. They‟re the ones that dig underneath the
surface to see what really happened. They‟re very powerful in that way.
Nothing is more important to a 3/5, nothing in the end, is more important to a 3/5
than success. Of all the profiles you look at, no profile is more fucked up in the
success movie than the 3/5s. It is what they deeply want. After all, they are 5s
underneath; they recognize that others consider them to be worthy, that there is
something inherent within them that could satisfy that perspective. And yet, at the
same time they go through the process of failing. They go through the process of
having their reputation diminished. And in that, success for them seems to be the
only grail.
The great success here is in recognizing that most successes often you can see that
they‟ve been manipulated, that there is funny stuff in the background, that not all of
what appears to be a success is really a success. And not all of what you‟re told you
should be doing which you are messing up is actually correct, because that's
somebody else's perspective.
Here is an inherent challenge, it‟s just a basic, basic challenge that the 3/5 brings
and it says, let‟s see if by looking at all of these memories, if we can see what the
truth really is, and in finding the truth, eliminate not only the lies, but attack the
liars. Get them back, vengeance. Paranoia leads to vengeance. The 5 likes
vengeance. It‟s a nice idea. It‟s one of the most difficult things for me to do in my
process is not to indulge in vengeance. And I don't want to get a taste for it; much
too powerful for that game. It gets real nasty.
But I understand the principle. If you‟re a 3/5 and you‟ve been whacked around, it
would be nice to get your vengeance back. It would be nice to get in there and give
them a good kick. And of course, the first ones that suffer from the vengeance of
the 3/5 on this cross are the parents. These are very contentious relationships.

The 3/6
RAC Four Ways 2
The 3/6 is only interested in one thing. With all the pessimism, with all the trial and
error, what they‟re truly interested in, which makes them very unique, is that they're
curious about what the truth is. There are very few places in the wheel where the
truth is important, which one would think is odd. But then again, the moment that

Retreat
you think that's odd, you‟re not very realistic. The 3/6 ends up looking for truth and
ends up looking for truth with no expectation of finding it, none. They‟re deeply
pessimistic that there is no truth.
In the last 25 years I have read very, very, very few books. As a freak I don't like
being influenced inside my head. I don‟t like hearing the inner voice of the reader in
my head. I was stranded in Bavaria in a snowstorm and couldn't get to a tour date
that I had. There was all kinds of time on my hands and in those days I would travel
with a guitar, but I didn‟t have any music, the guitar was being fixed. And I was
staying in a house of the late Jurgen who I worked with in Germany for many years.
He comes into the room where I was staying, he had a lot of books in the room, and
he says to me, I know you don't like to read, but try this, this is interesting, you‟ll
like it. he gave me Krishnamurti‟s diary of the latter years of his life that he spent in
California in San Luis Obispo, and he was suffering deeply, deeply, deeply from
migraines, incredible pain.
I have a kinship to that, he was a 43/23, 8/1, 12/22, a pure individual freak, single
definition freak. And so I read this diary of his. And at some point in into the book
in all of his pain and discomfort, a real 3 quality, he gets to the intellectual grasp of
no choice. I understand the limitation of my own intelligence. Had I not met the
Voice, I never would have known no choice. I never would've gotten there
intellectually on my own because frankly I wouldn't have cared. It was extraordinary
to me that this being was able to penetrate through the false memory of the totality
to penetrate to an essential truth, the essential truth that there is no choice, that it is
all a matter of choicelessness.
Now, this was the potential magic of the 3/6 in this configuration. The whole thing is
that through the very pain itself, to be able to find an essence of truth, not the
fractal of truth, but the essence of truth, because what‟s the point of teaching
Human Design if I couldn‟t show you the absolute, no point. No value to this
knowledge unless you recognize that it is an absolute of the maya. So, it becomes
an essential truth in and of itself. That‟s what it is. And no matter whether you have
an analyst here or an analyst there, whether they're good or not, whether they're
educated or not, the description they're going to give to a configuration is going to
be basically the same because it's based on an essential truth and formula. It's not
about subjectivity other than in terms of performance.
So, the 3/6 at this level, on this cross, out of pain—the not-self, it‟s one of the tricky
things. It‟s like should you really wake up a Sleeping Phoenix. There are certain
configurations where you look at it and you say hey, maybe we‟re all better off if this
just stays not-self for awhile, because it‟s useful. That 3/6 pain leads to the demand
for essential, non-shifting absolutes. Where are the absolutes? This is what it‟s all
about. Where are the absolutes?
I have the 33.6; I resonate so deeply to this. Where‟s the absolute? No absolute? I
don‟t want to learn anything that isn‟t an absolute. And of course, nothing has ever
been. That's what makes Human Design so interesting. To be an absolute of illusion

is such a trick. It‟s so wonderful. It‟s the only place where you can have an

The 4/6
RAC Four Ways 2
The 4/6s are synthesizers of memory. They make good historians. It doesn't mean
they're not prejudiced. Remember that the 4/6 is always going to have the dilemma
of the 4/3 phase in which the collective memories that they gather, in other words,
information they gather from others, that what they synthesize there could be a very
slanted perspective. But their real influence over the group is the ability to be able
to forge the group memory. These are people that do class reunions, these kinds of
people where 20 years later you get a letter that says that we‟re all going to meet
again.
And it‟s so interesting that the memory that you have of that milieu and the horror of
what it could turn out to be. But this is very much a 4/6 trip. It's very much this not
so much what the personal memory is, but what was the flavor of the memory of the
time, of the moment. So, they‟re very good for us in terms of providing us with
generalized truths.
Remember that the responsibility of this gate is to present the truth to the collective.
Think about that. You go through the logical process, and when you get to the 31 all
you're getting to is the presentation of a theory you should follow. You get to the 33
and 33 is going to be the evidence of whether that works. It‟s the 33 that has the
final word. It‟s the 33 that says, ok, this is good; this is bad, this is right, this is
wrong.
4/6s on this cross are very powerful. They‟re the ones that are saying, well, you
know what it was like; basically what our community feels, based on the way in
which we see our history. And you always have these beings that become the
influential spokespersons for these small groupings. They become the example.
They become the spokesperson. They‟re the ones that the group turns to to describe
the group memory. It is the essential way, the way of form.

When you leave the right angle here, you leave the form principle. Oh yes I know
we're still dealing with the 33 and we‟re still dealing with this configuration, but there

is a unique transition that takes place here. Now, if you look very carefully at the
left angle you‟re going to see something. What you‟re going to see is that the 1st
hexagram and the 19 are part of the same quarter. And if you look down here, the
2nd and the 33rd are part of the same quarter. It's the beginning and the end of the
quarter.
In other words, you're looking at something very odd. You're looking at the only
examples of crosses that have only binary quarters that they operate through. And
that they do not operate through the four quarters. So if you have this left angle
cross, you have to see that this left angle cross is deeply rooted in the Quarter of
Civilization and deeply rooted in Mutation. It has nothing to do with the Duality on
one side and the Initiation on the
other side. Nothing; it has no grasp
of it, has no connection to it.
And yet, that‟s the way it‟s going.
These quarters break. It‟s like when
the great designer decided to make
a wheel, they didn't make a wheel,
they made four quarters and then
they sort of fit them beside each
other. But it's not like this at all.
This is an illusion. There's a real
break there. It‟s almost like you
could tear out a quarter.
The quarter that you come in on is
really exclusive. These quarters are
really different, very different. I
hope to be able to substantiate that
when it comes to cosmic principles
of the life pattern that we actually
operate through not a double helix, but a quadruple helix. Very clearly these
quarters, and this a something that I understand from my work in sequencing that
the Cross of the Four Ways are boundaries and beginning points in sequencing. And
that each of these quarters is a family of incarnating life very separate from others.
Oh yes, we have the movement, but I want you to see how clear a break it is.
If you look at this left angle and you saw that this left angle was within its own
quarter and the next quarter only, you would say, aha, here‟s a real bridge. Uh-uh,
this is not a real bridge. This is a real crevasse. This is almost like a cavern. In
fact, they are not fused together; they rub against each other as a friction. If you
could look at the four quarters, every time a planet moves across the cusp of a
quarter, it goes like this (sound). Oh, they are really different and it's only when you
get to the left angle that you can see it.
We know that all juxtaposition has a fixedness to it. We know that. And we know
that juxtaposition without motivation simply represents the process of the hexagram.
So, one of the things to see about this 33 is, it's screaming: go into retreat; nothing

else but retreat. Now, it‟s a 4th line, it doesn't have the left angle perspective. It
doesn't notice that when you're looking at the house across the way, there‟s no path.
There is just this friction field. So, it‟s there at a point that says: so far, no further.
Retreat within yourself, retreat into your own memory. This is the loneliest cross we
have. You cannot find a lonelier cross than this juxtaposition. It can be so alone.
Remember that the nature of the retreat is that the collective is social. The
collective is about sharing. There is no proper remembering without having been
open empathically to sharing, to taking in, both your own experience, your own
memory, that of others. Here you have a 4/1 that just says, look, I just want to
withdraw from all of that. Now, mystically that's very nice. Mystically there is a
potential, like it all 4 lines, there is the potential of being able to enter into a very
special place within oneself. That‟s a 4/1. It says, can we have a break on this
pressure of moving around. Let‟s have a break now. I'm not really ready for what‟s
over there. I'm not. I'm just going to retreat.

The 5/1
I like this left angle. It‟s such a nice name: Refinement. Look at what is over on the
other side. It‟s the 7th gate. And what we‟re going to notice when we go to the
other side is that we‟re going to lose a lot more yin-ness. We‟re going to add
another yang line. It‟s very
different. It‟s very different energy;
it‟s a very different force. We're
going to move into personal role in
a realm of duality. And the friction
that lies there at that boundary, this
is refinement boundary, at the
simplest level it's are you going to
be male or female in your role; at
the simplest level.
In other words, we‟re going to enter
into the realm of Duality.
Remember, we have seen all of
these roles without any gender
quality. If you want to find gender
you go back to Initiation in the 3rd
gate. There‟s no gender here in this
whole build up. And then all of a
sudden you get to the edge and it‟s

like, what kind of form am I going to be in this? How am I going to play the duality
game? And the duality game is in the 7th gate. It starts in the 7th gate, the role
gate. Oh, you have no idea how incredibly dualistic this is. So this boundary, there
is this refinement process. And the whole thing is the preparation for entering into
the friction.
The 5/1 refinement, basically what it says is that many women are going to be
refined into remembering differently. And oh boy, do they ever. If you could really
get a man and a woman to remember how they met, there‟s nothing more hilarious
than hearing those two versions. There is nothing, nothing funnier than those
versions. As a matter of fact, by the time they're finished telling their version you
wonder if they actually met. This refinement is not what you think it is. This is the
establishment within the form of the way in which memory is going to work. Not
only is memory going to be something that defines us, but memory is going to work
dualistically.
In other words, we‟re going to have two very different kinds of memory systems
based on two very different kinds of processes. Any couple that has had a child, and
you want to have a memory of the birth of that child, you obviously are going to see
how different the memories are. You can‟t imagine how different those memories
are between the women and the man in that particular process. They‟re totally
different.
And this is one of the things what the duality business is all about. Everything about
duality is about how we deal with memory. How do we deal with memory? If you
live with somebody long enough, you have done enough things to each other that if
you added them all up and kept them as a memory every day you couldn't stay
together. It‟s one of the things about the memory system. And the first law of
duality, the first law of pair bonding is that you have selective memory. And that
you have selective memory that is rooted in differentiated perspectives.
Isn‟t that odd? What a refinement that is, the way the not-self works. The not-self
is so open, the not-self is conditioned genetically to be attracted to what it's not, so
it takes what it's not. Those two don't see any experience in the same way; they
can‟t. And they don't see experiences as themselves; they can‟t. So they learn that
in order to be able to stay together they have to learn how to forget.
And so, this is where we are when we get to the end of the trail here, that it‟s not
just about building form principles, it‟s also about forgetting about them. It's not
just about collecting memories. It's about forgetting memories. And it's one of
those essential ingredients. If you are truly going to enter into the duality business
you better know how to censor your memory system.
Every couple knows that there are things that they do not reveal as their
remembrance. You know that. You know how pissed off you can get if your partner
remember something from eight years ago. It‟s what it's all about. What I love
most of all about the program is that it just shows you the “this and that” of what it
is, what the whole thing is. After all, we‟re not all running around trying to have this
total memory, this total recognition of the truth, most of us don't care. Most of us

would like to forget most of the things that have gone on in our lives that were
unpleasant, that we don't want to be reminded of, that we don't want anybody else
reminding us of it, we don‟t want to remind ourselves of it.
And in isolation in the form principle as principal, if you‟re going to be a scientist, it's
okay to remember everything do it correctly. But if you‟re going to live with the
witch of the North, learn how to forget. If you‟re going to live with some brutal
beast, it‟s better to forget. Don‟t remember all that stuff. It‟s so wonderful when
you grow up that you forget most of the things that your parents did. It‟s such a
relief. And it‟s built into the form principle.

You say to them, do you want to do past life therapy? No, I do not. I don‟t even

It‟s such a funny thing. I‟m so glad that I don't have to consciously remember
things. I just have this kind of an unconscious mind. But I see what it is for people
how uncomfortable they become when they forget. I can't remember the name of,
what's the name of, and on and on. And yet, forgetting is one of the most important
healing agents we have. If you‟re going to live in the world of form, you have to
know how to forget.

And the example of this is the 6/2. They are great. They are the archetypal
example of forgetfulness. They‟re perfect. They walk out of a room; they don‟t even
know they were in one and don‟t care. They‟re perfect. It‟s almost this existential
perfection because they‟re so good at forgetting. These are the kind of people that
by the time they enter into school they realize that when summer vacation is over
they‟ve forgotten everything they learned before. And they‟re horrified it‟s going to
catch up on them. And it‟s not that they have bad memories; they do not. Oh, they
remember ever face of every man that put them there. And they remember every
mistake you ever made. There is an unbelievable arrogance that is there because
they know all that. And basically they would like to forget it.
If you want to have a relationship with them, don‟t make any mistakes. And it‟s not
like they will tell you. They will try to forget that you‟re useless, but they don‟t have
a bad memory. They remember you‟re useless. And the only way they can be
spared from your uselessness is if you don‟t show up any more so that they can
forget that you ever existed. They are a classic of this. Every 6/2 has a touch of
this.

The 6/3
LAC Refinement 1
If you‟re going to be a 6/3 and you‟re going to be on this cross, there is something
that really haunts you. You don't know anything about initiation or duality. You
don't. And you‟re so close to it. But it‟s not like being one of these other gates in
the track that‟s looking over and it can just move. There is this chasm that‟s there.
There is a risk.
You can‟t hide. You have to deal with the other. Not only do you have to deal with
the other, you have to be truly intimate with the other. You have to make more.
You have to live together. The 6/3 stands there and says can I go back? Can we
just stay here, here on the form side and not get into the individuality business,
because that would really be nice. Is it okay? No, no, no.
And what you see in all 6/3s is that they have this toe-dipping. They love to dip
their toes into the next hexagram. They spend most of their lives dipping their toes
into the next hexagram. But when you do this here and you‟ve just for a little
second, the moment you do that, there‟s one of these others right in your face.
You can‟t escape them. And in that moment, you must have a role. When you're
looking at the first half of the wheel—we‟ve gone through the first half of the wheel—
the first half of the wheel only establishes the principles, the yang and the yin
principles. They‟re just basic principles. You come into the world. You come into a
world of mind. You come into a world of mental plane where life is fulfilled through
mental purpose. But the mind can only be established in the form, the mind can
only be established when there's brain. You‟re dealing with two basic principles of
the energy and the matter.
Now, what we get to see is what happens when you bring them together. And when
we finally get to the end of our process we will get to see the byproduct of their
being together. But in Duality, we see these two forces trying to find a way to be
one, trying to find a way to be a cell that can then re-divide again, this whole
reproductive process.
So the 6/3 standing on the edge here is facing a real void. And of course, what you
meet in most 6/3s on this cross is a deep, deep reticence to bond with the other. In
other words, this great fear in that. They can end up having a life of celibacy, they
can end up having a life in which they have very, very little consequential contact
with the opposite sex, because the risk is wow, you have to leave the retreat behind.
You have to enter into the world of role, in which you have to play a part counter
another. There is no life without the other. We‟re always dealing with the other.
So, here in the 6/3 it‟s quite a jump.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 3
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Every quarter starts with a Sphinx, every quarter ends with a cross and arm of the
Four Ways. We begin with the 7th gate. Obviously, whenever you‟re dealing with the
Sphinx you're dealing with gates that carry disproportionate analytical value because
they are in fact role gates, gates that we use to be able to identify genetic continuity
in the mapping. And whenever you look at the 7th gate, you can see immediately
that the 7th gate carries enormous influence in the way in which we structure our
very analysis of lines, much more so than the 13, much more so than the 1 and the
2, much more so than the others, because this is after all a logical gate in a logical
circuit and everything about logic is about the future and about securing our place in
the future and this is the role of leading us securely into the future.
Each and every one of the lines, authoritarian, democrat, anarchist, advocate,
general, administrator that each of those six lines we well know are automatically
attached to the way in which we do overview in terms of line analysis. We know that
all 1st lines are authoritarian, every student is taught this. So, it is one of the things
to see about the nature of the 7th gate is the 7th gate is the logical equivalent to the
10th gate. The 10th gate is the gate of behavior, that is, the gate of behavior in the
world. And collective behavior is shaped and molded by the 7th gate; all collective
behavior.
As a collective gate everything about being in the role of a leader is the need to be
able to share that role. In other words, to be able to have those in the collective
sense that will act as followers. Now, this is very much a 3rd color motivation. This
is all about the follower and the leader and this is about the power trip and the
power trip is inherent in the 7th gate. It‟s built into it. You cannot miss it, it‟s there.
But the whole thing about the collective process is that the power trip has to be
something that is collectively supported. In other words, that there have to be other
that are willing to follow it. No followers no leader; you cannot be a leader in a
vacuum. You can not be a leader without followers.
So, this is the key at the beginning of what it means to be in the Quarter of Duality.
That at the very beginning everything about Duality is about followers and leaders,
and all the struggles that we have gender relationship, the struggles that we have in
hierarchical social environments, all of this begins with the theme of the 7th gate.
There are leaders and there are followers. You can't all be chiefs; you can't all be
Indians. It does not work that way. There is a leader and there are followers.
Now, one of the things to realize is that if we go beyond individual design and we
take into consideration the nature penta, you will see that all of humanity in the way
in which it‟s designed is it‟s designed to follow a leader. This is the nature of
humanity. We are designed to follow leaders, which means that amongst us that for
every six people being born in the world one of them could be a leader. It‟s also
something to think about.
But it's so important to see that the 7th gate confuses all of our personal relationships
and immediately creates a situation where no matter where you look in any bond,

the bond is not fair or equal. I don't care how good your relationship is with your
other. You know and I know that it's not fair or equal, and it never will be, nor can it
be and that is one of our illusions.
One of our illusions is that we can have the “soul mate” relationship. Well, I prefer
that you see that as a relationship between your personality crystal your design
crystal. You‟re more likely to find your soul mate inside than you're ever going to
find it outside. Maybe rave children will find that, but then again, they‟re going to
have to change the American laws about marriage when that comes along. It's bad
enough that they have problems with same gender structures, wait until they have
to deal with 5s. So the 7th gate screws it all up. I want you to know that right from
the beginning.

The 1/3
Think about what it‟s like to be a 1/3 on this cross. You have your Sun in the 7th
gate. You have an Authoritarian personality, are a deep pessimist underneath.
And you think about your
relationship with the other. As a
follower, you‟re going to be so
annoyed. I can‟t follow this idiot;
they don‟t know what they're doing.
And as a 1/3 you know they don‟t
know what they‟re doing. You can
smell it, you can taste it, you can
feel it, you bang into it. You know
precisely what's the matter.
And of course, you have to
understand what it means to be an
anarchist. Oh, I love the line of
anarchy. It‟s wonderful; but
misunderstood, though. The whole
thing about anarchy is that the
anarchist is here to destroy forms
that don't work. But the problem
with the anarchist is they never
know how to replace it. They know
how to tear things down; they don‟t know how to build. It‟s their success. If they
just tear things down, they‟re great. The moment they tear it down and they say “I
know what's better,” boy are they in trouble.

Now, think about what that means psychologically in terms of the Sun in the 7th
gate. These are beings that are absolutely impossible to lead. You can‟t lead these
people. You, too, Brutus? (sound) They don‟t lead these people. They‟ll pretend
that you can lead them for awhile, but they have to be the boss. And either they're
going to be the authoritarian boss, and as we'll see the 7 in its relationships, the
democratic boss. Don't think because it's democratic that it isn't going to carry this
follower/leader. And you can see because of the nature of the binary there are 1/3s
that will power as followers to a leader. Who will be afraid, will be overwhelmed who
in their pessimism will say, better this dog than another one, better the villain I know
that the villain I don't know.
Or the 1/3 on the other side and you can see what happens that in a personal
relationship. The 1/3 Sphinx Sun in 7th gate in a relationship, they're going to be
either deeply, deeply resentful of having to have surrendered to being a follower or
they're going to be enormously demanding and impossible as a leader. 1/3s by their
very nature are heavy people. They are the heaviest of all profiles. It‟s lower
trigram, it‟s only lower trigram. And in saying heavy, this is not a moral negative
judgment. It's about weight. They‟re heavier. They‟re more serious. They‟re more
pessimistic than anybody else. They have been more wounded than anybody else.
They bang themselves more often than anybody else. They‟re so distrustful.
You say to a 1/3 “good morning,” to get them to smile as a response—well, I don't
know if it's really going to be a good morning. I can remember days where I said
good morning with a smile and then things went wrong. What‟s this “good
morning?” What do you know about good mornings? I want to tell you how many
lousy mornings I have. It‟s all in the psychology. It‟s all there. They‟re heavy,
they‟re serious. You say to them “wow,” and they go “yeah?” They‟re great for
force-feeding them something to see whether it kills them or not, because they're
great judges of those things. But you don't want that force-fed you as your
relationship.
So you end up meeting the other and you‟re a 7, you‟re a 1/3 on this cross and you
have no other way to deal with them, but to be the authoritarian. There's no other
way, if you're not in charge you‟re going to be deeply insecure. It doesn't mean you
will be in charge. But that's the role you're going to be looking for, it‟s the role that's
going to seem to fit.
Now, we understand the nature of role within the context of Design. That role is
something that you can only live out off you‟re operating correctly as yourself. It's
all right to be a 1/3 this cross if you're correct. You are going to be insecure. As a
matter of fact, you‟re going to look for a way within your role to have a secure
foundation for your relationship, that you will know many things about that
relationship. And you're not going to be somebody who is going to be naïve. There
are great values in being a 1/3.

The 1/4
RAC Sphinx 3
When you're dealing with 1/4s you‟re always dealing with a different phenomenon.
We are dealing with a real power to give direction; after all it‟s the Sphinx. There is
nothing more powerful in the ability to be able to give direction at a personal level
than the 4. And one of things to see very clearly about this quarter is that if you've
got a 4th line profile in the gates of this quarter, you‟re much better equipped to
handle the vagaries of what goes on in duality. And this has to do with the basic
skills that the 4th line brings genetically. That is, the social capacity, the
brotherhood/sisterhood, the ability to influence familiars, the ability to have
opportunities through those that you know, that this very basic social quality of the
4th line brings many advantages in this quarter.
This is one of the cases where you‟re going to see that the 1/3 child and the 1/4
child that in the previous quarters are radically different from each other in the sense
that the 1/3 is actually better equipped than the 1/4, here you actually have the
reverse of that. In other words, when you're looking at the basic relationship
between the 1/3 child and the 1/4 child, both of them need to have a solid
foundation, but only the 1/3 child is going to challenge their parents if something
goes wrong. And the 4th line child will actually ignore it as best they can and gloss
over it, because that's not what they're interested in. They‟re only interested in
being able to influence others with the foundation. They're not interested in seeing
whether or not the foundation actually works.
So, one of things to see about the social mechanics is that the 1/3 on this cross is
much more pessimistic about bonding, naturally more pessimistic. They're the ones
that immediately pick up the problems in their parents relationship. From the time
they come out of the womb they're already sniffing that. If you're a 1/4 child all
you're going to do is you're going to take the nurturing example presented to you in
your family and you're simply going to translate that. My father was a son of a bitch
with his wife; I'm going to be a son of a bitch with mine. My mother fooled my
father all the time; I will fool my husband all the time. That‟s the 1/4. That‟s the
way you do it.
As a matter of fact, the 1/4 child will do it better than either of the parents because
their specialty is influencing others and they‟re going to take it lock, stock and barrel.
Why do you think we have problems with generational violence in the home? What I
mean by that is that the parents fought physically, the children in their relationship
with their partners would fight physically. In other words, something that carries on
like that. Well, this is a 4th line movement.
Remember that the 4th line not only has the ability to influence those they know, but
are deeply influenced by those who know them. And the 1/4 child growing up in a
dysfunctional violent household would assume that that's natural. They may not like

it; it‟s not about liking it. It's like the child can't stand seeing its mother slapped.
Yet, that child, if it‟s a male, will grow up and slap his wife. It's there.
And it‟s simply one of those things to see about the difference between what it is to
be a 1/3 to what it is to be a 1/4. Maybe I should say something nice about it? All
4th lines because of their social capacity, that that 1/4, if they have really decent role
models will be decent role models themselves. And the hope is that more and more
people that we can bring to awareness about the nature relationship that they can
begin to operate properly, that their children are not going to have these kinds of
examples, 1/4 children, who will carry these examples whole hog into the next
generation.
And that you can see that the responsibility of parents that have a child that‟s a 1/4.
You can lie to your 1/3 child and pay the price your whole life. You lie to your 1/4
child and they'll perpetuate the lie, which in the end is actually a much deeper
punishment for all involved. So it's the responsibility of the parent of the 1/4, and
this is really specific to the 1/4, how important it is to be a proper example for your
children, because you are a very, very powerful influence in their life, you are their
security, you are setting their foundation.
And again, because we're dealing with a role that is going to be applied through
purpose to duality, what the 1/4 sees is what the 1/4 will give out. And it won't wait
until it has a wife or husband, it will do it as it‟s growing up, it will be a reflection of
that. And of course, remember the power of the 1/4 to influence others. So that
when they do end up being violent there is all this concretized solid immovable: this
is the way it is, you want to disrespect me, you‟re not going to listen to me, you‟re
not going to follow me, I smack you. It‟s what I learned. It worked for my papa.
So, it‟s an ongoing story that we share. That is, every time that you have somebody
come into your life who is interested in Human Design who is an adult who has
children, your goal is to save the children. You may never save the adult, but you
can save the children. And considering that the vast majority of clients in Human
Design are women and that women have a visceral deep, deep need to do the best
they can for what came out of their bodies, that any mother that you introduce to
Human Design and what it means in terms of their children that you can have an
enormous influence on protecting these beings. And that a mother that understands
that her child is a 1/4, and that that child is going to take her example and bring that
example forward in its life, that there is a deep responsibility to be correct.

me. If you‟re lost, that‟s your business. And why? It‟s the democrat. No line, as a
role line is more misunderstood than what it means to be a Democrat.
What it means to be a democrat is that whoever wants it the most gets it. You're in
a relationship and you're a man and your wife wants to be the boss, this is where the
democrat comes in. Yes dear, you go ahead, you decide. Do you know how many
couples spend hours saying, no you decide, no you decide, no you decide, no you
decide. It goes on and on and on.
Now, think about the democrat. I explained you that, for example, in the American
election 50% of Americans are going to stay home. They‟re the democrats. No,
really, you must understand this; otherwise, you miss the point. They are the
democrats. They're the ones who are saying, yeah, go ahead, I‟ll be here inside of
my house. If you decide to take away everybody's rights, I don‟t care; I'm here
inside of my house. You go ahead and decide what's best for all of us. You decide,
dear, you decide where we go on a vacation, you decide what color care we‟re going
to have, you go ahead and decide, dear. That‟s the democrat.
Don't you notice what happens the moment that a country becomes democratic,
have you watched this process? In the first election, 103% vote. Everybody and his
dog go to the polling booth. They‟re all there; we‟re voting. Two years later you
have the next election. 60% vote, the other 40% is saying all, let them configure it.
I‟ll go along with it. When you get to mature democracies, you can barely get people
out to vote. And the only people who do vote are the ones that really want
something. They‟re the ones that are saying, I want this, I want this. And the other
one is sitting back and saying, yes, you go ahead. You two guys work it out, I'll
watch the debate on TV, but I will not vote. It doesn't matter enough to me. It‟s
not worth the trouble.
Think about the difference between the 1 and the 2. The 1 is an authority because it
learns how to be an authority; it studies, it investigates. When it's an authority it
knows what's backing that up. When you're a 2, you're a natural. You don't know
why you're a natural. You know how you got there. You don't know what it's about;
you don‟t know how to explain it. Let somebody else do it. The story of the 2nd line
Buddha—let somebody else wake you up, leave me alone. I‟m not interested.
It‟s very democratic, after all, isn‟t it? And this is something to really understand
about the 2nd line relationship. The 2nd line relationship is, if you actually leave me
alone, you can be with me. My description of the 2/4 relationship, you move into
your lover's house, which used to belong to his or her parents. And if the parents
are still alive, we‟ll, it's an apartment in the house and then when they die you take
over the whole thing, but you never leave it. And all the furniture is in the same
place and has been for many years. Your lover comes in and they can‟t touch
anything. Don‟t move the furniture, don't change anything. The moment that they
even want to empty out some of your drawers so they can put in some of their
clothes, there‟s a scowl on the face.

What you see in these kinds of relationships is these are relationships in which one
partner will simply give democratically the authority to another. I don‟t want to take
it. I don‟t want to be responsible. That's not what it's about; you do it, dear.
Think about the phenomena of divorce. You have about as many people divorcing as
marrying, so you have this rotating bell. You have 15% of humanity that are 2/4s.
We know that the 2/4 is the missionary. That is, you can be called to be influential.
You can be called to it. And here is one of those situations where you see that the
partner that's the one that doesn't vote in divorce ends up being the one that does
everything, and it‟s usually women.
In other words, they have to take on roles of being the father, and they have to go
to the other side and they have to make all the decisions and they feel incredibly
under pressure. So many 2/4 divorced mothers have psychological breakdowns.
They lose this protected world where nothing is touch, where they don't have to be
bothered with making the decisions and then all of a sudden all of that is placed on
their shoulders and they are all out to be that force of influence.
When the 2/4s are called they are amazingly powerful. But you have to see how
difficult it is to have a relationship direction like this, this 2/4 Sphinx, because it's not
understood. When the partner says, where should we go tonight, and you say, you
decide most of the time that is not accepted, because if you decide you take
responsibility for its success or failure. All the people who don't vote, when the
voting is over they‟re the ones that you hear loudly. That wasn't very good. I knew
that they would elect an idiot.
That's why you have this great line in the 7.2 about democrats denigrating
democracy. The people who don't vote are the people that scream the loudest when
the voting is over. So, in the relationship where you're always saying, no dear, you
decide, it's so you can say, oh dear, you fucked up. There is nothing about the way
in which we relate—this is the program after all. It‟s the program that sets us up
into all these modes and then we think it‟s us. It‟s like, we have a problem instead
of we‟re just a frequency. The 2/4 frequency is a 2/4 frequency, it‟s just what it is.

The 2/5s are such funny creatures. Funny in the sense that they‟re really best when
they‟re fucking themselves. Because most of the time that‟s what they‟re doing.
And they‟re doing that because quite frankly they‟re so suspicious of the other. So
fundamentally paranoid about what it means to bring another human being into their
life that they would rather avoid the whole thing. A 2/5 that says to you, give up
sex, it‟s good for you; you know they're right in. I‟m not into this pair bonding. And
they‟re so heretical, after all.
And the whole thing to deal with when you're dealing with the 5th line and you're
dealing with relationship is that the only thing that the 5th line ever cares about is

whether it can seduce. It does not actually like or want relationships. That's the
joke. It just wants to know that it's still attractive.
It‟s like a guy my age walking down the beach and there's all these pretty 20 year
olds, it would be nice to think that I'm still attractive, but oh boy, I wouldn‟t get
messed up in any of that. It‟s like, no, no, no, I don‟t want any of that. But it would
be nice to know that there's still a spark out there, that I still have the light
somewhere. And of course, this is the 5th line. This is what the 5th line cares about,
it cares about its ability that if it wanted to it could call you, that it could get you,
that it could grab you.
But then again, it says, oh, look at what‟s going to happen. They're going to move
the furniture; they‟re going to make me explain myself. The worst thing you can do
in a relationship with a 2nd line in the profile is say to them, “why do you love me?
Why me?” Never ask a 2nd line person that question. You can ask all the other lines,
they‟ll make something up. The 1 will tell you how it‟s investigated its feelings; you
go through the whole thing. But a 5, the 2—I don‟t know.
And of course, the whole thing about the 2 is that because it doesn't know, it‟s a
natural. Only 2s fall in love without understanding that they're even in love. These
kinds of things that you see in comedies where somebody walks up to somebody in
their office and they say to them, what's the matter with you are you in love. And
there is sort of this, “I guess so.” It‟s like, really?
Think about the 2nd line—shyness, barriers, hermit, all these layers that are there.
They don‟t know why they like somebody. They have no way of digging into that.
They simply surrender to love in the same way that they surrender to somebody else
voting for them. It‟s like, okay, this must be what it is. They don't know. And here
you are a 2/5, you‟re the beginning of the quarter, it‟s all about direction, the
direction leading you towards duality and the 2/5 standing there saying, are you
crazy, let's go back towards civilization. If I go back over there I can find a nice
quiet room and be by myself.
The other thing is that the moment you carry the 5th line in your profile you‟re going
to be subject to millisecond primary positive projection. It‟s one of the things that 5s
understand about the unfairness of everything. When a 5 meets somebody for the
first one millionth of a second, there is a positive projection from the other. And
after that, it's all downhill. And depending on what happens, it can go very fast
downhill. You‟d be amazed; die, zoom. It‟s just a projection field.
So, when you're dealing with a 2/5 and that 5 is unconscious and somebody knocks
on their door and says, you‟re really for me, appealing to their democracy—think
about that. The 2 is always saying, please, dear, you decide if we‟re in love, okay,
all the time. Everywhere you see a 2 you‟ll see that in a relationship. You decide,
dear, whether we‟re in love. If you get to the point that you decide we‟re not in
love, I guess it‟s over. But between now and then you decide. I‟ll go along with it.
If you say we‟re in love it‟s okay with me. No hassle, no fuss, no muss, don‟t move
the furniture.

And of course, what happens to the 2/5 is that you immediately end up in a dilemma
because the 5 brings this heavy projection that they're really going to be wonderful,
they‟re going to be this subservient democratic you-decide-if-we‟re-in-love-dear,
because the other person has broken down the barrier, and then the other person
immediately discovers the 5.
If you don't do what they want—leader/follower—the 5 goes nuts and with all the
savage nastiness of the 5. I guess you can imagine by now how nasty I can get. My
5 is so nasty. There's nothing like paranoia to feed nastiness. And all of a sudden
there is this, “all right, I'll let you decide.” All of a sudden the unconscious boils up
and says, “What, you‟re going to let this idiot decide for us?” Whoa, 2/5s, may they
love themselves first; which of course, is true for everyone.

The 3/5
RAC Sphinx 3
Put a 3/5 Sphinx on a street corner—no, better yet, make a 3/5 Sphinx the
policemen who stands in the middle of a cross section and you'll see some of the
biggest accidents in history. This is one of those things where you need a cartoon
and the cop in the middle should be an octopus with 75 arms pointing in the same
direction at the same time with cars smacking into each other and banging and
falling apart.
Basically, if you look at our evolution, you will see that what we call boomers, the
product of the postwar generational bubble, and what they have done along with
technology for sexuality that when it comes to duality, 3/5s know a lot about it,
because they get more than most. They plow their way through more binaries than
anybody. And by the way, wait until we get deeper in. Give me a 3/5 with their Sun
in the 59 and I will show you a rodeo.
So, here this 3/5, first of all we‟re dealing with the movement away from this
democracy—you decide, dear—to the 3 that says, this is a mess. This isn't going to
work. Have you ever seen a 3/5 fall in love? When the 3/5 falls in love, the moment
that they even have a sense that they have fallen in love, they‟re already preparing
for the end. They haven‟t even touched the person yet. They‟re already preparing
for the end. They‟re already listening in everything that's been said for clues of
disaster. They can be physically excited, they can be caught up in the energy and
yet at the same time that 3—if anything is going to go wrong it will. If the worst is
to be expected they will see it. Not only that, they‟re already asking themselves is
this a mistake. They just met the person.
And the 5 underneath, the 5 is say, what do they want, how much am I going to
have to give them. How much are they going to take from me? And the personality
is going, “too much, too much, I can see it. Let‟s move on. Let‟s find somebody
else.” The magic of a 3/5 going into a singles bar—you‟re a 2/4 you go into a singles
bar you go home after you‟ve had a half a drink. You‟re a 3/5, you go into a singles
bar; you could live there. The 3/5 is at the end of the bar if you‟re lonely.

You sit down beside the 3/5 and you immediately hook into that 5 unconscious.
They‟re Sphinxes—this one could take me in the right direction in my life. This one
looks like they‟re in the right direction. Maybe finally, in this sleazy bar, I've met
somebody of real value. And the 3 is looking at them and going, got another one,
hooked another one. Let‟s see what this one is like. Maybe this is better. And then
the other one says something and the 3/5 already has a catalog of opening
statements made by former mistakes, has a whole collection of, “I know what that
means, I know what they're really saying.”
And as soon as they start talking, the 3 is categorizing it right away. Oh, this is bad,
this is bad. And before anything can happen, they do the classic 3/5, they stand up
and totally ignore this person that's trying to get access to them and move on. If
they don't have too many things that register trouble or if the person that's coming
onto them is wealthier than they are, the 3/5 hangs a little longer. It's like, “if she
can afford that kind of jewelry, maybe there‟s something. He looks like he‟s very
well dressed, that‟s good; he has a job.”
It‟s all this stuff that goes on in the 3/5. They don't want a failure. Threes are
terrified in relationships that they're going to end up with a failure. Not only a
failure, but remember something when a 3/5 gets divorced it's announced on CNN.
Everybody knows, every relative you have, every friend of every relative you have,
the wife's family, her relatives, local newspapers—the son of a bitch divorced me.
Oh, you can‟t get away from that. And your reputation; these are the spouses who
have left their 3/5s who go on these television shows and talk about the horrors of
these people. These are the kinds of divorces that end up being so messy in the
courts and all this horrendous stuff is publicized.
What a direction. And you can already see this is just the opening of Duality, folks.
This is just sort of: “Look how nice it is for us to go two-by-two into the boat
together.” “Oh, yeah, right, sure, tell me about it, give me some more bullshit.

Imagine what it‟s like to be a 3/6. The first 30 years of your life, this is called
relationship bonding hell. You can't imagine how bad it is. Not only that, but it sets
one of the most important underlying tones that the 3rd line brings to this entire
quarter. It says this whole business about relationships, whatever it is, it does not
work. The 3rd line being, in a 40 year relationship, will still tell you in all honesty this
kind of stuff really doesn't work, because they know all the things that are wrong.
When you go to some wishy-washy analyst, therapist, whenever, basically what they
tell you is that relationship is compromise. Not of course, for us that‟s very funny in
our language, because we know what compromise brings. And it‟s true, it brings
problems. But the fact of the matter is that because the two are never the one, that

the one is actually a separate form than the separate things, relationships don't
work. They don't work in the absolute sense, cannot, because the purpose is not
relationship. The purpose is the children produced. That's why the duality bonding
game is such a mess. It is not the goal.
The gods don't give a damn. After all, Zeus has its own problem with women. He‟s
going to care about you? He says, oh, this is a tough business, just fuck and make
more and shut up. Just put them out there, just pop them. Don‟t worry about this
other stuff. It‟s never going to work. It‟s Jupiter‟s realm. This is not like this is
Vesta‟s realm. This is the hearth and the home and the sweet.
Anyway, to be a 3/6 profile, a 3/6 Sphinx, if you don‟t want to go where you want to
go, ask them where to go. If you don‟t want to get to where you think you should
get to, ask him how to get there. That‟s what they‟re good for. It‟s one of the
things that I enjoy about No Choice is that when somebody misdirects you, that's not
true. They're directing you. And the 3/6 on this cross is the great cross of
misdirection. Oh, it‟s wonderful. I think it's actually beautiful.
These are the ones that you would think that 3/6s and 6/3s would have the most
difficult problems in relationships, would be into turnovers in relationships and up-
and-down and off the roof and over and under and all that stuff. It's not true. It‟s
just a projection to think that. As a matter of fact, 3/6s and 6/3s have a lot of very
stable, long-term successful relationships. It‟s one of the ironies, I guess.
But it's something to recognize about the 3/6 when it comes to a relationship. They
know something that is absolutely essential and allows them to accept bonds. They
know that they could do worse. They know that they may be better. But what they
do know is that it will never be perfect, and the best thing to do is take the best of it
and forget the rest.
And if they survive their 3/3 phase, when they go up on the roof they have a chance
for a really strong lasting relationships. But these are not relationships that are
really about love at all. Remember, there's a lot of confusion in this quarter that
brings out these themes of love and sex and partnership and marriage and blonds
and all of this stuff.
One of the things to be very clear about the 3/6 is that the 3/6 ends up being aware
of the transitionary responsibility of the bond. In other words, they‟re much more
attuned to the fact that the children make the marriage. And one of the ways in
which 3/6s can find love is that they can find love through their children. They will
not find real love with their partners; it's not possible. They have already accepted
deep within themselves that the partnership bond is not correct, does not really
work, is not really solid, is full of many problems, but it's the only form we have right
now.
There is a real beauty in accepting what is, and accepting it with a kind of
pessimism. It‟s like when I talk to my mother every once in a while, she‟s 93 years
old; she slept in the same bed with my father for 61 years. I can tell from her
conversations how much of the marriage was something that you had to put up with

it, you put up with it. And you put up with it because there really wasn't any
alternative. She enjoyed her life, she enjoyed her children, she had her things, and
she had her power. There were things that she didn't like, but she just put up with
it.
This is very much something that only a 3/6, 6/3 can get to. They actually get into a
relationship where they think, okay, I‟ll just stay with this, because knowing me I
could really do worse. Yes, there may be better, but then again I‟d find a problem in
the better anyway. So, let‟s just stay with this one and let's just deal with it.
And remember that in order for a 3/6 or a 6/3 to really have a good life they need
to do well financially and they need to be independent financially. So, one of the
things about the 3/6, 6/3 in this whole business of accepting the relationship that is,
is that they put their focus in their work. These are people that are closer to their
colleagues at the office than they are to anybody at home. They transfer that, in a
way. They transfer that into their material dimension, and so that they can live out
the 6.
And remember, the theme of the 6 is leadership, and here we‟re dealing with a gate
and the role of leadership. So, if you have a 6th line in you profile on the Sphinx
crosses, then you have to see that there is all this added pressure on you to take
that leading role. And of course, what happens is that the 3/6 ultimately can come
to a point where they actually trust in the mediocrity of their bond.
Trusting for a 3rd line being is as close to love as they‟ll ever get. To trust in your
partner is a deep expression of love from a 3rd line being that knows that anything
could go wrong, that anything that you trust can fall apart. They know all of that.
So, that's the best that they can do as a direction. In other words, you see these in
those kinds of movies where you have the father saying to the daughter, look, you
don't have to love them right away. Get to knew him. Get to see him. Learn to
respect him. You know, your mother didn‟t love me. It took time, it took a long
time. This is very much a 3/6, 6/3 reality. Here they're saying, look, yeah, okay,
but just look at your life instead. And it's nice; eventually you‟ll be able to say we
did it together. So that's the advice. The advice is to forget about this love stuff.
Just find something that works and stay with it and have your focus in your life.
Mostly again, because duality is necessary for the end product, duality is really a
problem. The genes only want diversity; they only want you to be attracted to
something that is theoretically repulsive to you. After all, any attraction is repulsion.
Your genes attract you to something that you're automatically repelled by at the
same time. And then you try to figure out how to live with that. And that the genes
are only doing that so that they can get this nice little package that jumps out. It‟s
always fun for me, I look at my children and then I think about their mothers, I
think, this is another package. And it‟s been what it‟s all about. It‟s been about the
package. That‟s the way we‟re driven.
And if you‟re a romantic, if you‟re an individual like me and you‟re a 5/1 romantic,
the idea of duality not being what it's about really means that all you're left with is
sad love songs. That‟s all you‟re left with is all these sad love songs. And all this

comparison stuff. You don‟t love me enough, you love me this much and I love you
that much. You should listen to me, no, you should follow me. Love, honor and
obey; you get all of this trip. It‟s tough enough for human beings to live with
themselves. The not-self is a horror to have as a companion. And then you try to
have a relationship—two not-selves trying to deal with each other. It's a horror.
That's why we have these formulas, so you end up with just all of these formulas
that just operate and everybody thinks that it‟s their unique way of living a
relationship. It isn't. It's a homogenized pattern, and basically the pattern is there
to inure us to the pain of what duality is and to the joy of children. How many bonds
are held together by their offspring? This is the glue. This is what duality does.
Duality says, all right, now, you‟re stuck to each other. And we‟re not going to help
you with that, because we don‟t care; you work it out. What we're concerned about
is you manage to reproduce. Good for; thank you very much, see you next life.

The 4/6
RAC Sphinx 3
When you get to the end of the right angle and we‟re dealing with the 4/6, again, all
6th line beings obviously are going to go through turmoil, there is going to turmoil in
terms of the relationships. The nature of friendship, the way the bond is structured
for the 4/6; but the 4/6 is deeply influential. These are the people that will set the
trends. These are the ones that really establish for the right angle the way, in a
sense, because they are the most socially equipped. They are the most aware of the
advantages that come from the other. One of the things that you see about the 4,
because it's an opportunist, is that their frequency is relationships must offer
opportunity.
Think about the G center, were all of this is taking place, and think about the ego
and think about the relationship between the G and the ego. If you have a defined G
center, all of this is being expressed within a 4th line context. If you have a defined
G center, the person that is going to be attracted to you is somebody with an
undefined G center. And what I mean by that is not the obvious. But within the 4th
line context what that means is that you have a higher cultural level than they do.
In other words, this is somebody coming from the slums falling in love with
somebody who is in the middle class and in doing so actually wanting the advantage
and the opportunity to rise up out of their standard and go to another level, another
cultural level. The person that never graduates high school, falling in love with
somebody who is very literate or very artistic or cultured, or whatever the case may
be, if you look at relationships you will see that this is very, very common; in other
words, this crossing of class lines.
For the 4th line being, the G center and the ego center are themes in attractiveness.
Remember, they‟re here to influence and what they're looking for is how to develop
their influence. If you have an undefined G and you‟re a 4th line being, bringing

culture into your life is very important and the G center is the culture center. So you
see a lot of open Gs, for example, who will rise up from very low stations in life to
become part of the cultural nouveau riche.
In other words, they will jump strata in the classes because they will be absorbing all
of this culture. It's a tragedy always of the defined G. If you have an undefined G
and you‟re living in the barrio somewhere in the hills of Rio, it‟s very, very different
than having an undefined G and being brought up in the best neighborhood in some
wealthy enclave. It‟s a totally different process. You‟re going to have a different
cultural level, and you're going to take in that level very deeply, amplify it.
If you have a defined ego you‟re going to be very attracted to undefined ego people,
and this is about money. In other words, this is about a genetic recognition that the
defined ego can work and deliver. Now, again, none of this is gender related. But it
is very important to see within the 4th line context of opportunity. And again, we're
talking about a theme here of leadership and following. If you've got a culture and
your partner doesn't you can lead, and they follow. If you have the ability to make
the money, whether you're the male or the female you have the ability to lead and
they follow. And they're not going to mind.
In other words, this is the beauty of the 4. We call it brotherhood/sisterhood, we call
it the social capacity, but basically this is the way that it works. In other words,
influence becomes their guide, their tool; influence becomes their way in a
relationship. And it's based on these two very, very important areas. If you‟re a 4th
line being with a defined ego and a defined G and you meet somebody with a defined
ego and a defined G, you better be friends and not lovers, because you're just going
to clash. Your culture will clash with their culture, your way of material will clash
with their way of material and that there is no illusion of learning in that relationship
and no leader/follower in that relationship.
Remember something about the 3rd color and leading and following, that this is the
theme of desire. And desire permeates all of this. Desire is an underlying theme in
all relationships. How that desire is played out; it‟s not just sexual. And one of
things for the 4th line being is that the only way that they can truly feel love is if they
see their influence at work.
There you are with your deep culture, and you've taken a hick from the countryside
into your life and slowly but surely you watch them flower. This wonderful line in the
traditional Rave I‟Ching, in the 54th gate, this line of the maiden and the moon not
being full, and how wonderful it is if you have the patience to wait for the moon to
become full so that you can truly see her light. Do not judge the maiden when her
moon is not full.
This is the whole thing about the 4th line, is that the 4th line loves to play this role of
setting the foundation to see this wonderful transition. Now unfortunately, many of
these relationships are relationships where when you raise somebody's culture or
you transform their material destiny, they may end up leaving you. They might. A
lot of 4/6s, particularly in their first 30 or 40 years, that the people that they bring in

because these relations are grounded on the mistakes of the 3rd line phase, that
those very first experiences may be defeating.
It‟s very common, for example, to be a 4/6 on this cross, you fall in love with
somebody, you're at an Ivy League or a very expensive university and you fall in
love with one of the waitresses in the local café who is a local, and you cross this
incredible barrier because it's an incredible barrier culture, and you begin to work on
raising that culture. And of course, what happens is that by the time you get to 30,
you go through the whole Saturn crash, this is somebody that is going to say, thank
you very much, that was great and away they go.
And the next thing that is going to happen to that person is that everyone around
them, because it's the 3rd line process, everyone around them will say, you see is
what happens to you when you marry below your station. Or you fall in love with
somebody who's not your equal, or when you live with somebody who wants you
only for your money, and on and on and on. In other words, the theme of the 4/6 is
always a theme you'll see played out through the G center and through the ego
center.
It‟s very important to keep that in mind, and will tell you so much about the way in
which they need to direct in love. In other words, they need to be that kind of
authority; remember the harmony to the 1st line. They need to be that authority in
the relationship—I‟m lifting you up. And the other isn‟t saying, you snotty bastard.
The other one is saying, lift me up as fast as you can, I‟ll go passed you. I'm on my
way beyond you.
These can be very enriching relationship. But they‟re most successful when they
begin in the roof stage, because again you don't have this very negative reaction,
very pessimistic reaction to getting it wrong in the first 30 years and thinking that
that's taught you a lesson that you need to avoid. In fact, as a 4/6 if you don't offer
or are on the receiving end of these kinds of cultural or financial advantages the
relationship will never work. It just won‟t work.
Built into both the male and the female is a kind of honing device rooted in our
genetics that is trying to do the best possible job in reproduction in the sense that
we're looking for the best possible mate. We even have lines about that. Go down
to the 3rd gate, you‟ll see there are lines about the ability to select the right mate.
This is so deep inside of us. And for the 4/6 it's very clear. You're either going to
learn something from your partner, they‟re going to transform your cultural level, or
they‟re going to transform your financial security. Or you are going to be the agent
of offering the other in return for love; the same advantages. In other words, this is
that bond that is there to say if I'm going up or I'm bringing the other up our
children are going to have a proper frame for them to go beyond.
You can also see that there are a lot of power trips in this. You can see that there is
a lot of using from both sides in that kind of relationship. The so-called social
climbers and all these phrases; we have nasty phrase for people who want to use
relationships to advance their personal life. And yet, to see very clearly that this is
the theme of the 4/6, that this is the direction. It says, well all right, if we're going

to bond, if we‟re going to be forced into this kind of direction, then we have to
operate from the same level of culture and wealth.
And so we end up with very stratified societies in which you can see that the quality
of bonds—if you go into certain neighborhoods based on finance and culture, and you
look at those neighborhoods and the way in which the partners work you'll see within
each neighborhood that the general theme of the relationships are homogenous.
They‟re dealing with the same financial problems; they‟re dealing with the same
cultural problems or lack of it. And so the relationships revolve around that kind of
infrastructure. If you move up to another level, there‟s another set of problems. But
they‟re all happy to be together because they can share that level of the problems
with each other.
Again, we end up with this stratification of society and this is what the 4/6 brings. It
is the role model. And the role model says, well, the genes want us to be different, I
have to compensate, so I'm attracted to this person who is poor and stupid. I will
teach them how to read and buy them some nice clothes. It's a way of trying to
create equal-ness to try to make the relationship better. And it's true, you know
that yourself, that no matter how attracted you maybe to another person that the
moment you have a conversation, the moment that you share lifestyle is the
moment you realize whether you can really have a relationship or not.
This is the final statement of the right angle in the experiment of setting direction for
duality. It says look, we're getting screwed in this, and we‟re going to be attracted
to what's really different. So let's do what we can even things out. Give us a sense
of commonality and the way we do that is through the G and through the ego. If
you look at 4th lines in relationships in profiles with that in mind, it is going to be an
eye opener for you. It can also be very disillusioning. So be careful.

We move into tricky ground here. We move into the mind immediately. We move
into this Juxtaposition Cross of Interaction. And it‟s interaction that is brought to you
by the 23/43. We have this shift from the 2 and the 1, we maintain the consistency
of the 7-13, but now we have this juxtaposed, which is the left angle shift, and we
step into the 43/23. Now, these are my nodes so for me whenever I meet beings
who are Sun/Earth 43/23s, it‟s very interesting. It‟s very interesting because I filter
this without any kind of interference. And I'm unconscious to begin with, and I know
what it is to be a 43/23. I know what's good for us.

Think about the 43/23 in this context. I know what's good for us. Interaction, from
the 43/23? This is the channel of the deepest deafness that you can imagine. Your
partner is screaming at you—interaction—screaming at you; you do not hear them.
You don‟t. You say I know what's right in this relationship. I know the way things
should be in this relationship. I will explain it to you. And when I explain it to you, I
expect you to assimilate; ah, the magic of the 23rd gate.
Have you ever really looked closely at that 23rd gate? This is the gate of
assimilation. For an individual, the idea that you have to assimilate means that you
stay an individual and everybody else thinks you're assimilated. There is no
assimilation. It's a myth. It‟s built into this. It‟s the awareness and understanding
which leads to the acceptance of diversity.
So, on the shift here, the underlying
theme of the way in which the role is
going to be played out is going to
shift. We have a 4/1. And we've
already seen what the 4 does with
duality; that the 4 is very interested
in either money or culture. That
money and culture is really the
ingredient to make a relationship
successful.
But there is no real direction
anymore. The 1-2 which is the heart
of direction is gone. We‟ve got the
43/23 underneath. It all becomes
mental. And basically what the 4/1
does is that the 4/1 tries to explain
to the right angle what a relationship
really is. Let me tell you the way it
is, let me explain to you how you
could live together. 4/1s,
interaction, they are amazing at the way in which they will be able to influence
couples. And they‟re spooky in that they're not-self. “I know.”
Now, you don't want to ask them about their personal relationships because their
personal relationships are really the kind of relationship in which you know very
clearly that the 4/1 is absolutely un-touchable. That‟s my oldest advice; if you‟re
going to have a 4/1 as a lover, you have to understand that there is absolutely no
way you can go against them. You can never win, you can only lose; never win, only
lose. They can be the biggest jerk possible. And there's nothing you're going to be
able to do. Nothing.
So of course, they have relationships that are rooted in their need to be an influential
authority. The opportunistic authority; but for everybody else, they‟re busy
explaining how we interact with each other. Remember that 4/1s are a bridge.

The Left Angle Cross of Masks 2
 13  43
The 5/1
When you go to the left angle you get the whole story; the Left Angle Cross of
Masks. I always love it when by mistake I walk in on my partner when she has one
of these facial masks on; it‟s horrifying for a man. Masks, we‟re nothing but masks.
The 7 is so clear about this. The 7 says, it‟s all roles, it‟s all roll; this is a game. You
play your part in the role and no
matter what it means, whether
means you‟re going to be happy or
not, or this or that, it doesn‟t matter.
And you wear this mask—the 1950s
Eisenhower era in America, where
everybody was happy. The Leave-It-
To-Beaver world, everybody was
happy. Everybody was smiling.
There were housewives in gowns and
high heels making dinner.
Everything was perfect, nobody
fucked, nobody shit, and nobody said
a bad word. This was a really an
incredible world. Masks, masks; how
shattering it was when it was peeled
off and suddenly the suburbs were in
den of iniquity, the Stepford Wives.
The masks come off; oh, wow. And
our relationships are masks. You
know that, you know what it's like when you meet somebody for the first time; you
know you're wearing a mask. You work on it really hard.
This is my presentation mask; aren‟t I sweet? Let me show you this face, and you
show me that face. And if those faces like each other, let‟s hope like hell that we
don‟t scare each other when we take the masks off. I didn‟t know he was like this
when I met him; no, of course not. I didn‟t know you were going to look like this in
the morning when I met you. It‟s all masks.
You don't need roles and masks if duality is natural and easy. It would be just like
(sound); you wouldn‟t think about it. You come together, you make more, you have
fun, you do your thing, and you survive. You won‟t need any constructs. Masks;
you‟ve got to wear your masks.

Think about who wears the mask—the General. What do we know about the
general? The general says, look, I will only go to war when it's absolutely necessary.
I will only have a relationship when it is absolutely necessary. This is the practical
relationship, practical. It's the mask that dictates this. It says I could wear a mask
of contentment as long as my laundry is done. I'll wear the mask of being content
as long as I have a new car to pick up the kids at school. Masks, masks, masks; and
all for practicality.
I got married so someone who would do my laundry. I‟m not saying that for myself,
but you can't imagine how many males cannot survive in the world without a woman
doing their laundry. It's just practical; otherwise, you have to bring it home to your
mother. It's just practical. Well, somebody's got to do that. And who is going to
clean this place up? And who is going to look after me so I don‟t have to work? You
can‟t imagine how practical it is. For a woman, if she doesn‟t do that her hormones
are going to drive her crazy. Get rid of this thing; at least I‟ll get something I love
out of it. It's practical.
So the whole thing about understanding the Cross of Masks is that basically what it's
saying is we will wear whenever mask it takes as long as we have a benefit out of
the relationship. And basically what you're seeing is that you go from the
recognition that as a direction duality is going to be difficult to the left angle that has
to sell it.
Remember, the left angle has to sell it. So, it sells it through masks. We‟ve been
selling love from the beginning, the googoo gaga faces that are on TV every day.
There is more romance novels sold than any other kind of fiction; the mask of love—
this whole game.
So, basically what we're taught is we‟re taught to assume certain masks. And that's
fine as long as the byproduct is practical. In other words, yes it's difficult to have
this thing over here with you flying along in formation. However, there are
advantages. You don't have to do this, you don‟t have to do that and you don‟t have
to do this.
The logic behind it all is about work. It‟s just about work. The whole thing about the
realm of duality is the realm of duality says, look, you‟re not gaining a lover, you‟re
gaining a slave. And both partners see the other in that way. There are things that
you don't want to do in life. And isn‟t it nice that somebody else will do them. And
all you have to do is deal with the price. So, if you put on a mask, you can pretend
that you can live with the price; and you do.
The guy that can‟t imagine divorcing his wife, because he can't imagine how he
would live; it‟s terrifying. He could absolutely detest the woman and wear this mask
of: Morning, dear. This is the world we live in. If you see it in the Third World, it's
even worse. At least we have sophistication in the way in which we play out our
gender masks. But they‟re masks. And it says something very straightforward
about the nature of duality, that relationships are inherently dishonest. All
relationships are inherently dishonest. We lie about them all the time, to ourselves
to our partners. It doesn't have to be lies in words, we lie in our aura. Because it

doesn't work; that's what makes it interesting, after all. It doesn‟t work. We know
that.
The left angle says okay, okay, okay, but what to do. Just pretend, you idiot. You
pretend you have a good life, you pretend you have a good wife, a good husband, a
good dog, you pretend. What do you mean, my dog bit you; I have a good dog. I
can‟t see it being a bad dog. It‟s like parents with their children. You give birth to
Hannibal Lecter, and there you are saying, what a wonderful child I have. It has
funny eating habits, but what a wonderful child. It‟s all masks; we do it all the time.
I go up to people and say, how are you, and the mask comes on immediately. I‟m
fine. It‟s all masks. It‟s the way we deal with each other because we don't deal with
each other honestly. It's what makes it so difficult because our auras, how powerful
and penetrating they are. It‟s what I really love about this gate. I have three
activations in the 7; I really understand how ridiculous it all is. When people think
that there's a God, which is really upsetting to begin with, but nonetheless, they
really assume this plan, how it‟s all worked out in advance.
The male is a mutation out of the female. The male is already deeply
disadvantaged. There is no equality between men and women. Men are inherently
inferior, and they‟re inherently inferior in everything but brute strength. It is simply
the reality. The fact is that when you create a parallel movement in space of this
powerful, powerful yin and this yang, and you cover it with a patina in which the
yang thinks it's more powerful. And then you expect the two of them to get along
and truly be honest with each other; it's a joke. There isn't any woman who has a
man who will not tell you that most of the time that man is their child. There isn‟t a
woman I've ever met who does not know that their man is their child. And they
resent it, because the male is inferior; it's obvious.
It‟s obvious to any woman. They come out of their bodies, after all. That‟s the first
horror in the male psyche. Men can't make men. We spurt out some juice; we don‟t
do anything. We sit around and wait and look and wonder and out pops a male out
of a female body. It scares the hell out of you. For thousands of years men were so
terrified of women simply because these males kept coming out. And then you
expect them to get along in life as equals. How is that possible? How is it possible
that anything that comes out of your body can ever be your equal? It's not.
And so you have to see that this whole concept of duality is a joke. From the point
of view that if you look at duality and say, okay, this is a process where we get to
union. No. It‟s not the way that it works. It‟s my joke about the uterus.
Technically speaking, it‟s an inside that is outside. When you go into any hole in the
body, regardless where it is, it‟s like going into your mouth; in fact, the way in which
the development of the whole form works, your throat is actually outside. But it's an
outside that's pulled inside. The illusion of the male that it‟s penetrating the female
when in fact it‟s still on the outside; nothing has been penetrated. Not in that sense.
So this whole business of duality is a lopsided game and because the female carries
all of this power, what you have is that all relationships are a power struggle. And

they are not a power struggle from the female, from the yin; it‟s a power struggle of
the male trying to find their strength, trying to find a way to be the dominant force.
Well, I have the great good fortune of having a 93-year-old Leo mother who is the
matriarch of many generations, of having been raised by older sisters, it was always
clear to me who had the power. I never had any problems with understanding that.
They‟ve got the power. I used to watch my father who was such a heavy dude; he‟d
walked into my mother's house. He did not walk into his house; he walked into my
mother's house. That was her power. That was her way of dominating her world.
Watch; you‟ll see what power really is. And then you see the males that fight
against that kind of power. They resent it. Males are inherently afraid of females.
They just all are. They‟re born afraid. And all they can do is just push outwards in
order to try to compensate for what they cannot recognize on the inside.
It‟s like my recommendation of sleeping in your own bed. It‟s the men that are
terrified by that; not the women. After all, all this is tied up with the male psyche
being connected to their sexuality in a very different way in which it operates in the
female. And all these problems that our genetics bring us with being attractive to
the opposite and being caught up in this and then being responsible for a life force,
that the best that you can do is wear a good mask, and be yourself.
If you‟re a male and you‟re operating correctly, you're not going to get rid of what is
your primal fear of the female, but you're not going to be distorted by it. It‟s the
distortion that is so dangerous. I don't get to talk to enough men. It‟s always been
so clear to me that most of the problem is in the hands of men. It is this inability to
be able to come to grips with limitation, to be able to see the beauty in limitation.
For me, the bond, the yin/yang bond, regardless of these divides that can never,
never truly be bridged, it‟s still the best experience that we have, after all, as
humans. Our whole lives are built around bonds. It is what we have to deal with in
this life, and whether you have a rich life or not, it‟s really dependent on the quality
of the bonds that you have in your life, and not just with your partner, with your
children, with your friends, whatever.
Duality is a deep theme. But remember how human this is. This is not in any way
connected to the rave that will have no connection to duality in the way we do, how
stuck we are with “this and that.” And so when you see somebody and they have
their Sun in this quarter, you have to begin to understand that the focus for them,
their purpose in this life, is to be able to operate correctly in any bond. And of
course, we know what our approach is, our approach is that we bring them to their
selves and their strategy and so forth and so on.
Okay, the 5/1; obviously, when you're dealing with a 5th line you‟re dealing with
seduction. Masks are very seductive; the mask that you put out when you're trying
to attract somebody is very different than the mask they get when they wake up
with you. This is just the business of seduction, and you have to see that it's so
important to recognize that the further and further away you are from the legitimacy
of the mask, the more devastating the results are going to be; in other words, the

5th line crash, the 5th line crash of reputation, all of these things, the punishment that
can come to the 5th line.
The 5/1 is paranoid. It‟s why you stand behind a mask. You don't really know if you
can reveal yourself. You don't really know what's on the other side. And the 1st line
is unconscious. There is nothing more difficult to be than the 1st line being in terms
of trying to find in a relationship a place where you can finally say yes, this is truly it.
You can be 50 years into a relationship with a 1st line unconscious and somebody can
say to you, boy, you must have really loved this person, and you go, well, yeah, I‟m
still watching, still investigating, still trying to figure out for certain. Why, do you
think after 45 years she's going to leave you? Well, I don't know actually, maybe,
could be. It hasn't happened yet, but—that‟s 1st line. You have to see that in a
relationship between two human beings there is never a solid foundation, no matter
what you call it. We try; we create marriage licenses, all of these things, we try to
do that, but it does work.

LAC Masks 2
When you get to the 5/2 and remember that the 5th line of the General is deeply
focused on leadership, absolute authority. The 5/1, this is my mask, this is the way
that I want to be able to live my relationship with you, this mask, and we‟re going to
keep it that way and don‟t you dare try to get underneath that surface. Don‟t
interrupt your father when he‟s telling a story. That is the way your mother is; that
is the way she is. It‟s one of the nice things I get to say to my children—it‟s the way
she is, it‟s the way I am; what to do.
5/2s realize something, that anyone they meet who‟s married can be made love to;
anyone. And the only people that ever turn them on are people that are married. It
gives them a great excuse not to have a relationship. It saves them from all the
trouble of getting locked it. And yet, at the same time, they love the game; it‟s the
flirtation game.
And of course, with an unconscious 2nd line you know very well that they‟re basically
a hermit, they‟re basically closed off. They have their barriers. And yet, their
personality is deeply seductive. Their personality is going like this. And they
experiment with these masks. These are the kind of people that love to do that.
The 5/2 on this cross is that they help people realize that they‟re in a bad
relationship. Because when I say that they can get anybody who is married, I don‟t
really mean anybody; after all, that is a huge generalization. They can touch
anybody that is going to have any kind of real dilemma in their relationship anyway.
They‟re the ones that will heighten that; they will highlight that; they may be the
catalyst in the change in a relationship or perhaps the transformation of a
relationship. It can be very positive.

LAC Masks 2
It‟s always so interesting to me that 6th lines can always be so beautiful. When you
read 6th lines you see that there are these—like the bodhisattva, like Buddhahood—
these incredible names that are associated with 6th line themes. This is the role of
the Administrator. Now, remember, don't forget in the background beyond this 7th
gate, think about the way in which all crosses operate, that you‟re looking at the
three arms of this cross all being focused through that 7th gate. But still, they're
carrying their power in that.
The thing to remember about the 5s and the 6s on this left angle is that so much of
their approach is intellectual. The only way that we can get out of the physical
dilemma of the relationship is through the mental bullish that we can live out. We
have all these mental things that we can play with. The 43/23 is really good at that.
It‟s deaf to its problems. It only talks about what they have as an “I know.”
The 6 has to go through its processes, it has to go through its phases, this tripartite
life process. And we know what it means to be caught up in a 3rd line process in the
beginning. But this is the administrator. It‟s the ability to share and justly apportion
power. Now again, as we talked about when we talk about the teaching of line
analysis, this is a line that has an introduction, that is, it has the blue highlight. And
that we know that you have a line this way, you can see that every single line of this
gate is a developmental process in life. In other words, if you look at these lines,
every one of the lines of the 7th gate has a heading. Remember, if the line doesn't
have a heading in means it‟s natural from birth, it‟s there. If a line has a blue
heading it means it is a developmental process.
So you can see that this ability to share and justly apportion power is not something
you're born with. It‟s something that you can mature into. Now, the 6 is always
looking for the ideal. And it's always looking for something that it can trust. And
more than that, if it doesn't indulge in its basic hypocrisy, it really is looking for not
only what it can trust, but that it can truly trust the other and it can trust the other
with intrinsic responsibilities.
One of the things about parenthood is that parenthood creates recognitions of trust
or not that can solidify the relationship. The way in which each parent views the way
the other raises the child, their relationship to the child, the way in which that is
assessed. So many people that I know who are in relationships will say that they're
having a hard time with their partner, but their partner is a good parent. And you
can tell right away that good parent part is a very deep. It‟s the part that has
nothing to do with the difficulties of the illusions and ideals of love, but have to do

with the general respect for and recognition that they are capable of looking after
your child that carries your genetic material into the future.
Apportioning power is the only way in the end that one can imagine that duality
could work. In other words, this is the example, and the example basically is saying
that if we get to a point of objectivity we will realize in a relationship that one
partner has powers here, and the other partner has powers there, and as long as
that their powers are in different areas there is no point in them having conflict. Let
them each have their power.
This was one of the ways in which my parent‟s generation tried to establish that kind
of a law. What I described as my father walking into my mother's house, my mother
was in charge of her world and my father didn't interfere. He didn't tell her what to
buy, didn‟t tell her how to feed her children, didn't tell her how to clothe them, look
after them, maintain the house, didn't tell her what house to live in. She would
decide where they would live, what house they would buy. But my father on the
outside world, my mother had absolutely no input whatsoever, none. It was not her
world, it was his world. And in that way, they each had power.
My mother‟s generation was a generation where a woman was deeply dependent
financially on males. So, my mother had a bargain. I have my world, I have my
power, and here is my power. I recognize your power, you go out there and you do
that. We had this archetype that had been created by the not-self civilization. The
whole theme of administration is to get to the point where partners are examples
and are examples that can share power. This is the 7th gate, after all. This is
collective.
Ultimately, it's not about sharing direction, it‟s about sharing power. And as we well
know, politicians share directions, not power. This is the way the 7th gate lives now.
And for us, there is a deep need for transformation in that. In other words, the goal,
if you will, the ideal—remember that's what the 6 always represents—is a potential
example that can be the direct result of the whole process and the transition to the
next gate, which is the answer.
It‟s so funny to think that all formulas are, in fact, trying to figure out logically how
to make bonds, which in fact is why the 4th gate has led to every science known to
man, every philosophy, every pseudoscience, every esoteric thought, every dream.
It's all based on the same thing. You‟ll see this incredible relationship between the 7
and the 4, and this transition in the 6. This transmission to, okay let‟s administer,
let's turn the partnership into something that‟s administered.
You can see the seeds of that in the way in which Communism evolved in the mid-
20th century, in which there were very deep experiments in trying to administer
relationships, in trying to administer the raising of children, in trying to work out
areas of power. There was a favorite joke in the Soviet era. A Western female
reporter interviews a Russian female and she said to her, aren't you lucky, you can
go out and you can work and you could earn exactly what all the men are doing and
there are no restrictions and there you are out there doing that. And the Russian

woman replies yes, and then I go home and I cook and I clean and I wash and I iron
and on and on and on.
One of the things that we have to see is that our goal, if there is a goal, that
anything that the 7 points us to—and remember this is the direction for the quarter.
Everything else follows the lead of this 7 until you get to the 44 at the end. And so,
ultimately what the 7th gate is giving us is that it's giving us a promise that at some
point we can find a way to administer power. Yes, well, all I can say is, good luck,
because I can understand that that is possible the moment that you really have
awakeness.
It‟s so clear to me that in a world where you could have a community of let's say you
need a minimum of maybe 50 to 200,000 people. And in that entire community,
everybody was living their design. And what you would see in living their design
beyond seven years is that natural bonds would form between likes, not between
differences. In other words, egos would bond with egos, and G centers with G
centers, and spleens with spleens, and solar plexuses with solar plexuses, and
profiles with profiles, and energy types with energy types, and angles with angles,
and then you would see that there is no need to apportion power. And the whole
myth of duality would disappear, because all we ever have is only one thing, we have
uniqueness.
We are each here to be unique. We are not here to be bonded. That's just the
mechanics of the program. We are here to meet many things along the way, but we
are here to meet it alone. There is no other way. We're here to meet it through
their own authority. Nobody is my authority, no partner, no God, no thing. There is
only one authority, it is my authority. There is only one God, it is me. There is no
judgment; there is no comparison, there is nothing.
And only when you can stand in that place can you stand having someone beside
you, because they are in their place and there's no question of authority, and there
is no question of competition and there's no question anything, they‟re just there.
We‟re flying along; hi, nice to see that you‟re flying with me. Aren‟t we lucky, we get
to see each other for awhile; good. There isn‟t anything else.
And at the moment you get to that place, it doesn't matter what kind of plumbing
that you have. It doesn't matter what the traditional roles are or the masks, it
doesn't matter. None of that matters. It‟s just movement in space, it‟s just
geometries. The passenger has no sex. There is no such thing. The passenger has
no body; just the illusion that it gets from connecting to this vehicle. The passenger
has no relationship with anything. It‟s why it‟s always so fucked up. It doesn‟t
understand what‟s going on. Why am I being pulled this way and that way? And
this machine has funny hormones, and all that stuff.
No, where we go is not that we‟re going towards some cosmic fusion; you‟re going to
die in your own grave, unless you come from Srebrenica. You‟re going to go alone.
Your crystal isn‟t going to be holding anybody's hand when it gets picked up by the
bundle. You're on your own. You're always on your own. And there's no need for
any mask or roll. The mask and the role is just the vehicle's game. There's no need

to judge. I see all the games. I thank my lucky stars every day that given the role I
have I was not also blessed with the 18/58. It would drive me crazy.
It‟s not about becoming one. We‟re already one. That's been always there. The
problem is we have to become differentiated. And the thing we have to recognize is
that when we differentiate it's not like we're going to be without company. There are
all these things flying around. Some of them are on your fractal. You can‟t get rid of
them, you shaken them and they don't move. My life-long deep philosophy, when
you wake up and you see the same face this must be love. When you wake up and
you open the door and you see the same face that must be friendship. When you go
to work and you see the same face that must be colleague.
After all, the passenger is just being yanked around through all of that. And then
you have the passenger worried about relationships. If it weren't so madly absurd,
it‟s so absurd. So when you enter into duality, you‟re not entering into a quarter
that's called “duality becoming one.” You go in dual, you go out dual. But while
you're running along that track you make something else. And that something else
will eventually run around the wheel and end up in the same silly story.
It‟s so much fun to be human isn‟t it? Isn‟t it a joy to be given such a movie? I
understand something very profound, for me very profound. I went through many,
many relationships in my life, I‟ve had many relationships. I was incapable of
maintaining relationships. Now, only was I incapable of maintaining relationships,
but I must've been an enormous pain for anybody trying to have one with me. And
I‟ve talked so often about that you do not change in waking up. You see differently.
I‟ve been with the same person for 21 years. It's a very long time. It's almost
forever in the way my consciousness works. And I can go to all those places inside
of me that have rejected every other relationship as a long-term relationship, every
one. I can go to those places right now, I can dig out all those places, and it‟s so
obvious, because I am me. And when you run down a track with somebody you're
not allowed to be just you. It sets the stage for making more.
And yet, I notice something. When you‟re a passenger and you honestly don‟t care,
because I honestly don't care, what can my passenger possibly care about; it‟s not
responsible, it's not in charge, it can't change anything, it can‟t do anything, it can
only witness, it can only watch this life, instead of being hooked on it, turned by it.
I told you the story. Imagine what that's like. I‟m a 62 and literally, without that
sounding like my huge ego blurbing, there has never been a 62 like mine. There has
never been detail like that. But I've lived for 21 years with a 17/62, who most of the
time assumes I‟m an idiot. My facts don't count. Compromise and what compromise
does.
Now, I really enjoy that. It would have killed me in the past. She would say to me,
you‟re an idiot and I‟d say I‟m a world teacher. Do you think that would do any
good? All of what would come out of that is yeah, they‟re idiots. Don‟t say anything,
don‟t muddy the waters, recognize what No Choice really means. Because I
understand something, I‟m waking up every day and seeing that person, because I

have no choice. It's not up to me that it started. It's not up to me the way it goes.
It's not up to me if it ends. It‟s not up to me how it feels along the way. Whatever
the feelings are, whether they're good or bad or this or that or blah, blah, blah, and
on and on, it‟s a real movie. No, this is it.
It was my first deep mantra. It was the first thing that really came out of me. This
is it. This is all there is; no change, straight line, straight line, straight line, no
choice. I don't resist. I trust in the geometry deep, deep, down inside, because I
recognize that every force that I meet, all I have to do is see them and then I will
see why they‟re there, I will see what's about. I will find a deeper love that has
nothing to do with the person that has nothing to do with the personal.
It doesn‟t matter who you meet. The moment that you see it within the context of
helpless choiceless geometry, you‟d better respect who is in your face. Just let it be.
Be you and see what happens. See if the geometry holds, see where it takes you.
And the whole thing about duality is that understand what I try to explained to you
the other day that the program, that the wheel, is so primitive.
We‟re coming to the end of a 19,000 year round in this program, it's a primitive
program. These are primitive vehicles that our consciousness is straining against it,
that this old line of duality is an old line of duality programming primitive humanity
into this reproductive program. But that's coming to an end. That in the beginning
it seemed like the tracks were going to merge, but they don't. It‟s the illusion that
you have about space. But you never get to travel that far. It‟s short, quick.
That‟s why correctness is everything in life, because only when you're correct does
your magnetic monopole aligns you to the correct perspective on your geometry.
Think about that. Think about what it's like to be the not-self. Imagine that you're
the not-self and you're lucky, that it‟s you‟re lucky in the environment you get,
you‟re lucky in your conditioning, you're driving in a limousine in which there
happens to be one little aspect of one of the windows that‟s clean. That's what
you‟re seeing. Now, you're going in the same direction, it's not like your life is going
to change, but you only see your life through this little window. And when you wake
up and all the windows are clean, whoa, I didn‟t see that, I didn‟t see this. I was
looking over here. Yeah, this is what seeing is about.
And you cannot see this way if you're connected to your life. You can only see this
way when you're watching your life. And it doesn‟t mean that you deaden things.
People have funny ways of how they think what this means, watching your life. It
doesn't mean that if you‟re emotional you're not going to be emotional because
you're disconnected. People think that means that you're pulling out of being
human. You‟re not. You're disconnecting from what is the vehicle‟s function. The
vehicle has the life, the body is the life, the body is not yours; it's old stuff. Let the
body live its life. Watch. It‟s its life; it‟s not yours. This is the whole point.
For all the people who claim they‟re spiritual and mystical, they don't trust in the
Gods. Say your prayer, but please pass the ammunition. No trust. I am in the
hands of the Gods. Everything I say, everything I do, everywhere I go, everyone I

meet, everyone I touch, has nothing to do with me, has never had anything to do
with me, nothing, nothing; I am just a filter.
This is just a filter. I watch the filter. I dramatize it as a movie so that it can be
entertaining. And I can see the beauty of the parts and the roles and the furniture
and the “this” and the “that,” and the complexity of it all and watch, but I am
somebody who is truly spiritual, as black as I am, because I am a surrendered being,
I know I am helpless.
So, relationship is not a challenge to me anymore. Love is not an elusive for me
anymore. My vehicle knows how to love; at least it seems as far as my vehicle is
concerned. So, that's what it is. That's interesting. And the vehicle feels good, and
that's nice. The vehicle gets hurt; well, that's okay. It‟s what happens when the
vehicle gets hurt. I know that movie, but it‟s not m. It‟s not what I‟m about; I‟m a
passenger here.
It's like what happens to me in these classrooms. I'm in here listening to me. I
have an unconscious mind. I don't know what the hell I‟m going to do or say. And
my passenger sits in here and says a good flow today; not bad. Every once in awhile
it says good stuff or you‟re being funny today. I have no sense of that being me.
It‟s what I experienced as my life. I allow life to simply be there.
So you have to understand something about the trap of duality. If you're identified
with this process, you will be unhappy with the other all your life, regardless of
whatever mask you wear. And at the moment you release yourself from the mental
control of your life, the moment you open yourself up to following what is truly your
authority, you‟ll begin to understand something very funny. You don't care.
I used to get so concerned when they would get mad at me. I don‟t care anymore.
I don‟t. It‟s so funny. It‟s like, ah, this happens and that happens. It‟s the way it is.
I‟m not going to change it. I can‟t. I can‟t change my partner, that‟s called murder.
What are you going to do?
So, you have to see that the formula that‟s structured here is a very primitive
formula that makes it so difficult. And it is deeply rooted in leading and following,
and it‟s deeply rooted in trying to find a way to pretend that it works. And the only
healing that we can bring is the healing that returns someone to their own authority.
Love can never be your authority. Oh, I make all the fuzzy people upset now. Love
can never be your authority. You have to be your authority; no one else.

So it‟s something to keep in mind that when you're dealing with this whole
recognition of what duality leads to is that we know that duality in fact leads to
trying to come up with a formula. If in fact duality is something that is truly an
illusion, the fact that it is not possible to really bond with the other, but only to be
able to survive it through masks through administrations through all these games,
that ultimately there must be a formula for duality, a mystery that can be solved
because there is a doubt engendered and the doubt engendered is why are we “this
and that” if we‟re not meant to be something else. What's the point? You're
attracted to something and at the same time, you can never fully, fully be one with
the other; you can't, tough.
And because this is the beginning of a direction towards duality, that the first thing
that comes with this recognition in the 6/3 is that there must be another way, that
there must be a way in the future, there must be a logical way in which we can make
partnership work.
What you get to see from the 6/3 is that the 6/3 is always looking at how other
people work as partners, always. These are the kind of children in the 3/3 phase
where they see their parents are always fighting they don‟t want to ever have a
relationship because it‟s just about fighting, that the worst can be expected from any
bond.
And yet, they are 6s. They do have this opportunity for an objective view of the
process. They will recognize that it is trust in the end that it‟s what it's all about.
And that how can we develop this trust that will allow us to move along on the same
track with another without it ever being possible that we are one. And this is the
greatest doubt of all.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 3
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
When we move to the 4th gate and we move to Youthful Folly, we know in basic
analysis that when we‟re looking at the 4th gate we‟re simply looking at a gate of
formulas, a gate of formulas to try to deal with the pressure of doubt, doubt about
the pattern. And the first thing to be clear about is that through the 4th gate, the
doubt about the viability of any relationship is the key.
There is no future for humanity unless we can make more. There is no future for
humanity unless we have pair bonds that manage to last long enough so that the
young are nurtured long enough so they can stand on their own and survive, that it's
clear in the pattern of the way in which we operate that we are conditioned to be
with the other through the pattern into the future. And what the 4th gate wants to
be able to do is it wants to be able to come up with a formula that makes it
acceptable to spend your life with somebody that you can never be one with.
Think about how devastating all of this is for the not-self. For the not-self when you
come into the Quarter of Duality you come into something that is never intended to
be resolved. And yet, it's the whole focus of the life. Your purpose is fulfilled
through your bonds and yet the bonds are never perfect, that the bonds can never
be what you want them to be. And you come into an immediate tension between the
overwhelming power of the yin confronted by the need for power in the yang, that
you immediately come into the tension of the reality that the passengers on either
side are isolated. There is no real bond. There is simply the geometry and in the
geometry the illusion that you're with somebody; we‟re flying in space. There
somebody flying beside you. You look at them and say “I love you.” But you could
just as easily say, hey, we‟re flying together in space and basically you would have
the same value.
So, the whole thing about the 4 is that the 4 is trying to figure out how do we get an
answer to being together so that we can go into the future without this whole
business of not really being designed to be one working. How do we do that? We
have enormous doubts about relationship for the very simple reason that it's not
what it's all about. The genes don't care about your relationship; they couldn't give
a shit about your relationship.
All they want to do is establish a platform upon which life can emerge; nothing else,
but new life, new blood, new genes, increase the gene pool. And then you turn
around and say to your genes, yeah, yeah, yeah, that‟s very nice for you, but what
about me and my life with this one over here? Well, work it out. Thank you very
much. Didn‟t you give me a key to how to work it out? No. You mean I‟m going to
go through this whole quarter and get to the end and still be in the same place I was
in the beginning? Yes. Then what‟s it for? So you can make more. But what about
me? We don‟t care about you. But what about my life? We don‟t care about your
life.

Youthful Folly
Duality is a bitch. It‟s just the program, old program; it takes two to tango, old
program, very primitive. The 59.1, you get a club, you see it, you whack it, you
screw it and you leave it. It‟s the old program built into all of us. Monkey killers,
monkey sex; it‟s the same thing.
So, the problem of the 4, and it‟s a problem I like, is that the 4 is confronted with
something that they cannot logically solve. It‟ part of the mystery of the 63 and the
64, they really play games with us, that the 63 is more abstract than the 64, and the
64 is far more logical than the 63, which makes answering questions and making
sense out of things very confusing.
And there‟s the 4th gate, the poor 4th gate, the logical conceptual font. There it is
saying, everything is logical, one and one equals two. This is the way it is. And of
course, partnership can never logically be answered. There is no logical how to
make it right. This pisses off logic. This is the circuitry of the 18/58. We will
perfect. And if you don't allow me to perfect you, I will kill you. We will perfect. We
are going to have perfect relationships. You can see where the masks came in. The
mask will create the rituals for the pretend perfect relationship. These mighty
couples, they drive me crazy. Aren‟t we perfect together? Don‟t you wish you were
like us?
It‟s not the way it works. So, the 4 is in a great dilemma and it establishes
something very important about the logical mind is that the logical mind is
impressive in the way in which it will build its database, but it doesn't mean it's right
and it doesn't mean that what the conclusion that it reaches is an absolute. And
partnership teaches us there are no absolutes. You can never, never get to the
same place with your partner.
I want you to remember, the most profound law in all of physics: no two objects can
occupy the same place at the same time. Think about it. You‟re never one with
anybody. They never get into your space. Now, I‟m not talking about auras, I‟m
talking about the passenger, I‟m talking about the crystal. Nobody opens up the
door and gets in beside you. Nobody sits in my backseat with me. Nobody knows
what's going on in this box. Hell, I don't even know what's going on in this box.
I‟m not one with anybody; can‟t be, never will be. Not with you, not with God, not
with anything; I‟m one with me. Nothing else; I don't have anything else. I don't
have any other God but my God. I don‟t have any other truth but my truth. I have
no other authority, but my authority. I am alone. I am alone. I'm alone in a
crowded space. That's all. I'm alone in a geometry filled with objects moving
around. Some of them seem to know my name. So I nod. You‟re here flying here
with me? Good for you. Have I known you from before? We‟re flying in space all
alone.
It‟s so nice as a 5/1 because you know that right away and that absolutely no one
including yourself can ever know who you are. You‟re an enigma wrapped up in an
enigma put in the side box somewhere, no idea. It‟s a joke. So the 4 has a huge
dilemma. How do I deal with this? Think about it.

The 1/3
The 1/3 on this cross says I know what goes wrong so maybe if I come up with a
formula I can make a living telling people how to avoid what goes wrong. You have
a whole industry on this planet of
people who will tell you what not to
do in your relationship. Have you
ever picked up one of these women's
magazines? Go to a magazine stand
and just read titles—how not to lose
your lover, ten ways of how not to
lose your lover. This is a 4th gate
job. Let me logically explain to you
what not to do. Don't pick your nose
at dinner, keep your mouth closed
while you‟re eating, and try not to
fart in an intimate moment, all of
these things. The whole thing about
the 4 is that the 4 is coming up with
all of these theories, all of these
formulas about how to make a better
relationship, and so forth and so on.
Now, one thing about the 4.1 is that
the 4.1 comes into the world and
says, all right, I have a mother and father, that's very impressive. No, it is, it‟s very
impressive. And then you‟re watching them. But you‟re a 3 underneath and you
realize right away, because you see them drop their masks, you see them with the
mask of aren‟t we happy today. You see them with the mask of we‟re pissed off
today. You get them differently. You begin to understand something right away.
You don't really know why they're together.
Do you know why your parents were together? Can you imagine what really brought
them together? We can make things up. To the child who has a 1st line for their
personality, they look at that and they think, really. The other thing is that the 4th
gate as a 1/3, they are so sensitive to the lies of relationship. The lies, all the lies;
3s are great at smelling a lie. They know right away. It‟s not quite right.
And so they come into the world looking for a better logical solution. And the logical
solution is all about the other. How am I going to organize the other so that I can be
with them and everything is going to work out fine? And the 1/3 goes through this
whole process of crashing into these problems and trying to have a logical solution,

and then trying to explain it to their lover, trying to get them to go along with the
logical formula. It's like these 4th gate therapists who say to you, well, you know, we
have to talk about this now. We have to discuss this, and why don't we come up
with something that we can try together; if the two of you talk about this, this way…
If you‟re a logical person you‟re already handicapped in relationships. You just are.
There is no rhyme or reason. And no matter what logic does to try to figure out
why, there's no rhyme or reason. All you can do is develop constructs of what leads
to the 17th gate and ultimately organization. In other words, if we‟re going to
organize humanity we better organize them this way because we‟ve got to produce
kids and we want to keep them together, so let's work out a formula for the way this
should be. And if everybody lives it out this way and everybody does things
according to this pattern, then we‟re going to have relationships that are stable.
It‟s mental. It doesn‟t feel. It‟s one of these things about these kinds of formulas.
They don‟t feel; they don‟t know what it feels like. It‟s so interesting that the 1st line
of the 4 is Pleasure and it‟s all about perfect timing. It's very difficult to talk to
anybody about the nature of relationships when you realize that just about
everybody you talk to entered into their relationship incorrectly. So you‟ve got
everybody in a not-self relationship. So, not only do you have what is the essential
aloneness. But you have the vast distance between the true selves. You've got
these layers and layers and layers of conditioning that are exposed in that bond.
After all, we‟re attracted to what's different, so we‟re attracted to what we don't have
and that's what conditions us. I keep on telling people that everything about
understanding life begins with recognizing we‟re in movement and timing is place.
There is a place for everything. There is a place where everything happens. And
being in the right place at the right time is nothing more than an act of surrender.
And regardless of what the formula is, it can never be the answer. It can just be
another construct, because when it comes to duality, we are always going to remain
apart. As a matter of fact, we must.
The greatest threat to the individual is the conditioning of the other. The greatest
threat is to wake up every morning and it's the same conditioning you meet. It‟s the
thing that threatens your very unique authority in this life. There is nothing about
duality that is rewarding. There isn't. People think there is; it‟s the way we‟re
conditioned. It‟s just the way we‟re conditioned, all of these structures that we have.
What would human beings be like if it didn't depend on pair bonds to make children?
What if you could just cook them in the oven? I think basically we‟ll get there. You
just make them in the oven. You get yourself a Petri dish, you do a little mixing, you
build yourself an artificial womb, you slam the juice in and you set the thing on broil
and away you go.
What do you think would happen to human relationships? What do you think will
happen to all this binary business, this duality business? It would fall apart in a
moment. Do you think rave children are going to be interested in binaries? That‟s
hell. You won‟t even be able to communicate to a rave child unless there are at least
three people in the room. They won‟t even relate that way. They won‟t think in
terms of the binary. We‟re stuck. We‟re stuck with binary intelligence—our spleens

and our minds. We‟re stuck in the duality. We know nothing about triangulation, we
know nothing about this experience of being able to transcend in awareness.
We‟re stuck with our binary—mind and body, mind and body, mind and body. Why
do you think we can't meet, they‟re not meant to. Only the genes get satisfied, and
we spent the rest of our lives suffering, because we think we could have done better,
or should do better, or made a mistake, or stuck with the consequences and moan
and cry.
You cannot avoid in this program being with the other. It‟s obvious. You can‟t avoid
it. I've always been connected to the other. I can‟t avoid it. I can remember when
I couldn't see how chaotic it was. It‟s so obvious to me that I have the same life;
I‟m the same man. I see differently, and now it's nothing. It‟s not my construct. I
didn't create this program. I didn‟t create this traffic jam of forces moving with me.
I didn‟t call for it, need it, want it. It‟s just there.
The 1/3 is going to look at the standard logical formulas and is going to see what's
wrong with them and it's going to try to change them. And one of the things that it
will understand or it can understand is that there is a time and a place to find
pleasure in all relationships, but it's never consistent. In other words, the formula
says, the one thing that I can predict as a pattern is that if you do end up flying in
space with somebody that you see every day once in a while you‟ll get a laugh out of
it. Every once in a while it will be fun. Isn‟t that sweet?
You can count on that, folks. I love black humor. It‟s just one of the things to see.
If you have a long-time relationship, if you actually count out the amount of times
that you laugh, a shared laugh, a shared deep pleasure, a big smile, come on, let‟s
be practical now, we know the way that it works. It‟s true. So, the 1st line says hey,
it's not so bad. Every third click you get a smile. You travel a little bit, you get
some pleasure. You travel a little bit; you might pick up some more pleasure along
the way. How nice.

Remember about the 1/4, the whole thing about the 1/4 is that whatever worked for
mama and papa will work for them. Whatever didn't work for mama and papa won‟t
work for them. They will regurgitate it back out as the continuation of a social
interaction system. Everybody in that family seems so aloof. It‟s that kind of thing
where it‟s passed down. This is the way.
So whatever the 1/4 child is going to experience in terms of the way in which they
see duality in their life, this is what they're going to carry forward. And they‟re going
to carry it forward as a formula in which they have a lot of power. You‟ve got a 1/4;
they have real strength in grasping the foundation and influencing others with that
foundation. So they're the ones that are going to be able to take, well, what I saw
was that my mother and father didn't sleep in the same bedroom. That was their

solution. And so they'll become the 1/4 spokesperson for “don't sleep in the same
bedroom.” And when they get their partner, they will insist that what worked for
mama and papa is going to work for me, too. And they‟re going to influence others
in that way.
I'm just using that, because that‟s one of my favorite themes. But, there are many,
many things that you can see within that context. They will take and bring it out.
And remember the responsibility of parents of a 1/4, they are only 2.3% of the
population or 2.6, somewhere in that neighborhood, but that‟s still many, many
millions of people. You‟re talking about one hundred million people. And you really
have to see that those children, that their parents have this enormous responsibility
to be correct, to not put on that false face, because that child will not challenge that
false face, it will carry that false face forward.

RAC Explanation 3
When people read the heading for this line they truly do not understand. Perhaps
now you can understand. The energy to beguile—to beguile in many ways is to
fool—youthful folly—to beguile to succeed despite ignorance. In other words, if we
take this in the context of looking at the pattern of duality that this is going to be in
the incarnative purpose and theme, that you can see very clearly that there is no
way that you're ever going to figure it out, there is no formula. You can beguile and
succeed. You can fool people. And you can fool yourself.
It‟s like the person who falls in love—fool. Don‟t misunderstand me. The whole
pattern is set up that way. And the very fact that they think they think they‟re in
love is simply a way in which translate what is happening to them in movement in
space. Somebody has showed up. You're flying along all alone, and all of a sudden
somebody zooms up beside you. That‟s love. What to do. They not only zoom up,
they don‟t zoom away. They‟re there riding along with you. There you are. I‟m in
love. Yeah, well, okay, if you say so.
But then again, if you think that and you beguile yourself, you'll succeed, because
after all, might as well think of it that way, why not. It's one way of hoping that you
can cross that barrier. It‟s one of the jokes about being in love with love. I'm in
love with love. I think that's wonderful to be in love with love. But the moment that
somebody else is in that picture, it‟s them and love and me, and love is always in the
middle, because it‟s never direct. It can‟t be direct. There is no direct. There is a
medium. And basically what the formula says is let's call the medium in this case
Acceptance.
So we can see that love can be pleasure, duality can be pleasure, duality can be
acceptance, duality can bring irresponsibility, duality can bring the liar, duality bring
seduction, duality brings excess—the lines of the 4 just moving along. And you can
see the way the formula is going to try to express those larger themes. So, when
you get to the 2nd of acceptance: The recognition of limitation in oneself and others

leads to tolerance and the suspension of judgment. I accept that you're flying in
formation with me and so I will suspend all judgment because I‟m going to call this
love. That‟s my formula. Why not?
After all, if you can't win, you can hope. If you can't beat the game, you can still try
to do your best. It‟s the whole thing about duality. With duality we‟re always trying
to do our best because we know in the end we will be rewarded with death. And we
know in the end all that hard work will come to an end. We‟ll get out of it. Hell,
they‟re going to die, too. There is even vengeance in the whole thing. 40 years of
cooking, man, I'll go and I'll be out, and so will you, baby. It‟s the children they care
about; God forbid they go first; your whole thing is destroyed. Ah, it‟s so funny. I
love the movie.
Think about how powerful these 2/4s can be in teaching acceptance, because of
course for them, you can see that for all 2nd line beings, acceptance is one of the
most difficult things. You go into a 2nd line profile‟s house they don't want to touch
anything. 2nd line beings need to be called to “love,” they need to being called out.
They need to be called into the play, into the drama. It‟s all drama. We don't write
stories about relationships that have no drama. They all have drama.
There is, in fact, no such thing as a mundane relationship. There is always tension.
There is always struggle. There are always problems. There are always differences.
It's always there. It‟s human beings that get fucked up by that because they think
it's their responsibility or the others. And then you get into the whole thing about
blame and shame and guilt and fault and this and that and blah, blah, blah. It‟s so
boring.
Human beings whine so much. The not-self is a whining machine. I‟m so unhappy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, stuff it; it‟s not my fault you‟re unhappy. It‟s not even your fault
that you‟re unhappy, you idiot. These are the kind of people that even if they woke
up they just whine in a better tone. Human beings really expect that everything is
supposed to be the way they want it, and when it's not they‟re upset. And then they
think they do something about it.
It‟s like you‟re in charge of the person that is flying beside you; what an arrogance.
Think of the arrogance of that. You're flying along with somebody and they say to
you: change. What do you mean change? I‟m flying over here, you're flying over
there, stay out of my face. I‟m over here; you can't occupy the same space as me.
You have no idea what I am. I'm not changing. I am, period.
Passengers can‟t stand duality. Your personality crystal, your passenger looks at the
vehicle, playing all of this partnership dance bullshit. And all of this stuff that the
machines do, its machine work. Fucking is machine work. Anybody with any kind of
consciousness who rises above their sexuality in any given moment will start to
laugh. Machines do funny things. The things these machines do to make more
machines, it's really insane.
And then they‟re trained to like it, like dogs chasing after a bone. The personality
inside is going, this is nuts. I don‟t want to do that; sticky, wet, dirty, smelly; the

personality says this is machine stuff. The machines do that. I‟m not a machine.
What this box does is what this box does; I‟m not going to get involved in that. I
don‟t want to step down to that level. It‟s not the movie. You don‟t even get to
enjoy the movie if you‟re stuck down in that level. That‟s where everybody is.
They‟re all so deeply identified with their lives, with their bodies, with their vehicles,
with their excrement, with anything. It‟s mine. It‟s like that great scene from
Nemo—mine, mine, mine. All these seagulls looking at a fish; mine, mine, mine.
It‟s my body, it‟s my life, it‟s mine, it‟s my choice, my this, my that.
And then you wonder what happens to people in a relationship. You‟re mine. Right,
sure. You‟re flying over there and I'm flying over here, do you understand that?
Can you ever understand that? You're flying over there, I‟m flying over here. And
the fact that we see each other doesn't mean I'm yours, I‟m mine. You‟re over
there, flying over there, you‟re over there, because it‟s the reality; human beings,
eh?
The identification with the not-self with this thing; they don't know how it works. If
they were in charge of it they would die in a millisecond. They have no idea, and yet
they think they're in charge of everything—their lives, their decisions, their “this,”
their “that,” blah, blah, blah. It‟s insane.
And the 4th gate sits there and says we have to make it logical. We have to work out
a formula. The abstract side says this is a roller coaster. This is okay. The abstract
says, hey, life is interesting. You say to an emotional person you can never be one
with the other and they nod their head. You say to a logical person, you can never
be one with another and they scratch their head. It‟s totally different. The abstract
knows it's all insane. We‟re set up.
The formula is primitive and it was built for monkeys. It was built for Homo erectus,
for God‟s sake; Homo erectus was living in this program. Homo erectus still couldn‟t
figure out—my dog is pretty good compared to Homo erectus. We‟re still in that
program. The only thing is is that we don't scratch ourselves the same way
anymore. It‟s so true.
People forget that; it‟s a primitive program, these are primitive vehicles. The
moment that you tap into the modern esoteric mystical movements that began in the
19th century, a lot from England, and this movement of the synthesis of basically
Western Roman Teutonic mythologies with Indo-European mythologies and you get
all this stuff flowing out. All of them talked about the same dilemma, and it is a
dilemma.
We have a development of consciousness because we are at the end of a round;
we‟re coming to the end of a round. And it means that our consciousness for many
in the fractal, for a layer of maybe 100 million people on this planet out of the 6
billion, where consciousness is really in conflict with the form. It‟s like the ability for
modern humans to be able to say generally in the collective that we shouldn‟t be
killing each other because of this or that—color, religion.

There is an aspect of our consciousness that would like to see the nature of being
and it's totally different from the way in which our vehicles work. At the same time
that you can collectively intellectually say that you would like to live in peace with
your brother, if your brother doesn't smell right at a visceral level, at your splenic
level, you're ready to kill them anyway, because our bodies are different.
These are killer monkey vehicles. It's what we do best, everybody knows that.
There has never been a species on this planet that kills better and now it's really
legitimized. We are a killing species. We‟re vicious. These vehicles are vicious. My
consciousness isn‟t. My passenger is not vicious. My passenger doesn't have a
body. My passenger has rented one; it‟s just passing through. It‟s just watching
this time around.
And inside of this killer monkey vehicle, if you do not separate yourself from its life,
there is nowhere to go. You descend into the horror of this form. You‟re the lucky
ones, you know that. Most of this world is caught in the horror of this form—
starving, disenfranchised, in despair. A billion people who don't have access to fresh
water, three billion people who don‟t make more than a euro a day. This is a
horrible place. This is killer monkey land. This is where everybody is killing
everybody else, where everybody is taking from everybody else.
Come on; see it for what it is. You want to be connected to that, identified with
that? That‟s the whole point. And at the very heart and soul of this upon which
everything is building, it‟s this damn duality. And in the name of duality, the not-self
launches itself into everything. War is an ugliness and pain. You can‟t even have a
peaceful life because you‟ve got somebody flying beside you bitching in your face.
You can‟t even get a ride, man; crowded bus, people yelling, what a world.
So you can see that the dilemma of the 4th gate. What the hell do we do? What
kind of a formula can you come up with for duality? And then you begin to
understand something about the way in which our societies have developed. That
everything about our societies began with the basic dilemma. How do we maintain
duality as an infrastructure for growth? How do you keep people together so that
they can bring children into the world and nurture them?
And all of the things about organization—most people, when they come to Design
and they see the 17/62, the channel of organization, they really relate it to simply
collective organizing functions, as if this is really sort of separate from any
underlying deep motive, just the collective wanting to organize the world, which in
and of itself is an arrogance, but nonetheless. You have to understand the basis of
it. The logical mind is driven to organize because it recognizes that it can't control
the outcome of bonding. And it‟s trying to find patterns that will provide with some
kind of way that bonding hopefully could move into the future.

The 3/5  49  43
RAC Explanation 3
When we get to the 3; I have this, I have the 4.3. It‟s not my Sun, but I have
Saturn here, so as my daughter can testify I have been an irresponsible father in my
life. No question about that. I lived out that formula. And it was that formula in
that being who was not-self.
When we look at the 3rd line it says: Irresponsibility: The general refusal to apply
oneself diligently. Again, here is the key of the way in which the 3 is going to deal
with its relationships. Don't get too involved. The 1st line personality is going to say,
ah, there are bad times, but there are also these good times of pleasure. And the
2nd line personality is going to say, it‟s all about acceptance. It‟s all about
acceptance. No matter what, you just accept it and it‟s okay.
And the 3rd line says hey, just don‟t pay any fucking attention. If you‟re flying along
and somebody is screaming, turn on the radio, man, just forget it. Don‟t worry
about it. It‟s okay; it‟ll pass. Hopefully they‟ll fly off one day, and that strange
screeching you hear all the time will disappear. Can you imagine being a 3/5 on this
cross and you‟re going to explain it to others, right; you‟re going to explain the
importance of irresponsibility. Don‟t expect me to care for you. Why don‟t you care
for yourself and let me care for me; a very individual mind. I don‟t need you to care
for me.
The other thing is that if you're 43/23 and you‟re flying along in space and somebody
beside you yelling, after awhile you don't hear them. You go totally deaf. I have
had lovers who have wanted to take a hammer to my face—will you listen to me.
No, I‟m not listening; I‟m flying.
So, when you're dealing with a 3/5 what it's really saying is that in every relationship
you can find something. That's what it's saying. And again each of these—even
though I'm enjoy making fun of them, because it‟s important to see the humor—but
at the same time you have to see the advantages. Each of them, in fact, is providing
you with a way. It is in the formula. That is, a way within the logic. It‟s very
different from what it is—wait until we get to the experiential abstract gates and how
they deal with duality. This is different. This is just logic. But logic tries to come up
with these formulas.
So, for example, if you have a 1st line in your profile, wherever it is, you're going to
see that one of the ways in which you're going to deal with relationship is waiting for
those moments of pleasure to justify the relationship. If you have a 2nd line in your
profile, you‟re going to try to get to that place where you can simply accept the other
for what they are. If you have a 3rd line in your profile, you're just going to not pay
much attention to it, get by in your relationship with just the bare minimum effort
and expect you can get by with a bare minimum effort.

The 3/6
RAC Explanation 3
The 3/6 is much better at maintaining dysfunction than any other profile, 3/6s, 6/3s,
because within themselves understand dysfunction so deeply that they can actually
deal with dysfunctional relationships, odd relationships in a very sophisticated way.
And so when we come to duality, our impression—you‟ll see the same thing, by the
way, in mutation. The difference is in the wheel the way that works is to really
understand we have a totally different way of looking at 3/6s and 6/3s through this
kind of quarter that you're going to see that they're actually much more stable than,
for example, than the foundation variation which would be the 3/5 or the 4/6 for that
matter.
However, that being said, they will really expect that the ideal is to get by with as
little as possible. The one advantage on this cross is that given that you have
individual mental definition, if they are mostly individual in their design as well, if
their partner is mostly individual, the individual relationship is an empowerment
relationship in which the illusion of being together is redefined as the illusion of being
separate but together. So, this can be something that is very powerful, in that
sense; in other words, a way of trying to get back to the truth. In other words,
you‟re strong enough to stand on your feet, I'm strong enough to stand on mind and
yet we‟re in it together.
And of course, that's the level that can be seen through the 3/6 in this configuration.
But obviously they have to go through the 3/3 phase. Obviously, for many in the
not-self that is going to be very disorienting. And basically they end up being the
ones that try to find all kinds of answers to what are basically just archetypal
solutions that are being given here in the line themes. In other words, they start
looking for subtleties. They try to find other ways logically that they can do things.
these are people that write the self-help relationship books, who try to explain all the
different ways that you could make your relationship better depending on this, that
and the other thing.

one of those answers that—the old story, the tangled web one weaves when one

I was a master, by the way. I don't think anybody who has ever been born could lie
as good as me. I was such a good liar that I didn‟t even know that I was lying most
of the time. Being a 43/23 unconscious, it‟s extraordinary what you can do. And of
course, this is one of the thing about the nature of how logic will say to you, look, I
know that duality is tough, so lie. Just lie. If she asks you if you love her say yes.
What do you care? If she‟s going to stop screeching, it works. Just lie. If she asks
you if you mailed the letter that you were supposed to mail and you didn't, just lie.
Yes, dear, I did. Why get into trouble.
This is logic. Can you imagine; this is how logic works. Logic says, hey, duality is
tough, so lie. And 4th line beings, remember their wave—kindness/nastiness,
kindness/meanness. This is the wave of the 4th line. When you‟re their friend and
you accept their influence, they‟re going to be very kind. And if you reject them in
any way, they're going to be very mean. And one of the ways that they build up the
ammunition to be mean is they lie about being kind. How else do you build this vast
circle that's going to provide you with opportunities in your life?
Think about 4th line people and how many people in their life they smile at. They‟re
liars. Really. This is the kind of child that says to you as you‟re pulling away from
the school, they‟re all my friends. There is best friend number 762. There is best
friend 8901. It‟s their way of just dealing with it.
So logic says to us, look, it‟s really easy to deal with duality. Here is the answer.
You can wait for pleasure and make that all the story. You could accept and deal
with life. You can be irresponsible as hell and do as little as possible for your
relationship or you can just lie; one way or another cheat your way across that
barrier.
It‟s so interesting. Logic says I give up, I don't know what to do about this. You'll
never see this in any other quarter with a logical gate. In any other quarter it‟s
standing there going, I‟m logical, this is it, this is the law, and this is the way it
works. One and one equals two, you idiot. And then you get into this quarter and
logic gets all fuzzy. Logic becomes belief system. It is logic saying well, try this. It
will make it a little bit better. I really don't have the answer, is what it is saying.

gate, all this power and the 8th gate in the throat; this very powerful need to
demonstrate, simply to demonstrate uniqueness: Formulation.
On the other side of the 4, so that I don‟t leave it out is the 49th gate and you can
see that underneath every logical attempt to try to find a way through the right
angle process to make duality work is the potential to transform the way we bond at
the tribal level. If you look at the 49th gate, the 49th gate is the gate of marriage and
divorce. It‟s on the other side of
the 4. When I talk about the 4 in
relationship to duality you can
really see that duality in that bond
itself, that relationship, that
polarity to the 49, but it's also
revolution and ultimately in that
potential for revolution is the
possibility of transforming; in other
words, of transforming the way in
which we deal with the dilemmas
of duality.
So here when we‟re dealing with a
4/1 we can't escape the fact that
role playing is the great lie that
logic gives us. In other words, that
it is logic that is created—the 4/1,
in that sense—has created the
roles that we accept generally
within our cultures for the way in
which a man and a woman are together. And it's all a role, it's all a lie, but after all,
it makes everybody comfortable to live the same lie. This is one of the things about
our civilization is that people are happy to share the same lie; it‟s not a lie any more.
It‟s just life.
So these roles that have evolved, the roles of the male, the roles of the female all of
these archetypes we know that they're under pressure now. We know they're
breaking down. But again, remember how old this program is. The program was
conditioning us simply to take on roles and it's not your passenger that‟s taking on
the role. It‟s your passenger that has to experience those roles.
My favorite image is the logo for Jovian, the guy sticking his head through the sky,
you can‟t stay with your head through the sky, you can‟t. You can look through and
see the duality is something that in terms of the way the gears works that it never
works. It‟s not intended to because it's not what it's about. There is no way to cross
that bridge, because that's not the point, nor should we be looking for it. We are
here to find our own unique authority. And in truly loving ourselves in being unique
that we can embrace anything in any way as simply being there, along with us in
whatever the process happens to be.

But that‟s quite a leap when you're dealing with the biology of this. It‟s biology. In
doing level four and talking about the concretization and looking at transits and
being able to see this concretization of life as it moves, to be able to understand how
physical the conditioning of the vehicle is, how physical the world of the vehicle is.
It‟s so dense. The passenger has no way of being able to influence that in any way.
And we have to see that our teaching, what we teach, is to get to a point of being
able to stick your head through the sky and see the configuration and then come
back in to your body as a passenger and just watch what happens.
Remember, there is no choice. It‟s not like you can choose to be awake or choose to
be wise, choose to follow your strategy, choose any of these things. There are no
choices. There is geometry and there are fractal lines. If you're on the right
geometry, and you're on the right fractal regardless of what you want or think you
will get to the end of your process and you will wake up. And if it's not your
geometry and not your fractal no matter what you take in, no matter what you learn,
that's not where you‟re going to.
Remember what we discussed when we're dealing with level three that the goal of an
analyst is not to awaken their client, that the goal of an analyst is to unburden their
client. Design does this better than anything else that's ever come down the pipe.
It's here to unburden anyone. And it begins with being able to understand the way
you work, the way things happen, why they happen the way they happen, to begin
this very long process, the seven-year process of getting to a point where you can
begin to allow your vehicle to just run on its automatic pilot.
It‟s what I loved about the LSD experience. I was one of these people that loved to
drive when I was on LSD. I particularly loved to do it because I loved to shock
people. And nothing more shocking than being on a trip with me and I drag you into
my car to go for a drive and there you are peaking on LSD and you're running down
along a highway and there is an interesting experience in all of that, because of what
it's doing to the way in which you perceive reality in that moment.
If you don't think about driving a vehicle, you can drive the vehicle, but the very,
very moment that you wonder how you're doing so well, you‟re fucked. You go right
into a tree. They‟ll scrape you off the highway. It‟s the magic. And it‟s one of the
things that I learned very early through that kind of an experience was I have Pluto
in 33.6, so part of my program is to get to a place of really being able to let go at a
very, very deep level. And that was one of those places where I knew it if I don't
stay disengaged I'm really going to have problems; just let the mechanics do their
job. Drunks know this when they're going home. They get to the house and they
have no idea; but, there is this automatic pilot at work.
Well, these vehicles, you can leave them alone to live their life. You don‟t have to be
involved in all that, you don‟t have to worry about the consequences of this and that.
You don‟t have to worry about what your vehicle wants to wear or eat or do or be.
It's just there in the formula; nothing to do.
So what you're looking at here with the 4/1 with the juxtaposition is that you're
looking at is very, very fixed result of the right angle process of trying to come up

with a logical solution to duality that in the end the only solution they can come up
with is lie. And I think that's wonderful. It puts it all in its place. If you don't know
what to do about duality, just lie. And of course, that's just about what every not-
self relationship is based on—lies. It really is.
How many lovers did you have before me, darling? Ah, there has only been you.
It‟s all lies. If you say that they can get upset and they tell you, no I don‟t lie. Of
course, they do. It‟s the formula. You can‟t escape it because we don't logically
know how to bridge the duality gap. We don't. We don‟t know to make it be all
right. We don't how to guarantee it‟s going to be safe into the future.
You feel that vibration now where they have this thing in the States with gay
marriage and whether they should institute a law that bans it and what a bond is
supposed to be. Logic is so helpless when it tries to deal with this because there is
no answer. They‟re only theories. And in most cases, if you touch the core of any
relationship you will find one of these four themes, it's going to be there, that this is
the way that they have discovered how to live in a relationship. But the overall
theme is that most relationships are built on lies, and not-self relationships built on
lies.

The 5/1
We get to the Left Angle Cross of Revolution; well, it sounds really physical. And it is
when you see it in the 49 as the Sun. The 4th gate, the 5th line is called Seduction.
And you learn how to do this in your life because it‟s a blue line. It says: Allowing
others to assume responsibility as a shield against potential punishment.
Now, think about the 5 and its paranoia. Think about the 5 and its need for
practicality. And think about this theme. This theme is—if you think this relationship
can be worked out, you take the responsibility. Go ahead, I dare you. I don‟t want
to take the responsibility because if I take the responsibility and it doesn't work out
I'm going to get blamed, and I going to lose my reputation. I'm going to be the one
that has to suffer because I'm a 5th line being and I'm the one that is going to take
the fall. And I don‟t want to take the fall.
As a matter of fact, my heresy is that is that the only way that any kind of
relationship can work is if you truly understand the other human being. That's the
truth that the 5 brings, that‟s the revolution. You can see it in the line. It‟s a line of
unearned reward and recognition, but if you look at the White Book line it says: the
potential to succeed through the understanding of others. It‟s the beginning of the
process.

Now, there‟s a negative side to that. The negative side is seeing that the other
doesn't understand and we end up with its typical 4.5 phenomena of: you don't
understand me. He doesn't understand me, she doesn't understand me. My wife, I
guess this is a cliché now, my wife
doesn't understand it, which is
what the 5th line seducer does
when it's trying to screw some
young thing and that‟s the come-
on line: my wife doesn't
understand me. My husband
doesn't pay any attention to me,
and it goes on and on and on.
And you can see what the 5th line
is doing. That 5th line is calling us
out in a different way. It‟s saying,
all right, we know what seduction
is, we know we can be seduced,
we know we can seduce, and we
know we can call somebody into a
relationship, but we‟d better
understand what we're calling. It‟s
very important practical 5th line
business; understand what you're
calling. I'm an architect is a clarion; no 5 can make the call, unless they understand
not only what they need to call but who they‟re calling out. This understanding is
important.
And of course, this is a cliché code word for the logic process. And basically what the
5 is saying is, it may be rough now, but maybe through understanding we can make
it better. That the more we understand each other, maybe we can find a place for
this bridge. Now of course, that‟s a great pitch, after all, it‟s a great 5th line pitch.
Trust me, honey, we can work it out. We just have to know each other; we just
have to get to understand each other. And when we can really understand each
other, and as long as you can understand me the way I want you to, then everything
is going to be fine.

The 5/2 always has to deal with the dilemma of being self motivated. Basically 5/2s
are always stuck in a position where they end up having to take responsibility for the
education of their partner. They end up being responsible for doing the call. They
end up being the ones responsible for initiating the relationship. They‟re the ones
that get the burden and as a result they don‟t do it. They don't want to do it. They
don‟t want to take all the pressure.

It‟s one of the things that 92% of the population doesn't understand about what it's
like to be manifestor. Only manifestors are under the pressure of having to initiate
without knowing what the response is going to be. That's very frightening at times.
You‟re a manifestor boy and you fall for girl, the kind of courage that it takes to
actually go up to them and asked them, or to let them know. Manifestors are really
on the spot when it comes to all of that. And this kind of line carries that quality,
that quality that you are the one that has to take the burden if you‟re a 5/2.
Basically what they can be as representatives of any 5th line universalizing process is
that they're the ones that will give us the formulas for the question of responsibility
in relationship. What one has to be responsible for in a relationship, and the way in
which responsibility should be delegated in a relationship. Again remember, we‟re
still always dealing with formulas, we‟re still always dealing with duality, we‟re just
dealing with the way it's marketed, in that sense.

The final formula for duality, I like it: Excess. And here again in the 6th line, where
are we going? We‟re going to the 29. It‟s next door and the 29 goes, yes, yes, yes.
And yes to what? Yes to the abstract. Let‟s get out of this logical trap. Think about
it. Duality has begun with just the 7 and the 4, this deeply logical stuff, rigid in its
pattern, always trying to find a formula for which the fates will tell you there is no
formula. And it's not like the abstract is any better at answers. It‟s just that they‟re
better at experience. At least they go through it.
The 6/2: Repeated and conscious abusive of norms will not escape discipline. This is
all about techniques. If you‟re a 6/2 and you go through your 3rd line phase this line
is very much related, like the one-night stand line in the 59.6, as we‟ll see this is
very much related to the early Saturnian phase, that if you‟re a 4, 4th gate, this
cross, 6th line, that you know that the chances are that first 30 years of yours that
you are going to have your share of excess, that you're really going to go into it.
And remember that you're going to go into it for the pleasure for the acceptance for
the irresponsibility for the lies for the seduction, you take it all with you, you jump in
there whole hog, you hold your nose and you wait and see what happens.
Of course, you go in with the expectation that it‟s all going to be wonderful and
beautiful; otherwise, you don't really get the impact of the lesson that needs to be
learned. You get smacked around. If you don‟t jump in it, if you‟re not
overwhelmed by it, you can never find techniques. Remember always the learning
potential of the 3rd line, its capacity to learn from failure.
So, one of one of the things about the 6/2, the potential of that 6/2 is really to be
able to learn from excess in order to be able to provide, as a role model, techniques.
Again, you're still caught in a logical thinking that somehow logic is going to allow us
to be able to find a way to live with the other. It‟s hilarious. But it's wonderful that

logic meets its limitation. It doesn‟t stand alone. Even though logic is what our
framework is built on, what our genetics are built on, it still isn't the only thing that
makes life work. It can‟t be. It‟s very limiting. We're going to have to see how the
individuality works, how the tribe works in order to be able to get a larger picture of
the way in which each of these processes tries to come to grips with something that
they can never truly solve.
In other words, the illusion of the oneness, the illusion that brings us together
through the genetic attraction that this illusion is something that we can never
achieve; it's always an illusion, which is why logic gives us all these ways to pretend
that it's there, or to see that it‟s there in a positive light. And it's all for the genes so
that they can ensure reproduction, so that they can ensure they were nurture the
young.

LAC Revolution 2
When you‟re dealing with the 6/3 you're dealing with the bridge to the 29. And it's
one thing to theorize about what the roles are, it's one thing to theorize about what
the formula should be, but it's another thing to actually have to commit to it and say
yes, and to enter into it as an experience, and to enter into the experience not from
the light but from the abyss, from the deep within the deep, from the depths of the
29, to try to come to the surface of this deep, deep, deep, void in order to find some
light, you start down there.
And again, to be able to see that yes, the 6/3 will go through its 3/3 chaos. But, in
many ways like the 3/6 in this quarter, they will develop very stable techniques for
maintaining relationships, just stable. And they‟re techniques of self-restraint. So it
basically says logic says well okay, if logic is going to work, if duality is going to work
then what do we need, we need self-restraint. We need understanding. We need
fantasy. We need to be able to play the game. We need to be able to accept. We
need to recognize that pleasure comes and goes. All that is very good advice, isn‟t
it? How nice of logic to give us all that advice. It's the best that logic can do. They
say we‟ll try that; we‟ll try this, whatever.
One of the things you‟ll notice, for example I‟m a 5th line personality, so I‟m going to
resonate to the 5th line theme. I‟m going to resonate to 5th line logical approach.
That's the natural approach. My approach is you're allowed to think you have a
relationship with me. That‟s the best I can do. If you end up being seduced into my
aura, that's the best I can do. I can accept that you think you have a relationship
with me. What else can I do? That‟s the logic of it. My experiential side, in the 30th
gate in the 5th line is the gate of irony. I see the irony in that; but what to do. That
seems to work for me. I‟m surely not going to indulge myself and try to figure out
whether I have a relationship with you. That‟s not the point, at least not for me.

So, what you get to see is that when you're looking at the way in which logic is laid
out here and you look at the formulas for the 4, you're looking at all these basic
formulas that logic has worked out over this whole primitive cycle on how to
convince ourselves to be able to stay in relations long enough so that we can make
more children who have the same problems we do.
Aren‟t the Gods grand, sweet and kind? Don‟t we love the program? It‟s such a
wonderful thing when you can watch the program and not be a victim of it, when you
can see the beauty of relationships without having to qualify them in relationship to
yourself. There are some people I love to fly along with. That‟s nice. That's all

Introduction
When we get to the 29th gate we get to the Abysmal, the deep within the deep.
And we know something very special about the abstract process, is that it doesn't
care about patterns. Patterns are not important. Patterns cannot be trusted. Logic
says, look, if we are unique and traveling in space, it is logical, based on the laws of
physics that we can never become one, it‟s logical. So let's find a pattern that'll
work that will allow us to survive the serendipity of being stuck with somebody else
flying with you.
But abstract doesn't think that way. Abstract doesn‟t think, abstract believes.
Abstract believes that there's somebody waiting for them. Abstract would like to
believe that their soul mate is around the corner or even better beside them in a
bed. The abstract is very different and good thing. We‟ve we've got a lot of
incarnations popping out through this quarter. There better be something useful
about this duality business and the abstract is trying to balance the logic.
Remember that we're talking about the collective and it sets the pattern for all of us.
And that you can see within the duality of the design itself that when you're looking
at either the left or the right you are looking at things that are the same but
different. The abstract and the logic are the same, but different. You can‟t have the
collective without what they are together and what is larger than the two of them
coming together in the quantum sense. What we call collective is the whole is
greater than the sum of its two parts. And if you isolate logic on its own, duality is
an unfortunate process we must do the best to get by with.
But the abstract? The abstract sees promise. After all, the 29th gate is a generative
gate very, very powerful. When we started off we started with logical gate that have
no juice at all. The 7th gate—the throat is not a motor, the ajna is not a motor. Here
we are with one of the central forces of life and this is really where duality isn't just
talk and thought, duality is good up and down work, duality is right in there. This is
all about being creative, procreative; it‟s the sacral, after all.
For years people have said to me, where is the tantra in these tantric channels, from
the sacral to the G? Well, if you want to see the roots of tantra, if you want to see
the roots of primary sexuality, don't go to the 59th gate, go to that 29. The 29 was—
I could get very crude. The 59 only knows that—well, it doesn‟t even know. It‟s like
a dog rubbing up against your leg; suddenly it understands that something is
happening. It doesn't really understand what to do with what is happening, it really
doesn't, particularly these poor animals that are raised in somebody's house as a
fuzzy child. However, the 29th gate is really ready to see how you plug in, how you
connect. It is a commitment to find oneness. It is a commitment to find oneness as
a hope. So, how do we glue each other together?

The 1/3
We have the 1/3s, bless their little hearts. Let's take a look at this 1 theme. We
have The Draftee—I love this line—The Draftee, the ability to adapt to struggle
when necessary but not as a permanent state. This is so wonderful about the gate
of commitment. It says: I don't care about the pattern. I don't mind if it's going to
get messy. Let‟s see what happens,
but I don't want it to be a really bad
experience. In the end, I don't want
things to get worse. And remember
that everything about the abstract is
a beginning, a middle, and an end.
And the pace at which that happens
is not determined by any law or
pattern.
So, the 1/3 Contagion, what they
bring to all of is is they bring a
theme in the life force, the 29th gate.
Remember something, whenever
you're thinking about the sacral
center, whenever you want to think
about what life is on earth, you have
nine strands that form life on Earth.
It‟s the nine gates of the sacral and
out of each of those gates is a
generative life force that is coming
out that establishes an attribute of the totality. So, the 29th gate is something that is
deeply instrumental in the way in which we live our physical lives on Earth, and what
we are here to respond to.
In the Quarter of Duality the first abstract gate is: don't qualify it, don't worry about
it, just do it. The 36 will figure out how to play with it. But the 29 has to just do it.
Don't think about it, don't worry about it. Don't think about what duality is, is what
I‟m saying. Don't worry about these logical questions of “this and that,” what the
hell do they know over there. Let‟s just do it.
We accept being drafted into the duality business. We accept being drafted into the
Adam and Eve business as long as it's not a terrible thing. That‟s just it, as long as
it's not a terrible thing. When it gets emotional, the emotions say, yeah, but
sometimes the terrible is, too. Come on, oh, it feels good. The not-self emotional
being loves pain as much as pleasure. They just do, they indulge themselves in
both.

So, what we know about the 1/3 is that the 1/3 is going to find out right away that
it's not easy to make a commitment. It's not about it's not easy to understand
reality, it‟s not easy to make a commitment because they get the see something.
The 29 does something really very beautiful at its deepest level. It says I'm making
a commitment to you. Now, that may not be true, but it is the way they live it out.
Remember this collective, it‟s sharing. And basically that 29 is saying: I'm making
this commitment to you. And of course, what they're expecting is a shared
response. I‟m making this commitment to you; will you make this commitment to
me? We've both been drafted into this duality program, let‟s make this commitment
together.
Think about the 46/29 as a life force, that is, as a definition. As a definition as the
quantum of its gates, it represents the existential potential to succeed through
experience, the existential potential. In other words, the trap of the abstract life
force in the 29/46 is to stop in the middle of anything. It is the greatest danger.
And of course, the deepest fear in commitment is that things will get so bad that you
will have to stop in the middle and if you stop in the middle you will fail. In other
words, in terms of relationship you get to the place of divorce, you get to the place
of separation, you get to the place of breakup, all of these various things.
And of course, the 1/3 is going to find out right away that commitment is something
that is full of broken promises, over and over again, broken promises. And
remember we‟re dealing with contagion, and when you're dealing with contagion,
you can never forget the polarity to the 29. Remember the magic, the power of the
30th gate, this is the fates. It‟s the thing that changes the movie all the time, makes
life unpredictable. And when you compare it to be other side, to the 18, you‟ll see
how different the experience of logic is with duality than the abstract is. Logic is
always trying to correct it, always. And the abstract knows there is no such thing as
correction. There isn‟t.
As a matter of fact, the one thing that the abstract knows is that the only way
relationship goes through any transformation is through crisis, and that it is crisis
that will establish the strength of any abstract relationship. Yes, we been through
the highs and lows together, these are couples that feel very strong in their
relationship, because they been able to go through crisis together. Logic doesn't
want crisis. Logic wants depth, wants a skilled relationship. It doesn't want crisis.
It wants to avoid crisis and will do everything including lying to try to avoid crisis.
The abstract knows it's there on the plate.

The 1/4
RAC Contagion 3
The 1/4 is very different, as always, because of the way in which they accept
conditioning from their mothers and fathers when they are children. And obviously,
when we‟re dealing with the theme of duality, then we are dealing with a theme that
every child growing up is going to use the relationship of its parents as its model

both either positive or negative. And you have to see very clearly that for the 1/4, if
they're dealing with parents that had been divorced, chances are they will never
have a secure marriage, a stable marriage.
Now, we‟ve already seen that in terms of the way in which we do social psychological
investigations in the West, particularly the kind of university research that goes on.
And we're beginning to see that these things become inherited condition traits, like
having three generations being unemployed in some of the poorest areas of urban
environments in America. It‟s not about confidence anymore. It's about an inherited
not-self trait. And the same thing with the way in which we deal with the role
models of our relationships, violence in the home, all of these things, we can see
how powerful the conditioning, the nurturing force actually is.
So again, the great responsibility of all of you in your work, particularly with parents
of children who are 1/4s to remind them of how rigid a mirror you will be for them,
and how significant that will be in their life, that you can distort, truly distort, their
life by your own incompetence, by your own inability to be able to operate correctly.
The other thing is that logic feels inadequate in relationships. And it feels
inadequate, the theme of the 48th gate, it feels inadequate because it recognizes in
the very logic that there is no one, there is only the binary. And so there is a sense
of inadequacy, the inadequacy of logically I don't see how we can ever be one.
When you're dealing with the abstract you‟re not dealing with that at all. It‟s not
about inadequacy; it‟s the fear of being inexperienced. That's very different. You
can tell the difference between the logical bride and the abstract bride, they have
very different fears. If both of them are archetypal virgins, the logical virgin feels
inadequate and suffers accordingly. She knows she can never truly been one with
her groom. The abstract bride doesn't feel inadequate, but she's afraid of her
inexperience and hopes that she'll be able to perform well and enjoy herself. She‟s a
very different bride.
And this is us, folks. Take bride and groom and remove gender; this is us. This is
the way it works. And this is just the collective. Don't think that duality is a simple
little thing. It's quite a trip. And there are these different ways and then you get to
see, oh my goodness, I'm a little bit of all of this. I‟ve got a little bit of this, a little
of that, and it‟s very confusing. My logic says, it‟s a joke, play a game. My abstract

The 2/4
RAC Contagion 3
They are enormously seductive, the 2/4 Contagion. These are some of the most
potentially powerful beings you can have on the planet at any given time. It is the
essence of the 2/4. We know the not-self 2/4, the 2/4 that is enclosed in their own
little world, that really rejects the outside, that is afraid of their own skills, because
they don't have any real foundation in their own talents. We know these aspects of
them. And yet, at the same time, the 2nd line is here to be called.
Now, when you're dealing with Contagion as a 2/4, you‟re dealing with a
fundamental theme of caution. This is after all, a line of Assessment—caution. In
other words, one of the things that the abstract learns is that where logic will accept
any partner—that's the other thing that is so spooky about logical—logic will accept
any partner as long as they can work them through a pattern that's mutually
functional. But, the abstract says, oh shit I‟ve been there before, I don‟t what to do
that again. I don't like that kind. I don't want that. So, what you're seeing in the
caution is this caution of, okay, I accept that we cannot avoid this duality trip, but
I'm not just going to be pulled in, which will be quite different when we get to the
left angle.
So what you know about the 2/4 is that because of the 4 underneath, because of
their capacity to be able to influence the other, we've already seen that within the
context of duality the 4 has a tendency towards acting. And that you can see right
away that this whole caution becomes a performance because the fact is that when
you're looking in at the 2 window of somebody on the Cross of Contagion, they‟ve
already infected you the moment you look in the window. They got you.
Now, how powerfully they‟ve got you, whether they're going to bring out of you the
courage to bang on the door and actually get snared with them, that‟s another story.
But you have to remember something about 2/4s, 2/4s are always catching whoever
sticks their head in the window. You have this tendency to see the 2 as being shy,
barriers, and the hermit. But after all, the hermit can never be identified as a hermit
unless somebody identifies the hermit. You cannot be a tree that falls in the forest.
You don't exist then.
No 2nd line being for all their enclosure is in fact cutting them off themselves off from
anything. What they're doing is creating a barrier that usually have huge neon
signs, the kind of signs that when you walk by somebody‟s house there is this big
sign that says, beware of ten dogs; that‟s a 2. And you know that they have one
little Chihuahua in the house and it‟s stuffed. It‟s not even alive because the dog
moves the furniture. And there is always somebody out there who says, I‟m not
afraid of dogs, you got me, and they break down the barrier.
And of course, when it's Contagion, it's like knocking on the door of somebody who
has the Black Death. I don‟t mean to make it sound really awful, but just think

about that. You're all excited, you see something in them, boy do you get it. And
then you release it as an infection into the world.
Think about what opportunism really is. The opportunist in and of themselves can't
do anything. I always do the 4th line the other way, I say, you‟re an opportunist,
just wait for things to come to you. Yes, that‟s true. That‟s a nice way of looking at
it. Let‟s turn it around the other way. You‟re a useless lump, you‟re stuck, and you
can't do anything. You can be living with somebody that you absolutely hate and
you can‟t even pack your bags. All you do is rotate back and forth in your underlying
motivation trying to figure out which way to commit suicide—do I use a gun, should I
try pills, maybe I should think about murder, maybe that's easier, I don‟t like pills,
and on and on and on.
And you have to understand that when you're a 2/4, you have to see this beauty,
because the 2/4 is designed to be the hidden disease ready to plunge maddeningly
out into the world, but somebody's got to initiate it. Somebody's got to release the
virus, release the infection. Think about how that works. I‟ve told in health things
that the 4th line carries the common cold. So you go knock on the door of the 2/4
who basically would like to be left alone, their nose is running, they don‟t want to see
anybody, they‟ve just wiped their face, you come to the door, you knock on it, you
tell them you're sorry to bother them, you shake hands, I really needed to tell you
that we‟re having something going on next week and would you, could you kindly,
and blah, blah, blah and the 2 slams the door when it's over, the whole
neighborhood gets sick. And guess what, the 2/4 then starts calling them all up and
saying, I‟ve a great remedy. I‟ve been through this, I know it works. Let me offer
you my advice. And the next time that you‟re sick, you know who to come to,
because I gave it to you. Thank you for letting it out of my system.
So think about a 2/4 Contagion, there is nothing more dangerous than knocking on
their door, you have no idea what you're releasing in the world, none. You‟ve got
this nice closed-in alcoholic 2/4, drunk all day, happy as piss, doesn't bother a soul.
The local place that sells alcohol has made a fortune off this person, they‟re really
nice. And then somebody sees their God damn potential and drags them to AAA and
changes them into this bitter, nasty, snarly anti-alcohol monster that raids people‟s
liquor cabinets and sets their houses on fire. You have no idea what you've done.
You should have left them drunk.
The 2/4 Contagion are dangerous people. And you think I jest. Do you know what
my cross is and profile for my Kironian phase in life, which I‟m presently in? I‟m a
2/4 Cross of Contagion. Don‟t let this virus out, I tell you.

Again, with 2/5s we always end up in the dilemma of their own personal trip. And

to them. It's not so much they have difficulty with accepting. The abstract will
accept whatever is there in front of them. They don't accept what's expected of
them in that. They don't look at the rules, or the pretense of rules. But at the same
time, the abstract is something that is rich in its feelings.
And so one of the real dilemmas for the 2/5 is coming to grips with its own inner
feelings, they‟re closed off and they‟re their paranoid. And yet, they are deeply
seductive. Something that we were discussing outside before and something always
to keep in mind is that whenever you're looking at a harmonic profile, that is, a
changing profile, a harmonic cross, in other words, whenever you're looking at the
1/4 or you‟re looking at the 2/5 or the 3/6 or the 4/1 or the 5/2 or the 6/3, these are
the harmonic profiles, then you automatically have a personality that‟s 6th color. And
the 6th color personality naturally transfers to the 3rd color, which is desire.
So, it‟s something to understand about the driving forces that are there in these
changing profiles. In other words, that the changing profile is so much just simply
trying to get to where it's possible for things to be worked out. The 2/5 is looking to
be a 3/5, which is really a joke, but at the same time trying to bring the 2/4 to the
3/5 as a continuity within the structure of profile.

The 3/5 RAC Contagion 3
This paranoia is something that's going to become problematic when we move into
the unconscious of the 3/5. 3/5 Contagion are the ones that can really make a
difference in our understanding of the way in which we can be with the other. And
yet, they are the ones that suffered the most in trying to show that the way can be
exciting. Logic is never interested in excitement. That's not a goal of logic. It's not,
but one of the primary themes of the abstract is excitement.
And one of the things that you see in the 3/5 is that this is the heart of the
excitement program. Now, the line itself is called Evaluation, and it's about
assessed inaction. Remember I was talking about tantra. One of the basic principles
of tantra is to know when to stop action in order to create excitement. It‟s one of
the laws of tantra. You can hear that in that patina of beings across the planet who
are trying to experiment with tantra and there is only one thing that you hear them
say all the time: Don't come; stop, stop, stop, stop, stop and then, wait for the
excitement and don‟t move, don‟t move your body, don‟t do anything, just wait and
wait and wait.
This is what the abstract can find out. This is what the 3/5 can find out. And this is
why 3/5s suffer from such a bad reputation in their relationships. They do. They are
looking for excitement and if they don't get it the thing falls apart. It's the
compensation for being 3rd line, after all. The 3rd line says, ah, it's so much trouble
to have a partner. However, excitement can compensate for that. It really can.
And the one thing that the abstract truly, truly understands is that to create

excitement you have to create tension. And inaction in the 29, you have no idea
how much tension and excitement that can create.
Now, let‟s go to another level of the 3/5 Contagion and understand something about
it. for me, 3/5s have a capacity that makes them very, very potentially successful as
scientists, as an example, this ability to be able to discover through working things
through and seeing what doesn't work. And out of seeing what doesn't work, try to
find a way that it can work. But more than that, this is the potential of the
intelligence that you derive from experience itself, that the 3/5 Contagion, because
of its seductive power is always going to be able to engage others in the experiment
of duality. But they will fail a lot. And the whole theme for them in many ways is
that failure is sustainable if at least it was exciting.
There are so many ways in which we tried to come to terms with geometry we do
not control. How do you come to terms with it? How does any human being come
to terms with the dissolution of a relationship? How do we rationalize that? How do
we set up a belief system about it? What is our logical approach to it? We all come
up with different ways, and we also try to come up with ways in which we think the
best of it. It‟s the difference between the way my mother talked about my father
while he was alive and the way that she talks about him now that he‟s 10, 15 years
dead. It's like the Pope turning all of these average Joes into saints. They‟re dead
and all right; let us only think the best of them. And more than that, let's exalt them
in some way.
One of the things that is so obvious is that—I have been to a number of ordinary
funeral kinds of things, and I'm always astonished the way in which they describe
people in the eulogies at a funeral, just for ordinary people, let alone the kind of
schmaltz job they do for politicians. And you realize right away that partnership is a
great success when one partner is dead. It's one of the things that you really see
that death really makes the partnership work. All the bad things get kind of—oh, he
was a saint, your father. Are you kidding? My father? Yes, he was a saint. All
right.
And the abstract is the inventor of this program. What it's looking for is to grab
something from each death. In other words, every coming together and every
splitting apart for the 3/5, it‟s a death. And what you do with that death is one of
two things. He was always a son of a bitch. I‟m glad he‟s dead. That‟s one side,
which means don't do it with that kind of being again. The other side is, oh, yeah, it
didn‟t work, but wow, we had fun. There were things were great, I probably will
remember those things for the rest of my life.
It‟s the way in which the abstract tries to build up in its memory program, because
the abstract is history, it tries to build up in its memory program the things that it
wants to keep. It's like when you ask three abstract people who went to some resort
in the middle of bongo bongo land what it was like as a recommendation. Those
three descriptions are going to be so incredibly different and not just experientially—
the one who didn't tell you that there was a swap next door with old garbage in it
and it was filled with rats, because nobody went over there and saw it. You get all
these different stories. The couple that had an exciting time forgets they spent the

first two days vomiting. Have you ever noticed that? Oh, it was a wonderful
vacation. Do you remember dear that we were sick for two days?
The abstract is wonderful the way it does that. That‟s why we have histories that are
lies. It's all distorted. Oh, it was a wonderful war. Yes, right. We were all so brave.
Right, sure. Let‟s remember something nice. You don‟t want to see the kidney pie
that was laid out over the surface and take that home with you. So you talk about
wonderful things. This is the abstract. This is the way the abstract molds all
experience through its feeling that is subjective. And nothing better than the 3/5 to
set up this game in Contagion; none better.

The 3/6 RAC Contagion 3
Remember 3/6s in this quarter are very stable. It‟s one of the jokes. After all, if we
know logically it doesn't work, if we know abstractly that the best you can do is
rearrange your memory. When you get to the 3/6 what you get to is the recognition
that everything is crazy and mixed up and silly, that it all doesn't really work. And
yet, the very fact that it doesn't work becomes the solidity, the stability. If you
actually accept that no relationship can really work, you always can be surprised if
something does work and be satisfied with it. This is the 3/6.
And it doesn't even concern itself with that. It simply says, well, this is supposed to
be terrible and it so happens that it's only a little bit about terrible and that's really
okay. That‟s who they are. And of course, they learn very, very, very, very early
that the duality game is really a mess.
And remember something, in my tendency in is, because I'm trying to deal with a
primary archetype is to put this in the context of partners that are lovers. But I want
you to understand that this is duality in the sense that it's all duality; that it's about
meeting all the others. It‟s not just about this primary reproductive genetic
imperative. Yes, the other kinds of meetings are secondary to this primary force.
But the child that isn‟t going to be sexually mature for its first 15 years and in those
15 years this whole duality program is at work, and obviously they're going to be
conditioned to live it out in the way in which they‟re programmed.

the 4th line does. This is a 4th line personality, it‟s a 4th line contagion, it‟s a 4th line
influence, and it‟s very powerful in that sense. In other words, the 4/6 on this cross
can have an enormous impact.
The difficulty for them is if you understand what I meant earlier about how the 4 is
always dependent on somebody else releasing their potential then you can see why
the circle that the 4 develops as associates within their web, this is the essential
ingredient; therein lies all of the triggers. The fact of the matter is that when you're
dealing with a 4/6 that first Saturnian cycle is going to be fraught with difficulties.
They're not going to have the right circle and in not having the right circle they're
not going to be able to find the bond that they need.
Now, remember that the 6th line unconscious is looking for the soul mate. It‟s ideal
is that relationship is something that can be perfected, that there is a possibility.
And very early in its life it recognizes that's not true, but it doesn't stop it from
dreaming. And I think that one of the things about the 4/6 contagion is that they
can fill you with the dream of what a bond can be, the dream of it. That can be quite
effective after all, they‟re role models. It‟s all connected to the 41st gate. Everything
is. It is the initiating codon. And the 41st gate is a gate of fantasy.
And basically what the 4/6 says in all directness is my relationship with you is
limited. But my relationship with you as well, if I include my fantasy life, is full. It's
full, because as a human being, I can experience you more than just in the reality of
our relationship. In fact, I can take you into my fantasy realm, and I can manipulate
you in any way I like. As a matter of fact, all the things you won't do, you will do in
my fantasy life.
And so, this is the potential that‟s in the 4/6 contagion. And you can see that we
feed that potential because we establish those things, because they‟re a reality in us,
they simply go out into the macrocosm and so we see these things in movies and
books and stories, we see this in the complexity of what it is to be human. We see
all of this discussion about the sexual fantasies of human beings, how detailed they
are, how much they're part of the consciousness, this is coming from the 4/6.
And one the things about this, as well, is what it's saying is that when the 4/6 is
making love to you, they‟re making love to their fantasy, and that‟s how they survive
it. Now, you can look at that good or look at that bad, you can judge that any way
you want in the duality. But in a way it allows them to get through the experience
without stopping. So it doesn't fail, so that they can get to its natural end, which
doesn't mean that it's till death do them part, it just means whenever the natural
end is, which is when the geometry will change, regardless of the rationale reasoning
or whatever that takes place at that time of the change in the geometry.

 30  34
The 4/1
The turning of the wheel is always such an interesting thing, the 20/34 that suddenly
pops up, this busy, busy, busy. Aren‟t the gods funny? Look at what they give us.
They give us a world of 43/23s—I know, I know, I know, I know; 40/37s—let‟s make
a deal, let's make a deal, let's make a deal; and 20/34s—busy, busy, busy. I know
I'm making a deal and I‟m busy. I'm busy making a deal. I know I‟m busy making a
deal. That‟s what the gods gave us. I know I'm busy building a community. I know
I'm busy feeding my family. I know I'm busy, busy, busy. And the moment you see
any of these, we‟ve seen one already, the moment you see any of these three
channels that are formed as an opposition in the wheel that you have to understand
these are driving imprints, that they are very deep imprints, because they always
come basically the same way and they come in a generation. These are generational
definitions.
So we get to the 4/1 and we get to
the Juxtaposition Cross of
Commitment, we have somebody
who is really busy at that. You‟ve
got a cross with a definition. You‟ve
got the 29 as an adjective of being
busy in the now, which doesn't
know how to behave and doesn't
know why it's being busy, it‟s just
busy in the now. I‟m busy in the
now; I‟m busy in the now.
Somebody who comes in on this
cross is going to be busy making
commitments. Their whole life will
be about making commitments.
You can see that as you move
towards the left angle and you move
into the upper trigram of the 29 you
approach chaos. And the approach of chaos is simply the abstract recognition that
they get to the same place that logic does, but in a different way. After all, they‟re
the same but different. Logic gates to the place that says duality never works
because the pattern won‟t allow it. The abstract says duality doesn't work because I
haven't found the proper other yet, and it's always blamed on the other, it‟s not
blamed on the pattern, it‟s blamed on the other. I know duality can work if my soul
mate showed up. So what am I going to do? I'm going to go after every
combination that's available. Go get them.

So when you're dealing with a 4/1, what the 4/1 is that this is a salesperson for
commitment. Go do it; go have it; go be a part of it; find a partner, change your
partner, get another partner. Go to a commune, fuck your brains out, do all these
things. Go out there; do it. This is the call. The Cross of Commitment in the realm
of Jupiter—go out and just do it.
That has dangerous implications in the way in which one human being treats the
other. And it can lead to all kinds of experiences that we in our morality would
consider to be crimes. So let's keep that in mind, because after all, this is a head-
long plunge into finding another; just another. And it can be very cold. It's a 4/1; it
can be very rigid in the way in which that's done at the individual level.
But as a thematic, understand what it is. It‟s the abstract saying okay, okay, this
duality thing, what's tough is finding the right partner. I just have to find the right
partner. And of course, what that means is that in every single human being that
has any kind of abstract activation that no matter who you with, no matter what the
condition of your relationship, no matter how good you feel about it, no matter how
much you think you love your partner, there is a part of you that is saying there is
someone better. There is someone more perfect. There‟s a partner out there that's
my soul mate, that no matter how much I love you dear, I know deep down inside,
because I know how many things about you I can't stand, I know that there‟s
somebody else. Yes, I love you, but there's still all this shit I don‟t like. No, there is
somebody else. I know that.
What a pitch. And it‟s the only way that you can in the 29th gate hold on to the left
angle and get the left angle to really play out this game to the hilt. And then we see
what happens when you're hunting only for a partner. After all, we have to see that
by the time we get through the synthesis we have to understand that what is logical
and what is abstract fits together. It all becomes what duality is.

America. That‟s a classic example of overreach. You want to look at Marilyn
Monroe's whatever—overreach. You‟re never going to have her, but we‟re going to
turn on your fantasy system because we've learned in the 29th gate that there's no
contagion without fantasy. You have to create fantasy. So you create all these
illusions about beauty, the beauty
industry; again, whatever word you
want put in front of industry that
relates to the way in which we are
set up to deal with each other. The
perfume industry, you name it. The
modeling industry, the massage
industry, you can go on and on and
on. And of course, it is overreach.
Saying yes, not having the
resources and it collapsing.
The difficulty with the heresy in the
5th line here is that what this heresy
does is it puts the emphasis on the
fantasy as superior to the fact.
Again, coming to the conclusion that
you're never going to find your true
partner, so if you're never going to
find your true partner let us see if
we can illustrate for you the
possibility. What do that call that in the American West, they had brides for sale?
You could buy a bride. You could bring them over from Europe, you would pay for
them, and they would come and they would marry you. And there were all these
hairy, dirty, lice ridden guys who would cut out a piece of land in the middle of
nowhere, and they didn‟t have good selection, so somebody provided them with a
catalog.
Now we do even better, dating services, chat rooms, on and on and on and on and
on. And we have these fantasy realms that are being created. This is the 5. And
it‟s the overreach. And the overreach is that you are going towards the fantasy as a
way to ameliorate the pain but you‟re leaving behind the true potential. And
everything about the 5/1 on this cross is that they're selling you fantasy.
Now, remember all 5s, all heretics, myself included, if we don't sell fantasy we are
not going to do well. It's part of the mix. It is part of what it's all about. I sell the
fantasy of awakeness. The vast majority of people I will touch in my life will never
wake up. They might get unburdened. I might get to see a couple hundred. But
the fantasy, it‟s very rich. And there is also a joke in a No Choice world. No Choice
whether you believe it or not, or get it or not. But, you have to understand here this
5 is selling fantasy.
And you can understand it, because if you take it down to the mundane level and
you look at the 29.5 in the detriment, which everybody knows—failed ambition—you
over do it, everything collapses, it falls apart. You can understand how it works at

the mundane level. At the mundane level the 29.5 is saying I can do that, they have
a fantasy that they can do things. A fantasy that they can do the job they been
offered, the fantasy that they can do work that they think they can do, they have
this fantasy inside of them.
In the web of continuity, the 29 being the polarity to the 30 that's the harmonics to
the 41, there is this whole movement. So, it‟s selling the fantasy. And of course,
what happens to these people is it falls apart, unless reality and the fantasy
somehow converge. And of course, this is what we do in our romance creativity in a

LAC Industry 2
In the 5/2, the fantasy is private. And it means that the sexuality in many cases is
simply singular, and the excitement is singular. Unfortunately, the way in which the
program works and you can see very clearly because the left angle distributes the
real information is that the human sexuality is almost entirely based on fantasy in
order to create stimulation. It‟s fantasy. And it's fantasy much more than it is
sensitivity or physical touch. And it's particularly so in the way in which the male
operates. But that is not to say that is exclusive of the female, because remember
I'm not talking necessarily about fantasy that you live out at a conscious level. It's
built into us, this inner dream that it could be something.
So, the 5/2 on the surface when you see them will have the tendency on this cross
to be very much busy with what appears to be nothing to do with duality. That will
be the surface for them. They‟re the ones that will have the fantasy love life, even if
they have a partner. They will have a very, very rich fantasy life, again as a way of
dealing with not being able to find the right partner. You can‟t; how can you?
Let's say that you're lucky to meet somebody who has a personality crystal that was
just beside your personality crystal when the Big Bang took place, when it all
shattered, and you both share a common face where you were once connected to
each other, and it's in one person's head center and it‟s in the other‟s and you think,
here‟s this incredible first-generation bond on the fractal. But then, you have
different designs and the designs actually live the life. And even though that could
be, in that sense, your real soul mates, personality crystal as a mechanical term for
soul, the fact is that your bodies will not meet. Your vehicles have a different life.
They just do.
There is no perfect relationship waiting for anyone. Logic has already told us that.
But abstract has to find it out another way. Logic will impersonally see the pattern
see in the end that it‟s hopeless, so let's build pattern techniques. The abstract will
experience the impossible, experience that even in the best circumstances, in the

best relationship, in the best possible moment, there is still a place inside them that
knows that this is not perfect. It‟s not.
And the moment there is no perfection, the moment there is no completion of the
process, there is always this part that says this is not it. So, this is the overreach.
We‟re reaching for the ideal. After all, the 29 is trying to reach the kingdom of
heaven, the 46th gate. It‟s overreach. It‟s like, I‟m going to have a relationship with
God; it‟s overreach. I‟m going to call up the president. Yeah, right, good, he‟s busy.
With what is another story. Overreach.
So, the moment you come into the world—he‟s a 35/36, Laura must be good, well,
it‟s true; there are no scandals about this guy sexually. And he‟s a 35/36. He‟s as
horny as a rabbit; I mean in waves. So, anyway, I don‟t want to get too much into
George's personal life. I don‟t even want to touch George's personal life.
Overreach. Think about us, just us. We come into the world and how do you think
we‟re conditioned? We‟re conditioned by overreach, all of us. We‟re conditioned to
believe that out there somewhere is somebody for us. And that we dream of that
person. What little girl does not dream of the Prince? And what little boy doesn't
dream of a living Barbie. We want perfection. We want a perfection that's not real.
It‟s the way we‟re trained.
Barbie is a great example because if she was alive her breasts would be so big that
she'd fall forward. She has an impossible figure. No human being could possibly
have such a figure. She‟s got a waist that you could put your fingers around. It‟s
impossible. And her breasts are bigger than your head. And little girls play these
things and little boys check it out—where‟s my ideal? I don‟t want to be ripped off;
none of us want to be ripped off. We all want our ideal, we all want our dream
because that's the way we‟re conditioned by the 29.5.
If you really work at, if you‟re really industrious, if you're really busy maybe you can
catch yourself a really good one. It‟s like Sex in the City—keep on working, keep on
working; I‟m busy fucking until I find Prince Charming. It‟s a 5th line theme. I‟ll
eventually find him; I‟ll eventually find him, if you don‟t get AIDS, or whatever.
Persistence despite difficulties has its inevitable rewards. Where the hell are the
rewards? You know what the rewards are? You get to the other side and die. You
can't imagine how many of the rewards that are laid out for humanity is brought to
you by death, because we are all living with overreach. We're living in a world of
overreach where we know that for most of us failure is guaranteed.
When you get up and you see that person whose face you‟ve seen, who is still there
and you call it love, you look at them and you‟ll see that there are many, many
places where you can still go. It‟s just so, after all. There is no soul mate. So,
we‟ve got to give up on the trip. It‟s one of the nice things to see about the nature
of acceptance. Logic says okay, can't do anything about it; accept it, let‟s see if
there is a pattern that will work. For the abstract, it leads to confusion. It‟s just
confusion.

So, you get to the 29.6 Confusion where momentum outstrips awareness. Really
think about that in this context. Having a partner for whatever reason is the point
and not any awareness related to it. In other words, sex for the sake of sex,
partnership for the sake of partnership, you need American citizenship, marry an
American, there is no awareness. It's about driving blind.
One of the things that I enjoy about going to this process with you is that I can take
away the prejudices that develop about lines. The 6 carries a lot of stuff that is very
exalted, it carries the role model and the example. It is our mutative future. It
really is very much the Buddha, the bodhisattva, all of these things. The 6 is the
center of the tripartite mutative process. There is all this stuff about the 6. We
really don't hear too much about the negative of the 6, that all 6s carry the inherent
hypocrisy that they are all basically somewhere inside of them hypocritical about
something. After all, it is their theme.
But there is something else as well. You can see it in the 19.6. There is a coldness
in the 6. There is a coldness that is able to separate itself from the collective
awareness. And there is something frightening in that way about the 29.6 is that it's
not connected to this sharing awareness. It is only about persevering, nothing more.
It‟s persevering; just keep on going, man. Just keep on going, sooner or later,
maybe, maybe, maybe, sooner or later, maybe, but just keep on going. Drive bind
and don‟t care because the answer isn‟t why.
The 29.6, because it is part of becoming your own true authority to be a true
example is to recognize that it doesn't help to try to be aware in relationship. Think
about that. It doesn't help. I'm not saying it hurts, but it doesn't help. And the 6 in
its movement from the chaos of its first segment to the on-the-roof phase recognizes
disengagement and in movement towards objectivity that trying to figure out why
things went wrong isn‟t job. They‟re not 3s.
My sons, as 3s, when something goes wrong I ask them what happened so they can
figure it out because it‟s good for them. It will bring them great advantages in life.
But you can‟t do that with a 6. They‟re not 3s. They realize right away that it's not
about the awareness of the other. It's about their awareness, because just as they
realize that there isn't a perfect partner for them, they realize that the world will
never be a perfect place. It won't. And that the only chance they have is to be their
own role model, to be their own example.
And we can see in the 6th line mutation of our times that basically what confusion
has brought to us is that it's brought to us this increased indifference to the demands
of formal bonding. In other words, more people live together today outside of formal
marriage than in the history of humanity in terms of organized civilization where

marriage was something structured. I guess it's about 40 or 50,000 years old, this
enforcement of a bond in order to secure the future of the children.
And you can see now we have confusion in this. And we have what was called the
“me generation” of the 90s, this kind of thing. You have this whole movement that
is taking place is a 6th line theme confusion. And it is simply about persevering
within yourself. It isn't about anymore trying to figure out how do you get to, where
do you find that perfect role model example on the other side for you. Over; forget
that cookie. That's done; it‟s fate.
It‟s one of the few places where you get to a 6th line and you see that the role model
example isn't something that is an ideal in the sense that it's perfect. Just because
it's the roof of the house doesn't mean it doesn't leak. It could be the roof of the
house and it's the wrong angle and you‟re living in Canada and the roof falls in after
the first snow storm because you suddenly have eight tons on your house. There
are problems inherent in the 6th line process that are there, traits that are there.
And you know that when we‟re talking about 6th line confusion that you can see very
clearly that Buddha is confused and the bodhisattva is confused. You can see right
away that that confusion is there. It may not be a dominant theme, but without
confusion you're not a 6. It has to be there. To be confused is to be confused by
the fact that you're constantly being impacted by the other, yet you can‟t find
another that is right for you. That‟s very confusing. And eventually what you do is
that a part of you disengages completely from the other, just deals with the
movement, just deals with the phenomena and cuts itself off in its aloofness from
connecting.
So, when we talk about the roof we‟re actually relating back to this aspect in the
continuity, that roof phase for the 6th line being where they become aloof, when they
become colder, when they distance themselves, when they try to move out of
confusion, when they begin to see what they learned, when they begin to recognize
that they will never necessarily find the right partner. So stop being so absorbed in
it. Stop being a 3rd line suffering over it, stop being a damn martyr and leave it
alone. Be a hypocrite; it helps. If you‟re a 6th line being and you don‟t know
hypocrisy you‟ve missed one of your most important tools. To be yourself is to be
yourself is to be yourself no matter what the configuration is.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 3
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
One of the things we talked about in terms of the initiation that exist for the Sleeping
Phoenix is that in order for them to wake up they must die first. Remember that,
that's one of the things it is so important to understand about the Sleeping Phoenix
is that anyone who carries this cross to see very clearly they must die first.
Now, I don't mean physical death, obviously, but they're all kinds of death, and it's
one of the ironies. Here we come to this point where we meet for the first time in a
Quarter of Duality the contribution that is going to be made by the tribe and we
obviously begin with, or it is obvious that we begin with, the 59th gate. It is a
genetic role gate. It is well understood and discussed in that context in Human
Design, the 59th gate, and its sexual imperative to simply make more. It is a sexual
imperative to make more. That is: Dispersion: The ability to break down barriers to
achieve union, to achieve reproductive and fertile union.
Now, we saw that in the collective there is this dilemma about the realization of the
difficulty of duality. We've seen the logical response to it; we‟ve seen the way the
abstract deals with it. And both of them are very concerned with the fact that the
actual dual or the polarized relationship doesn't really work. And whether they see
as the result of a pattern that it won't allow it to work, or they see as the other that
won't allow it to work, their concerns are about trying to find something that will
work.
The tribe doesn't care about that at all. And when I say that, what I mean is that if
we're just specific dealing with tribal and we're not in talking about the reality of
somebody's design where you have all these mixes, if you're just purely tribal, this is
not the point. The point is that only when you make more can you die. Isn‟t that
interesting? Only when you make more can you die. And it's one of those things
where you get this kind of tribal consciousness that says I have my children and my
children are carrying my genes, my process, that I have succeeded in my
responsibilities of maintaining the species and now I can go peacefully.
Now, in the context of the Sleeping Phoenix that can be very, very important. In
other words, that for Sleeping Phoenix beings it may be that the only thing that can
help them, those that come in with the Sun in the 59, is that they do have children.
It may be the catalyst they need to die and wake up. What they themselves are
unable to have contact with, can suddenly be placed directly in their face by their
children. There is no question that when we are dealing with this particular cross,
we‟re dealing with an enormously powerful dynamic because we know that the cross
is functioning in the design as a definition, as a life force, that the 20/34 being a
definition with the 59 being its active adjective, then we know that all the busyness
is going to be focused on, not the partnership, but the children. Let‟s have a baby.
And let's have a baby right away. We don't have to wait; let‟s have a baby. We‟ll be
all right. Let's have a baby. Don't worry about our relationship now, it‟ll get better.
Let's have a baby.

Dispersion
There are men that when their wives or girlfriends become pregnant really don't like
them anymore. They have fear of them, they don't like the aesthetic, they don't like
the change in the body, they don't like the change of the patterns and they are
afraid of the responsibilities that are encroaching. But the moment that you get to a
Sleeping Phoenix 59, they actually get really excited. It's like, wow, the baby is
coming.
And it seems that their concern for their partner or for themselves, if they're the
ones that are pregnant, it‟s the child becomes everything. And the duality no longer
matters, that conflict that is so prevalent to the 59 vision that they see at the other
end of the channel, that the child immediately takes that away because the child
brings so much focus and attention, necessary care, busyness, running around,
making a new room, getting the furniture, taking your breathing lessons, on and on
and on.
So the tribe has a totally different approach. The approach of the tribe is children;
union as a way to produce children. It‟s why 59s have a hard time on the mundane
plane, because after all, they‟re driven by an imperative that says, I‟m fertile, I‟m
fertile, I‟m fertile; I want to do something, I want to do something. It‟s there all the
time.

Let‟s take a look at the 1/3. Think
about what it is to be a Bosnian
female who is carrying the baby that
is the result of rape by conquering
troops. And you can have one aspect
of the 1/3 here, and that one aspect
of the 1/3 on either side, the raper or
the rapee, or however you want to
look at that.
Again, you have to understand
something about the Preemptive
strike. We can now call this the Bush
line. Well, it‟s true. The guy has
created a preemptive policy, which is
very spooky because you really don't
know if the other people deserve it or
in this case want it. This is the
preemptive strike. And one of the

things about the 1/3 is that—again, lower trigrams are never well-equipped to deal
with anything social. Lower trigram sexuality is a hit-or-miss business. There is a
lot of banging around. There is not a lot of smoothness and grace in all of that.
So, when you're dealing with a Sleeping Phoenix 1/3 you also know something that
you know that they're very much aware of the fact that they're not aware of what
they need to be. It‟s part of the Sleeping Phoenix process and part of being a 1/3.
And the seriousness; this is one of things that needs to be discussed about the 1/3 is
how serious 1/3s can be. It‟s not even seriousness, because seriousness is so much
mental attitude, it‟s heaviness. It's like you make the foundation out of concrete and
you make the roof out of tiles. If you weigh the foundation in comparison to the roof
you would see how heavy the damn foundation is. It‟s heavy. It better be heavy,
otherwise the house would blow away in the first wind. It's heavy and sturdy.
So, when you're looking at a lower trigram profile you have to understand it is
heavy. 1/3s, whether male or female, like to be on top. Their partner is going
(sound of lack of breath). Never mind; that‟s a heavy joke. 1/3s are heavy. They
just are. So when you're dealing with a preemptive strike what you're dealing with is
an authoritarian approach that says, look, I know you don't particularly like me, but
we‟re going to have a baby now. It‟s not about I don't care about how you feel. All I
want is a child.
Obviously, because of the 3rd line underneath that having a child is not enough, as
we well know that so many children unfortunately have parents that don't hang
around long enough to nurture them to any kind of psychological stability, that we all
these broken families. I know, I‟ve had one myself. And I know the consequences
of having a broken family. And you have to see that the 1/3 preemptive, the
caveman/cavewoman at work, the person that simply penetrates your aura and
grabs it because they smell the possibility of fertility, they‟re obviously going to
make mistakes. But they're also going to learn what we call techniques. These are
the kind of people that will experiment with an opening line. Haven‟t I met you
before? This is a 1/3 preemptive strike.

which your father or if you're a woman, if you're a girl growing up and you‟re
watching your mother, the way in which your mother deals with her sexuality, if
you‟re a 1/4, this is the way you are going to present your sexuality. And the way in
which you are going to go after the other.
Remember that at the low mundane level, and please let's allow that for the not-self,
the 59th gate is a hustle gate. It's hustling. And remember, within the context of its
cross, it‟s asleep. It doesn't know how mutative it is. It doesn't understand its own
potential. it‟s simply very, very busy in the now hustling sexually, whether it likes it,

wants it, needs it, knows it, cares about it, it‟s just a mechanic, a sexual mechanic,
sacral mechanic.
The sacral center is about availability, sexually, availability—the drive is in the solar
plexus center—but the availability. And of all the gates of the sacral center, there is
a basic polarity that you can see. The 34 says, I'm never available, I‟m busy. And
the 59 says I am always available. So, think about this person, the Sleeping
Phoenix, they‟re very, very busy, which ordinarily would mean that they have no
time whatsoever for chasing after. But this adjective being there, that becomes their
busyness, all the time, all the time looking for it.
And remember, it's not just looking for what we see in the archetype of having a
child that makes a difference. It‟s looking for any relationship that‟s going to have
as byproduct more children. It‟s like going into partnership with somebody in a
business in order to hire people, you hate your partner but you love your employees.
It‟s the same structure, you hate your partner, and you love your kids. So you learn
to respect your partner because you both love your kids. And that way you can stay
together because that's the tribal way. And that maybe at some point, if you're
lucky as a Sleeping Phoenix, you‟ll wake up.
But the 1/4, again, this is one of those places you have to see if you don't have a
parent that understands how powerful they are for you as an archetype, then you‟re
going to have a very distorted process. And remember, when you try to change the
mind of the 1/4, remember what we saw in the acting of the 4, the lying of the 4,
the role playing that‟s a potential in the 4, it‟s devastating for them to discover in life
that what they thought was correct, a foundation that they could really deliver, is
faulty. It‟s devastating. In most cases, even when confronted with it, they will lie to
themselves. They will don a mask, and they will still try to live out that archetype
that nurtured them in the first place. So, one has to be so careful with the
upbringing of 1/4s.

Shyness is a strategy. All 2s have this strategy. Remember they put this big neon

time you actually get there? Isn't that terrific that I make you do that? It‟s a
strategy.
Self-imposed barriers; remember, with the not-self, this becomes very distorted; the
Sleeping Phoenix 2/4. And yet, the dilemma of the 59.4, that the 59.4 says, look,
the unfortunate thing is that based on the preemptive strike it looks like it's not easy
to just grab somebody and try to get them pregnant and wait a few years to find
some kind of relationship through the children. The 2/4, that 2nd line being a

natural, it doesn't want to really—it‟s uncertain of itself in a relationship, it's going to
be uncertain of itself. But the 4 underneath says, look, there is a way. Don‟t make
love to them right away. Make them break down the barriers slowly; make them
knock on the door many times.
The 2/4 has lost its power in our world. I tell you, it is one of the clearest things to
me about the nature of bonding and mating that we have done a great disservice to
our children by giving them an example that ignores courtship, good old fashioned
courtship. It‟s one of the most intelligent approaches to any kind of relationship,
particularly when you consider that the vast majority of relationships, as much as
90%, are emotional when the beings come together, that there is no truth in the
now in that kind of configuration. But it does take time to discover the feeling.
And what the 2/4 actually brings on this cross is the potential for courtship that can
lead to not so much love, but that bond that says we get along and in fact, we could
probably have children quite successfully. Now, these can be very powerful bonds
that are established. But the whole criteria to that is that you've got to go through
that period where you do not consummate the relationship, where you really build up
the quality of brotherhood/sisterhood that can actually make that variation work.
And you understand this as being basically the standard tribal advice comes from
this profile on this cross, this quarter. Standard advice; it says, better that you have
a friend as your partner in life than you have a lover that will torment you.
It's actually good wisdom, after all. This is one of the qualities that the 4 brings. It
says, we can be together as friends and we can see that friendship is deeply
rewarding because out of it comes many opportunities, our children will bring us
opportunities, that having children in our partnership may bring opportunities
materially, because we‟re going to need more material to look after the children, and
so forth and so on; and that we get along.
The tribe in its own way understands a difficult duality it. Its first solution is well just
do what we're here to do, have children. Its second solution is, let's be friends and
have children. This progression when you get away from the foundation to the
natural, the natural 2/4 says I can be friends with this person. I don‟t have to have
this deep love for them to have a good life with them. And then by the time these
kinds of couples that live together for 40 years and had two generations of children,
this was a couple that discovered love. Well, so to speak, but nonetheless, that
friendship bond is something that the tribe relies on.
Think about it. In the old tribal structure within tribal communities basically by the
time you married someone you would have known them all your life. Tribal—went to
school with them, went to the village fiesta with them, you went to the parties with
them, you had friends who had friends who had friends, and you all know each other
and they lived around the corner for a couple years and then they moved down the
block, all of this; you know them.
It's this whole 4th line theme of, this is somebody you know. And of course, you can
see that in the small communities of the world this is where the tribal rules, is the
rule. You don't marry a stranger, you don't marry somebody who you don't know,

I don‟t think that you can kill a 2/5 on the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix and have

unmoved of all forces, this incredible balance between the 2 personality and the 5
unconscious. Even the 5 with its capacity to call out is paranoid enough to resist it.
And that you're dealing with a harmony, a harmony that brings an innocent
motivation, a kind of—it‟s hard to say that about beings—they‟re like zombies. It‟s
like they're living through life that they are not connected to but not in an awareness
way. It‟s like there is something missing in their life and don't really know what it is.
And at the same time, they are truly not open to anybody directing them to it,
because after all, they can only motivate themselves. So, it‟s not an easy place, in
that sense, for a 2/5.

With a 3 you change the game entirely, because the interesting thing about the 3 is
that it brings out another level of concern in the genes. We saw that at the 1st line
level that the genetic drive to just simply reproduce is the theme. Just make more;
that will be the answer. And then we get to the 2nd line theme and we saw that well,
you can sort do things with it, kind of. There is stuff that you can do with it. And
you can get people to be able to like each other enough that it can make relationship
something that seem viable.
It's one of the things that the family therapist is going to ask the couple that's
having that relationship with each other that it‟s a dilemma. Or your friends, when
they say no, we‟re not friends. And of course, it makes a difference in the quality of
your relationship. And we all know that, how different it is when you have somebody
in your life that takes on that friendship role.
But when you get to the 3rd line, the 3rd line genetics is not even concerned with
making more. It's concerned with making the best. Think about this as an example.
The poor disenfranchised parents who have a new baby. And what they want for
that baby is at that baby can do better than them, can have a better life than them.
That that baby won't be the failure they've been, that that baby will be a success,
that it will make them proud, blah, blah, blah.
That‟s what you get in the 3rd line. The 3rd line says, I've got all these problems in
my life, things go wrong, everything goes wrong, but maybe, maybe the only thing

that I can do in my life that's really creative is the child I can produce. And that
means that I need to find the right genetic material that will raise the standard of my
genetic material.
Now, remember what I told you about the open G and the open ego and about how
culture and materialism is so much a part of the bonding program. And here, one of
the things you see is that built into us genetically is that every man and every
woman is genetically not simply looking for a mate, but is looking for the best
possible mate. Now, we already know in the way in which we‟re defined biologically
is that men have a deep drive to be promiscuous; in other words, to spread their
seed.
Do you realize that approximately 1/5 of all the people who are alive right now on
Earth are all direct descendents of Genghis Khan? Isn‟t that incredible? He had a
habit of impregnating the women of his enemies, and he would do that daily. It is
estimated that in his lifetime he impregnated, I'm not just talking about making love
to, that he impregnated over 10,000 women. And today, 1/5 of all of humanity is a
direct descendent of Genghis Khan. Genetically, he did really well, after all. This is
the male archetype. It‟s the male archetype: spread your seed.
Now, the female archetype is to get the best male and not care about whether they
stay or not. Men have a huge myth about women. My favorite is the aroma
experiment. When you “fall in love with somebody” the one thing you‟re most
deeply connected to them is their aroma, and particularly a woman. So much of the
way in which a female reproductive genetic system operates, particularly at the
lymphatic system, is that their genes are actually sniffing out the right genes.
They‟re sniffing them out. And you know the smell of your lover, oh boy, do you
know their smell.
So they‟ve done experiments. They will take a woman and they will fill a room with
men and they will blindfold her and she will go down that line and she will sniff out
her lover. It‟s like 99.6 times accurate; they smell them out immediately. Now, they
waited in this experiment until members of the test group, there were many, many
women who participated that some of them became pregnant. And then they do the
same experiment. So the pregnant female comes into the room with her man who
made her baby that she could smell in a dark subway any time and she couldn‟t
smell him. She can‟t tell the difference between him and somebody else. It says
something about the female relationship with the male that the assumption is that it
is the female the clings and it is not at all.
So, when you're looking at this Openness it's two kinds of promiscuity at its core.
It is the ability to let go of any male, or the ability to have any female. It‟s
interesting to think about openness in that way. The way in which it‟s lived out is
that it is the 3rd line, because it's so deeply mutative, that it's the 3rd line that brings
us unusual genetic combinations. I always described that as the lovely blond, blue
eyed Teutonic going to Jamaica and ending up with this sort of milk colored baby as
a result. We end up with a brand-new genetic combination and we can see that
that's something that proliferates. I look at my own children. They‟ve got genes
from all over the place. This is something that is proliferated.

So understanding this 3rd line theme is also recognizing where not divorce in and of
itself comes from, bonds made and broken, but where the lawyers come from that
make money out of it, and where the material separation becomes something that‟s
a big deal. Now, the way in which men got women to cling to them is that men
claimed ownership. This is how they got women to cling to them. They enshrined
ownership tribally.
If you go to any tribe, it is very, very rare to find any tribe in the world today that
actually has as a history the rights of women. The rights of women to own property,
the rights of women to vote, we won‟t talk about the Swiss. I think there are still
cantons in Switzerland where women cannot vote. I think there are two cantons
where they can‟t vote. In the Arab world—just thinking about the nature of divorce,
and all of these things.
So, this is the way that the male claim them and you can see this in the 3rd line. It
says this is this is all my property. The child is my property. I own the child.
Children are chattel. They are chattel. It is one of the saddest things for me; if you
murder your own child it is less serious than murdering a stranger. This is insane.
They‟re property; they have no rights. Children have no rights. Nobody protects
them, truly nobody protects them. This is all this yang trip with I know that she
won't, by her nature, cling to me.
Remember, it‟s simply the tribe‟s way of seeing what logic and the abstract has
already discovered. But the tribe, because of support, because of the need for glue
has to figure out a way how to keep the answer as the solution, the child being born,
and then you end up with this whole property trip, and you end up with money as
the theme.
If you allow women to work in the exchange of energy you give up your power, as a
male. Why do you think that women were kept away from the work force and power
and all of those things? It was so that they couldn‟t exercise their power. It‟s what I
love so much about the story of Odysseus, Ulysses. There is Penelope, the
archetype of the female. You take a man for every season and at the end of the
season, actually a year, you put them in a pot and cook them and everybody eats
them. And then you take another male for a year as your consort, as your lover,
they might even impregnated you, good there‟ll be somebody else to bring into the
royal whatever; but the father—into the pot.
Then Ulysses comes along and screws it all up. He refuses to die. He refuses to
submit to the female authority. I‟ve mentioned it before that for me Homer was the
first propagandist of male patriarchy. He is the one that established the
Mediterranean culture, at least in the Mediterranean culture the supremacy of the
male. After all, he lied so much. He changed the values of the gods. He reduced
goddesses to being servants of the male forces. He changed everything. He
changed the whole game. You find it all here in the 59.3. And wherever you find
that in terms of the cross, whatever quarter you‟re in, you have to see that this is
really a deep part of that mix.

The 3/6 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 3
Again, when we're dealing with a 3/6, again dealing with it within the context of this
quarter is to be able to see the stability in this, and to be able to see this stability in
many offspring, rarely a stable partner. These are fathers that have children with
many women or women who have children with many men and it's quite a common
phenomena. And yet, they are very stable in that.
As a matter of fact, these women who actually have children from many different
men are closer to the true archetype of female than any of the males that you see
around in terms of if a male impregnate two women on the Genghis Khan scale,
they‟re neophytes. But if a woman has children from more than one man, she
actually is very, very different than most women on this planet. As a matter of fact,
in most cultures women could ever do that, even today.
And again, this stability comes from not simply the acceptance of the failure of the
partnership process. In other words, you can't make a partnership work simply
because you have children, and yet, also to realize the beauty of having children,
that the stability is in having the children themselves, that the life can be made with
the children. And of course, in these situations you see the parents taking on
multiple roles.

The 4/6 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 3
This brings us to this theme of I‟m not after you for your money or for sex. I just
want to be friends. Ha, ha. This quarter reveals the 4. When I did the first two
quarters I gave you the positive propaganda of the 4 because that's what‟s there;
that is, their ability to influence mind, their ability to influence civilization. But when
it comes to duality they bring a lot of duplicity, they bring a lot of role playing,
acting.
And where the 2/4 will be legitimate in needing friendship as a basis for a
relationship because that's what will be called out of them, the 4/6 uses it. In other
words, no, no, no, no I'm not really interested in those things; I'm interested in you
as a person. This is the great role. I'm interested in you as a person, blah, blah,
blah.
But we know how manipulative the 4 can actually be, how influential it is. And
obviously, with a 6 at the unconscious level, aside from the tripartite process, you're
dealing with a force that can be a very powerful leading example. 4/6s, part of their
role-playing is to pretend they're left angle. You can see this. The 4/6 is the only
profile that's only all upper trigram. A lot of people who has somebody who is

friendly to them in their life and know that they're actually friendly for an underlying
reason don't necessarily object. There are a lot of people, for example, that make
an effort to be friendly with me when in fact that‟s not what they want to do, but
that's okay. It‟s part of the game.
So you can see what the 4/6 plays here, this Brotherhood/sisterhood thing, but
remember the underlying theme is the 59th gate. And this is the Cross of the
Sleeping Phoenix. And on the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix where you know that so
much is just buried because there is just all this busyness, there is all just this
running around. There is all this running around being friendly.
They‟re connecting all the time; they have a lot of influence. They really do. When
you see 4/6s doing their mating dance they‟re out with friends all together some
place, thriving in that kind of environment. The other thing is that we know that
they‟re voyeurs. It's all part and parcel of the many different layers that you will
discover in sexuality. There is also this availability to just watch. Just be on the
outside looking in. This is the kind of friend that you tell your most intimate sexual
things to, that you can share that with. And of course, obviously they ultimately can
take advantage of that with you.

skill is in sharing. It‟s what it's about. And you can see something interesting here
is that despite the fact that we're dealing with a very, very tribal gate, that when we
were dealing with a Sleeping Phoenix it was surrounded by all this heavy individuality
as the background to its expression, it‟s me, me, me, me, me, then going out the 59
to the other.
And here we have the logic stepping back in. Now, we know what logic says.
Somebody on this cross has a logic part that says, partnership never works, so, let‟s
focus. Let‟s focus on giving our children the best, let‟s focus on finding a way that
we can work with each other and that we can share with each other. It's only then
that you understand the lines of the 16, like the Grinch, that you begin to apply this
to the way works in relationship as an arm moving into duality.
We have 4/1 juxtaposition, it means that we have a foundation at the unconscious
level, and we have the ability to simply put it out at the conscious level. And we‟re
not a Phoenix anymore; we don‟t have to die anymore. We can plan. And what's
the plan? First we get to know them, we find out if they're really good for us, and
then we have children.
It's the basic strategy that is there tribally, it‟s the basic strategy that the deepest
foundation in any relationship can only be established through friendship, and not
the friendship of the 4/6 that learns to be false because of its 4/3 phase, the
friendship of the 4/1 is very fixed, very rigid. It‟s everything to them. The solidity of
that friendship is more important than anything. And for the tribe it says, look, this
is the way. And this is the message that the 4/1 is trying to bring to the 5/1 to
deliver to the tribe.

is to be friends, and the 5/1 says I want good sex. The 5/1 says I want good sex,
that's my heresy. My heresy is, “Look, that‟s very nice what you're saying, I‟m
happy to spend my life with a friend, but I want good sex. I really want it to be fun,
at least at that level.”
Seduction; it's all about sexual power. And the whole thing to understand about
every single 5 is that their ability to attract is rooted directly in their sexuality. It
doesn't matter where you see it, it‟s a frequency. And it is a frequency that is calling
the other. But it‟s a heresy. And it‟s a heresy in the tribe. The tribe never talks
about its sex life. It never talks about its sex life in the sense that anybody would
ever find out. It might get out.

The tribe has embarrassment with sex. Look at any tribal society with very few
exceptions, the greatest taboos are on sexuality. What kind of sex life are you going
to have if you‟re living in Bangladesh and sleeping on the floor with 12 children, two
uncles, a great aunt? Sex is not the story. And yet, we have to see that with the 5
we have our dream. Every
hexagram the 5th line is what you
want. I don‟t want just a friend.
The 1st line down at the bottom that
says, “I have to do this, we have to
have to have children.” Its dream is
the 5th line that says, “Wow, you
can have a friend and it's fun, that
it‟s exciting, that it‟s romantic,” that
it‟s blah, blah, blah.
And of course, it makes the tribe
very uncomfortable. What it feeds
is the 2/4 fantasy machine. The
whole ability to get things out into
the secret life of the tribe, how the
tribal women will have their
moments of secret conspiracy and
discuss the inadequacies of their
unfortunate sexual relationships
with their husbands.
The thing about the 59.5 is that the 59.5 really upsets the apple cart. It does. It
upsets the old apple cart. It takes the tribe and it spins it a little. And it says to it,
“Wait a minute, wait a minute, friendship is the answer?” It can‟t accept that. It
can‟t. It‟s far too paranoid, anyway. “The whole idea that a friendship is going to
turn into a great love, that it is just enough to get along with somebody to make life
worthwhile? No, no, this is the Left Angle Cross of Spirit, and my spirit is only going
to be fulfilled when my partner is good in bed.”
It sounds odd, but when you get to the bottom line of the 59.5 that's all you've got,
the bottom line. They're going to judge their relationship by the excitement of it.
What is the detriment? It‟s the line of the Gigolo, the adventuress, to use love to
break down barriers, to seduce. And it‟s not about producing children as a be-all and
end-all. It's about the sex you have when you're not producing children.
The only way a man can keep a woman is by having sex with them all the time. This
is the logic of the 5. There was a time in our evolutionary process where we made it
twice a year, like anything else. All you have to do is watch your dog or cat get into
heat to realize what a pain in the neck all that is. They‟ve got it all worked out. You
have a season, there's your season, everybody gets hot, every does their movie, and
it‟s over. After that you go back and you live your life.

The construct—men insist in the way in which this is structured that they are able to
have sexual access when in fact that's not what the program is all about. The
program, the genes, just say make more. That's all they're interested in. The Pope
says do it only at certain times and only to make more. It‟s what it‟s all about. Sex
is not to be enjoyed. Sex is not fun, sex is not what you have a relationship for, sex
is not this, sex is not that, and in fact, because on the other side of this 59 is this
extraordinary 55th gate. We know that the 59 is changing. We know that sexuality
is losing its power. And it is here in the 5th line that the heresy of that will die. I've
said many times, I‟m the last 5 messenger. There are no more 5 messengers. The
next one you get should be a 6 where you're not led like sheep, where being the
example is the thing.
And what I want you to see here in the 59.5 is that you're seeing a heresy that is
coming to an end. The tribe had to figure out a way to get along with duality. And
you can see that the right angle‟s way is simply to say, “Okay, let's enjoy the
children one way or another, it‟s the children that make the difference.” The left
angle says, “That's not good enough. It‟s not good enough, it's got to be another
thing that makes it worthwhile that's really good enough, let‟s sell sex. The oldest
profession, let‟s sell sex—59.5.”
You know how many books are available in stores today that are trying to teach
couples who are married to each other how to have exciting sex? That‟s the 59.5
business; tantra classes, for Ma and Pa Kettle. Really, it‟s incredible. Because it‟s
the 59.5 way of saying, “Partnerships are really a hassle, but orgasm is worth it. It‟s
enough.” And of course, we know that in and of itself, it is coming to an end,
because it's going to bring us to the 6th line themes and it‟s going to show us how
that door is coming to a close. And it is, soon.

If you look at the 59th gate you‟ll see that only the 2nd line and only the 6th line have
a blue heading. In other words, the other lines, you‟re born with then, you don't
develop these things, they don't grow. And it‟s one of things to understand about
the strategy of shyness is that shyness as a barrier is something you develop, and
you develop it over time. You're not born with those barriers. Remember, these are
self-imposed.
And when we get to the 6th line and we get to the discussion of the 59.6 we do come
to the One night stand, but we come to a line that has something that it grows
into. What is that? The tendency based on personality or circumstances to accept
only temporary unions that may be otherwise impossible or dangerous to continue.
What a lovely line. This is the power of intimacy.
The 5 sells sex, the 6 sells intimacy. The 6 sells the potential of closeness. And the
beauty that is possible in that. But the recognition that intimacy is never something
you can hold on to. That they learn from the 3rd line phase that it is temporary

anyway. And it's very important to see the process of the 6/2, that the process of
the 6/2 is not so much that the disillusionment of the first 30 years, that the one
night stand proves to be not useful, that they don't get the soul mate that they think
should be possible for them. But what they do discover is that they love intimacy.
If you really want to discover love, then discover love as a medium between you and
it. It‟s my comment about you in love and me, you in love and them, and here it's
you and intimacy and the other. It‟s the love of the intimacy, not the other, the
intimacy that's possible. And in recognizing that what you love is the intimacy the
ability to let go. The 33.6, remember, the deep, deep, deep ability. It‟s one of the
ways to let go. It's the ultimate secret. Let go. Let go of it not being your soul
mate, let go of it being a difficult, let go of duality and love intimacy for the sake of
intimacy, and only for that. And when it's not there, it's not there. But when it's not
there you don't miss it. And when it's there it‟s there, but you don‟t hold onto it.
This is the ultimate role model. And we know that the 59.6 is under deep, deep
mutation. We know that our sexual drive is dying. We‟re less and less fertile. We
have enormous problems with fertility. So, there is this radical change that is taking
place that can be witnessed in the 59.6. It's not the sexual union; it's the intimacy
that matters. That the sex is just, well, that was another kind of glue. But to be a 6
here, this is the spirit. It's the spirit looking for the spirit. Well, find the spirit in
those moments of transitory intimacy. That‟s the secret.

When you get to the 6/3, the 6/3 has a problem with all of that. And remember here
in this quarter the 3/6 and the 6/3s have a tendency towards stability that you don't
find in other profiles. They're willing to accept built into them the vagaries, the ups
and downs, and the ins and outs of any kind of bonding. They are not as Sleeping
Phoenixes totally absorbed with the need for children. As a matter of fact, 6/3s and
3/6s often don't have children. It's really not the point for them.
In other words in the intimate bond, in the tribal bond, that that necessarily isn't
what they're looking for as an offspring. It may simply be the byproduct of their
relationship. It may be the very intimacy itself. The 6/3 is willing to accept any
relationship that provides at least some intimacy, this sense of connection. And yet,
what it's looking at, what it's facing is that there is something out there, lurking out
there that says NO, and that‟s the 40th gate. It just screams NO.

Introduction
If the 29th gate screams “yes,” the 40th gate screams “no.” If you're ever going to
understand the ego center you‟re going to have to understand that half its gates say
“no” and the other half say you better listen. The 26th gate and the 40th gate always
say “no” first. When you know somebody who's a 40 and you want them to do
something and you ask them and they say “no” what you can be sure of is that
doesn't mean you can't ask them again. They will always say “no” first. Let‟s make
a deal. You have a 40/37, you‟ve got an ego and an ego that runs on willpower,
willpower is not a sacral. Thank God being an egoist and not having a defined sacral
I'm so glad that ego doesn‟t work the way the sacral does. It would drive me crazy
to go (sound). The ego is wonderful, it goes (sound) and stops, takes a rest, lies
down, has a smoke, looks at the scenery, waits around, relaxes, gets back up, and
goes (sound), stops, lies down.
The ego is not interested in 24/7. If there was ever an expression, “24 hours a day
seven days a week,” if there was ever an expression to describe a generator, you‟ve
got it, 24/7. This is the generator. And then you go to the ego and you arrive in
Spain, immediately. The sign on the door says “opens at 10” and it's 10:30 and
you're waiting. It‟s the store that says “we close at 2:30” and you arrive at 10 to 2
and it‟s closed; that‟s the difference between the ego and the sacral.
The most mystical thing that I was never told about the bodygraph, the human
bodygraph, the rave bodygraph by the Voice was that if you had a channel directly
between the sacral and the ego you wouldn't die, which is something to think about.
It‟s why we have no direct connection between the sacral and the ego and we are
stuck with the 42nd gate that says “die.” It‟s the only gate that tells you to die. It‟s
the only gate that reminds you that death is the final experience. It‟s like the
beginning of Star Trek: the final experience is death.
Let‟s crank of the engine of the 40, the 40 is the great gate of denial. It wants more
than anything else to say “no” because it is a gate of aloneness. And one of the
most interesting things about the nature of the 40/37, the Cross of Planning, the
global cycle that were a part of now, all the things, is that the 40/37 is at the heart
of what we call our modern or basically civilized sexuality. What are the rules of
civilized sexuality?
The rules of civilized sexuality are that the female is not a sow. In other words,
you're not here to do nothing but pop out offspring. So at some point the tribal wife,
and in the old days it‟s when they had 14 and they said no more, it‟s going to kill
me, most of die by their 11th , there is this thing that says, okay, look we cannot just
keep on making more. At some point it‟s more trouble than it's worth. And
remember that most of making more with insurance, because you lost so many when
they were young, you needed them to work, and so on.

sexuality the 40/37 is the place
where we figure out how to have sex
but not make children. So this is the
great channel of foreplay. This is the
great channel of oral sex. You‟ve got
the mouth in here. This is a channel
of touch and sensitivity. So, you're
dealing with all kinds of ways in
which couples can satisfy each other
without getting into the actual act of
procreation. This is about cuddling;
this is about sexuality at another
level.
And so one of the underlying themes of the 40/37 is that the 40/37 says, look sex is
part of the bargain. So in terms of looking at the way in which the 40/37 applies the
duality and this really applies to duality, you have to see that the marriage bond, the
marriage contract carries with it all of the themes that we have seen in the 59. It's
all built in. It‟s in the contract. And what‟s in the contract is that you have to have
sex. It‟s in the contract. The contract can‟t legislate that it has to be good. It would
try, but it can‟t.
The 40th gate is the gate of aloneness and the 37th gate is the gate of the family.
And when you're dealing with the gate by itself you cannot confuse that with what
happens to that gate when it becomes a channel. The gate of aloneness is the gate
of aloneness. When the 40th gate is part of a defined channel, it‟s not the gate of
aloneness anymore. How can it be? It isn‟t. It is the life force that we call
community. It is a definition. It's very different.

I know so many people that are the 40/37s. I‟m a 40, just the 40, no 37, no
opposition, not my nodes, not my Sun/Earth; it‟s Mars. It‟s so obvious to me that I
have the gate of aloneness. I don‟t know what all this community stuff is all about.
I don't know anything about that life force, nothing. As a matter of fact, my 40th
gate doesn't even look at the 37 because it doesn't have to, it just goes through my
51 to my 25, to my 10, to my 20 and pops out as me and my aloneness and my
insular-ness in my integration. It doesn‟t look at the 37 at all. Remember, if you
have an active gate in a center that is part of your definition, it isn‟t looking for its
harmonic, it doesn‟t need it. I don't mean 37 saying feed me. And yet, the 40th gate
is the gate of the love work. And of course, it‟s actually the love of work if you get a
lot of vacation time and you're paid well and your work looks after you until the end
of your days. That‟s the formula of the ego when it comes work.
The whole thing about the ego is that ego never loves the work; it loves the massage
it gets for the work. The tribal father comes home from the fields and everybody is
saying, you did a good day‟s work, here‟s your soup and here‟s your meat. It gets
properly serviced.
The 40th Gate
So, let‟s get to the 40th gate for a moment. If I were doing this in isolation and I
can't, I would be able to tell you a whole different story, I would be able to say look,
what the tribe tells us is forget about the whole business of having a relationship,
masturbate. The 40th gate is a gate of masturbation. Go ahead masturbate; it‟s
better. Why mess around with all that stuff. It‟s very easy. Enjoy your fantasies,
satisfy yourself. You don't impregnate anybody. It doesn't cost any money.
You have to understand that the 40th gate having that theme allows it to become
non-reproductive sex when it meets the 37. And the 37 by itself doesn't want to
have non-reproductive sex. It doesn't particularly want to have sex at all, except
there is no other way to get to the family. Basically what it wants is affection, and
it's such a joke. The 40th gate wants to be left alone. The 37th gate wants affection,
and both of them have to figure out how to make love. It‟s kind of cute.
But we can‟t look at them that way. You can never separate them, you can‟t. You
can‟t separate the 20 from the 34. And when they're in a cross, when the 43/23 is
in a cross you can‟t separate them. This is not Siamese twins. It doesn‟t work. It‟s
40/37, it‟s community. It‟s a channel of community. It‟s a channel of bargains. It is
a life force in and of itself. It says that the only way in which partnership works is if
you have a contract. If we‟re designed to run along on these duality tracks, then we
might as well figure out a way to do it.
We‟ll make a deal. You do this, I‟ll do that. We‟re stuck with it anyway, so let‟s work
it out. You do this, I‟ll do that; here‟s our bargain. If you follow your end of the
bargain and I follow my end of the bargain we‟re going to do okay. You‟ll end up
trusting me and I‟ll end up trusting you. You‟ll be loyal to me and I'll be loyal to you,

time. That‟s part of the bargain. But in return for be working for you, you're going
to massage me and make me feel good. You're going to tell me I‟m wonderful.
You‟re going to let me know what a great contribution I‟ve made, and on and on.

The 1/3
RAC Planning 3
When we‟re dealing with the 1/3 what you can see is that if you take this line of
Recuperation and you integrate it into the life force, what you basically get to see
is that the contract gives you a window of relaxation that we call the honeymoon.
This is the honeymoon line. This is the line that says, okay, we‟ve got our contract,
we‟re man and wife, let's go off and really have a good time. Let‟s enjoy ourselves.
Let‟s relax. It's going to be hard work, but let's have a honeymoon. And the
contract makes it possible. Now, of course, if you‟re a 1/3 you realize on your
honeymoon you‟ve got a problem.
On my very first honeymoon, I shouldn‟t tell this story on camera. My very first
honeymoon we has a suite at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. I went out one
morning, I went was looking for a book I was after and I had gone to this antique
bookshop not far from the hotel. And when I came back I got into the elevator and
when I got into the elevator there was an absolutely stunning woman in that elevator
who must have—it was about being in the right place at the right time, I suppose.
You can find out on a honeymoon that things aren't quite going to be according to
Hoyle. So, the 1/3 discovers something about the honeymoon, that the honeymoon
is really an illusion. And that you‟d better hope that the contract works. And then
all the fears of the 3 and the 1 together, the fears about that.
Now, if you divorce a 1/3 that has this cross, you look out. They will take everything
from you they can everything, savagely. Nobody is more disappointed in the
breaking of a contract and than a 3, nobody. Threes hates bonds made and broken.
If you're not-self and you‟re a 3, you hate it. It‟s failure, after all. How many
relationships don't work and there is a partner in there who hates the failure, not in
terms of it being personal, but the relationship failed. You‟re going to pay for this.
You‟re going to pay for putting me through this mistake; you‟re going to pay for lying
when you sign this contract. Prenuptial agreements are scary. They come from the
1/3. The 1/3 says I don‟t know what‟s going to happen, so I‟m going to list it now.
In case you and I don't make it, this is mine.

comes the baby carriage, and out of that comes this 1/4, the honeymoon is
everything. It‟s all a honeymoon. And if things are rough, take a second
honeymoon, a third honeymoon, a fourth honeymoon, fifth honeymoon. Ah, it‟s
wonderful. The 40/37, because it is emotional, has to be seen in its emotionality.
That the honeymoon is a horror-moon, there‟s another side to that moon.
You cannot separate the Cross of Planning from emotions. Think about where the
Cross of Planning comes to an end. It comes to an end in 2027, and it comes to an
end with the mutation of the emotional system so that intelligence will be present in
feeling, the emergence of intelligent Phoenix, of emotional intelligence. And you can
see very clearly in Planning that everything about this era of planning, the cycle that
we've been in, all of this has been about the development of the feelings. And the
40/37, the feeling they work is sensitivity.
So, when you're looking at the 1/3 or the 1/4 here, they are deeply sensitive to the
contract and the value of the contract. The 1/4 believes the contract is everything;
to be married is the only way. No, no, no, you're not really together unless you‟re
married. Your children are bastards. They‟ll just follow whatever the mythologies
that they‟re given by their parents.

The 2/4
RAC Planning 3
When you come to the 2nd line and you come to the 2/4 Planning think about
democracy, what we‟ve learned about democracy, that those that don't vote are
democratic. Those that don't complain about the contract are truly the resolute
ones. Everybody knows that the marriage contract is neither a law nor a rule. It's
an arrangement. And it's an arrangement that flows in the wave. And it‟s a ratchet
that it works on, that we know that the moment that you're dealing with duality as
experience through the 40/37 is that you go through this process where you get to a
place of explosion. And yet, the contract already states that this is part of the deal.
The marriage vows, this whole business of “in good times and in bad,” “for better or
for worse,” this whole theme is inherent in this contract. Maybe you can recognize
what kind of a thrall this era has placed us in since 1610. We have been in an
emotional era, a defined emotional era that's going to come to an end and get very
cool. The heat‟s going to turn off. The mutation is going to be complete and it‟s
going to establish its basic stability.
We know something about 2/4s, what we know is the capacity in them to be called
to influence, to be triggered to be influential. And it is the 2/4s that influenced the
way in which the contract is seen. And the contract is seen in relationship as
Resoluteness for better or worse, for good or bad. We will stick it out, because
that's the deal. It‟s the unwritten bargain.
The 2/4 is not a 1/3. It's not going to be enraged that the relationship breaks down,
that the bargain turns out to be a lie. The 2/4 is all ready for the lie. Everybody's

ready for the lie in the emotional world, after all. If you're in an emotional
relationship there are days that killing your partner, maiming them, removing certain
parts, having them dealt with, hoping that they'll be revenged, that they'll get what's
coming to them, and on and on and on. Emotions will take you to just about any
place you want to go in that. It‟s resoluteness that makes it work.

The 2/5  37  9
RAC Planning 3
The 2/5 has to be self-motivated. And in many ways they can only be self-motivated
if they see the bargain is to their advantage. As a matter fact, 2/5s on this cross can
be quite functional. They can even be very, very powerful, as long as they see that
partnership serves their purpose. And they're the ones who have to come to that
place of motivation within themselves that they're actually going to accept being in a
bargain with the other, accept that there are certain parameters in the loyalty game.
And it‟s all loyalty, it‟s all touch. It‟s physical. Everything about the 40/37 is that it
is physical, everything. It's accepting somebody in your aura.
Where the collective and the individual in terms of sexuality have a voice, that is,
they can express themselves in the throat, tribal sexuality cannot. They can only
express themselves in the ego. If you see a tribal couple that has been together for
30 or 40 years, an expression of love may be as simple as a momentary contact,
walking by and touching your partner for a moment, you touch their shoulder. It will
carry all that information that‟s so part of the sensitivity and the physicality of the
tribe.
The tribe has a big problem with relationship not working because they need to
touch and be supported in touch. That's why they try to frame rules around it and
make a bargain out of it. They need the contact. And they're willing to put up with
the fact that the contact is up and down, that there are explosions, that there is this
and that. It doesn't mean the same thing to them, because we know what the 40/37
brings. It brings stability for their offspring. It brings the community. It brings
public services, public education, public health, all of the things that have grown out
of this Cross of Planning that we're living in that‟s coming to an end.

RAC Planning 3
I like the name of this 3rd line: Humility. It‟s tough thing humility in a vain world.
The line itself is just about avoiding negative influences. Don‟t make deals with the
wrong people is basically the underlying theme. But of course, what a joke, it‟s 3rd
line. And you can see that here when we are looking at the 40th gate, three of the
lines have that blue lead, this is one of them. Humility is something you learn. It‟s
not something you're born with. It‟s something that can come to you.

In many ways it's about learning to enjoying the advantages of the bargain. There
are advantages. We‟ve seen that with our modern civilization. I would rather live in
this civilization than to live in some pre-Columbian whatever or go to some exotic
corner of our planet now where we've got people that are living basically still Stone
Age lives. I'm quite happy with the advantages of our civilization. I'm very
accepting of what is. It is clear to me that the 3rd line humility can learn that. I can
see that it's possible for the 3rd line being to find a way to get the best out of the
bargain, to get the best out of the bargain materially, to get the best out of the
bargain in terms of their needs. After all, this is a stream of need that goes down to
the 19/49. There is a great deal of neediness inherited all of this.
The 3/5 has the enormous problem of dealing with projecting in its life that is so
difficult for it to satisfy. It‟s so hard to be a 3/5 and prove yourself. It‟s just so
hard. The expectation, the projection on you is that you've always got it, that you‟re
always going to make it, that it's always going to work and you can see in this
configuration is that when somebody meets the 3/5 they‟re hoping that what they're
going to get of this is at least they‟re going to get those things that they really can
enjoy out of the bargain. I'll put up with the tough stuff, give me something I can
enjoy. I‟ll accept it's not perfect. I know it's not perfect. I see the mistakes, but
give me something that I can enjoy. Don't expect from me what cannot be
delivered.
I‟m a 2nd line 40 in my Mars and I understand the nature of this resoluteness
because I know what happens to me in these bonds that I get through 37s. I realize
that I see that I'm helpless. There‟s nothing I can do but just survive it, which is
really what the resoluteness is all about, you just survive it. I don't even have the
advantage of the 3rd line that says hey, while you‟re surviving it, there are going to
be good moments. And the 3rd line finds them. Remember, there they can really
discover. They find these little things.
It's the 3/5 that if you want to find out who wrote 80% of the positions in the Kama
Sutra, it's the 3/5 here. Working out, okay we can enjoy this way, that didn‟t work.
Well, that always happens, things don‟t work. You‟re not hurt? No. Okay, let‟s try
this one, maybe this one will work. And when we find one that works, let‟s enjoy it.
We can mix this into our bargain. And of course, you can take that through the
many levels.
The other thing is, think about it this way, when you come in on this cross you‟re a
slave. You‟re a slave to work. And not everybody is here to work. I'm not. I don‟t
have a sacral. Work is an alien thing. I'm okay with being alive, which is enough
work. But the idea that my motor has to be on all the time, this is not interesting to
me. Now remember that the ego must work otherwise the tribe starves. And when
you have the 40/37 you have automatically this “I have to work or the tribe starves.”
The work that I do, it‟s like doing this. As a 40th gate all I'm doing is saying all right,
I‟m feeding my kids. I‟m doing it for my children. It's actually one of my jokes
because Jovian Archive Corp. is owned by my children, not me. It‟s really a 40, 2nd

the 40/37 they‟d be down on their knees. Thank you papa, keep working, do a good
job.
They have to work. And the trap of the ego is that it can only feel good when it's
working for someone else and not working for in the sense that it has a boss, but
working for somebody else so that it can get something back. I‟m doing this for you,
honey. And if I want to do XYZ, you do it, right? Something like that; I‟m doing this
for you.
You can tell what kind of fights these people have—you‟re doing it for yourself. Don‟t
tell me that shit. You‟re doing it for you and if I didn‟t scream at you and ask you for
money I wouldn't get any. Don‟t tell me that you‟re doing it for me. What about
that bank account that I can‟t get access to, you‟re doing that for me?
It‟s a bargain, after all. And the bargain is the moment you have the 40/37 the
bargain is you‟ve got to work and you‟ve got to work for somebody. If you don‟t
work for somebody, it‟s terrible. You might as well work for your own genetic
material. I work for my genetic material, may my boys be as good as Genghis Khan,
or something like that.
I read this funny article the other day that there are more blond blue-eyed Danes in
the world than there should be. And one of the most successful sperm labs in the
world for women who cannot produce is in Denmark. You‟ve got all these 18-year-
old Danes masturbating in a clinic and they‟re impregnating the planet. You‟ve got
all these blue-eyed blonde hair Danes being born all over the place. It's very funny.
So you have to see that when we‟re on this cross we‟re on an emotional cycle of
work; reward, work, reward, work, reward, and all of it is rooted in support. I‟m
supporting you by working. You‟re supporting me by being grateful. That's the
tribe‟s idea of how you make duality work. Obviously, we know what happens to the
3/5, the 35 is about demanding attention and getting it.
That 5th line unconscious automatically demands attention. It automatically creates
a projected field that says I can be your saint, you‟re savior, your Buddha, your
bodhisattva, your perfect working machine when in fact it may not be so. And then
of course, the crash of the 3/5 and it doesn't come right away and it has to ratchet
up. And at some point you have your partner screaming at you that you have failed
in the bargain. It‟s very painful.
40/37's are very different than people that have either the 40 of the 37, they‟re
very, very, very different. It's so obvious if you have one or the other and you don't
have the whole thing and you meet people that have the whole thing because it's the
difference between an inactive gate or a dormant gate, or a gate that is basically
inanimate to what it means to be a definition. These crosses that are definitions are
already concretized life forces.

doesn't give it anything that it wants and actually will put up with it. They just put
up with it. If you really want to see the humility that‟s possible in this profile you
won‟t really find it in the 3/5, but you will find it in the 3/6. There is a level of: it is
what it is. And this is the way it is. Remember that the tribe will never challenge

The 4/6
RAC Planning 3
The 4/6 is very interesting. The tribe is the beginning of penta. And the moment
you give birth to a child you stop being a binary, you become penta. The moment
that you have a child come into your life you‟ve got penta. The 4th line here is about
organizing. And the way in which they organize is that the way in which you keep
the pair bond functional is that you bring all kinds of pair bonds together and you
have them live next to each other. This is the beginning of community.
Now, you do that for number of reasons. You don't just do that artificially. You do it
because it makes sense, that is, to be able to deal with nature and dangerous
animals and enemies and the people that live in the next valley and so on. In other
words, there is this natural tendency in humanity to operate in what are basically WA
units, to operate in these configurations and it‟s going to be built on two by two,
which are actually three by three. And of course, out of that you begin to get into
the penta process in which the whole business of being a couple with a child
becomes the norm. It‟s what you see all around you. And out of that you're able to
build a community of the shared bargain, which becomes the underlying tribal code.
It‟s a deep capacity to be able to organize others. The real influence of the 4 can be
seen here, particularly in our time. One of the interesting things about the 4 is that
right now the 4th line is in harmony to where we are in terms of the global cycle. But
it's going to be in dissonance with the 6 that's coming. And the influence of the 4,
its powerful influence is really coming to an end because basically the 4 as a line, as
a theme, the underlying color relationship with transference, all of this is part of the
evolutionary process that is taking us to the rave child. It‟s taking us to penta
consciousness. It‟s taking us to the organized consciousness field.
What we‟ve tried to do in this cycle of global planning is that we‟ve tried to create
this in artificial constructs. We've translated it into a fixed family structure, and then
we built all these structures around it to support that structure. The 4/6 is going to
be very influential in this position. It is the end of the Cross of Planning, in that

sense. It is end of it. And of course recognize that when we are moving in global
cycles we‟re going the other way.
So I want you to think for a moment about where we are. Since 1961 we have been
in a 1st line theme. That 1st line theme is recuperation. We're living in a global cycle
of the Cross of Planning. We‟re in the 40/37, the ability to relax and enjoy the fruits
of one's labor. And what do you think that means when that goes away? The days
of relaxation are over. And the days of enjoying the fruits of one‟s labor or loins are
over. That's what's coming to an end. This is a honeymoon, folks. As far as the
Cross of Planning is concerned, this is the end of the line.
I love the Moon here, the Moon cannot stand still nor will it. The tribe created
relaxation. Take it at the very simplest level. If you have to hunt every day in order
to feed your community, you‟re under continual pressure. So along comes
agriculture, and you know there‟s going to be enough, and you know that there are
those that are going to be concerned with that. And you know, because you are
tribal and you're connected that there's going to be distribution of that. And you
begin to relax.
When you worry about whether your children are going to be competent to operate
in the world it's nice to have a school that takes them, and then you can relax. And
everything about the way in which the Cross of Planning works is that you can‟t
separate it from the demands of the ego to take a break, to relax, to sit back and
enjoy.
So, what do we have? We have all these institutions, we have holiday institutions,
Spain; it‟s one of my jokes about Spain. Spain went bankrupt for hundreds of
centuries looking for gold, and it shines here every day. And after all of that and the
collapse of the traditional Spanish economy and its failure to catch up with
industrialism and all that, all of a sudden, what do you have here? Every square inch
of this country is worth a fortune. It‟s worth more money than all the gold that the
Incas ever imagined having, and it shines here every day. Gold shines and falls from
heaven every day.
So we have all these people relaxing here on their second, third, fourth, fifth and 19
honeymoons, bringing their kids to enjoy the honeymoon atmosphere. They‟re able
to relax because they know their house is safe, what they left behind, that they‟ve
got a job to go back to because it‟s well-organized, that they have a ticket for an
airplane that will actually fly, all this stuff. The Cross of Planning is the cross of
relax. That's the bargain. The bargain is, let's relax. We‟re going to build in all this
infrastructure and then we can all relax.
Imagine a global cycle that has the 20/34 as its engine and the 59-55 as its temple.
You‟re talking about freak-dom. You're talking about no bargain. You're talking
about not knowing where to go, not knowing how to act, not knowing how to be with
the other, totally driven by survival mechanisms. You think that this is something
that we're ready for? We're not. And the deeper you understand global cycles in the
way in which the program operates the more you will see, oh it doesn't slam, the
cycle will come to the end in 2027, it‟s not like tomorrow all that's going to be there.

you‟ll smell it all. It will all be there. You‟ll see what‟s going to happen.
It‟s already happening. The institutions are breaking down wherever you look. We
have all kinds of metaphors for that. The bargain is breaking down; the marriage
bargain has broken down. These bonds are breaking down. The deal is breaking
down, the whole process. And we‟re living with this illusion that it's going to get
better. That was good in 1610. I want to tell you that was great. They were right;

in 2027 not to be seen again, not in this form, not on this planet. We‟re really
closing a door here.
So, the 4 is the precursor. This is bringing the advent of the penta, but on a
mundane plane, on the tribal plane, this creates the actual functional village. You
create a village. The village becomes a community. The community becomes, and
on and on until under the Cross of Planning you get to nation state and ultimately
you get to global citizen. That‟s the whole progression, all held together by the
collective. And you will notice that in the next cycle there is no collective. This
wrapping of the onion will be gone. No collective; Cross of Planning, lots of
collective, logical collective.

When you move away, you move away from the madness. Let‟s follow our lines,
you‟ll see at the top it‟s still going to be hot, because you‟re going to go to the 5 so
you‟re going to stay with this energy. And of course, on the other side you get the
35 and you get this quality of the way in which the abstract deals with the other.
As a juxtaposition cross, this Cross of Denial is that—a simple story for that would be
you‟re traveling through a town and you meet somebody and they want you to settle
down in that town and you don't want to. You would rather say okay, but let's find a
place outside of town so we can just be together denying not the partner, but the
community and community responsibilities.

Think about what that means to the ego. And remember we still have the 40/37.
It‟s not just that ego is expected to feed its own. The ego is expected to donate its
energy to building the church, the community center, be the voluntary fireman,
whatever all of those things are that add on to work and work that is rarely rewarded
financially, volunteer work, community work that is expected of you.
This is what this denial is about.
After all, you don't the 20/34. You
have to see that the Cross of
Planning, everything about the
Cross of Planning is that it's so
focused. It's so focused on the
skills and all the things that go to
make the bargain work so
everything can be more relaxed.
And when you have this shift, you
immediately get away from that.
There is no focus, there is no skill.
So, what‟s the bargain going to be
based on now? The bargain has to
be based on habit and expectation.
If it is our habit to deal with each
other this way we can pretty much
count on that we can expect that
this is going to take us to there.
And if you believe any of that I'll sell you a bridge. But this is the denial, the denial
to be organized into a penta. Often the 4/1 here doesn‟t want to have children. It
doesn't even want to get caught in that whole game. It would be quite happy just
being somewhere with someone. But then again, the 4 can never escape its need to
have opportunity through those that it knows.
This is the kind of force in a community that creates a suburb, if you know what I
mean. What's so funny about these people—I remember that. When I was growing
up as a kid in Montréal I watched, as most of us did, who came in after the war, we
got to see the baby boom and as a result an enormous amount of construction and
new neighborhoods and all of these things. You get to watch what happens. M
father wanted to build a house somewhere, and there was a forest area that edged
the city then, which was quite small. And he bought a plot of land there and built a
house. About a year later, three more houses had been built there. And eventually
it became a new neighborhood. And this is what these beings bring.
In other words, because they‟re 4s and they‟re influential, even though they're trying
to get out of the community trap they end up in the suburban trap. And they end up
having to do the same damn things in the suburb. And the real joke is that the next
move for them is to go back into the part of the city that had been abandoned and
rebuild it.

In other words, you can see this is a very powerful influence. And in fact, they keep
the whole damn thing going. But, at the same time, they're convincing themselves
I'm not going to live with them over here; I‟m going to go out into the countryside.
And when the countryside gets crowded because they moved out and followed you,
you go back into the center of the city and you say they're not going to come here,
only poor people live here, this is abandoned. And they start gentrifying some inner-
city location and all of a sudden you get this movement following them, and it keeps
on going until the end, and we‟re near the end now.
What you‟re seeing now is the very end of this cycle that‟s created by the 4/1 on this
cross in this quarter. We‟re really seeing the end of it. What we‟re seeing is that our
abandoned cores are now attracting the very people that were on the outside and
pulling them into the center again. Now theoretically what that is doing is
revitalizing the spiral, and that you're keeping the core alive by continuing this
process. But hey, we only have 23 years left. It's not like these people that are
going into the core now are going to go beyond that. They're not going to create
another level. It‟s not going to happen. They‟re not going to start a new cycle.
They‟re going to end up finishing their lives in the revitalized core. But that will be
the end of it.
The city as we know it, the way the city functions as we know it, all of these things,
you must understand this is totally dependent on this cycle now. And it's going away
fast, fast. It really is. And all of these cities are beginning to implode. We know
that. We have cities now that are human nightmares—20, 25 million people.

Basically we are designed to take planning and take it everywhere. The moment
that we had the city of Ur, the moment that Mesopotamia established the first viable
village city, it spread like wildfire, and of course, wildfire given the frequency of its
time. After all, I used to remind my history students many years ago when I taught
kids that if you could see Rome in the year 0, you would see a modern city. It didn‟t
have electricity, but you would see a modern city, a modern construct of a city with a
modern city's population, with slums and ethnic neighborhoods and shops and public
transportation and all of the things.

We are the nastiest creature that has come out of the soup on this planet. There is
nothing meaner and nastier than the killer monkey, nothing. The killer monkey
never asks if I go to the next valley will anything in that next valley mind. No, it‟s
I'm going to go into the next valley and if there's anything there I don't like, I'm
going to kill it. In recent years I often refer to the Matrix films. There‟s this
wonderful scene in the first matrix
film where the computer program
that is an agent is trying to explain
to a human how disgusting they
are. And using the analogy of how
difficult it was to think about them
is an animal until finally they
figured out what they were, that
they were a virus. A virus—
wherever they go, life is destroyed,
whatever they touch. They leave
behind such a mess, so much
death. It's amazing.
Migration; think about that. That‟s
what we‟re here for. It‟s not
enough that we can relax in our
village; we actually want to get to a
point where we relax on the planet
as a whole. It wouldn‟t take a
chicken very long to acknowledge
that we‟re the biggest, meanest, maddest, cruelest most vicious rapacious nasty
bastards that ever lived. I grew up on the Province of Québec where the tradition of
the Mohawk Indians was to take priests from France and to boil them alive, just boil
them alive. And people think, how nasty. Yes, that‟s us. It‟s still us.
The whole thing about the Cross of Planning is that the Cross of Planning has
prevented us from being as ugly as we can really be in many ways. It didn't stop us
from institutionalizing ugliness. After all, if you‟re going to control villages and
whenever and you‟re going to get into that trip, you‟re also going to get into the
destruction trip. My community is better than your community. And the whole thing
to understand about humanity is that the only reason that we‟re not one in terms of
our comfort with each other is because of migration. The moment you move to a
different valley you're automatically the next enemy.
And you can see that for many on the Cross of Denial in this movement that it's not
enough to go to the suburbs and then retreat back to the inner core that you have to
separate yourself entirely and move to the next valley. Think about the way in which
formal religions are broken down by sects. The United States, as an example, was
literally settled by religious fanatics who belong to various cults. They were just
cults. It was next-valley business, and next-valley business became the enemy. It's
been like that ever since.

But in the same way that the next valley allowed us to conquer the planet, it also
placed us in competition with the only thing that could place us in competition—us.
Oh, the 40/37 is a bitch. The tribe fights, the tribe kills, the tribe ritualizes death.
The tribe does all that. It‟s vicious; to protect the bloodlines, protect the gene pool.
So you get to the Left Angle Cross of Migration and you get to Rigidity. The
recognition that to achieve liberation all negative forces must be rejected. The 5th
line here and the 6th line, Decapitation, these are nasty lines, nasty. The
revolutionary that demands absolute victory; the power of the ego is maintained in
the rejection of negative relationships. I can't stand these people anymore, I can‟t
live with these people anymore, come with me. We will start a new world, a new
village, a new life; follow me to the next valley. Call me Abraham, call me Moses,
call me Muhammad, call me anything, let‟s go to the next valley and then we have
an enemy to compete with.
And when humans have an enemy to compete with, they go form stones to atomic
bombs overnight. Isn‟t that amazing? If the only thing that was our enemy was a
bear, we wouldn't have had to develop nukes. It never would have been on the list.
But we‟re the enemy and migration creates it. And think about it as a global cycle.
You have migration before you have planning, because we‟re going through the
precession of equinox. And so you can see what lead up to this time of planning.
After all, what did planning do? Planning legitimized what in fact were conquered
areas throughout the world, states that were legitimized. Think about Europe. It‟s
very easy for people to think there‟s this French tribe and there is this German tribe,
but it‟s not so simple. And there have been waves that came across. The first
beings that came across, we ended up calling them Celts when they finally got to the
end. You go into the heart of Bavaria and you have Celtic names attached to
everything. The rivers, the villages, old Celtic “ing,” the i-n-g, you see this
everywhere in that part of the world. Old Celtic Isar, the river of Munich, an old Celt
name.
And there were all kinds of these movements that came across; migrations, one
after the other, streams of them. And in the modern nations that we have were all
developed in the cycle before planning. Where do you think the Catalans came from,
they came from Visigoths that were here and Romans that were here. And then all
of a sudden it gets concretized as a language and a state because it's more relaxing
that way. The city state really functions. The nation state isn't too bad.
So, everything that's going to drive us is going to be here, particularly in the
heretical 5th line—follow me to the next valley. And every heretic does this. I tell
you follow me to awakeness. It‟s such a trip. And the only reason that you move
out of your valley is that you‟re paranoid, and you're tired of them always projecting
on you. I don‟t want to live here anymore. I don‟t like the way these people think
about me. Let me out of here. They always want things from me that I don‟t want
to give them. I‟m going to make my own village. I‟m going to have my own rules.
The most incredible thing about the advent of the Cross of Planning cycle was that
it‟s almost exactly when utopian writing first began. We're going to have Erehwon,

runaway. And obviously, it's going to be a combination of many things. You have a
little freak child that grows up in a very tribal environment and they have this kind of
configuration, they‟re going to run like hell. They‟re going to run from the very thing
that defines them.
The constraint; it‟s like what children begin to hate the moment they become
teenagers is that there‟s always somebody telling them what to do. And after awhile
they just can't stand it. And these are beings that have very, very uncomfortable

There we were with the bestland tragedy and there was the line of the day and it
was this line, the 40th gate, 6th line, Decapitation: The necessary destruction of
inferior forces in positions of power before liberation can take place. And in its most
extreme, that is, the Earth, exemplified by the terror of the French Revolution where
the idea of who is deserving of punishment was cruelly extended to an entire class.
The distortion of the ego through power and authority: Decapitation.
Migration understands that when you move you have to change your habits. That
means that in order to create a new environment you have to have propaganda and
conditioning. It has to be enforced. Those that do not follow must be destroyed.
Those that do not agree must be destroyed. Even in its most positive you are seeing
simply the integrity to remove only the worst of the forces.
Now, there are two kinds of migration. There is 5th line migration that says “let's go
to the next valley and create our own world.” And there is 6th line migration that
says “let's go to the new valley to prepare to come back and conquer what is really
ours.” That's a different story. And one of the things about it is that this movement
to migration is always based on the sense that the bargains somehow has been
broken, that there is a need to establish a new structure in order to make things fair.

So imagine that you're dealing with a system which is feudal. You have a tribe that
operates at a feudal level where you have one family that basically controls the
wealth of the tribe. Everybody else gets pushed around. Here you have a 40th gate,
6th line, they don't start a revolution; they don‟t. They make sure that they find
allies that simply want to leave with them under the guise of migration, under the
guise of let's go to another valley. Let's get away from these people, they‟re sucking
us dry, they‟re taxing us to death.
And then they go to that other valley and while they‟re in that other valley, they
begin to plot, because when you leave you give up so much. And they want to go
back, and they want to get it. Now look, in this wonderful movie of ours, that as
you're going along here and you get to the 40th gate, the hot is going to end, you‟re
going to end up now going into the mind. You‟re going to go through a definition;
you‟re going to go through the 64/47.
Think about the tribe as a genetic pool for moment. And think about what migration
really is. Migration is a division of a genetic pool. And the moment in human beings
that two genetic pools are separated from each other they automatically both attract
and repel. It‟s just an obvious. They automatically attract and repel. And that
everything at the deepest level of the tribal warrior—26th gate—at the deepest level
of the tribal warrior is to make sure that another genetic pool doesn't dominate over
yours.
Why do you think that genocide is such a common thing? And it's much more
common than our history will admit. Genocide this is an old game. You go in, you
kill all the men, you kill all the boys, you impregnate the women, you bring them
into your genetic pool, you expand your genetic pool, and you move forward. So,
when you're dealing with decapitation, what I want you to understand about this is
that this is an attempt to refine the genetic pool. And out of that you can get every
kind of horror story you want. But after all, it‟s a mutative process. It's about
controlling the genetic pool.
So you split up the pool, the 6 goes to the other valley, and then it waits and it waits
and then it goes back and it tries to destroy the other genetic pool that it came from
to dominate. Almost every single thing that you can imagine about antiquity and the
movement of culture is entirely based on this process. Go to a different valley,
eventually go back and kill.
And when I say go back and kill, it‟s not in a life time, please don't misunderstand
that. I‟m not talking about 20 years later you come back and do that. In fact,
historically some of it takes thousands of years, and then you end up with a culture
that's developed over here and a culture that's developed over here, and they're
automatically going to be in conflict, automatically. And in order for one culture to
dominate it needs to destroy the potential of the genetic pool, and it does.
Where are the Etruscans? What happened to them? Where the hell are they? They
got wiped out. Only the blood of their women survives. They were eliminated and
their culture absorbed and instantaneously a much more primitive culture went

(breath in) like a flower. What do you think the Indo-Europeans did for the
Dravidians? It‟s such a movie.
Anyway, I want you to understand decapitation from this level. By the way, it‟s very
clear on the mundane level. After all, this is a definition. It means that there is
going to be no way that there is going to be a bargain with forces that are
unacceptable. No way. This is a vicious line. So it should be, after all.
And of course, when you seen only in isolation, somebody who has just the 40, the
6th line, you will see right away that it operates as a very, very, very strict denial
system. We know that because the 6 is going to go to its tripartite process that we
know that the way in which this movement has been taking place at the
psychological level was changed with the advent of the rave in 1781. And what we
know is that this need to separate oneself from the tribe comes in this first 30 years.
In other words, in the trial and error 3-3 period this is when it really goes out there.
And remember, they‟re hermits underneath. It's natural for them to go off and
create their own environment and their own environment that operates through their
laws and their way and this is not planning, this is migration. It also says something
about all 6th lines. In genetic continuity every 6th line carries decapitation. As I said,
I know this in my 28th gate in 6th line; it's often so obvious to me that I should
simply kill people in the now because they're useless. They‟re just taking up space
in the consciousness field. They‟re not doing a very good job filtering. And if my
sword was strong enough and sharp enough I wouldn‟t have to do time or be
executed. I‟d kill them in a moment.
That‟s what the 6 says—take off their heads. You know that being beheaded,
interestingly enough, is a symbol of enlightenment. To lose your head is a very old
symbol of enlightenment. How nice. Off with their heads. Decapitation; how
wonderful.
Well, you know what happens is that all of this leads to a confusion over the nature
of our history. It leads to the problems of trying to make sense out of what
partnership is anyway. You can see what happens to duality the moment you have
definition. The moment you have definition, duality is subjugated to the bargain.
there is no individuality, there is no freedom, there is no oneness, in that sense, it's
all just—hey look, this is the bargain, this is the trap, this is the way you do this, you
provide, you serve, you work, you have children, keep them going; that‟s it. And
you find a little bit of this and that and whatever.
Every single theme in the vehicle, the collective, the tribal, the individual, and we
still haven't tasted the individual, all have to deal with this dilemma in this quarter.
And migration is one of those ways that they try to do it. They try to select the
perfect people to come with them. They select couples to come migrate, to resettle
with them, to have a whole new way in which the bargain works in the duality.
But the 6th line here is totally wrapped up its authority; the authority to say no and
not simply no to the connection, but no to your right to even exist. The ego is nasty.
The ego through the 26 and 40 what you're seeing is the binary that in order to fight

So the 6/3 here basically tries to stop everyone in migration from even connecting or
relating to where they came from. It is a focus on the potential of perfection. And
that perfection is not a matter of being able to be one, it‟s not a matter of not finding
the right partner, but it‟s only about living in the right society. This is the ultimate
statement of the tribe. The tribe says, it isn‟t about being one and it isn‟t about just
having children.
The thing that makes it work is if we live in a society where we have support. That‟s
the tribal answer. If you‟re a mother and you‟re having problems with your child,
your next door neighbor is a mother who is having problems with her child, you have
support. If you‟re having troubles with your partner, you have support. There are
support mechanisms simply that are built in.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 3

Introduction
It is exceedingly difficult for anybody that has in their design the 63 and the 64
regardless of its cross, wherever you can find it, that when you see that the 63-64
are really not part of the process. Not only that, in the evolutionary sense it‟s
something that's out there that we actually never get to. In fact, when it comes to
the way in which the cycle operates we actually stop at the 62nd step.
So in many ways the 63-64 it is very, very disturbing in that in a way it‟s never
really connected to life. Now, isn‟t that interesting and it's interesting in the sense
that it is the way in which the collective pours the information of how we take in life
back into our conceptual zone. In fact, when we think about the head center, we
think about the head center as being part of mind, or at least what we call brain.
That the head center itself is this deep gray area of the brain. But the thing is, the
gray area doesn't think.
The 64-63 do not think. That whole process of being inspired is the byproduct of
definition, life force. And we know the gates that are not in a definition are in a
sense inanimate, are in a sense just not there. And when you‟re dealing with a 63
and a 64, they're not connected to the life itself. They‟re simply taking in and taking
in and taking in. They don't even know, like dolphins, they don't know when they
should breathe. They just take in and take in and take in and take in and it‟s it's one
of the things we know about the deep gray area is that it really is infinite in the
sense of what can be taken in.
But it's not being processed. So when you're dealing with a cross we've got a Sun in
the 64th gate, you know that on this Cross of Consciousness you have somebody
that‟s not connected to the world. You can always understand consciousness by
looking at the non-mental part, the 5 and the 35, because what you're looking and of
course you have matching circuitry, so what you're looking at is that the pattern that
the process of pattern whatever exists in pattern is what flows into the 63. It's
flowing in.
One of the things that is so interesting to me about 63-64 and it's slightly different
with the 61 is that they're almost nostrils for me. It‟s like they‟re just taking it in, so
the 63 is sucking up the pattern experience and the 64 is taking in the result of the
experiential cycle. In other words, the 35 being the fulfillment of the human
experiential way that‟s rooted in the 41st gate and in that whole stream of feeling.
What happens when you get to a place where expectation is not fulfilled, all of that is
breathed in or taken in by the 64.
So, what does that mean when it comes to duality? These are people that have a
very unusual connection to love, regardless of whether they‟re right angle or left
angle. They seem to fall in love with something that nobody else sees. They will see
beauty where there is no beauty, and yet perhaps the beauty is actually there. They
will see intelligence where there doesn't seem to be intelligence, yet perhaps the
intelligence is there. And the most interesting thing about the 63-64 is that what it's

taking in, because it is not being processed, they don't have a physical connection to
anything they meet in their geometry.
Now remember that we‟re more than a cross. We are the characteristics of our
design and in the characteristics you‟re going to have things that are going to bring
those kinds of interactions at another level, but from the plane of purpose they‟re
not connected with the temporal personal physical connection. Unfortunately, for
right angles it's very confusing; after all, it‟s the gate of confusion. It‟s very
confusing in the sense that they don't have the facility to be able to at least grab
onto what they actually are taking in from somebody else.
Think about the personality crystal itself. It sits in the head center. And if you see
the design in a bodygraph, you know that the head center penetrates the body, goes
above the body, the personality crystal is not in the physical form. It‟s within the
aura field, but it‟s not in the physical form.
And 63-64s are like that. They‟re sitting up there above the physical form. And
they're not in a sense looking through, how can I describe this, you know how I talk
about the passenger, this is a passenger in which instead of there being windows
around, which is normal, so you‟re looking to the left and you‟re looking to the right
and you‟re looking back and you‟re looking forward. They have a window that looks
up, and all the other windows are dark. They have no idea what the hell is going on.
And if they see anything whizzing by up there, that‟s the hook. Ah, that‟s what it‟s
about. But only they see that way.
They‟re very odd creatures. It‟s what makes them so interesting, because while
they‟re looking up and something passes by, which has nothing to do with their
geometry, they ask a question. It‟s where all the whys come from, it‟s looking up.
If you were really looking around, you wouldn‟t ask why, because everything that‟s
there is intended to be seen. But with a 63-64, because they don't filter through the
vehicle, and by the way again it's different for the 61 because that‟s all acoustic,
they‟re looking up.

The 1/3
So, what do we do with a 1/3 Cross of Consciousness, Sun in the 64th gate? When I
did the first two quarters I showed you how beautiful the Cross of Conscious can be,
how valuable it is to the development of consciousness of humanity, how essential it
is. It actually is through the Cross of Consciousness that the difference between the
abstract and the logic can finally dissolve because they're not different. They‟re two
parts of the same thing. And through the Cross of Consciousness it's possible to be
able to emerge the abstract and the logic.

Okay, that's the nice part. We saw that in mind, we saw with the development of
civilization in the form. But here it's different. Here we‟re dealing with the theme of
duality. This is not the 63rd gate that we looked at. This is not the 35 that we
looked at. This is right in the middle of the whole duality business. Not only that,
when you get to the 64.6 the very next gate is its definition, the 47.1, right one after
the other. So a 1/3 here, I love this line, it says: Conditions. What‟s the weather?
They‟re always looking for the conditions.
And of course, one of the things that the 64 discovers right away, they know it
immediately is that they realize from their 3 underneath that nobody knows anything
about anything. If they meet the
wisest person, there is a part of
them, because they are looking like
this, that will find something wrong
with it. All they can do is keep on
processing. And if you‟re a 1/3, it‟s
possible, but remember the
heaviness of it. There is a heaviness
to the 1/3. It means that there is a
seriousness that can lead to a
tremendous amount of distress
because of confusion. It‟s about
avoiding disorder, and yet the whole
thing is that for the 63 or the 64
disorder seems to be what everything
is.
Remember in the analogy of the
monopole‟s work and geometry and
trajectory that everything about the
way in which we‟re supposed to
experience existence is on that linear field. That‟s the limitation being a passenger in
a form vehicle and we‟re only supposed to be looking in certain ways. And the 63rd
and the 64th are steps in evolution that we‟re not even going to get to, that if we
ever were going to get to it, it‟s thousands of years away.
In other words, the moment you have the 63-64 it's looking somewhere else, and it
only sees chaos. It only sees confusion, in the same way that the 63 looks this way
and says wait a minute, there‟s something wrong with the pattern. Well, they‟re not
looking at the pattern in the way it‟s constructed for everyone else. They're looking
at the pattern from a unique perspective. They‟re actually riding on top of the
vehicle, in that sense. But their whole focus is another trajectory, another angle.
If you look at these lines you get to see right away that the most confusing
hexagrams are the 63 and the 64. Look at the language here in the 1st line. It says:
In penetrating to the center, the understanding that instills the necessary harmony.
What do you mean, understanding? I wrote this, what do you mean understanding.
That should be over there on the other side. That should be 63.

But when you‟re looking up, it‟s all very confusing. The abstract becomes logical,
logic becomes abstract, both of them become fused into something that is, whatever
it is. This is why when you bring these beings into the world they churn everything
up on the intellectual plane. They churn it up because they get different look. Now,
magic can come out of that. That is, the magic of being able to discover by having a
totally different perspective something that is truly of value to the whole.
But again, our context is duality. So, the only way that the abstract says—it‟s so
funny. The abstract says, look, I give up. Remember what the abstract story was,
the abstract story is you just have to find the right partner. So when the abstract
gives up, guess what it says. It says, the only way is understanding. It‟s the
abstract saying, logic did you figure it out? You‟ll see that logic comes back and logic
says, you know, the only thing it's logical to me that you have to feel it. They don't
know what to do. They get to the same place and they transfer. The 63-64 literally
is like one gate, this funny binary that just divides, because it‟s the game that we're
in.

The 1/4
RAC Consciousness 3
If it is so difficult for the 1/3 to be able to find understanding in an abstract gate, you
realize that partnership and duality is always going to be difficult for these beings
because this is the foundation. This is not the cross of rubbing bodies, this is not the
cross of being friends, this is not the cross of love thy neighbor, this is about
consciousness, just consciousness. It‟s totally disconnected from the physical. The
physical is just curious.
So right away when you're dealing with the 1/4 child, that 1/4 child is going to be
very confused if it can't understand what's going around in its life. It‟s going to have
difficulties. I watch them. The only thing that Cross of Consciousness can do is that
they can hope that they‟re splits. Oh, it‟s very different. If you're a Cross of
Consciousness and it's connected to your throat and it's connected to a motor, this is
really difficult.
These are people that are going to have a hard time in the way in which they relate
to the other. But if you‟re a split, you could meet somebody else somewhere else
and at least have a connection that has a physical quality to it, because the Cross of
Consciousness, no matter what kind of physical relationship they have with the
other, their purpose is not being fulfilled through that. Their purpose is only fulfilled
through trying to find, because this is the Quarter of Duality, trying to find the right
consciousness. That's their answer.
Their answer is I don't know about sensing and understanding, I don‟t know about all
of these things, what I do know is that if I find somebody who has the perfect
consciousness, that's the right one, even if they‟re in a horrible box. And of course,
this is a variation on the abstract theme. The abstract theme is the problem is you

The 2/4
RAC Consciousness 3
The 2nd line personality is a natural. When you‟re dealing with 2/4s, 2/5s, 5/2s, 6/2s
wherever you have a 2 on this cross, there are certain advantages to that, but they
are much more connected to being a hermit than you would find in any other
configuration of this cross.
When you're driving along and the windows are covered so that you can only look up
you don't see who‟s there. You‟re very much caught up in your world. When you're
dealing with right angle configurations of this cross, which is already self-absorbed,
they are very, very much in their own world. And of course, that‟s natural for a
2/4—leave me alone, stay away; I‟m very happy doing my thing.
And remember the whole thing about if you're a 1 and you‟re a Cross of
Consciousness, whatever 1, the four 1 variations, if you're 1 there is something okay
about being Cross of Consciousness. It's sort of like, all right, I have to dig into
things, I‟ve got to study them, and I have to find a way to come from outside the
body into the body. I have to find a way through the consciousness to come in and
see everything how it is. But, when you‟re a 2, you don‟t have that trip. When
you're a 2, it‟s just obvious to you that you‟re confused. It‟s confusing.
And yet, because you‟re consciousness, you are waiting for the right consciousness.
And that you can see because of the nature of the 4 underneath and because we're
going to have the 2 pulled out through the 4, because of the capacity of a 2/4 to be
a tremendously influential force once it's motivated, that you can see that what
these people are going to bring is that these are the ones that will teach you inner
development.
Some of the best minds in Human Design have incarnated on the Cross of
Consciousness. People who have come in on the Cross of Consciousness have
extraordinary minds, they do, they have very, very good minds. And one of the
things that these kinds of minds bring is that they say to you, particularly from the 2
perspective, they say to you, look go inside, become conscious, become conscious of
your consciousness. And it's not that the 2/4 Cross of Consciousness has an answer.
We're lucky; we have mechanics so we can pretend, in that sense, in the illusion,
here‟s your absolute. But the whole point of consciousness is to drive you to
consciousness. It says this is the pattern and expectation of our process, that we
are here to search out consciousness, and we are here to search out and find the
other, and that you need to go through an inner process of development.

Now, what that means at the personal level for the 2/4 that's not called out is that
they're caught up deeply in their own trip. And if they go too far into that trip it‟s
very difficult to get them to come out. And remember something about 4s, if they
lose their connections, if their circle narrows, they‟re really killing themselves in a
way; they‟re killing off the possibility of being able to be pulled out to fulfill their
purpose.
But, when you see a 2/4 Consciousness pulled out, you‟re going to see that one of
the main things that they bring to people is look in, look in, they‟ll tell you, because
that's their only answer. They can make up what they think you might find. After
all, that‟s all part of consciousness. But the whole point about them is that they‟re
trying to bring about an inner development. It‟s very difficult with a 2/4 on this
cross to help them with their own inner development, because in fact, they resist
education. That‟s difficult. In other words, they really operate from that natural gift
that the 2 has.
And of course, the one that's going to bring them out, that is going to trigger them,
that‟s going to pull the 4, that‟s going to pull them out, they‟re expecting them to be
able to explain it as if they were a 1. I see you so deep in your thoughts and when I
hear you speak I'm so impressed. Can you not help others with that? For the 2/4
that's a terrifying position to be placed in.
What you end up is with minds that are simply so busy. One of the real risks of
being a 2 on this cross is that your mind never stops. It's always in action. There
are no solutions there. And you can also see that in the context of duality here, that
duality says maybe in the abstract sense you could be my partner, but first I'd like
you to take this inner development program, because I think you might have the
potential, but frankly you and I are really not on the same level.
And for them, duality and the acceptance of duality is only about consciousness. If
they can‟t find that consciousness—it‟s why they get so messed up, because after all,
the genes don't think too much about the value of consciousness. It‟s like, we don't
care about that, we care about sexual organs, we care about reproductive
environments, we care about mammary glands, we care about things that will
provide life and we don't care about consciousness.
So, it's not like your genes pay any attention to you when you're on the Cross of
Consciousness and you‟re a 2/4 and you're saying, I‟m not going to take anybody
until they're at my level. That is, until they get to you at another level, slightly
below the head center. And then you‟re gone, because that consciousness says,
hey, this is not for me.

nothing in them that drives them to believe that they should come out of that cave
and help humanity, because in that cave, the 2/5 Cross of Consciousness hermit
discovers something very heretical. There are no solutions.
This is the most difficult thing about coming in on this cross is that the deepest
wisdom that the Cross of consciousness can get to is that they get to a place that
says for the vast majority of humanity there will never ever be solutions, no matter
what question you ask them, because there's something wrong with the
consciousness field. That‟s why they‟re important for me. They're important for me
because the consciousness field has to be healed. There are solutions. There are
ways. And the Cross of Consciousness needs to be a force that sees them, verifies
them, and recognizes them, because it transforms their frequency.
The 2/5 in the cave doesn‟t want to come out. It sees no point. It doesn't want to
lie. After all, if you‟re a 5 you‟re going to get caught, you're going to be punished,
and you know it. And you know you can't tell them the truth because what you also
don't know on the Cross of Consciousness is if there isn‟t a possibility somewhere
down the road you don‟t know. That‟s the whole point, you don't know. You just
know that consciousness is really interesting.

The 3/5
RAC Consciousness 3
By the way, did you notice something about the 64 that everything in the 64 is
inbred from the day you emerge? No blue headings. Think about it. Nothing you
grow into, nothing you can mature into, nothing you can age and make better. You
got it; you live with it, that‟s the movie from day one. The baby comes into the
world with a 3/5 Cross of Consciousness, day one, it isn‟t going to change.
This is about the deepest level that the 64 gets to in understanding the pointlessness
of it all. Remember something about pointlessness. It doesn't necessarily lead to
nihilism, as I‟ve discovered in my life, that pointlessness can need to helplessness.
This is the double edge sword of all that.
And when you get to the 3/5 you get to the recognition that one does not have the
resources. It's not that there isn't possibly a solution somewhere it's that the Cross
of Consciousness look out around the world and says, I understand, human beings
are basically stupid. There is an intellectual arrogance to the Cross of Consciousness
that you don't meet in any other cross, and most of it is legitimate. Humanity isn't
very bright. We know that as a whole. We‟re limited after all, we‟re all limited. And
we know that the business of waking up, the business of recognizing truth, all of
these things is not easy. As a matter of fact, it's managed on fractal lines.
The 3/5 recognizes when there is not enough resources to complete transition, seek
assistance. You know that that person beside you does not have your level of
consciousness, which means that you may be stuck with somebody all your life who
is an idiot and you don't want to be stuck all your life with an idiot. You would like

somebody to help out here. And there is this helplessness or pointlessness in
recognizing that you can't get rid of the idiot that's beside you, because
unfortunately we don't choose our geometries. And there's Cross of Consciousness
with something flying beside it that has no consciousness level connection to and the
only thing that they can think of is there must be an answer somewhere.
The 3/5 Cross of Consciousness develop more techniques, more answers, more
programs. Give me a 3/5 and I will give you a technique being born. One can
always hope as we have learned in Human Design that the 3/5 is not crazy.
However, 3/5s are very useful at that. And this is the technique business, the
abstract technique business and it's all based on raising consciousness. It‟s almost
communal. Let‟s raise their consciousness and once we've raised their
consciousness, then I can look for a partner.
Do you see how much this has permeated our conscience, this way of seeing? You
go to one of the best universities and you're not going to necessarily want to be with
somebody whose level of consciousness is not the same as yours. We have
intellectual hierarchies. We have consciousness hierarchies. Every once in awhile,
because Ibiza is Ibiza, you have people that come in from all over, very straight
people. And every once in a while because of circumstances—there was a party at
my house one night for my kids and parents of the children came.
One of the parents that we know, her sister had just come in from I think
somewhere in the States, New York, I think, very, very straight people and very
bright, well educated; straight. And you know right away that the way in which
these people see everything is so different than the way you see. And it's so
obvious. And there‟s a part of you that says, okay, let‟s dumb down this dialogue,
because you can say something through the way you see that they will totally
misunderstand from the moment you say it, instantly. You're just not talking the
same language; you‟re not seeing the same world.
And it's always a shock to me. I'm always amazed by bright people who are dumb.
It's always amazing to me that this is in the program. The 3/5 knows this. The 3/5
says, you‟re bright, you‟ve got a good job, you‟re making lots of money, pay me and
I'll lift your level of consciousness. If they have an undefined mind, they‟re even
worse. On the Cross of Consciousness with an undefined mind—at least the fixed
Cross of consciousness is consistently there. You get used to it almost.
You can get used to the fact that when you talk to them you‟re always going like
this; you pull them back. You say something—I had this morning with Alok. I send
something and all of a sudden I saw his eyes go like this. It was immediately
looking out this window. It‟s like come here; look out this way for a moment. The
Cross of Consciousness; immediately they‟re off in their zone.
But it‟s fixed. At least he goes to the same place all the time. I know where to find
him. You have an open mind and you have the Cross of Consciousness, you don‟t
know where the hell they are and you don‟t know where they‟re coming from, and
it‟s spooky. It's like they look out the window and you have no idea what they‟re
looking at. I know what he's looking at; I don't understand it, but I know.

Talk about Overextension. I love the detriment of this line. It‟s a Moon in
detriment. Beware of the Moon in detriment. Wherever you see the Moon in
detriment you look at those lines. That's really sticky stuff, it really sticks to you.
Overconfidence that the fates will be kind on demand; this is the 3/5 Consciousness
at its best. If you‟re not connected to the form and here in this you‟re not, then
basically the assumption is that you can force the physical world to fit into your
consciousness frame. You just think that you can. You think that you can mold
anything.
After all, if you think very carefully about the way in which the bodygraph is
constructed you'll see that in essence that's half true. In other words, the head
center is a pressure center at one end and the root at the other end. And the way in
which they literally create this whole pressure system that drives us. The 5 has such
power at the unconscious level. It is able to deeply influence the other. And unlike
inner development that you see with the 2nd line quality, the 2nd line personality
quality, here it‟s something quite different. It's about finding a way to use
consciousness to make money.
The 63-64 doesn't know the material world. It has no idea. Remember it's outside
of the vehicle. It really doesn't know the material world. It‟s always trying to figure
it out because it's breathing in the filtering of that physical world all the time. And
its way, and you see that in the 47, what it connects to, it‟s one of the most material
all gates, because the 47 simply says it's an old wives tale. If you‟re fucked up by
your head, be busy, do something, work, don‟t think, work.
So, when you‟re dealing here with a 64 what the 64 is actually trying to do is it's
trying to be God. You know this stuff about choosing your mother and father before
incarnation. This is really a 63-64 story; particularly the 64. The 64 says I‟m going
to create you in the image that I desire. I‟m going to reshape you; I‟m going to
reform you. I'm going to master the material world that way. I‟m not going to be in
it; I‟m going to create it.
And in essence, the pressure of the head center does in many ways create the
material world. It's the pressure on the way in which our minds view the maya. It
really does create it. And this is one of the illusions we have from the 64-63 that our
mind is really in charge of our life, because for them they would like mind to make
life, create it anyway they like. I'm going to make her the way I want her. I‟m
going to make him the way I want him. And the focus is that have to be conscious
at my level, which actually is the great inner lie of the Cross of Consciousness
because what they're really asking for is somebody who knows the truth. That‟s
what they‟re really looking for. They‟re not looking for an equal.
The quantum, the abstract collective knows better than any other stream the magic
of the quantum. That is, you and love and me, that combination. They know this
movie. The whole point of consciousness is to be able to create this place where the
two can meet and to create it. Now, the way it works out on the mundane plane is
that you just end up with people who want to make money out of everyone else's
confusion. That's all; just make money from confusion. You're confused; we‟ll help

you. You just don't understand. And I'm not mixing metaphors here. It‟s the
abstract that will actually say to them, you just don't understand, and they‟ll sell
them a bill of goods.
One of the things to be very clear about though is that the 3/5 Cross of
Consciousness is as useless in relationship as just about any configuration you can
find, seriously useless. And hopefully they‟re generators and they‟re sexy and at
least there‟s something there. You cannot see your partner if you're looking up all

The 3/6
RAC Consciousness 3
We know that 3/6s in this quarter are different in the sense that we don't have our
usual view of them as being unstable, that there is stability here. Their deepest
wisdom is to recognize that no relationship can really function without an
intermediary. And without that being tribal, that the intermediary has to be the
child, for them it could be anything. It could be somebody that simply has an
answer that can help them and their partner find a way to get together, that it's
something that the two of them can find love in—God, work, all kinds of things that
are possible there.
But the recognition in duality is that you can't ask for anything better than to have a
3rd or a 6th line in dealing with this Quarter of Duality, because there is a recognition
of impossibility, improbability of finding what's correct, that the chances of really
having true love is remote. That love is something that hurts, that it causes pain,
that there are failures, that you make mistakes, and blah, blah, blah. So, if it‟s
already built into you to know these things, it's no big dam surprise that duality is a
trip.
So in that sense, the 3/6 has an advantage in that they‟re really not disturbed by
how difficult duality is, they‟re not. But again, from this cross, even that is a stability
that is simply the result of being disengaged from what's going on in their life, and
really disengaged from what's going on in their partner's life, even though they'll try
at some level in their design to make contact, that's not where their purpose is.
You can only meet these people if all of a sudden out of nowhere you zoom in above.
After all, that's what these people are waiting for. They‟re waiting for somebody to
zoom in in an upside down vehicle looking down while they‟re looking up and they‟re
saying, ah, my soul mate, finally, somebody showed up. Don‟t wait for that one.
You wait for that one; you‟re going to have a very, very lonely life.

The 4/6
RAC Consciousness 3
The 4/6: Symbolized by the phases of the Moon that it’s assured of transition
convinced by its very process that it will triumph. The assuredness that confusion is
a process that results in realization; or where confusion is so energized assuredness
never brings real relief; Conviction. It doesn't matter to the 4/6 that there is
confusion. It doesn't matter to them that they don't really see the consciousness
that‟s there for them, because they realize out of conviction that as a 4/6 voyeur,
and it's great to be a voyeur on the Cross of Consciousness because your purposes
fulfilled through being a witness of the consciousness field.
The 4/6s on this cross do a great job of sussing out the consciousness level in
everything that they meet. Now, again, we know underneath what that's all about in
this quarter. That is, they are looking for that soul mate that‟s going to show up,
that‟s going to have that consciousness that they can deeply relate to. By the way,
the Cross of Consciousness ultimately do find those kinds of people in their life in
which they can feel intellectually comfortable. It's not like it's a direction that's not
fulfilled at some concretized level. But in terms of it being an idealized thing, no, it
never gets there.
What you get, though with the 4/6 is that the 4/6 says I‟ll wait. They go through the
4/3, they go through that phase in which they don't really get the opportunities that
they need; they don't really have access to the kind of consciousness field that is for
them. And remember, we can never forget beings on a cross are beings that are
not-self that have opened centers that are being conditioned, that have a mind that‟s
running their life. Please understand that in any description that we do here, I'm
talking about archetypes disconnected from their actual body, from their graph, from
their characteristics, from their type.
How different the Cross of Consciousness is in a projector or in a generator or in
reflector or whatever, the fact is that we have to see that we‟re simply talking about
archetypes here. Most of my work in doing this is so that you will be enriched in
your understanding of the genetic continuity of lines so that you have a deep and
rich understanding of profile. That‟s the real goal. Be very careful about taking what
I'm saying about the Cross of Consciousness and immediately assuming that that's
the way the whole package is going to work.
It‟s where the purpose is. And ultimately if the characteristics are operating
correctly, that purpose is attainable. And it‟s attainable in a way in which their
relationships with the other can be correct relative to their limitation. If you're going
to have a Cross of Consciousness lover in your life you're going to have to expect a
certain amount of disengagement, a certain amount of they don't seem to be present
right now, a certain amount of confusion in the way in which they both express their
relationship with you and the way in which they express their concepts about the
world around them. But if you're correct, then you have somebody who will resonate

to whatever that mental dysfunction is. They‟ll be able to live with it, to accept it,
it‟s there.
So, 4/6s have certain advantages. However, the not-self 4/6 on this cross with its
assuredness that sooner or later it's going to happen can end up being very, very,
very depressed. When they go up on the roof they can get very, very cold, very
cold, and very distant. They look out in that they say well; it doesn't look like there
really is anybody out there. I've been watching. I've been looking. If they have any
strong individuality in them, they will have already created some kind of unrequited
love virtual ideal, a novelist that they read whose mind they think is extraordinary, a
teacher, whatever. All of these things are available in our kind of personality
society, in order to be able to see that there is consciousness out there that is
something that they can relate to.
It‟s obviously interesting that whenever we‟re dealing with a 6, obviously we‟re
dealing with the Kironian process and in understanding that this in and of itself is a
mutative quantum where they have to make that leap and in making that leap,
realizing something so beautiful. That we do not have to make sense or understand
everything. I thought that when I was given this knowledge that because it's an
absolute of the maya that finally people would be satisfied. Here it is; an absolute of
the maya, shut up now, sit up. But it's not enough because the maya is so deep and
so dense. And there are so many places you can go and so many questions that you
can ask. It goes on and on and on and on. As a matter of fact, you can even make
up maya, attach it to maya and then do that. We humans do that all the time. The
maya expands moment by moment, breath by breath.
But for the 6 it‟s the recognition that our lives are not determined by having an
answer. Human life; it‟s not the point of human life; human life is ironically enough,
just living. And after that, it doesn't matter. It‟s not like you have to know. I
thought when I was first introduced to spiritual mysticism that the responsibility was
you wake up the planet. You wake up the whole planet. And only if you can wake
up the whole planet are you a success; the Messiah mythology, wake up the world.
Not that anyone has ever done that, but nonetheless this concept of wake them all
up.
All of the mystical literature, spiritual literature, and religious literature is rooted in
this concept that there is this glorious final day where everybody wakes up and
everybody gets in just before the door slams. What the Cross of Consciousness
recognizes is that because human beings are stupid and they figure that out,
because human beings have varying levels of consciousness and most of the
consciousness field is deeply dense, it's obvious that the solution, the answer isn't a
universal requirement. It isn‟t.
It‟s such a shock when they find that out. It‟s the most liberating thing that can
happen to them. And it‟s for the 4/6 to get to that experience in their Kironian state
where they can suddenly realize consciousness isn‟t the point; it‟s a preference, but
it‟s not the point. It cannot stand alone as the reason; otherwise humanity, the vast
majority of the life force of the planet would not be denied it. It sets them free.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Confusion  64  45

The 4/1
When we're dealing with the 4/1 we‟re finally beginning to move way here, we‟re
getting to the end of our juicy red field, that the 5 moves into the 26. And of course,
we get the 45 on the other side. So, when you go into the Juxtaposition Cross of
Confusion, you trade the 5 and the 35, and instead you get pure, unadulterated
tribal business—the 26. The 26 is
an incredibly powerful gate. And of
course, the 45 is literally the only
voice of the tribe. It is the only
expression of the tribe and the great
gate of entitlement.
One of the things to see about this
entitlement, this gate of gathering
together, the pasha, the ruler, all
those terms we know that go with
it, is that the deepest responsibility
of the 45th gate is that the only way
in which they can enrich themselves
is through the education of those
that they control. It used to be the
tribes had to compete with brute
strength. We know that now tribes
compete in terms of education. The
better you educate your tribe, the
more successful it's going to be.
That in the end education is the only way in which the tribe can be enriched. And if
you have a well-educated tribe as the ruler of that tribe you're going to get a lot
more taxes, you‟re going to be able to gather in a lot more income, and this is the
reward for educating.
Now, the 26 enforces the rules of the tribe. It is the tribal warrior. It is the tribal
soldier. It is the tribal propagandists. It‟s the tribal sales representative. It is the
tribal‟s representative to the outside world. So looking at this Juxtaposition Cross of
Confusion you have to see that this is not consciousness anymore. We still have the
64-63, but this is not the Cross of Consciousness so do not confuse them. And this
is why this is the most confusing of all harmonic profiles.
This 4/1 here is so confusing. It's all it puts out. And what it puts out is a dumbed
down, tribal educational program that tries to make sense out of very complex and
confusing things and feed them to the tribe. And all that breeds is more confusion.
Oh, it really does. And confusion in the sense of what it means to, let‟s say,

introduce Western democratic thought into the textbooks of a historically totalitarian
environment. It can be very confusing what that brings. The results can lead to
turmoil.
Be very clear that this cross brings turmoil, brings problems. Remember, there is
this assuredness attached to it. This is the only way. We‟re going to take this little
village in the middle of Africa and we‟re going to create Silicon Valley here. We‟re
going to change it all. We‟re going to end all these local practices, we‟re going to
change the architecture, we‟re going to put them into schools, we‟re going to
educate them, and on and on. You end up with an enormous confusion field.
It isn‟t that their heart isn‟t in the right place. It‟s just that they don‟t have a heart.
There‟s no 21 in this. There is this cabal between the 45 and the 26. One should
always be careful about any combination of this arm, because you know what's
missing; it‟s got no heart. When the 45 and the 21 discuss what needs to be done in
order to be beneficial for the tribe, even though the 21 is the control mechanism, it
brings heart. It says yes, I know we have to take more taxes from them, but let's
not take too much. Otherwise, it's going to be problems for them and they‟re going
to suffer and they‟ll begin to resist us. There's always this, there's ways of
controlling where you have to have the heart. It‟s the 21st gate; after all, it‟s the
heart muscle.
But the 26th gate is just the thymus gland. It‟s T cells, it‟s a killing machine. When
it sits with the 45 it sits with the CEO and says this president is really wishy washy,
what‟s the matter with them? Why don‟t you just let me go out there and collect the
taxes, and anybody who doesn‟t pay I kill him. Then everybody else will pay their
taxes on time, there won‟t be any rebellion, they‟ll kill the bastards. And all the ones
that pay their taxes we‟ll put them on a stage, we‟ll have an event. We‟ll bring all
the villagers and we‟ll show them how wonderful they are, we‟ll give them medals.
So, the 26 and the 45 is a risky combination. There is no 21 there. And you can
also see that if you're a 21 between the 45 and the 26 you‟re between a rock and a
hard place. The squeeze is on. All 26s want to be 21s. All 45s want to be 21s. 21s
can‟t stand 45s or 26s.

Let‟s go to the 5/1 and let's go to the joke. I love the jokes. The 5 is the line of
Promise. It‟s all about values. It says: Confusion over which values and
relationships can bring harmony; or focusing on past confusions about values and
relationships. But it is about a promise. And the promise is that the mind somehow
can penetrate this, can find a solution and then teach it to the people. That‟s the

most interesting thing. If you want somebody who's going to do a better job
educating than the 4/1, because the 4/1 is just going to dump everything at once
and say okay this is what you have to do to become this. The 5/1 is trickier. The
5/1 seduces you to that.
It‟s just seduction. The seduction starts with the very basic things of values—
reading, writing and arithmetic, male and female allowed to be educated, taught the
basics, and introduced to basic concepts that can be the foundation and the building
block for ultimately education. The other side of this is to understand that the 4/1
only wants to change the consciousness of the tribe in order to get rich. It sees that
if the tribe doesn't get educated,
doesn't raise its consciousness level,
that it's going to be destroyed by
the tribe in the next valley, and so
forth and so on.
But the 5/1 is a Left Angle Cross of
Dominion. This is a different kind of
consciousness raising. It‟s a
seduction, it‟s a promise. It's the
promise that every child hears when
they're born, for example, in
America. There‟s a promise. One
day you too can grow up to be
George Bush. Well, one day you too
can be president. It doesn‟t mean
you will.
But that is very interesting in the
way in which you have a shift in the
consciousness here. In other words,
the pitch is that one day you can be not simply better educated and a better slave
paying better taxes, but your very ability to be educated can liberate you to have
intellectual capital that will turn you into a force, a leader, a ruler, yourself. Look at
the planets in this line. It‟s Venus exalted, it‟s Jupiter in detriment; you‟ve got the
maker of the natural law and the enshrine-er of the true law sitting in this line. In
other words, this is all about how the heretic in this case, it‟s very heretical, this
heretic comes along and says, all right, what we‟re going to do is educate you so you
can actually take my job and rule the tribe.
Now, you damn well that‟s a lie. The 45 and the 26 don‟t go along with that. But
the 64-63 realizes it‟s true. So it‟s a blending. It‟s a promise. You can see what
happens if you look at societies that have been basically totalitarian or authoritarian,
I should say it's easier to see it that way, who educate their populations at a certain
point there is a certain cresting in the educational mean where the whole ability to
be authoritarian breaks down. You can only educate them so much and then you hit
that point where the tables turn. And everything about this kind of thinking is yeah,
between now and when the tables turn we‟re going to do really well. And they're

going to do better, and our tribe is going to be more powerful, because this is tribal
consciousness at its deepest, even though it's operating out of the 64 as a theme.
Now, let's look at this for a moment as duality and think about that very, very
clearly. Here it is not about “I want somebody that shares my consciousness,” it‟s “I
want somebody who shares my values.” It‟s easier. The consciousness is so difficult
to get to where you find those that you can commune with at that level as a 64-63.
And remember, because this is not consciousness, it‟s not focused on that. But it
does understand something.
It understands that the duality business is very, very difficult and that everything is
trying to figure out how to make the best out of it and for them the best out of it is
let‟s educate a set of values and through that set of values we can find a common
point. We both love Jesus, so we can love each other. We both love dwarfs on the
lawn so we can love each other. Whatever the values are, then the values become
the medium that allows for the embrace in the relationship, or justification for it, one
way or another.
This is more than heresy. This is heresy that is backed by the law. And given that
the mental plane is where the not-self lives, you can see that that has a very deep
impact on nor-self thinking; that shared values make up for shared stupidity.

The 5/2
LAC Dominion 2
If you‟re a 5/2 here, the best you can do is make that promise to yourself. This
whole business about being self-motivated, and in fact as many of you can intuit that
if you're dealing with 2/5s or 5/2s you really need to pay attention to their
personality color and to the transference in that, because after all, they‟re self-
motivated so it tells you a lot about where their motivation is coming from, will help
you really have a better insight into their nature. But always remember that when
you're dealing with 2/5s and 5/2s that they are resistant and they‟re resistant
because of the self-motivation and it tells you something everything very interesting.
It's more difficult to bridge from the 2/4 to the 3/5 than it is to bridge from the 1/3
to the 2/4. In other words, you always have this harmonic profile in between. But
because the 2/5 and the 5/2 are self-motivated it really means that the way in which
this chain operates in the profile chain is that you can see there are two places
where it doesn't run smoothly. In essence, it narrows. If you can see threads
moving through the whole hexagram, if I could show it to you literally what you
would see is that there are certain threads that can be stuck at 2/5 and only others
that actually move through. You see there are threads that are going to be stuck at
5/2 and not move any further.
So there is between the 5/1 and the 6/2 there‟s a kind of barrier of sorts. The longer
I work with profile, the more I realize that there is a very specific lack of consistent
flow between what it is to be a 5/1 and what it is for me to meet the 6/2. It's much

easier for me to meet a 4/6. I don't have that problem with the 4/1, the 4/1 is a
consistent bridge and I can go from my 5/1 to the 4/6 much easier than I go from
my 5/1 the 6/2 and it's because of the 5/2s in the middle. They slow it down. It‟s
like a traffic jam in the city. There you are flowing along and all of a sudden you get
in this traffic jam and some cars are getting through, they're in the carpool lane,
some cars are getting through and will get to the other side.
So, what I‟m actually saying is that there is not as much information moving in those
bridging points. Something that others can investigate down the road, but
something that‟s significant. So, they work on their own values. They‟re very
paranoid, in that sense, about the values of others. And yet at the same time, like
any 5 they‟re heretical, they can establish values. If they do manage to motivate
themselves they can have impact, but again, 5/2s and 2/5s you rarely seen them
concretizing their profiles. It‟s normally behind closed doors.

LAC Dominion 2
The 6/2 is a line of victory. It's the very last line of supposedly the very last
hexagram. It says: Victory. That‟s death, but we won't talk about that and turn
victory into a nasty thing. The heading for this gate: Transition, like birth requires
the determined strength for the passage through. It‟s all about just getting through.
It‟s what consciousness finally recognized, what the 63-64 recognize is that the only
thing you‟re really responsible for, in a sense, is that you're responsible for just
recognizing that all you can do is survive. The only criterion is survival. It‟s the only
one. As long as you‟re alive, you're serving a purpose of one kind or another
regardless of how you interpret it, see it, whatever.
The mental assuredness that knew victory was inevitable, thus making triumph
sweet but not reasons for excess. The medical gift of enjoying the confusion and its
diversity of data, and that‟s really the heart of it. The real victory in the end is life is
confusing. So why should I be upset? If I confused, if I don't get it, if they don't get
it, who am I to figure all that out.
But there is a real victory in realizing that at the very end it is the passage through
that tells you everything about this gate. What you think is not yours. It does not
belong to you. You do not own it. It is not parked. It is flying through. It‟s the
passage through, it‟s just moving through. Consciousness is just moving through.
It‟s just the way it is. There's nothing to hold onto, there's nothing to be concerned
about, it‟s just flowing through. And if you want to enjoy yourself, and you've got a
64, you can just sort of rest back, look out the window, and watch the movie.
Getting carried away at the mundane level, people on this cross think that they have
a right to tell everybody what to do. They consider themselves to be kings of the
world. They‟re assured that nobody in their right mind would ever challenge their
authority. They are convinced that they are the leaders, because they're the only

ones who understand that nothing is understandable, and therefore they must be the
leaders.
The 45 and the 26 underneath doesn't carry the same potency. It doesn't carry the
potency that we saw when we looked at it in the earlier quarter. Here it‟s
underneath the surface. It's flowing through the 64. And the 64, 6th line says we
will win no matter. Now, they‟ll go through their tripartite life processing and they‟ll
go through all of that. But the fact of the matter is that when they go up on the
roof, they go up on the roof assuming they‟re king or queen, Emperor or Empress,
the great pasha. And of course, they lose perspective.
They don't really see that leadership is something that has to be earned. The 45 can
only earn its leadership by having proper support. And the other thing is that when
you're dealing with the 6/2, whenever you see a leader that‟s a 6/2 you have to
realize they're in a bubble, a 2nd line bubble, cut off, not really able to dig into things,
separating themselves as leaders. The leaders that are above you, the things we see
in cult of personality where you see these huge statues and posters and they're
everywhere and the mythic leader suddenly emerges, it has no connection to the
people. Remember, there's no heart here.

When you‟re dealing with the 6/3 you‟re really dealing with the very, very end of the
process and we know precisely where we‟re going. We‟re going into the 47th gate,
we‟re going into what is in fact the definition, we‟re moving right through. The
abstract says duality is difficult, but the secret is the partner. The abstract mind
says duality is different, but it's not the partner, it‟s the consciousness. So, you have
this whole thing that the abstract is building.
But the fact that the 64 brings its demand for consciousness, it could only work in
context of the 47. After all, alone it's nothing. Definition becomes a life force, it
becomes something of power. If you're a Cross of Consciousness and you don't have
mental definition, you‟re very, very, very different than a Cross of Consciousness
with mental definition. It‟s very different. It‟s one of the most obvious places of
difference if you listen to these people, converse with them.

A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
I want to realign you to the irony that here we have this 47th gate, which is a deep
mental gate, and it's only concern is the mundane material plane. And of course, it‟s
one of these things to understand about the way in which the mind is designed in
terms of the manipulation of the so-called not-self how the mind is conditioned to
see that it's in charge of the physical plane. You can see that in the 47th gate that
the only way the 47th gate can relieve itself from anxiety is that the 47th gate needs
to concretize in action, needs to concretize in material.
You‟re getting to the heart, this is rulership. What is rulership? Rulership is four
gates. If you look at the Right Angle Cross of Rulership, you‟re looking at the four
themes, obviously, of rulership. Now, we‟ve seen two of them. We have the 45 and
the 26. The 45 is a natural ruler, the 26 is a propagandist and enforcer. So we
know already two very clear themes of how rulership works.
Then we add the 47 and the 22. Now, the 22 is about listening. In other words, if
you're going to be a good ruler you need more than just muscle. You're not going to
just be able to hold people by being able to coerce them. You also have to be able
to listen to them, and be changed. The 22 is a mutative gate. Mutative in the sense
it‟s individual, that the potential in listening you can be changed.
The other thing is the 47. Do you notice something about rulership? It‟s not
individual, it‟s not logical. In other words, that in the pattern there's no need to see
the need for rulership. It‟s what I teach. I say you‟re here to be your own authority.
It‟s just logical. But rulership is not logical. So it doesn't pay any attention to that.
It doesn't recognize that. It says, no, no, no, it‟s about making sense out of things.
Every time a politician offers you a pattern you have to see that what they're offering
you is an experience. They‟re not offering you a true pattern, because that's not
what they are. They‟re just trying to make sense out of things and use the tools that
will help make sense out of things. Now, I said to you that the 47 is deeply material.
And what I mean by that is that for the 47th gate that the only thing that is so
obvious in the sense of what rulership is, is that rulership is physical and material.
You can't afford to look up through the roof. You‟ve got to get down to business.
Let the 64 look up into the sky. The 47 doesn't look up into the sky, the 47 looks
immediately into its pocket. And if there isn‟t anything in its pocket, it gets really
upset. There is an enormous difference between being middle-class 47th gate and
poverty 47th gate. If you're poor and you've got the 47th gate it really hurts you.

The 1/3
Look at the 1st line: Taking stock. It‟s about getting rid of negative thoughts at the
personal level. It‟s about thinking the whole world is against you. It‟s about all of
that kind of inner fears, hardship, life is hard. But it's also something else to
recognize. It really is about getting down to business. You're taking stock, you‟ve
got to figure it out, you‟ve got to work it out, you‟ve got to get ready to go out there
and face the hardship.
Now, it‟s a 1st line theme and it‟s a
1/3. But when you‟re dealing with the
1/3 you‟re dealing with a foundation of
materialism. You‟re dealing with the
basis of mutation with a 3rd line theme.
And we know that 1/3s are going to be
able to see that the foundations aren't
solid, they‟re going to go through their
3rd line process of discovery. And we
also know that if you're a 47 and you
have a 3 in your profile, the chances
are as not-self that you've just got a
fucked up head. You just have a mind
that is disturbed because you can have
so many things that bother you that
are unresolved because we've already
learned that there is no resolution.
Remember that this is about not simply dealing with rulership as a theme, it‟s a
cross theme, but we really have to focus here that this is about duality. In other
words, somebody comes in on the Cross of Rulership; they are not going to share
authority with their partner. The Cross of Rulership says I'm the boss. This is not
gender related. In other words, this is not an archetype where you have more men
saying they‟re the boss than women. If you really looked at the nature of male-
female relationships you‟ll see that there‟s always one partner in almost all cases
that in fact rules.
When my children ask me something that I know I can‟t answer alone, I say, go ask
the boss. There‟s always somebody that rules. It is the nature of relationships. And
it's brought to us by the 47th gate. The 47th gate takes stock and says, well—again
it's the abstract way of trying to deal with partnership. And remember the themes
we've gone through, all this stuff about it's the partner, it‟s the consciousness, it‟s
this, it‟s that, you have to find the right this and the right that and then it will be
able to work.

This is saying something else entirely. It's saying that the way that I look at it is
that it can be materially viable. The way to really have a relationship work is be
successful. The more successful you are you‟ll see after taking stock that the more
money you have the less trouble that you in your relationship.
Think about not-self relationships. You think about the vast, vast Western context.
If you're a couple and you have a couple of kids, you're just above the poverty line,
maybe you earn 25,000 whatever a year. Any problem that you have is a huge
problem. Any expense that you have is a challenge. Anything that could go wrong
is a threat. You probably don't have the proper coverage for this or that or the kinds
of things that you're afraid of. Your children are denied the possibility of going into
better schools or living in a better home, there is all of this stuff. What the 47.1 says
is that in my research it seems clear that when there's enough material, there is a
lot less problems. It‟s so true.
It's not that the rich don‟t have problems. Everybody has problems. It's not the
point. The point is that if you take somebody who is borderline in terms of assets
and ability to be able to move material and you just give them a 25 or 30% increase
you‟ll see that if you measured their interaction with their partner you‟ve got a
sliding gradient that goes down and these little things that became big things now
are just little things.
The child comes home in poverty and says I have to have this book and the book has
to be purchased and the money isn't there and all of a sudden why can't you earn
enough and we‟re always like this and why don't you go out and do something about
it and all the fights that rise out of that. The 47.1 says, wait a minute, wait a
minute, the 1/3 says, hey, just go to work, man, make more money. Make sure that
this is the way and make sure that you rule.
I think one of the biggest changes in relationships that have taken place since 1961
is the fact that the women's liberation sexual changes in our society have allowed
working couples to be able to bring in the kind of material that had never been
possible. Now, of course, that‟s not true for everybody. But the fact of the matter is
that this is the theme here.
Rulership is about money. And this is also a problem when it comes to the way in
which these partnerships work, because invariably it is one partner and unfortunately
in most cases the male that is actually going out and being the breadwinner. So you
end up with these situations in which “I pay, I rule.” This is the way it‟s going to be.
I don't mind flying in space with you. I don't even mind looking after you, but I pay,
I rule. This is one of those things. And of course, it creates dilemmas in terms of is
there enough where one partner is always asking from the other.
And remember rulership is about being able to listen. Yet, you're the ruler. So when
you're looking at the 47 and when everybody looks at the 47 they get stuck in all of
this classic superficial Design analysis business, they get into the 64/47 and it's the
abstract mind, and it's confusing and they have to make sense out of things, but I

The 1/4
RAC Rulership 3
When you're dealing with the 1/4 there is going to be no challenge to this. That is,
whatever you see is what you‟re going to take with you. Remember, the underlying
theme of this line is a kind of paranoia. The world is against you, you've got all
these negative thoughts, and you want to get rid of it. You must understand that
the negative aspect of this line is what drives its material direction. And when you
couple it with a 3, you‟ve got the strong material drive, when you couple it with a 4,
you don‟t.
What happens to the 1/4 child is that it either identifies with the ruler or the ruled.
The boy will identify with its father, the whole Oedipus/Electra phenomena. The girl
will identify with the role of the mother, in a sense. So if the mother rules the roost,
the daughter will grow up to rule the roost. If the father rules the roost, the son will
grow up to rule the roost. It‟s just a pattern that they are going to follow and it‟s a
pattern that is going to say to them, I don't want to be the victim.
Whenever you see a Rulership relationship, where somebody has this cross, it would
be great to do interviews of their children and to ask the children about who wears
the pants in the family, how much suffering is attached to that, because remember
something, it‟s one thing to be the ruler, what you're trying to do is that the world
may be against you so now you're going to rule, which means that you're against the
other. There are many things caught up in this. It can be quite messy.

Where you really get to see the material level is that suddenly you get the 47.2 and
you get to the line of ambition. Where the hell does that come from? Normally
when people look at the 47th gate they don't think about money. They don't think
about it being so deeply material, but this is material. Ambition: The ambition and
drive to overcome personal oppression in order to achieve security. Realizing that to
be busy is mentally healthy, realizing that to make money makes you happy.
If you have a 2/4 on this cross, making money makes you happy. You smile every
time you look at your bank book. You don't need a comedian in your life. You don‟t
need anybody to give you a laugh. All you have to do is just count your money. The
laughing Buddha-Midas, or something like that, the hermit-Midas counting their
coins—I‟m rich, I‟m rich. I‟m rich but I don‟t spend. I‟m rich but I don‟t spend. If

those houses, kill the bitch and tear up the floor boards. You can‟t imagine what
she‟s stowed away, fortunes. They‟re cute, these 2/4s. You never know what‟s
going to happen with them.
The inability to sense when and which activity is healthy, is the detriment. In other
words, 47.2s make a lot of business errors. They‟re very ambitious. They realize
that they don't want to do anything else in their life but make money because as
they make money and as they count the money they don't think about how terrible
their life is. As a matter of fact, while they're counting the money they're actually
happy.
Now of course, I‟m playing with you, but you understand the drift of this. In other
words, being totally absorbed in their material life gives them pleasure and reason,
and it saves them from the fact that they're not very good at handling their personal
life, because they insist on being the boss. They insist on being the ruler. They
don‟t know any other way. I pay, I say, you do.
2/4s have the ability to be transformed. And of course, one of the magical things
about 2/4s on this cross that when they go out into the world they're really able to—
a projector on this cross, with a 2/4, they can be enormously powerful in being able
to guide others materially. Again, one of the things about outer authority is that if
you use the outer authority of your mind it could become the possibility of the other.
That outer authority of a 47.2 who says I want to go into this business. We‟ll it‟s
never for them. Their mind can't run a business. However, somebody else can.
And if they learn how to be able to transform and transfer, and remember we're
dealing with a cross that has the 26, transmission is possible, propaganda is
possible, you sell the concept to somebody else, they do great and you collect a
royalty or franchise fee, whatever the case may be. In other words, it‟s built into it.
So there are other ways in which the material dimension or the money making
dimension of this can work. It can also be that once they‟re a 2/4 and they‟re called
out, they can really bring that to the other.

those who have been called to process. And remember how ambitious this particular
configuration can be. And we are, after all, talking about rulership and let's not
forget it. So, one needs to be the ruler of one's life. One needs to be in charge. If
only you can only master the material world, then everything would be okay.

The 3/5
RAC Rulership 3
Then we get, unfortunately, to the 3/5. At the mundane level when you come to
Human Design you read the line of Self-oppression, you relate to that almost
exclusively to a mental experience. Now, that's the way we teach them and that is
the primary level. But I want you to see something about the nature of self-
oppression. These are people that need to find out that they don't have to be
materially successful in order to be healthy.
These are the kinds of people that lay a heavy trip on themselves, a martyr trip, the
punishment trip. If they don't do well, they can be more than ambitious, because
again the 3rd line themes are material. And because there is a great deal potential in
this configuration, here you have: The eventual realization of what is really okay.
Or: The extreme difficulty in realizing one’s worth.
Here you see the key at the material level. Now, remember something, we're talking
about the context of duality. Self-oppression within the context of duality is often
the result of claiming to be the ruler—I pay, I say—but what you pay is lousy. In
other words, you‟re not a good provider, and you're not good provider because it
breaks down. And you know what happens to the reputation of any 5 that doesn‟t
deliver the practical goods is that they end up being punished.
And when you‟re dealing with a 3/5 here, that self-oppression is so much that I am
not worthy. If I were worthy I could really look after my responsibilities on the
material plane on the outside. Everybody thinks that the 47th gate is just a mental
trip. Well, yeah, but it's a mental trip pointed at the material plane, the material
work, the material action and that 47th gate is telling the not-self mind to do
something about it, which leads to even more self-oppression.
It's also one of those beautiful lines in the genetic continuity of the beauty of what it
is to be a 3rd line being, that if you are not caught in the self-oppression “I made a
mistake, I'm not worth it,” if you‟re caught in that, you're never going to see that the
truth is that you're really okay. You're really okay, you‟re really all right. That
whatever level that you have on the material plane that you achieve is what you can
achieve. After all, in surrender one recognizes that one gets exactly what one does
deserves that ultimately is the potential.
However, the fact of the matter is that most of these people living out the not-self
can end up being very destructive to themselves. These are the kind of people in an
emotional rage, if they happen to be emotional, will take the very best thing that
they have sitting on the table, a plate, a dish, something special, something of

sentimental value and smash it. In relationship, these are people that feel that they
have not made enough of a contribution and as such their pain is that they have to
suffer in a relationship that hurts. And that they blame themselves because they're
not able to take care of business.
That's something to understand about all 3/5s. It‟s like anything that we teach here,
see the continuity in all things, move the information around the wheel, learn to see
the layers and layers and layers of depth and insight that you can bring to any
configuration, line, profile, how different these gates are depending on the quarter
they come from, how important it is to know what a quarter is in order to truly begin
to understand depth. And you have to teach mechanics first, you have to teach the
basic first.

The 3/6
RAC Rulership 3
This is not an easy 3/6 configuration even though it's in a quarter where in fact it's
easier for them to find stability simply because we know that partnership doesn't
work. But you also have to see that in the case of the 3/6 the demands of the
partner may be totally out of whack with the ability to be able to provide for it. In
other words, this is a case where self-oppression may in fact be the result of the
demands of others. Not something often understood about this line of self worth. In
other words, a partner that expects little, you can prove your worth easily. A partner
that expects a great deal, it may be difficult or impossible to prove your worth.
And it's all material. Long ago we left behind the importance of consciousness or the
importance of the right partner. We‟ve left it all behind. This is just about “let's
make it easy, let's grease the wheels of illusion.” I don‟t know who said that, but it‟s
a great quote. Let‟s just grease them, make it easier, and make it smoother. And if
you can't, then you have failed.
And when you get to the mundane level of the 3 in relationship so often in our
societies, because of the nature of the difficulties on the material plane, is that you
get to the “it failed because I couldn't provide. It failed because I couldn't give them
what they needed; it failed because I couldn't give them what was important to give
them.” And more and more this is not just simply the traditional archetypal
structure that lives that out, the typical male than that in that situation.

outside world is against me. At least in the 3rd line I‟m against myself. But in the 4th
line it‟s they‟re all against me, all of them.
And yet, who creates the repression globally—4th line beings. They bring repression.
That‟s what they‟re good at. They restrict you to a narrow, rigid fixed influence,
after all. And we know they lie and we know they‟re actors, and we that their
brotherhood/sisterhood is just a sneaky way to get into your pants. We know all
that; influence, indeed.
The strength of identity that even in times of the most powerful oppression can
maintain its resources and to some extent ensure their survival for the benefit of
others; a sense of identity that can be maintained despite external conditioning. The
negative is: When robbed of its light, the Moon is lost in darkness—beware of Moons
in detriment, please—when robbed of its light, the Moon is lost in darkness, barely
able to nourish itself, let alone others. The identity overwhelmed by external
conditioning. Okay, so we have two sides of the coin when we‟re going to deal with
the 4/6. We‟re going to have to go through the 4/3 process. Again, this is Rulership
and this is Rulership through repression.
Think about how that works. You're there with your friends and you say those ones
over there, they're not letting us develop. Those ones over there, they‟re the ones
that are in the way, they‟re the ones that are causing the problem. Let‟s do
something about that. They‟re very, very good at bringing politburos and these
kinds out of rulership structures where it's a cabal. It's like who rules Myanmar
today, the old Burma. Nobody really knows. They have a junta. They‟ve got about
12 faceless generals who have names that don't make any sense anyway, you can‟t
tell one “nee” from another “nu.” They‟re either “nees” or “nus.” It‟s General “Nee,”
General “Nu,” nobody knows who rules.
This is 4th line repression at its best. It‟s a cabal. And the 4/6 can be the voyeur
who influences a cabal to be the repressive forces, but they‟re on the other side. It
depends on what happens to them when they‟re a 3 in their 3 phase, what they
connect to, what conditions them, what circle they move into.
But this is one of these places where you can really see the power of the 4th line.
Remember, just about every cross and line has a hard time in duality. In other
words, I can be very, very, very dark in the way I describe them because duality
being the one quarter where there is no resolution is the most difficult for the not-
self to deal with. And so you do get these very dark qualities of various gates and
lines.
However, you also have to see that without morality, if you separate it from the not-
self “this and that,” you can see the value. I understand that this line of repression
gives all 4th lines a power to influence. They do. Their power is to be able to say,
I'm going to take you in here into the thrall of my friendship and everything else is
going to be outside. And in the way in which I influenced you, I am going to cut you
off from that outside. And in order to do that, I have to repress certain tendencies of
yours that have connected to or have been conditioned by the outside; be like me.

And you can see that this creates a very powerful identity. These are very, very
controlling personal relationships and rarely work. They‟re very, very controlling.
You have somebody on this cross, a 4/6; they‟re going to repress their partner. And
they‟re going to convince their partner to accept the repression because everything
around them is the enemy. And they‟re very, very good at convincing them in that
way, because after all they‟re very influential. And you have a 6 unconscious that
can become the leader, the role model trusted. It is amazing how many people trust
their repressors.
They had an election yesterday in Belarus. They have Lukashenko; he is what is
called Europe's last dictator. There are still collective farms in Belarus. It's still
basically a totalitarian kind of fuzzy communist country. And you've got all these
people there and they voted on a referendum whether to eliminate the term limit so
that Lukashenko can become dictator for life, one of these scenarios. And you have
people that go into places where they‟re going to vote where, in fact because there
are monitors viewing, where in fact they do have a private vote, they can actually
secretly vote. Now of course, we all know that it's fixed anyway, so it is really
doesn‟t matter; but nonetheless, they can vote any way that they would like.
And the commentator was asked, there is no opposition that is legal, all the media is
owned by the government; it‟s one of these movies. And the commentator said, well
you know, the strange thing is that the people here, particularly the old ones, they
keep him in power. Because he has continued to repress them their lives are very
peaceful and simple. And they don't want chaos. They like being repressed. They
don't mind seeing his picture on every street corner. They don‟t give a damn.
So one of the things you have to see, it‟s one of things we always have in Human
Design with language, is to see that people understand repression in a certain way.
I started off by giving you the negative and you‟re all going like that. But you also
have to see that it‟s very positive; it‟s all relative. It gives the 4 power.

And what I really mean is that you bring the 11 and the 12, and the 11 and the 12 is
one of the most extraordinary binaries we have in the wheel. It‟s one of the great
mutative binaries in which we have gone through transformation. The 12th gate is
the gate of articulation; the 11th gate, the gate of ideas. And so you can see that the
moment you step into oppression that you're dealing with another kind of process,
and it is a process that is very much connected with trying to open people up, trying
to open them up to an understanding that in the end that all of oppression is an
illusion, that in the end it‟s just an illusion. It's the illusion that I teach you, that
oppression is the movie but not the truth. It‟s just the movie.
And there is an aspect of this in this
cross, starting at the beginning if you
look at the 12.1 or the 11.1 you can
see the limitations. I know, I have
both my Uranus‟ in the 12.1, it is a
hermit, it is very, very cautious, and
it is not social. It‟s not like this is a
force that is really ready to deliver a
message. Yet, it understands one
thing and one thing clearly that all of
the duality is clouded by oppression,
and that the only way to get beyond
the oppression is to realize that the
oppression is an illusion.
I want to think about the track that
we‟ve covered. We‟ve gone from: I
can't be one, so what's the pattern? I
know I can't be one so it must be
about finding the right partner. I know I can't be one, but it‟s not the right partner,
it is about consciousness. And then you get to: Well, I can‟t be one and I know that
being two is automatically oppressive, so the only thing that I can think about is that
oppression must be an illusion. There‟s a long track moving along here trying to
figure out what to do with this basic dilemma of duality, of being forced to bond,
being forced to mate by the genetics, by the structure.

a life force and this life force is the social or antisocial transmission of mutation; or
not.
This is one of the examples of singularity in a line, and yet whenever you see
singularity in a line you will see that it's actually not really a singularity. If you look
here at the 47th gate the way it‟s written here, there‟s only this exalted, but they're
still a detriment mentioned. It just says there's nothing in detriment. It just means
there‟s no planet that brings out any different variation here. And yet, every planet
brings out a variation here.
And this is The Saint. Oh, man, what a line to carry. This whole business of being
a 5th line, what a projection, that you're going to be the saint and it's a life force,
after all, there is a life force driving
this cross. This position has special
significance—I love that—and there is
no planet in detriment. The gift in
times of oppression—we haven‟t left
oppression behind, oppression is the
problem.
Remember that this is what this 47th
gate gets to; it gets to the point where
it says we‟re not going to find the
same consciousness. As a matter of
fact, the problem is that we can‟t even
get to the same consciousness because
we're always dealing with oppression
one way or another. Inner oppression,
outer oppression, it's always around.
So, what we have to do is figure out a
way to get beyond oppression. The
gift of oppression to maintain without
hypocrisy a harmonic relationship with one's oppressors, while providing aid and
succor to the oppressed—very saintly—realization at its most exalted; acceptance of
the weight of the abstract process and the grace that naturally follows.
Now, this is a cross of grace, the 22nd gate is the gate of grace. And the whole thing
about this is that what the saint really says is this great heresy, it‟s a wonderful
heresy. It's you‟re oppressed; so what. You‟re going to do anything about that, can
you do anything about that, and is there anything to do about that? This is the
whole center of Christian myth—turn the other cheek. You're not going to get rid of
oppression.
As a matter of fact, in societies that are repressed religion has enormous power. It‟s
great. It‟s no fun being a saint in a free society. But if you're a saint in a repressed
society, wow, that‟s great, I can be saintly. I can die on a cross. I can die for you.
I can show you that it means nothing to me that they can repress and I can still be
here helping you and take all the risk.

Oppression
To be a 5th line personality and to read this line is really nauseating. It streams
through my veins; there is nothing you can do about it. We carry all of the nuances
of continuity in us; it's there in us. And I‟m one of these saints that really work well
in repressed society. I‟m just lucky that mine is universal. I deal with the repressed
consciousness; I deal with the whole of humanity being locked into the not-self so I
can play my saintly role.
Look how nice I treat you. I eat lunch with not-self people. And I don‟t even remind
you that; aren‟t I sweet. And I will deal with your oppressors; aren‟t I nice. I‟m
very saintly that way. It doesn't matter to me. I'm easy; I'll embrace the not-self.
I've been doing it my entire career. I understand, and hopefully I will give you aid
and succor so that you can find your way.
They‟re here to inform us, after all. Ultimately, mystically you can see very clearly
what they're here to say, if you want to get rid of oppression then you simply have
to accept that oppression exists. And as long as you accept that it exists, you don't
have to get rid of it. It doesn't matter. But the moment you put your attention to
anything, is the moment that you create an electromagnetic field in which you are
trapped and can never be released. If you‟re oppressed in your relationship, accept
it. If you marry the beast from hell, accept it. After all, you cannot change the
beast from hell. You may be able to kill it, but that's a problem.
Relationships; this is closest that the abstract gets to an absolute. It‟s why it has
special significance. And you can see that it‟s so interesting in the structure here
that in the lower trigram you're born with it and in the upper trigram you have to
grow into the theme. You don‟t get there right away. You don‟t become a saint
when you‟re born. It takes some doing.

Where the 5/1 can find joy in acceptance, the 5/2 can only find joy in not being

only thing that will bring them out is that there are those that can actually touch
them deep enough that they are drawn by their own motivation to help them.
Remember that the 5th line is deeply connected to the underlying thematic of the 5th
color, which is rooted in guilt, that it‟s always possible that the 5/2 out of just guilt
will finally allow it saintliness to emerge.
But like all things for the 5, if you don't have something practical to offer, you cannot
help anyone who is oppressed, you can‟t. Nor can you accept the oppression of
others. It‟s so obvious to me that in helplessness I cannot blame. It‟s such a
freedom. And I think I have learned that more from the abstract potential in me to
connect to the experiential process than I've learned from anywhere else.

The 6/2
LAC Informing 2
Let‟s get to the 6/2 because the 6/2 really gives you another message. The 6/2s
way of getting to a philosophical construct is that it says that it's not so much that
you simply accept, it‟s that you work from the level that it's all pointless, it's futile.
And if it‟s futile, then you can let go, because there‟s not even a tiny, tiny little place
where you can see you can do something. The saint thinks they can do something.
Remember, there is a funny thing that happens between the 5/1 and the 6/2; it‟s
called the 5/2. The flow between the two is very different at times, surprisingly
different. They‟re both left angle in the same cross, after all. Okay, what is
Futility? A difficult position in which there is no exaltation. Now, you notice the
difference here, this is so beautiful. The 5th line has only an exaltation; the 6th line
has only a detriment. You‟re not going to see that any place else.
The Sun in detriment—here you have a single aspect—where the strength and will
alone may find a way to adapt and survive. Now, think about that in the context of
relationship where the will alone can find a way to adapt and survive but without
hope of ever overcoming the oppression. Life as an ordeal stripped of realization.
Now, please focus that just on partnership for a moment. Partnership that can never
get to the point of realization, fulfillment; you can never ever get rid of the
oppression of flying in space with something else. To become the whole that is
greater than the sum of the parts in one way or another is to meet repression,
oppression, any of these things because it is the very nature that the abstract has
discovered in the process of what it means to be forced to bond. And yet at the
same time, this is the role model line.
Here you see the birth of 6th line hypocrisy. Meet a 6th line, meet a hypocrite; it
doesn't matter where you look, meet a 6th line, and meet hypocrisy. And it begins
here. Now, remember that hypocrisy, like all those terms that have a kind of
negative connotation, there are some things that it's better to do it than to do it
yourself—do as I say, not as I do. If you have no legs there's no sense telling
somebody to go running for exercise and then being called a hypocrite because you
don't run. There are situations where you can say to somebody, do as I say, not as I
do, and it's not hypocrisy.
However, hypocrisy is there and it was born in this line. It‟s a wonderful line. It
says, okay, it's all futile; I'm never going to overcome the oppression. However, I
realize that I may be stuck with you until I die, so basically, I'm going to tell
everybody that it's okay. I‟m not going to fuss, I‟m not going to do anything, I'm
basically going to be a fool on the hill, I‟m going to become as aloof as I possibly can
for my partner. I will do everything that I can to simply be able to survive.
However, if anybody asks me is a good thing to have a partner I'm going to say yes;

I‟m going to lie. And I‟m going to lie because I‟m going to assume that there is
always a possibility that maybe it will work for them. Who knows?
The 6/2 configuration on this cross, think about the 47: A restrictive and adverse
state as a result of internal weakness or external strength or both. How does the 47
see relationship? They see it as internal weakness or external strength or both. So,
you get to the end and you get to the 6th line and it says these things are
unavoidable. And if I just allow myself to get lost in the oppression like my 3rd line
theme showed me in the first part of my life, this is going to be lousy, it‟s going to be
a horrible life. I don‟t want to be oppressed. I don't want to see my relationship
with the other as oppression. I'm looking for the ideal. I'm looking for the one night
stand. I'm looking for my soul mate—all the 6th line themes.
So, in the end, what they do is that basically they speak about relationship in
hypocritical terms. They‟ll tell somebody else what they think somebody else needs
to hear, but it has nothing to do with them. I really think that one of the things that
you should do in your partnership is that you should spend a lot of time with your
partner going out and doing things. And the person telling you that, every time they
go out with their partner they have fights, they have problems; they have all kinds of
things. What the hell are they telling you that for?
It‟s not what they do, it‟s not what‟s successful for them, but basically what they're
saying to you is don't think about the oppression, think about situations, get involved
in the real world, go out there and do something. Maybe that will solve it. Maybe
that will get rid of it, whatever the case may be. It‟s all futile anyway.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 3
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
Think about where futility leads to. Futility leads to Conflict, into the tribe, into the
6th gate, into the heart of the emotional motor. It's as if the 47 is saying okay, I
know something. What I know is that this whole partnership thing doesn‟t feel right,
it doesn‟t feel right.
And you have to see that the abstract mind can never be separated from the
emotional system. And basically what you have here is a transference from the
mental feeling, which is not a feeling, but a mental feeling that all there is is
oppression. And that the heretic says you turn the other cheek. The role model
says that you just bullshit your way through it. Why don't we turn this over to the
emotions?
After all, it‟s tribal business anyway. Here we‟ve been going through this whole
thing; we‟re trying to figure out how you exist in a healthy way with a partner
because you have no choice. And we have avoided completely the only gate that
makes that decision. After all, the 59 doesn't decide. It doesn't decide whether
one‟s going to be fertile or not. It doesn't decide whom to bond with or not; it‟s just
simply available. But the tribe, the fertility can only be possible when it meets the 6
and the 6 is where we decide who we're going to be stuck with. And the deepest
glue of all is the glue of fertility.
Do you see how ordinary Virgo is? It‟s an amazing constellation. All these different
forces, and how much duality because it is the only unresolved process that we have
in the quarters. After all, you‟ve got birth, the body and at the end you have death.
All of those are very, very, very straightforward. And then you have this funny
quarter where you have this gender differentiated dualistic, parallel lines that never
meet.
And Virgo is at the heart of it; because you'll see the moment we get out of Virgo we
enter into the land of fear. And then we see how really screwed up we are by
relationship, because then you get to see all of the fears as they relate to duality.
Everybody thinks survival because of integration is about a singular process, it‟s not.
It‟s the binary that has to survive in order to become a penta, in order to create
binaries that survive to become pentas, benches and on and on and on.
So when we get to 6 at the very, very end, finally we go to the source. It‟s like a
whole bunch of people talking about something when in fact there is somebody that
could really give them an answer. If you want to ask the question of how the duality
program works, how do we find a way to bond, it‟s the 6th gate that teaches us. You
can see that its biological association in the pH. That is, what you really have in the
6th gate is that it knows how to be porous or not, how to be opened or closed. And
it's the 6th gate that “decides” what to be open or closed to. And it‟s the 6th gate that
is going to determine the potential for fertility. Here is the boss, let‟s ask the boss,
let‟s see what the boss says. So you go to the 6th gate, you meet the 6th gate and
you come up to it and you say, hello there, we have the Right Angle Cross of Eden,

Conflict
it‟s a good place, eh? Go forth and multiply. Here we are, okay, and how do we do
it? How do we make it work? I don‟t know.
It‟s so funny about the 6th gate. It‟s emotional. The only thing that it loves looking
at is itself in a mirror. And it‟s emotional, so some days it's yes and some days it's
no, and some days it's open and some days it‟s closed. And sometimes it's open to
those that it doesn't like and sometimes it's close to those it loves. It's open and
closed.
And so, after all this hard work, after finally getting to a point we think, hey, here‟s
somebody who really could tell us. The 6 puts its hands up in the air and says wait
until 2027, wait until we get a little bit of awareness here. And then you begin to
see one of the deepest dilemmas that we have is that the way in which we meet on
the physical plane, the concretized plane, is through a bonding mechanism that is
unaware and only emotional. It's the emotional system that chooses partners. I
know that. I'm an emotional. The emotional system is the one that does the
choosing.
And of course, it means that the odds are stacked against us. They‟re really bad. I
wouldn't bet on having a break from that. You‟re going to expect the 6th gate to sort
of sit there and calmly, logically, abstractly work out through all of these views and
formulas that have followed. There‟s nothing new under the Sun. This is the truth
of the collective. And this is the hope of the tribe. It‟s the truth of the collective; it
is the hope of the tribe. Neither the collective nor the tribe like surprises, they don't
like freakiness. They don't like the intrusion of what the individual brings, because
the individual has an answer that neither the collective nor the tribe like.
It's called love. It's about romance. It is about creating an illusion that satisfies the
program. It‟s a mutation. After all, love has a reason to be with somebody. It‟s
new. It‟s not old; it‟s not ancient at all. The vast majority of bonds still in the world
are being arranged. They‟re not rooted in choice. Love and the power of love; and
you can see that here there is no power of love. We will only get the power of love
when we get the fear. Here‟s there‟s nothing new under the Sun, here there is no
solution, never will be a solution, can't be a solution.

And when we get to the 1/3 of the 6, you see right away they understand:
Retreat—back up, back up—the realization that wasting one's resources against
overwhelming odds is not courage but folly. How clear that is. Everybody thinks
that if you‟ve got a 6 you‟re open to the 59. But then everybody thinks that gates
are channels and they're not, the 6 isn‟t open to the 59. The 6 isn‟t a corner

prostitute. It‟s not like you can just show up and say hello. It‟s the 6 and it‟s very
powerful.
It‟s sitting there and saying, within duality, remember duality, the 6 is saying, you
want conflict, I‟ll give it to you baby. It‟s: I‟m wasting my resources being involved
with you. It is pointless. I don‟t want to have a child with you. That would make
me stuck with you for the rest of my life. I don't want that. Why do you think on
the other side is the 59th with a club;
the caveman/cavewoman. The 6.1
say I don‟t want to waste my (noise);
tell me about that later; whoa.
Be very suspicious of very, very
personal things that are ruled by
Pluto. The power of regeneration that
can embrace retreat as a phase and
not a failure; the emotional stability to
accept conflict; or emotional
instability, by the way, in times of
conflict. The 6th gate is not here to
say I‟m ready. It‟s not what it‟s all
about, not at all. It‟s a 1st line, it is
investigating, and it is looking for
something that won‟t waste its
resources.
And in the end you get to the pure
genetics that say all right, all right, all
right, I know you're stuck with this. I know that you‟ve got a mate; I know that
you‟ve got a bond, pick the best genetic material that you can, because what
matters is what you get out of this deal. And what you get out of this deal is going
to be the offspring. So choose the best genetic material you can. And anything less
than that, resist. And if you want to see, because of the nature of pH, where birth
control comes from, it comes from the 6.1. The 6.1 is the mother of all prevention.
Obviously, a 1/3 is going to learn the lessons of this very quickly. And unfortunately
it is often too late. If you‟re a 1/3 and you‟re fertile and you end up wasting your
resources because you end up impregnating or being impregnated and you end up
with something that really wasn't worth while, it‟s a terrible problem. And remember
this emotional. We always have an answer. Our answer is strategy. If you‟re an
emotional being there‟s no truth in the now, wait out your wave, play hard to get.
Every time that you're dealing with young people please try to get them to
understand that saying no is not an anti-sex thing, it's about saying yes to courtship.
I'm not conservative and I'm not sexually conservative and I've been quite a
dilettante in my life, but I truly understand now, because I understand the way it
works, that because it's so emotional, because it's so rooted in an emotional process
that without courtship there is no chance to find out whether or not there is a
potential that you're going to enrich yourself, not waste your resources, but add to

your resources. The 1/3 is at risk. A 1/3 on this cross, Eden, you know damn well
that they can get pregnant at 16 and that would really mess up their lives. So it‟s
something to be aware of, in that sense.
I want you to think about the nature of the 6th gate as a profiling gate. Remember
that most people stop at the role gates. You do the four G role gates, and then you
get to the 59 and the 27 and you stop. But it's very important to include the lines of
the 50 which talks about the development of intelligence and the lines of the 6 that
tell you about the development of feelings. They‟re both very important.
And when you‟re looking at the 6th gate, you're looking at the root of need, passion
and desire. You can see very much that the way in which you multiply is based on 6
themes—retreat, we start with retreat. In other words, don't be in a hurry. And the
other side of it is that once you do meet that force, then retreat into the beast with
two backs, retreat into the whole that is greater than the sum the parts; find the
spirit.
The 2nd line, The Guerilla, and I‟m not talking about the beast. I‟m talking about
the warrior. That‟s one way and we'll talk about what that kind of bonding means
after this. Allegiance, trying to find allegiance; triumph; arbitration, the
peacemaker—these six ways, and these are the six ways that we decide on who we
will have a child with and each of these six ways is emotional in nature.
So they‟re in a wave, which makes it very complex. And obviously says to us that
what we teach, strategy, honoring the inner authority, you can see how clearly it is
the only way that you‟ve got a shot in hell of being with the right partner in this life
at any level; not just your lover, but friends, associates and all of that stuff.

an archetype around it, it will be much more cautious. There is no question about
that. But of course, we can never forget that the 6 has a very powerful polarity, the
36. And we know that there is a deep sexual drive and a need to transcend
inexperience that underlines this cross. And after all, this cross is really something.
You must go forth and multiply. And people who come in on the Cross of Eden are
always thrown out into the wilderness. And it can be very lonely, you want
somebody with you. This is the heart and core of the duality game at the genetic
level. It's the heart and core.

The 2/4
RAC Eden 3
It‟s deeply shattering to be a 2/4 Eden and have your life fall apart when you're
young. After all, the one thing about 2/4s is that their home life as children is
absolutely essential for them. They need to have a reliable home. They need to be
able to feel protected and sheltered within the home. They need to have that space
where they feel comfortable, that they're going to be left alone. And one of the
things about Eden is that it's not allowed. And you‟ll find a lot of very uncomfortable
2/4s on the Cross of Eden because there are constantly people trying to pull them
out. Normally that 2 personality is resilient enough in its defense mechanism that it
can keep away a lot of the extraneous calls. But a 2/4 on this cross, no, they're
constantly disturbed by being pulled out of a comfortable environment.
Think about it this way, if you have a 2/4 and they‟re in a house and their parents
have invested in the furniture for the house and they‟re going to leave it basically the
same for the 20 years the child grows up, the child is very secure in that
environment. But if you have a 2/4 on the Cross of Eden, all of a sudden the mother
can decide to redecorate the whole house, move the room of the child to another
area, and re-design the whole thing. That 2/4 goes nuts. They‟ve lost all the
continuity in their life. It‟s not like it's the same house anymore, things aren‟t where
they‟re supposed to be, there something wrong.
This is Cross of Eden. And of course, as a child in which they have no way of
articulating what is in fact are their genetics, what happens is they internalize that
and they internalize that through their type. They end up being angry or frustrated
or bitter or disappointed in their parents, in life. Why change things, says the 2/4,
leave it alone. You want to go in and paint the room, no. No, don‟t paint my room,
leave it alone. Don‟t come in here because then you‟re going to move everything
and you‟re going to touch everything and you‟re going to shift everything, and I
don‟t want you in here. It‟s very difficult for 2/4s on this cross, very difficult.
As a matter of fact, they get so many calls that they never know which call is truly
for them and in the end they‟re simply confused. The other thing is that if you have
a 2/4 in your life and you change the environment too often they're going to get
sick. One of the things about the 4, we know that the 4 is infective. We know that
the 4 is the carrier, the 4 is the influence that gets it out. But remember, they get it
out with their friends; they get it out with a set community. That set community of
their parents, they kids they go to school with. This is something that is absolutely
essential for them. Even though they‟re a 2/4, they have to have those contacts;
they have to be able to move their influence out. Now, because they‟re a 2
personality, you know that it's going take the time to integrate with the group to
bring that 4 unconscious out.
So think about a 4 on the Cross of Eden and the parents change their house, change
neighborhoods, change cities, and drag the kid to another place. It‟s very, very

difficult for them to get that 4 out. It‟s difficult for them to go into a new school and
start this process all over again of trying to deal with their shyness and having to
deal with trying to find someone they can bond with. So what happens is that they
end up internalizing all of this potential to pass things on. And if you hold it long
enough it‟s going to make you sick and then you‟re really going to be thrown out of
Eden. You‟ll be thrown into the sick bed, into the hospital, whatever the case may
be.

The 2/5
RAC Eden 3
2/5s don‟t want to be exposed. I think this is one of the things that you can really
see about the 6th gate is that the 6th gate is ready in its emotional wave to expose
itself. By the way, it‟s in what I said, so whatever, but nonetheless the 6th gate is
always ready to expose itself somewhere in its emotional wave. Hopefully it's not on
a street corner in a trench coat, but nonetheless, it's there.
And this is the whole mystery, anyway, of the emotional wave. You‟re going up and
down, and the subtlety of that in the 6 because the emotions only reveal themselves
in contact and intimacy. Remember the mystery of wave in the 6 is that 6s do not
appear to be—let me change the language here. 6s are not projectors of wave. If
you hit any other emotional gate it projects out its wave, that wave goes out, very
clearly goes out. But the 6, in a sense, can hold that wave very close to itself.
It‟s like what I talk about plants and their aura. If you want to communicate with
plants, you can‟t shout across the room to them because their aura is very, very
tight. You literally have to touch the flesh of the plant to actually reach its aura.
And in many ways the 6 has this, because of that, this pH, it has this ability to really
be able to hold its aura very close. And the only way that you can actually get to
their wave is that you get to it through intimacy.
I have a 59/6 emotional 1/3 in my life and I have a 39/55 emotional 1/3 in my life.
Now, the 39/55 emotional 1/3 you don't need any subtlety to figure out that they're
emoting. They emote; it‟s just there. And you know when they‟re up and you know
when they‟re down and it‟s almost like a cloud that you can step into. But the 59/6,
you don‟t know. You don‟t know how to see them. You don't know how to hear
them. You‟ve got to touch them. The moment you touch them you feel the whole
thing. And if they‟re really upset the moment you touch them they‟ll break down.
So it‟s one of the things to understand about emotionality here on this cross with this
as the Sun, you have to see that this does not really show emotion. It often is a
problem in their relationships. They seem to be disinterested. No definition can be
more disinterested in sex than the 59/6. Again, it‟s one of those wonderful ironies.
I can imagine 2/5s being great kamikaze pilots, truly. I can really see that. Finally,
it‟s just, all right. One of the hardest things to do in this life is to find a weak point

of anybody that's going to have a 5 in their profile. You can think that you have
found a weak point, but the fact is that there is so much projection that it's unlikely
that you can even imagine where their weakness is. Only a 2/5 can find their own
weak point. And in dealing with their own weakness, maybe motivate them to the
point that they're willing to be open to the other, maybe. But nobody else is going
to.
And remember, you have a 2 personality where the outside thinks they see in. But
they‟re only seeing that 2, all the rest of it is lost in this mirage in the 5 underneath
and the seduction of that. 2/5s will run away from attention, and much more than a
2/4 would. Remember, the 2/4 always has its neon signs up. The 2/5 never puts up
neon signs. It actually puts up a sign in front of the house that says that no one
lives here. Nobody lives here, nobody's ever lived here, keep on walking. And
they're up there in the window watching.
So, one think you know about a 5, they never stop looking. If you walk down a
beach and all the men with their sunglasses on staring, frozen at the beach, they
have a 5 somewhere watching, looking. After all, only the 5 has the ability to look
out and see that there's a sucker on every corner, that there is a fool around the
next bend. It‟s the only one that can look out the window and see who can be
called. It's their gift. It‟s so interesting how rarely that gift functions correctly in
life; like everything else, I guess.

RAC Eden 3
Think about the Cross of Eden in this third variation, this is the only really archetypal
Eden variation. They weren‟t sent out of Eden alone. Adam and Eve together, both
of them punished, both of them sent out. And you have to see that when you're
looking at the Cross of Eden you‟re looking at the most dualistic of all the dualistic
configurations in this very, very dualistic quarter. And you have the joy of a 3rd
line—go out and multiply and make mistakes along the way.
How many children are called a mistake? My father told me I was one. I don‟t know
if that was truth or vengeance, but I certainly wasn't planned, let‟s put it that way.
He was 50, so, I wasn't planned. There are always mistakes and the mistakes that
are great. Genetically the genes love the 3rd line best. Genes love the 3rd line. The
3rd line will have a child with anything. If it could do it cross-species it would,
anything.
And if it weren‟t for the 3rd line we would not have the development of the species.
We would not have the quality of the gene pool we have. We would not have all of
this evolutionary development, because it's only the 3rd line that is willing to make
the big mistake. Not only do you end up flying beside something that is different,
it‟s really different; different genetic pool entirely, all of these things.

It‟s the extremist line. You‟ll also notice something about the 6; every single line has
a blue lead. It‟s all about learning; it's all about growing through the process of
developing these things. And of course the moment that you see that you realize
that lines that have this kind of structure that they're deeply susceptible to not-self
negative conditioning, because so much of the way the line is going to be depends
on how it becomes that, that process through the nurturing.
There are two sides of this. It says Allegiance: The ability to secure support and
create strength out of a weak position and when connected to the harmonic gate 59,
mating that results in conception. Think about is, the 3rd line is the only line that
says if you hook up with a 59 you can really produce. In other words, this is the
most fertile. It has to be, in a way. If you think about the 6 opening up, it actually
opens up to a generic type. That's why when you see people with multiple partners
over years you see that they basically hook up with the same people.
And the one thing you can see is that when you're dealing with the 1 or the 2, there
is a very narrow area of selection. But when you get a 3 when it opens up, it opens
up to take in anything. It's able to be fertile with enormous level or quality of the
other. It‟s: destruction of old forms through union, either mundane, as above,
sexual union, or exalted as universalization; the depth of feelings that enrich union
and intimacy. It's also, by the way, sensitivity to controls that leads to the ending of
intimacy.
It‟s one of the things to understand about the 3rd line is that the 3rd line is intended
to break bonds. I mentioned to you the other day about aroma and the fact that this
idea that it's women that clings to men is such a joke, and you can see that here in
the 3rd line. The real tragedy for the yin is that the yin realizes something that
unfortunately it can't just get rid of that yang. It has to keep them along long
enough, because unfortunately the offspring take a very long time to be
independent. The natural tendency in the yin is to say, thank you very much, that
was a nice genetic contribution; bye now.
So obviously when you're dealing with this 6 and you‟re dealing with the 3rd line,
Cross of Eden, you know that you‟ve thrown out there and you have to do it. And of
course, what‟s going to happen to these beings is that for them duality is basically a
revolving door. And as a revolving door it can be successful or not. And remember,
it‟s a 3/5 structure, which is very difficult. There is all this very powerful 5th line
seduction.
There is the belief that allegiance here is possible, that you can find a way to be with
the other, that you can destroy the old forms, and that something new can emerge.
And of course, you end up with a 3rd line personality that makes a mistake in the
selection in the first place because it‟s not operating correctly. And that the whole
damn thing is emotional, and you end up in a situation where you conceive under
circumstances that are conditioned by the emotional wave and not by truth. And
that brings us to this business of selection.
It is obvious that the emotional system could never provide anything but clarity; it
can never provide an absolute. There are no absolutes in relationship; it‟s not

possible. There is no way to really be absolutely clear about the other. It‟s what
emotions teach us. And so it's essential that the only way in which allegiance can
actually be established that's healthy, is that you have emotional awareness that is
operating correctly. There is nothing else.

The 3/6
RAC Eden 3
The 3/6s here either end up being the kind of people that have very, very large
families or end up preferring the kinds of relationships where they may have a
lifelong girlfriend or boyfriend, that they always have a separate place, they‟re never
really together, but in that way they do end up developing what is classic. I remind
people that have 3rd line themes how important it is to break the bond with your
partner all the time. In other words, have your own bedroom, be able to break out
of the aura, go into your own aura, and be able to meet them again. And in that
way you can revitalize your relationship and you don't have to turn it into bonds that
are made to be broken and it's at the end of the sentence. It‟s bonds made and
broken, bonds made and broken, bonds made and broken, it goes on and on and on.
And in that way you can maintain relationships for a long time.
The whole thing about this kind of relationship, the 3/6 relationship, is that children
often make it much more difficult for them. They can actually find a way to find
allegiance through being able to be together but separate. My partner and I have
always over the years had houses where we were on the same property, different
places, and we've always done that. She‟s 3rd line, I have a 3rd line mind, and she‟s
3rd line in terms of intimacy. And it's something that just works. You have your own
space and you keep on coming back. And in keeping on coming back, you
rejuvenate that process every time.

You can see the 4th line through this quarter that all of the dark side of the 4th line is
coming out. The brotherhood/sisterhood works really nice in all the other quarters,
it‟s really nice there, but, when it comes here, no, because when it comes here you
get to the core. Think about the relationship between the 1 to the 4, the 1 is the
foundation, the 4 is what delivers the foundation. We think of the 1 as being
authoritarian, but only because of its lower trigrams self-absorption beginning of the
process do we see or feel that authoritarianism as something that is almost crude.
It‟s just a natural byproduct.
But the 4 is the true authoritarian. They've mastered how to hide that 1 authority
under a brotherhood/sisterhood mask of being your friendly adviser. I don‟t want to
make anybody who has a 4 uncomfortable; but then again, maybe I do. Triumph:

Okay, on one side we have the charity and wisdom that must come with victory.
Jesus, that makes me nervous. Just reading that, it‟s like victory is already assumed
here. And the other side is: the conqueror and the purger. You‟re mine. Everybody
thinks that the 1st line is the caveperson, but it's the 4th line that really plays it out.
It knows how to deal with the other. All the 4th line does is say, why don‟t we have a
fantasy today and play role model today and I‟ll play the caveman. Thank you very
much. Natural, unchallengeable power.
So we get to the 4/6, you know what their solution is, the solution is very simple—I‟ll
be kind to you as long as I'm in power. If I'm not in power I‟m going to be mean.
That‟s all. I‟m the one. And not only that, if you let me be in power, I‟ll be really
nice to you. I won't humiliate you. And if you don‟t let me be in power, I will smash
you—brotherhood/sisterhood indeed. Only if I‟m in power will I have a child with
you.

When we get to the 4/1 we immediately change a very deep theme, because what
we come to is the underlying developing emergence of the 10 and the 15, and
course we‟re dealing with the whole
business of love. All of a sudden,
out of nowhere, at the very end, at
the juxtaposition of the last gate of
the eight gates where there has
been no individuality, where there is
no damn romance, where there is
nothing, suddenly in the
background, just a little bit comes
this theme of love.
You can see immediately how it's
going to change things. Now, in the
Juxtaposition Cross of Conflict we
have a problem here in the sense
that even though we have an
underlying 10-15 remember

potential to love humanity, and the 10th gate is the potential to love oneself. But in
the not-self it's very easy to hate yourself and hate humanity.
So, one of the difficulties of this Juxtaposition Cross of Conflict is that it understands
that it has to be an absolute power because it doesn't like people. It doesn‟t like
them. It doesn‟t like the way they act. Here it gets very picky. I don't like your
frequency. I don't like the way you act. And so there is with this very powerful 4th
line theme, you end up with these attempts at being very, very dominating and
controlling. I am only going to have a child with you if I can teach you how to
behave. I am only going to have a relationship with you if I can get you to function
in a way that is acceptable to me.

You can see right away that these people are not on the Cross of Eden anymore and
multiplying is not the theme. You go through the right angle and the right angle is
caught up with, I‟ve got to make more. But Eden is about two things. It's about the
pursuit of knowledge and multiplication. And this leads us to something that is very
mystical and very profound. That
is, the underlying potential
awareness that is there in the solar
plexus that can emerge when this
mutation of 2027 comes about.
And that the recognition is that
when you get to the juxtaposition
and then finally to the left angle
here you're getting to the other side
of the Eden story. And the other
side of the Eden story is knowledge,
and it will lead to the Cross of the
Plane.
It is on the Cross of the Plane that
we gain the knowledge of the world.
It‟s no longer about a partner and
the need to make more; it‟s one of
the confusing things. The 59.5 and
59.6 are still about sex, even
though it already is beginning to
move to the mutational change. But on the 6th side, because the 6 is the source of
everything that is the emotional system that inherent in the 6 is this whole pursuit of
knowledge.

So when you get to the 6.5 and you get to Arbitration, you begin to see the
emergence of love. And love not as romance, not yet. But love as direction.
Whenever you're dealing with the G center, the Sphinx, we call it direction, but love
is also a direction, not to be forgotten. It is a way of the identity. Faith derived from
analytical diligence and emotional control that permits a higher authority to judge a
conflict. Harmony furthered through the avoidance of direct conflict. It‟s one of the
most dynamic themes of knowledge. There is always a higher authority. We know
so little. There is so much to learn and who are you going to learn it from? You‟re
going to learn it from the other.
Here is the beginning of the appreciation of the potential of the other in your life.
That it's not about this thing that you have to mate with them and bond with them,
it‟s this possibility that in your relationship something else is conceived—a great
thought, whatever. Whatever can be born out of one's knowledge gained in the
world. And this is the deepest connection that you see between the 6 and the 36.
When you look at the relationship in the polarity, the first four lines of the 6 and the
first four lines of the 36 all leads down to the dark path of confused emotional
relationships.
But when you're looking at the 5s and the 6s, when you compare the 6.6 and the
36.6, the peacemaker and justice, you get to see this real beauty that‟s there,
because it has to do with the pursuit of knowledge and the recognition that you do
not learn alone. It‟s the first essential truth and in many ways it finally can lead to a
place where you say, I may not like my partner, I may have problems with my
partner, but my partner is also my teacher.
Oh, how much I have learned from the women in my life. Wow, unbelievable how
much I've learned. And this is where you get to that place where you begin to see
that all right, it doesn't work, okay, fine. And we don't know how to make it work,
okay, fine. But what I'm interested in, is at least let me learn something about you,
let me learn something from you, let me at least see you in that context, and in that
way I can respect. I may even be able to find love in that.
Remember I talked about the G and the ego is one of the main themes in bonding,
looking for culture, looking for materialism. And here you can see that this is the
whole cultural trip. It is about enriching one's life intellectually, about enriching
one's life experientially. And it‟s a heresy. It says, yes, I know I'm supposed to be
here to be open to sexual reproduction, but actually I'm more interested in finding
out about other things. That‟s its heresy. And it's the beginning of the end of this
reproductive process. And because we're moving towards a 6th line mutation we‟re
really going to see this transformation, the way in which sexuality is truly going to
lose its essential power.

The 5/2
LAC Plane 2
The 5/2 is so obsessed with avoiding conflict that basically you can consider them
stillborn. They don't like conflict. They have a tough time with that. And the real
advantage, and I remember saying this a couple of years ago in doing a profiling
course, and it's something worth repeating in this context here about the nature of
2/5s and 5/2s is that because we live in the Internet age their ability to gain
knowledge is transforming in many ways the overall intelligence level of the planet.
So much in the past, the 5/2 never really got enough information to find a practical
that will actually work for them and to give them motivation. And if you're out there
in the world on the Cross of the Plane, the Cross of the Plane is messy. It's really
messy. You get to see horrible things. It‟s part of learning.
The fact is that for the 5/2, if they go outside and they see it, it is so difficult for
them. But, if they watch it on television or they see it on the Internet there is this
essential perfect isolation for them and they love it. But that, in many ways,
benefits us. We're going to be able to get much more out of 5/2s now than ever
before in our history because of these mediums being available, that they can live
out this kind of hermetic life.
The 5/1 is the only true exponent of the left angle. It‟s the only one that sells it.
And though the 5/2 would be a natural at doing this job, it rarely goes our because
of the double projection. And it rarely gets the opportunities to gain the depth
because it's not a 1 that studies, but if it's there in their environment, and they can
always gain access to it, as a gifted being they can actually get to an incredible level.
And obviously, at that point they may be able to give us back something; in other
words, the 5/2 blogger that you never see that‟s pumping out this wonderful stuff.
But you can't expect them to find a way to function in a relationship. It‟s very, very
difficult for them on the Cross of the Plane. The Cross of the Plane is difficult.

The Peacemaker; that‟s a joke, by the way, but you have to be an American to
understand that. In 1845 a man by the name of Colt invented a pistol, a handgun,
the Colt .45. It was a gun that carried six shots in it. It was very easy to use. It
had a very quick action and it was made very inexpensively. It was, I believe, the
very first mass-produced weapon. It was called The Peacemaker. So many people
don't really get some of these lines or keynotes because they're associated with
double entendres they don't have access to. So, it's always good to know that when
you look at this line, imagine somebody with a gun in their hand. That helps, sort of
gives some clarity to it; speaking of love.

Conflict
The discipline and integrity of a superior force to unilaterally—it sounds like George
again—cease conflict to permit surrender and survival of its foe. Wow. The highest
form of reason that life is sacred. I love this line. You go through a 3rd line phase,
and when you go through that 3rd line phase what you go through is the whole
process of what allegiance and failed allegiance teaches you. You go through the
bonds made and broken. You see the whole trip that is connected with that. And
that everything that you learned at the 3rd line stage was about destruction.
Think about what the 3rd line brings, the 3rd line brings destruction of old forms at a
price, an acceptable price; but nonetheless, thematically it‟s destruction. So if you‟re
a 6th line being, you have to see that one of the things that nurtured you when you
were young was that relationships can be destroyed, that there are partners that will
destroy it, that you are capable of destroying it, there are all these things that are in
it. And of course, this binary between being the most fertile and open, so it‟s the
one that can bring forth life the easiest, but it's also the most deeply connected to
destruction. It‟s only natural or logical.
But the 6 says I know the way it all works. So, I tell you what, my way or the
highway. Just like that; my way or the highway. And they don‟t do it that way.
They are 6s after all, they‟re role models. They will walk their way, and you know by
the way that they walk that you're never going to be able to change anything about
that, interfere with anything in that. There is nothing more incredibly powerful than
the 6.6. Why do you think that the 26.6 is justice; oh, baby, will they bring you
justice.
And what‟s it all about, what this arbitration and the peacemaker bring? They bring
an understanding that it's all about the conditions upon which we meet, it‟s all about
the conditions. And it's about seeing that under certain conditions it is all right to
meet. And under certain conditions it is not. And that the first condition that must
be eliminated is that you're meeting to reproduce. Number one, get rid of that. The
59.6 and the 6.6 are truly not very fertile. That‟s fading fast.
And the condition for the 5 and the 6 is basically the same. It's basically my way or
the highway, except the 5 plays the game of saying let somebody else tell us where
the highway is. But the 6 is very clear. And you can see that when the 6.6 that is
mutative, it‟s the 6/2 in this context, that when they get to their Kiron phase they
don‟t need a lover. They‟re not looking to the side to see if there's somebody there
for them. They just learn something from everything they see.
On the mundane level, all of these lines, the way we train people to read them, you
can see how obvious it is at that level it‟s so superficial. It works that way for the
not-self. But you really have to see that when you get to the 5 here, you get to the
6, you leave behind sex. You're only interested in knowledge. You're only interested
in experience. You feed right into the 36 the dreams of just give me more
experience so I get closer to clarity.

Introduction
When you think about the 46th gate, I want you first and foremost look. If you look
at the 46th gate and you look at the next seven gates that follow every single one of
them is a gate of the splenic system, every single one of them is a gate of primal
fear. If you think that we've had a rough opening eight gates when it comes to
duality and if you think of that the Vessel is going to do any good, people really don't
get what 46 is. It is the lead hexagram. It is the framer of all fear and all fear is in
the body. Primary fear, survival fear, physical fear, the body, the 46th gate that
what protects us, what makes us insecure, the 46th gate, and out of the 46th gate will
emerge all the fears of authority, of the death, of failure, of the past, of tomorrow, of
inadequacy, layer and layer of primary fears all out of the 46th gate, this nice gate of
the Vessel of Love.
I like the 46th gate. I like any gate that talks about good fortune, I think that's nice.
Good fortune that may be perceived as a result of serendipity, but derives from
effort and dedication. In other words, success has nothing to do with anything other
than it may show up while you're working. The whole thing is that the body keeps
functioning and as long as the body keeps functioning there may be a moment that
good fortune comes your way. And then again, it might not, but it's just about
keeping the body functioning. What is good luck? No choice.

The 1/3 Vessel of Love—that always makes me so damn nervous to begin with.
Think about it. You have a 1/3 Vessel of love, right, and the personality says, okay,
love is the body, and the 3rd line underneath immediately discovers that well, yeah,
sort of. I think that the 46th gate is the only gate that teaches no choice. So I can
be serious for a moment here, I don't think I've ever said that. In the 46th gate you
can truly see choicelessness.
The 46th gate, despite the fact that it's abstract, is much more connected to the
individual process in that it is truly existential. That serendipity takes place in the
now, the good fortune takes place in the now. The heading is so perfect: may be
perceived. People never read the lines, never really read them. What does “may be
perceived” mean? I really wrote good lines, guys. What does it mean, may be
perceived? It doesn‟t mean anything. You can it serendipity and you can call it

helplessness, you can call it choicelessness, you can perceive it any way you want.
Good for you. But in the end it's just about having gone through a life, nothing else.
The whole mystery of the 29/46 is „never stop until you die.‟ It‟s keep on going,
baby, this is the way. And you get it in the 1st line because the 1/3 is Being
Discovered. Oh it‟s beautiful:
Dedication in obscurity that is
unexpectedly discovered. All that‟s
saying is that stay alive, you never
know. It‟s not like stay alive and be
good, or stay alive and be great, or
stay alive and be wonderful. Being
discovered has nothing to do with
what you do. It‟s all about what to
avoid not doing.
It's so wonderful. This is the
foundation of choicelessness. And
everybody says that this is what I‟m
going to do. Art for art’s sake—I
never meant this guy, but it‟s cute—
art for art's sake. Well, yes, that's
the point, but that's the life; life for
life‟s sake, doing for doing‟s sake,
being for being‟s safe, loving for
loving‟s sake. What is it, after all?
And if it turns out that you win the lottery, that you get the best of this, very good,
you can call it anything you want, these things happen. They just happen, or not.
I love that expression: Shit happens. This is it. This is the movie. You want to be
discovered, well, no guarantees, but, if you just keep staying alive you never know
what will happen. Now, if you don't have that attitude the next seven gates are
going to torment you. They‟re going to carve you to pieces and scare the hell out of
you and you‟re spend your whole life in the thrall of fear. And it's right there in the
46th—holy, holy, holy gate.
It is, in fact, the vessel itself; the physical vessel is the 46. It‟s not the aura, which
is the 15. It‟s not the lip where the 10 comes out. It‟s not the 25 that is the blood
of life that fills it. It is the vessel; nothing else. We are the filtering vessel. That's
us. And we get what we get, period. It doesn't matter what you perceive. I love
that, it may be perceived as, yes, good. It keeps you busy, right? All that
perceiving is wonderful, but in fact, you cannot sit on that and say, it is this.
1/3s hates this. The 1/3 on this cross says, what do you mean. I keep on pulling
myself up after all these failures of working so hard, and why don't I get recognized
now. You can‟t imagine how many musicians I know in my life that are so talented
and were never discovered. And they‟re always trying to figure out why they were
discovered—it may be perceived.

This is the good luck/bad luck gate. This is where everybody goes, oh, and the
vanity to assume that you can work on being discovered like it really is something.
All of this is a sales pitch. It‟s the deepest, most beautiful part of the 46. The 46
says I want to tell you right from the beginning, if you don't live life for the sake of
life you're going to be frightened, you‟re going to be alone and it's not going to be
pleasant. It‟s what it says.

When you‟re dealing with the 1/4 it all depends on the way in which their parents are
going to operate in terms of what it means to be dedicated. If you‟re a 1/4 and you
see that your parents really stay with things, that they don't give out easily, that it's
any much easier for the 1/4 child to have this kind of resistance, regardless. And
remember, one of the most dynamic themes of the 46/29 is this be in the process so

RAC Vessel of Love 3
The Prima Donna—every line I read please go back to “perceived as”—a difficult
and demanding nature that succeeds despite its behavior because of the depth of its
talents. Or: Unrealistic demands and offensive nature of egocentric mediocrity. The
dilemma of vanity—there you are going along minding your own business and you
get lucky. And in getting lucky you assume that you‟re responsible. And in
assuming that you're responsible you become a very, very uncomfortable force. And
more than that, you‟re 2nd line; you don't know why you were discovered. More 2nd
lines get discovered that anybody else. You don‟t know why you've been discovered,
you don't really even know how you do what you do that got you discovered in the
first place. And so there is this sense of “I'm special. I got discovered, and now that
I'm special please bow down.”
And it doesn't matter whether you're mediocre as hell, because remember that being
successful or being discovered or any good fortune is not dependent on what you
think, relatively speaking, is your quality. Remember, “perceived as,” it‟s hilarious.
I'd love to do this is as a comedy routine. This gate is so funny because this is the
great pretending gate. We‟re always pretending through this gate. We‟re
pretending that we‟re great. We‟re pretending that were special. We‟re pretending
that we've earned everything. We‟re pretending that it's ours. Well, it catches up
with you after awhile.
The whole thing about this gate is that it is there to prepare you for the truth, and
the truth is that, after all, this is an identity gate, this is not the emotional system,
this is the way, in a sense. It is the way of the body. And the whole thing is that
the way of the body is no matter what the personality or the passenger, no matter

how they manipulate what they think they perceive this is just a body trip. And if
you surrender to your body trip, you will see that, yeah, you might be discovered.
You see that if you are discovered, you might be a prima donna. It doesn't really
matter.
It's just this recognition that there is no choice. Obviously, if we're dealing with
partnership and this is the theme in our duality movement is that discovering the
other, the partner that's the prima donna, that obviously these are themes. And
these are all very, very deep body themes. And of course, the not-self is lost in the
body. It‟s very hard for people to accept serendipity. It‟s very hard for people to
accept good fortune. It‟s very hard for people to accept luck. It's very hard for
people to accept No Choice or helplessness because it's all the same thing. And so
we don't. We end up creating all kinds of invented explanations in order to try to put
it in a frame that we work with and can understand.
Specialness is a disease in humanity. I remember how many arguments I had with
people when they would say, well, this is great that you‟re bringing in this stuff and I
would say, no choice, and they would say, yes, but it you‟re special and I would say
that‟s not true. Specialness is one of those things that is a response to not
understanding why things happen. It happened to me, I‟m lucky, I must be special.
I must be the special one. And if I'm the special one then I want you to treat me
accordingly.

The 2/5
RAC Vessel of Love 3
The one thing about the 2/5 in this kind of the position is that you rarely get to feel
this prima donna quality in them. They don't want anybody know, because they
don‟t know how to tell anybody why; and at the same time, they're paranoid that it
will be taken away. Maybe it's not really mine. Do you know how many people are
discovered who end up with deep, deep psychological problems because they don't
understand why they‟ve been pulled out of that, why they suddenly have success
and others don‟t? It‟s like the people that survived some kind of a horrible thing and
many die. Why am I the one that survived? Why am I the one that it picked out?
And for most of those people it is deeply, deeply disturbing for them, they don't
really come to clear conclusions about that.

I like the 3/5. This is a great 3/5 position. It‟s wonderful for them. Interestingly
enough, the line is called Projection. And of course, we do not associate that as a
3rd line theme; so again, it‟s something interesting to see this quality somehow
moving in there. And it‟s a very, very mixed bag of a line. You can tell. The Moon
exalted talks about a practical approach to good fortune, the 5th line theme and the

Mars talks about the tendency to projection to treat a potential future as the present.
It‟s very logical. There are very funny things mixed up in this.
However, what's interesting about it and what's the most interesting thing about it is
that this is not about projection as the way we know in the 2 and the 5. This is more
like having a telescope and wanting to see down the track and wanting to see where
good fortune is going to be. And not only that, but being very practical about the
fact that is was just on your way.
There are some people who are very comfortable with luck if—think about it, think
about the line, it can be perceived as anything—but it derives directly from effort and
dedication. It‟s like me. I‟ve had 18 years doing this now, 18 years of effort and
dedication. 18 years. It's so easy to consider myself lucky now. I‟m really lucky.
I‟m so lucky. And you can perceive it as any way that you want. It doesn‟t make
any difference. The underlying thing is, if you just live long enough, you get what
you get. And if you‟re correct you get what you deserve.
It‟s as simple as that. It‟s just a road. Here‟s the road. The 3 sees the road. The 3
knows the plane, the 3 knows the concretized way, the 3 knows mutation, knows the
material, knows all of that; it‟s a road. Go down the road, and 3s are good at that.
Go down the road; fall down, stand up, fall down, stand up, go down the road. You
never know. Maybe you end up riding in a limo all the way until the end. You never
know, you don‟t know, but you just keep on doing it, living, and breathing, day by
day.
I like what my 93 year old mother likes to say. She says, when I wake up in the
morning I realize that I have another day in front of me. How do you deal with the
world at that age? I wake up every day and there‟s another day in front of me.
What else to do but go through the day. There isn‟t anything else to do. This is life.
You get up in the morning and you go through the day. This is what the 46 teaches.
It says, get up in the morning and go through the day. And later in the day at night
maybe you think about what happened to you during the day, maybe that's good for
you, maybe you learn something, maybe you get somewhere with it. But just get up
in the morning and go through the day; that‟s all. There‟s nothing else to do.
As a matter of fact, you have no choice but to wake up in the morning and go
through the day, unless you die in your sleep. You have no choice. You might as
well as accept that, too. And you never know. You might wake up one morning and
during the course of that day you‟re life changes and then you can say, just like me,
aren‟t I lucky. How lucky I am.
The 3/5, because of the nature of the 3rd line personality, there are going to be
difficulties, and it is going to be difficult for them in the sense that it's often so hard
for them to believe that just around the next corner may be the one thing that will
change their life, despite the fact that they have that 3rd line personality. That 5
unconscious can be such a problem for them. At a certain point it just gets—I‟m not
a lucky person, they‟ll say. These things never happen to me. I don‟t know why I
should keep on doing this. There's nothing more difficult than having this kind of
martyr personality in this kind of gate.

The other thing is about seeing this again in our duality is realizing that one of the
things that the 3/5 is very much aware of is something that's very nice, which is if
there is ever going to be somebody for me it will happen. They learn that you can‟t
pursue it. And if they‟re just dedicated to their process, if they're putting in their
effort every day they may get lucky.

The 3/6
RAC Vessel of Love 3
The 3/6s have—there‟s more stability in this quarter. As Vessels in this sense and
here they know that things just happen, and most of the time they don't like it, and
that's really what separates them from the 3/5. The 3/5 is not really sure that it's
just “things happen,” and needs to find that out. And the 3/6 knows that things just
happen but doesn‟t necessarily like it.
After all, the interesting thing about what it is to be in the 46th gate is to realize that
the 46th gate somehow very mysteriously contains a lot of information from many
different streams. Its relationship to the spleen, to the tribal in the spleen, to the
individual in the spleen, to the collective in the spleen, and it has this inside of it; it‟s
there. And the practicality of this 3rd line theme, at the deepest level this is purely
material. After all, it‟s a body gate. And if you want to know the secret to success in
business here it is. It derives from effort and dedication, and may be perceived as
I'm a genius, I pulled it off, or I got lucky, or whatever you want to say, you can
perceive it anyway you want.
It‟s the effort and dedication. It‟s one of those things I realize that my father kept
saying to me and I didn't understand. He didn't care what I did, interestingly
enough, he just wanted it to be worthy, but he didn‟t care what I did. What he cared
about was that I would stay with it. He said to me, you don‟t understand that if you
stay with something long enough you will see what it is to be a success in your spirit,
because, if you do get success, if you are lucky, you can feel good about it. If you're
not dedicated, if you don't put in the effort, and the gods smile on you, I guarantee
you it's a disease, it will eat you alive. Those people that wish for things that they
have not earned, wow, don‟t you ever get delivery. You won't like it.

Any line that‟s called Impact is a line that is going to be something that you need to

potential for impact is there it has enormous potential to move quickly from
obscurity to positions of power. Now, again, it‟s still good luck which comes from
being determined that eventually, being in the right place at the right time, leads to

recognition. It's also a Plutonian reaction to achievement that tends to bite off the
hand that fed it, ignore the people that helped them get there.
The one thing that the 46 knows is that whatever you get you get from the gods.
It‟s the Vessel of Love. It‟s deeply spiritual at one level. No one who is on the
serendipity trail truly accepts that anyone is responsible for anything. Things
happen. If you‟re at the right place at the right time and you're prepared, you‟re the
winner. And just because somebody is there or somebody is walking with you when
you end up in the right place at the right time doesn't mean you owe them anything,
and they‟re the ones that always whine, the ones that are left behind.
Again, we can see a dark side in the 4. We‟re dealing with a 4/6, we‟re going to deal
with the situation that in the first part of the life of the 4/3 phase, and this is really
the end of the Vessel process, so we have this closing view, this overview. Their
power is to influence others to be determined. That is the power. And it‟s their
power in relationship. It‟s their power to be able to say, look, the only way they
were going to make it is if we just wake up every morning and keep on doing our
best. If we‟re determined, if we keep on making an effort, maybe we can find a way
to be together. It‟s very powerful.
And it's particularly powerful when the 4 can speak from their own experience and
deliver that as influence to the other. And again, the 4/6 ultimately can be a role
model of that. It's like the story of the factory floor and you have a bunch of people
that are friends and they go out every day and they drink together and all of a
sudden one of them is pulled out and pulled into the upper ranks, pulled into the
management, pulled away from the floor. Those friendships don't last. There is
resentment and it doesn't disappear. It doesn't. And the 4 understands this. The 4
understands that there is a resentment to luckiness.
So, the way it tries to compensate is it tries to tell people that they can learn how to
be lucky. Now, however they phrase it, remember this gate tells you the truth, it
says it can be perceived as anything. Underlying whatever the sales pitch is,
underlying that is just, hey look, put your shoulder to the wheel, keep your shoulder
to the wheel, and sooner or later, maybe, something will happen, and you'll be able
to say, wow, aren‟t I lucky.

Cross of Serendipity is a pressure cooker. And of course, when you see this Cross of
Serendipity and you see this power of the impact and you look underneath you can
see what this is all about, this is all about the energy to correct, the energy to
perfect.
Everybody thinks that everybody
has a right to luck. It‟s what logic
would assume. Logic would say,
well, if there are people who are
lucky, we have to figure out why,
what makes them lucky, how does
this luck come to them, how can we
get people into this situation where
they can be lucky, too. It‟s why
lotteries are so successful. Lottery
is the logical way to solve that
problem. We‟ll create a pattern
where anyone with a living of 50
bucks a year or whatever can
suddenly earn in 175 million,
whatever the case may be. Some
of these super lotteries are spooky.
I don‟t know what these people do
with 200 million dollars, let alone
anything else, anyway.
This is the way logic compensates for this. Logic says, okay; let‟s create a lucky
machine, the mystical lottery of Babylon. Let‟s create the lucky machine and we can
distribute lucky this way. So, the Juxtaposition Cross of Serendipity says anybody—
sales pitch—anybody can be in the right place at the right time. And of course, we
know that everybody is already in the right place at the right time, they just don‟t
know that. What a sales pitch.

So, you get to 5/1, you get to Pacing: proper rhythm, instinctive practicality, avoid
radical divergence and stay with successful patterns, and you, too can be lucky. The
whole thing about the heresy is that the heresy sets up this plan and the plan says
that lucky means healthy. So let's say that you want to be healthy. The 5 says to
you, this is the way you‟re healthy, proper rhythm, this will make you healthy.
Instinctive practicality; this is healthy. Avoid divergence from successful patterns;
this is healthy. Do all of that and everything is all right.
What is it to be unhealthy? It‟s when you reject the very patterns that have been
proven to be successful. So, the 5/1 on the Cross of Healing says, you don‟t have to
be unhealthy. All you have to do is follow these simple rules, because if you follow
these simple rules you too can be lucky. Now, of course, how do you get to the
proper rhythm when you're the 46
and not the 15? I find that
wonderful. How do you get to
practicality? Well, it‟s a 5th line;
okay we‟ll give it the benefit of the
doubt. Where are the successful
patterns? They have to be in logic,
this is an abstract gate. What‟s
going on here? Oh, I love this
stuff.
The heresy is that right here in this
deep, deep, deep abstract place
there is no abstract anymore.
There is simply this recognition that
we‟re not in charge of anything,
we‟d better not claim to be in
charge of anything. That in fact, all
we have to do is be these simple
things which we can only do
correctly if somehow mechanically
we know how to do that. This is the magic of what we offer anybody. We give them
this mechanic that says, you don't have to worry about figuring out how to be in the
proper rhythm, how to find the right practicality, how to do this, how to do that. You
can‟t do that. All you can do is follow a strategy that it is correct for you and you will
see that everything else will fall into place.
The irrational rejection is part of this. Most people think that the Cross of Healing is
about people being healers when it‟s about healing. It‟s not like somebody who
carries the Cross of Healing is a healer. They‟re not. There's only one thing that
brings well being, and it is a combination of pace and integrity. It is written in these
lines. Now, the pace is not ours to choose. And the moment that we do not, the
moment that we cannot be surrendered, there‟s no point; we‟re never going to find a
rhythm, we‟re never going to be correct.

Good luck, you can see it everywhere, everywhere you look. You see it everywhere.

The 5/2 here with pacing, again that 5 will bring out all of their rejectionism. The 46
sits in the middle of this duality realm and isn't interested in duality. You notice that
the way I describe it, it‟s not interested in duality. It accepts duality. It‟s the Vessel
of Love, it knows what‟s going on, but the thing is that for it it‟s clear that the only
way that duality works is not by figuring out the 2, but enlightening the 1. In other
words, each of those vehicles in space, it‟s on their shoulders. They just simply have
to be in their process and whatever will then happen is what happens. And if you're

Integrity: The wisdom to secure one’s identity through careful consideration of the
restrictive potential of commitments; the determination to say no to restrictive
commitments. Or: Deceiving oneself and others by overextending one’s resources
and eventually of being in the position of having to break promises; a drive for
success that will not say no, and will end up breaking promises. It‟s a funny line,
this integrity line. Where the hell is the integrity? You read this line and you say,
“Where‟s the integrity?” And worse the detriment is Neptune? Integrity, is there a
key in here somewhere?
Never accept anything that restricts you; nothing. Anything that's going to restrict
you is the moment that you are going to be caught away from what is right for you.
That is, to be correct simply in living. The 46th gate isn‟t a gate of making
commitment. The 29th gate is the gate of making commitment. The 46th gate
doesn‟t know how to say yes or no. It‟s never known how to say yes or no.

But remember the theme of the 46th gate—it can be perceived as. And that
everything that you see in this line is lived out in the 6/2, 6/3 life in the first 30
years. They end up in restrictive commitments. This is the lover that says, I don‟t
mind. I see that meeting you is something that's happening, but I'm not going to
make a commitment. It'll ruin it, because the moment I make a commitment I get
into “how do I make this work between you and me?” And it's not about how do I
make this work between you and me.
All I have is my movement with dedication and effort. And of course, the most
difficult thing to grasp is that if you don't have the dedication and effort, there is
nothing for you in this life. You must be out there, you must be involved, and you
must be in the heart of the life process. But surrendered, with no expectation, no
pattern, no anything because it doesn't matter what life gives you. You could always
perceive it any way you like. So you might as well perceive it as good and nice. You
can.
And as long as you don't commit yourself to something, it‟s going to be much easier
for you to do that. And we're not talking about—remember I‟m taking you to a much
deeper level here—we‟re not talking about the surface concept of commitment, we‟re
talking about the passenger. The passenger is saying, I don‟t make commitments, I
can‟t. I‟m in here; don‟t you see that? I‟m not this vehicle. I don‟t make
commitments. I don‟t know what a commitment is, you idiot. I‟m a 46 anyway.
What I do know is that I'm really lucky that you are there, so far, as long as it lasts,
for better or worse, in sickness and in heath, but no commitment, just effort and
dedication. And effort and dedication is deeply, deeply personal. And when you get
to the 6, particularly when you get to the 6/3, what you're actually getting to is the
deepest kind of individuality like you would find in integration or in the centering
circuit, this deep, deep individuality, the very heart of this 46.6.
For me, it's so clear that every single one of the lines of the 46 is themes of
choicelessness. It's all about choicelessness; it‟s all about accepting the body. It‟s
about recognizing the holiness of the form, and that the holiness of the form in the
form principle itself is about the acceptance that the body is the life. The body is the
life. So, let it live. And then from your perspective you can call it anything you
want.
Gee, I just fell into a pit of snakes. Aren‟t I lucky? And look I got out and didn‟t get
bitten, aren‟t I lucky. What a great life. After all, you could make up anything you
want about your life, you do anyway. We all do. This is what it is saying. It‟s
saying you can call it anything you want, anything you like, who cares what you call
it. It just helps you live it. And that you can see in the very, very basic sense of
what we call our inner psychology that to approach life in this way is to be totally
liberated. The body has its life, and the passenger says, aren‟t I lucky, and
everything is okay.

Introduction
Let‟s begin with the 18th gate, Work on What Has Been Spoilt. This is one of the
most incredible quadrants of the zodiac. And after all, what you're looking at here
are seven gates in a row that represents the deepest most primal basic fears that we
have. They are, in fact, the heart and soul of what we call our lymphatic system, our
defense system, our immune system. So, one of the things to keep in mind is that
whenever you look at the calendar, you look at the calendar as if it were the Rave
Mandala and you realize that Sun is going to be in the 46th gate an the autumnal
equinox, that you know between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice, which
is going to be when the Sun reaches the 10th gate, you know in those first three, four
or 5 weeks you know that you're going to be in the heart of programming fear. That
there's going to be more fear in the world, that there is going to be more people that
are letting go of things that are good for them because that is the response of
undefined splenic system when it's defined. That is, it will let go of things that are
good for it.
We‟re on the Right Angle Cross of Service. Again, this is one of those crosses where
there is an assumption of usefulness. People like to enjoy the names of their crosses
or profiles or special lines they have. With the Right Angle Cross of Service, there is
no question that what we're looking at here is by far one of the deepest most logical
collective crosses that you can imagine. You‟ve got the 58-52, you have root energy
of the logical process, the 52 is the format energy, and you have the 18, the 18 is
going to form a definition with the 58 so you have a cross that has a built-in life
force and the life force is judgment and dissatisfaction. And of course, the 17th gate,
the logical opinions, the logical organizing of concepts.
Remember what we learned at the very beginning of duality about the way in which
logic confronts duality. Logic looks at duality and says this doesn't work; let's find a
pattern that makes it survivable. And that when you're looking at the 18/58 you're
looking at one of the most incredible forces we have, truly. And for that reason it‟s
not necessarily pleasant. That is, it is the built-in capacity, through the 58th gate,
through what is essentially its foundation, which is the love of life itself to provide
the energy to correct. And the energy to correct is, in fact, the energy to perfect.
The whole thing about the logical process is that perfection is always the carrot just
beyond your nose. But as you keep on correcting towards perfection, what in fact is
seen from the outside appears to be beautiful.
In other words, once you've achieved a level of talent 16/48, the fact that you can
get even better and better and better is a subtlety that's most often your own, and
not necessarily something that the other sees. So, you have a concert as a
musician, you‟re a 16/48, you walk away deeply dissatisfied because there were
moments in it where you felt you just weren't right. And yet the audience is still
standing and applauding. In other words, when you see this perfection, please
recognize that the goal is not perfection, because that would be a killer. And of
course, it is in the end, it‟s just death. That's about as perfect as you get. There is
no problem after that.

But, the whole logical process is this correcting process. And if you want to make it
feel better when you hear it you can call it a perfecting process, which the 18/58‟s
themselves would prefer as a label, instead of bitch. Just call me the great
perfector. Don‟t call me bitch, call me the great perfector.

Let‟s begin with Conservatism. In the way in which we teach this on the mundane
plane, when we talk about the 18th gate, we‟re talking about the Oedipal/Electra
gate. We‟re talking about the fear of authority. So, let‟s put this in the framework
of not challenging your mother or your father, which is the way that it lives out, but
let‟s look at the root of why it‟s lived out that way. At the root of why it‟s lived out
that way is the basic battle between
the yin and the yang, and it gets
transferred to the children, to the
collective.
But what we're really looking at is
that at the very foundation of the
perfection process is that you have
the adherence to traditional patterns
despite and/or in spite of changing
circumstances. In other words,
we've always bonded this way, it‟s
always been man and woman, I‟m
not going to put up with any of this
gay shit now, it‟s all about man and
woman, and this is what we're here
for, and all we have to do is work on
it.

correct from birth. After all, you need tools, you have to learn something. You have
to live long enough to know a pattern before you can begin to criticize it. So, this is
something that you grow into, in that sense.
The 1/3; on one side of this is gradual modification. Now, basically what we've seen
in the male-female relationship, sort of, is a gradual modification that's been taking
place over let's say the last 150 years. The way in which a husband and wife, at
least within the Western context, the way which husband and wife deal with each

other, but you also have the—Jupiter is funny, Jupiter can be very heavy. As much
as Jupiter can be a blessing, here you see Jupiter at its patriarchal side: The
patriarch whose rigidity guarantees deterioration; the potential to refuse to correct.
So, at the very foundation of the way in which logic is going to look at how do we
perfect duality is that we have a basic conservatism that starts us off, which means
that we can never really get away from husband and wife despite whatever kind of
illusion we establish. In other words, the 18th gate says this is the way it is. Now,
what we have to do is not try to destroy what it is, but perfect what it is. And one
side says okay, we'll start with this and we'll work our way through.
Remember you‟re dealing with the 1/3. Remember, the 1/3 looks at the foundation,
sees that its mother and father get divorced, or see that they have enormous
problems and separate or all of these things that frighten children, then the 3rd line
underneath is going to see in that the inherent anarchy that lives in trying to come
together with the other.
However, if they‟re living out that 1st line foundation they are not going to reject
marriage is a possibility. They will not. It‟s built in. When I say marriage, I mean
the bond, the mating bond. They‟re not going to reject that. What they're going to
look at is they are going to challenge the authority of their parents. The father didn‟t
treat the mother correctly; the mother didn‟t treat the father correctly. In other
words, they will look for something in the way in which their parents dealt with each
other that they want to correct.
The way in which my parents dealt with each other is that they argued. For children,
that‟s always annoying. They always argued. I hate arguments as a result. My idea
of a relationship is you don't argue, you talk things out, but you don't argue. This is
a natural thing that happens in this kind of 18 trip. It‟s not that there is something
wrong with the bond, there's something wrong with the way in which the beings are
operating and that's something we can perfect setting collective rules.
You can also see the detriment here. Why we still have so much power in the hands
of the patriarch. Why the male is still dominating. The male is still dominating
because unfortunately for the yin it‟s rooted here in this detriment. And this is a
foundation. So the one thing to realize is that as long as we‟re in these forms you're
going to have at least half of humanity that is going to be under the thumb of the
male and the other half is going to be working out some kind of bargain and basically
that's what we see. We see attempts in more advanced societies where women have
finally been allowed to be educated at an equal level to men, and we're beginning to
see this, it‟s gradual actually, this gradual change in the way in which that
relationship works, the way the responsibilities in terms of the bond work.
But on the other side we see that despite that we still live in a world where
patriarchy rules and that the patriarchy is very rigid. Now in that case, the best
thing you can do was correct the patriarch. Only a 1/3 has the balls to do that. A
1/3 on this cross will really be of service. It will say, Dad, you're a jerk. You‟re jerk
the way you treat Mom, you‟re a jerk the way you treat others, you‟re a real jerk,
wake up. And only a child, by the way, can get away with that, which doesn't

necessarily mean that the patriarch father is going to agree. The daughter in India
that tells her father that she is marrying somebody from the cast below and fuck
him, she wants her rights, he‟s going to have her burnt today, now.
We live in an ugly world. So understand something about duality as perceived by
logic. Logic says pair bonding is the way, let's do what we can to correct it, but also
realize that pair bonding is the way and most of the time men are going to rule and
we‟d better work on them. I see the job, all of these years doing this work; the ratio
in this room is just about right. There are always many, many more women than
men. It‟s a much harder process to get to males. It‟s a much more difficult process
to correct that male archetype.
And so what do we end up with? We end up with an enormous fear of the authority
that engendered in relationship. In other words, that one of the themes here is that
authority is established in this conservative pattern. And of course it's the children
that are afraid it. The children they will have to challenge it.

The 1/4
RAC Service 3
When you‟re dealing with a 1/4 you know precisely the way this is going to work. If
there is a rigid father, whether you're the daughter or the son, you‟re only going to
accept a relationship where there is a rigid father. You expect it, even though that
father may be quite obnoxious, you're still going to expect it. And of course, if
you‟re raised on the other side, then the next generation can do even better.
I look at myself as a yang-yang male and what I do in terms of my relationship in
terms of what was traditionally female roles, I do many, many things that even 20
years ago men just simply didn't do. And it‟s not like it's a big deal. It's so obvious
to me how powerful the nurturing conditioning field is on the not-self, how much the
way in which men and women treat each other have to do with the way their parents
treated each other, no matter what you say or do about it all. The not-self is deeply
conditioned by that, deeply. And you can see in this with this conservatism at the
root of the 18, you can see the perpetuation generation after generation after
generation of the same thing.

I like the 2nd line of the 18. I think it‟s one of those lines that is so perfect:
Terminal Disease. I love the name too, I‟m an old shocker, I can remember in the
early years people saying, am I going to die, and I said yes, yes you are. I don‟t
know when, but it is terminal.

The recognition that what has been spoiled is irreversible. I love this. You can‟t fix
it so don't try. This is a wonderful line. Unfortunately, it‟s attached to the not-self,
too. The not-self doesn't really want to fix anything. It is work, and you‟ve got to
have some background in it and it might mean that they have to really look into
things carefully. This is from Pluto, if you think you‟re going to find truth in this line,
you‟re a fool. Acceptance and strength derived from a faith in spiritual regeneration.
What the hell does that mean? The acceptance that there is no potential for
correction. In other words, it's in the hands of the gods.
This is a great line, because the whole thing about the 18 is that it is so
overwhelmed with its fears that it figures that if it doesn't fix it, it will die. It has to
fix it. How upset 18s are when they see something that needs to be fixed and it‟s
not fixed right away, even if it‟s a minor thing. It eats at them. And this line says,
can‟t be fixed, and you get the futile ranging against the win.
Remember my warning: Beware of Moons in detriment. Nothing is more devastating
in all the activations than the Moon in detriment. Moon in detriment lines give you
such a whack. And this raging at the wind is one of the things that I notice is an
archetype of 18s, particularly the 18s that are generators, who have this deep
frustration and there is howling at the gods that it can't be fixed, because they know
it can‟t be fixed.
The other side is, this is the closest, the very, very closest that logic gets to
spirituality. It's as close as logic gets. After all, logic cannot accept that there is a
God. It can accept that there is a pattern that may lead to Godhead, but not that
there‟s a God. And yet at the same time, here in the 18.2, you have logic actually
crying out to the abstract. It's crying out basically to the 30th gate to the fates and
saying, maybe you can do something about this. Maybe there's something that I
don't know about that can actually bring about some kind of correction.
But if you can‟t correct, then what do you fear, what authority are you afraid of
then? It‟s not about you saying that your mother and father got it wrong. You're
saying that the Holy got it wrong, and that's why in the logic system we end up with
a Father-God. You end up with this rigid foundation dragged from the detriment of
the 1st line and in the 2nd line it becomes the ranging at God: Fix this, please dear
Lord, fix it. I can't, nobody can, only you can. And you can see that if you look at
evangelism you can see that this is the heart and soul of evangelism, that we are full
of sin, that we are terminal in our limitation, that there is nothing we can do, and
that all we need to do is channel the raging into the wind into a nice coordinated
prayer: Dear Lord, I'm bad. I'm weak. I'm afraid. Dear Lord, save me. It‟s a great
line.
If you‟re a 2/4 and you get called here, you know what you‟re called to, you know
right away. And boy can you be of service on this Cross of Service. We‟re holding
services today. Morning Mass, evening prayers, five times a day get down, point

you‟d better be afraid. This is a vicious God. It will punish you for 10 generations.
This is really vicious. Gods logically should be feared. I think it‟s wonderful.
So there is the 2/4 missionary and everybody says where do you get the missionary
from the 2/4. It‟s right here. And guess what the new partnership is? I‟m the pride
of Jesus. Yeah, do it honey. If you‟re going to marry someone, you might as well
marry Jesus, right? I didn‟t realize that Jesus was a polygamist. You have all these
brides of Jesus, there are so many brides of Jesus. Where does it say that you‟re
allowed to be a polygamist?
Anyway, aside for my black sense of humor, think about it. What do you think the
evangelists call the men and women that are there in front of them? They say,
brother, sister—this is the line of brotherhood/sisterhood—brother, sister fear God.
We are unable to correct the way. We need God‟s light to do that. Heal us, dear
Lord. Oh, I love it. It‟s so funny. If you go to the tribe, for the tribe God is very,
very, very personal. It's so personal it‟s spooky. And they're really very different,
because for them, God only has to do with being allowed to kill. After all, for the
tribe, the one thing is that they get to kill to eat. And for them, this is the whole
business of religion. They thank the spirits of whatever they kill because they can
eat.
But logic says, let's have something large. Let‟s have something that fits everyone.
And how do we bring them all together? We scare the piss out of them. And you
can only do that if they have no way of being able to do what you promised God can
do. You can't get to heaven on your own. You‟ve got a terminal disease. It‟s called
being human. We‟re here to show you the way. And how do they show you the
way? They give you a pattern. Every Sunday you come here, you join us, brother
and sister, in praying to this God that it does not turn its vengeance against us.
And when we go to the 28.2, what do you think the 28.2 does? It says, shake hands
with the devil. Here‟s the 18.2 saying, be afraid of God. And the 28.s says shake
hands with the devil. And you can see what‟s going on here in the spleen, what do
you do with fear. If the 2/4 isn‟t called out, this is a terrified being on this cross. I
don‟t need to be of service to anybody. I barely can be of service to myself.
This line has more impact on our lives than just about anything, because it sets up
this universal fear that none of us can personally deal with. We can‟t, we‟re not
allowed. The individual says if I can‟t be one with God, I'll shake hands with the
devil. At least the devil will shake my hand. God‟s up there telling me that it's going
to kill me if I'm not doing this or that. The devil says I can do whatever I want. And
at least the devil I meet. You never get to meet God. That‟s its power.
If an 18/58 actually could meet God, what do you think the result of that would be?
They‟d come back to Earth and they‟d say, I‟m not really impressed. It doesn't
work. Logic will always seek protection. Even God can't be perfect to an 18/58; it‟s
not possible.

So there can‟t be any collective God that you can really touch, because otherwise
you wouldn't be afraid. You wouldn‟t even if it turned out to be an ogre, it wouldn‟t
give you that kind of fear. All you would do as a human being is figure out how to
kill it. We tried, by the way, humanity tried to kill God in the 50s. Time Magazine
published on the front page: God Is Dead. It‟s my favorite front cover of Time. God
Is Dead on the front cover. I thought good, great. We tried. It doesn‟t work. We‟re
scared. And it‟s right here, it‟s in the logic. And this is the service to humanity.

The 2/5
RAC Service 3
Fives always have to deal with the fact that the moment that the other meets them
there is always this one millionth of a second positive projection. And one of the
things about the 2/5s that is so uncomfortable in this configuration is that there's
actually a projection on them that despite the fact that they say it can't be fixed that
somehow there's the assumption that they can fix it. That in fact, they can
communicate with God. You don‟t want to live with that is as a projection. And of
course again, one of the things you see about 2/5s and 5/2s is how they pull away
and that you don't see it.
I was curious about something, so I was looking at the global survey this morning.
It‟s interesting because it adds several hundred every day and so I like to watch the
fluctuations in movements and whatever. The most interesting thing to note is that
the harmonic profile that is by far the largest in terms of entries is a 2/5. And you
can see right away what I talked about yesterday about the advantages of the
technological age for 2/5s and 5/2s, that they can actually play a role and integrate
from that virtual space.
It‟s just interesting to see that of those harmonic profiles that are going to the site to
download free charts, here is the 2/5 and it‟s way ahead percentage wise. It's about
half a percentage point higher than all of the other harmonic profiles, which is really
statistically a lot. So, it interesting to see that yes they are locked away, they‟ve got
their 2, they‟re more likely to be hooked into that virtual outlet where they're safe—
the 5, the paranoia, the general they can wait at a distance before it really needs to
be called waiting for that practical moment and all that stuff.
But again, when you're looking at this in the context of the duality there is this
recognition that you cannot fix your relationship with the other. It's just there. And
for the 2/5 it will bring a deep reticence to simply get involved with that. They're
more likely to have good relationships over the telephone, over the Internet, ways in
which they don't really have to come out and threaten their aura, in that sense.

The Zealot: The energetic obsession to clean house. I love this line. Eighteens can
clean as well as anybody. They‟re wonderful. It‟s not so much that they clean as
well as anybody; after all it depends on many other factors in their design. It‟s just
that they know where the dirt is. The cleaners who come to my house to clean my
house, they never get to leave that house with a sense that they have actually done
something perfect, there's too much 18 energy my house. It‟s like, ah they missed
this. I never even see it. I don‟t even know it‟s there.
The zealot: The dissolution of old forms at an acceptable price—how nice—an
obsession with correction and its critical potential; an obsession with correction that
does not bring satisfaction. This is a rigid judgmentation. You‟re looking at the most
vicious, I hate to say it, the most accurate criticism you're going to find anywhere;
but, it is very, very uncomfortable. You don't want an 18.3 trying to clean you.
There‟s something interesting about an 18.3 trying to be of service to the collective.
But the moment that you translate that into the personal, you‟ve got yourself a
partner that is going to correct you to death; until death do you part. Remember,
they accept that you‟re going to be there. They keep on working on you over and
over and over again. Ten years of telling you to put the toilet seat down. Ten years
of telling you squeeze toothpaste from the back first; 10 years on and on and on,
and the never let go.
One of the things about the collective is that the collective can never understand
when they are interpreted personally. I guess it's some kind of magical innocence
that they're given by God, because they don't really understand why you're so upset.
They don't understand that them telling you for the eight thousandth time to do
something that they don't understand why you're upset. They don't get it, because
for them it's very simple. You wouldn't be upset if you'd simply do what I told you to
do. For the collective corrector, it‟s very simple. You don‟t have to be upset. Do
what I tell you to do, you idiot. It's wrong what you're doing. It‟s not right, fix it.
You don‟t do that. Don‟t go out the door dressed like that. How nice.
The 18.3 can make their partner an alcoholic faster than in any other relationship.
You‟ve got Neptune exalted here. In Neptune exalted, you‟ve got a partner that
keeps on stabbing you, after a while you just don't want to feel it anymore. And by
the time you‟ve had that fourth drink that stab is just a blur. It doesn‟t really go
around you, it bounces off and you sway a little bit. You end up with obsessive
behavior. Remember, we‟re talking about duality. The whole thing about the zealot
is that the zealot creates a kind of anti-zealot on the other side.
If you‟re flying along in space and you‟re having a nice time and all of a sudden an
18.3 pulls up beside you, it‟s like you know that there are gods that truly do not like
you, that there are gods that really think that it‟s time in your incarnative process
that you‟ve got to be straightened out. It‟s a 3/5 after all. I‟m playing; because you

can really have fun with a line like this. And yet, at the same time to see that
without them, man are we ever lost. Sometimes it takes obsession. It just does.
When you're dealing with a 3/5 there is the potential that what they can tell you,
regardless of whether you think it's a heresy or not, regardless of whether or not it‟s
comfortable to hear it, they may be telling you something that is truly important for
you. They learn after all, they make the mistakes, they deal with the projection,
they understand that others always see in them their need for correction.
The 18.3 is obsessed with correcting themselves. You give me an 18.3 with an open
ego, and I will show you somebody that I can milk tens of thousands of dollars out of
them. Just open wallet, give me a straight funnel to their bank account. They‟re
obsessed with correcting themselves. They‟re obsessed with being correct. And it's
a two-way street, but this is duality, and it is the Cross of Service, and it is, let me
tell you what has to be. And remember this line, this dissolution of old forms at an
acceptable price, you can have the bloodiest of things take place here. Cleaning
house can be ethnic cleansing. It‟s not far to go. All you need is cooperation on the
other side and away you go. Let‟s clean house.
These are the people that when they get divorced they try to create an imitation
death. Never, ever, ever have anything to do with them ever, ever, ever again. You
get rid of everything that you ever had that was connected to them, the clothes, and
the little thing here and there that they forgot when they left you, you clean it all
out. In the sense of the mathematician making a mistake and starting all over
again; go back to the beginning, go back to the process. And 3/5s anyway can have
a terrible time in relationships, particularly if they are not-self obsessive bitch, male
or female version. It‟s not like relationships for them are going to be easy, unless
they only get to choose masochists in this life and that‟s not the way it works.

Again, in this quarter we know that we have stability here in this combination simply
because it's used to the fact that things don't work. It learns from the process of
things not working. The only difficulty here in the sense of the 3/6 is that they do a
lot of cleaning house. In other words, what they really go through is a process of
trying to get to a point where they're not afraid that what they haven‟t cleaned will
destroy them. there‟s always this concern here in the 18th gate that, because we're
dealing with the spleen and because in fact the fear of authority is the fear of forces
greater than us that can destroy us, that there is always in the 18, and particularly
with 3s, there is always this underlying fear that there is a greater authority that will
show up that will smash you, that will punish you if you have not been correct.
I am an exponent of this. I'm a very powerful, very deep 48. I'm an exponent of
correctness. I teach you all about correctness. Part of the logical truth of Human
Design is that there is a correctness mechanically and how important it is to get to

RAC Service 3
We get to the 4. I always remind 4s, because most 4s never get the opportunity to
go through this quarter with me, so they have a very superficial understanding of the
4. And if you go to the first two quarters, that superficial understanding, the
influence, the power of it, its relationships, the way in which it really is the core of
the basis of the collective because of its capacity to network, to gain advantage out
of the networking, all of those things. And in the first two quarters, Mind and
Civilization, you really see how the 4 is so important in that.
But when you get over to this quarter, you see the dark side of the 4, just like you
see the positive of the 3/6, 6/3. Quarters bring out different qualities. That‟s why
quarters are at the core of any deep understanding in Human Design. And when you
look at the 4 here, The Incompetent, you also have to see that that is also
inherent in what a 4 is. Incompetency is there. That's why they make good actors,
to compensate for incompetence. Difficulties as a result of inadequacies that cannot
be resolved because of inadequacies; I love that. There's a great Catch-22. The guy
who wrote this is really good. I‟d like to meet him to thank him for this one.
I love the way this starts. You already know you're in trouble. The exalted begins
with: Given this negative position; survival through suffering. Oh, my God. All right,
the ability to correct and its potential for suffering; or, the demands of correction and
its potential to generate anxiety; indecision and anxiety, and no escape from
misfortune. That‟s a heavy line. The 4 is a medium. And you can understand that
best by understanding the 4th color. We have the 4th color of need, but we also know
that the 4th color is the only color that is always in transference, which means that
the 4 is literally in touch with all the underlying motivations.
When you bring that to the surface, what really is harmonic in that, resonance in
that sense, in the line value of the 4 is that the 4 represents a basic need in the
totality. And the need is not what the 4 brings, the need is that the 4 lives out its
role as a bridge. And here you understand something about the true influence of the
4, is that it's not particularly what it will say or offer as influence, it is simply by
being in the middle, being the bridge, that it allows things to move back and forth in
terms of the way in which the life force works, the way the structure of the
hexagram works. They‟re the middleman, they‟re the medium, and they‟re really the
heart and core of transference of information throughout the whole structure.
Basically what this is saying is that the 4, in and of itself, cannot correct anything. It
can‟t, but it can influence you to see that maybe out of influencing you, you can

them. That's why they‟re network people. They themselves can‟t find opportunity,
and yet, they‟re the opportunists. The person that brings them the opportunity isn‟t

When we move to the 4/1 we have a shift. And of course, we have a shift that is
inherently uncomfortable in this context, because what we're shifting to is the 38 and
the 39. We are shifting to trouble. The 58-52 are pussycats compared to the 38-39.
Whenever I look at the root center, to me they‟re like the 59 and the 27. You get
these two (sound). The 38-39 is so powerful. There is no true individual process
without them. Everybody thinks that the formats are the 3/60. Well, technically
speaking, yes. It is the source of
mutation and the pulse. But what
really drives the individual is the
38-39. Without the 38 there is no
empowerment of purpose. And
without the 39 there is no
empowerment of spirit. And there
is no polarity that is more
provocative, more in-your-face,
pushier than the 38-39. You talk
about pressure. If you want gates
that put you under pressure, you
just look here.

beat you up, kick you. Oh sorry

worse because there's all this fear here; fear of authority. And nothing is more
frightening to the individual than collective authority, nothing, nothing, because you
know damn well that the collective does not care about your idiosyncrasy. As a
matter of fact, you may find out that the collective wants to remove that
idiosyncrasy from society as a whole. And suddenly you're on the block.

So, here you have this deep, deep, deep individual underneath. Remember, we‟re
not on the Cross of Service anymore. We‟re on a cross of correction, Juxtaposition
Cross of Correction and guess what; this says, what God, you crazy. I‟m not afraid
of God; I‟m afraid of you, you idiot. I‟m concerned about the mayor of the city, the
President of the United States; don‟t even bother me with God business. There are
these people getting in the way of me fulfilling my purpose. There are all these
people getting in the way of me fulfilling my creative destiny. I'm not afraid of God.
I‟m afraid of the government.
And this is the great I'm-afraid-of-the-government, I‟m afraid of the pattern, I don‟t
like this. This is threatening me with not being able to fulfill my destiny. And guess
what? The 38 leads to that 28, and that devil is waiting there in that 28. It‟s like
the moment that you get into correction and the moment the 38 knows that it can
beat the devil on the other side, it‟s like, ah come on don‟t give me this God
business, I‟m afraid of government. Let‟s get down here to the devil‟s world, let‟s
get down here to that concrete black and white here we are in the soup. This is
where I have to find my purpose. God isn‟t going to give me my purpose.

So, we get to the obvious, if you follow this track. We get to the Left Angle Cross of
Upheaval. Let's just turn it all upside down. Let‟s just turn it around. And what do
you get? Ah, I love 5th lines. You get Therapy—isn‟t that wonderful—the strength
to recognize a problem and to accept that it's beyond one’s power to solve it alone.
The wisdom to both seek and provide guidance; the potential for correction and
judgment through relationships; or the mental patient; chronic instability and
potential madness; where relationships cannot assist in correction the potential of
mental instability.
Now, this is very interesting. Whenever I look at the 5 and the 6, I think about the 5
as representative of our time, and the 6 as the future. In other words, it's clear to
me that the time of the requirements of the 5th line heretic will disappear with the
birth of rave children. That is, we‟re going to move into a 6th line global cycle, and
we are going to move into theme of role model as opposed to heretic leading sheep.
So when I look at the 5, I'm looking a thematic of the way in which the sheep are
being led now. It‟s why I tell them a hexagram is a 1 to a 5. You're really seeing
what we‟re living in now at the end of this cycle coming to 2027, what we‟re dealing
with now is the end of the time of the 5. The dominance of the 5 and particularly the
5 manifestor, this theme of a leader that's going to pull you up, that's going to guide
you.

What you see here in this heresy is something interesting. What you see is the
attempt to recognize something. The spleen is not about feeling, it‟s not emotions.
It‟s about intelligence. Now, the whole thing about intelligence in the spleen is that
we have three different forms of intelligence. We had instinctive intelligence, which
is tribal. We have intuitive
intelligence, which is individual.
And we have judgmental
intelligence, logical intelligence that
we have in the logical circuitry. So,
one of the things to recognize is
that when you get to the 5 here,
what the 5 is saying is that what we
can do is that we can use our
intelligence, and we can use our
intelligence to heal ourselves, to
save ourselves from fear. And this
is the heart of therapy.
No matter what you may think of
therapy in any shape or form, if you
look at why it exists, it exists to
ameliorate fear. It exists to help
human beings deal with their fear.
Now, it is a fear of authority, but
remember, obviously we've already seen that that authority can be moved to any
strata of society that controls you, whether it's from the Godhead all the way down
to the person that keeps on parking in front of your garage. Therapy; many people
get upset with a mental patient line, the detriment.
It's really something to understand, the heresy here is deep recognition in logic that
we've already seen that logic says to us, we cannot ever be one, we have to learn
how to find the right pattern. We saw that the abstract said to us, we have to find
the right partner with the right consciousness. And what you're seeing here in the
18.5 is that the 18.5 says, what we can really do is if we can take fear away from
the singular, the person, if you can take fear away from somebody else, this is the
way to open them up, this is the way for you to be able to be with the other. And
out of that we have the whole modern therapeutic advice business. This is the
advice world.

Then we get to the 6 and we get to this line of Buddhahood, the perfected form. If
there was ever a bullshit line, it‟s this one, in the sense that it‟s deeply
misunderstood. It says: The potential of the perfected form through correction, or
the potential to share the values of the correction with others. This is called the
Buddha state of the eternal child. At the very beginning we saw that the underlying
foundation of the fear of authority is that at least half of it is going to be rigidly
patriarchal. And when you get to the 6th line and you get to the role model potential,
what you get to is the necessity to be spoiled.
Where the 5th line says look, you‟ve got a problem and I can help you, let's fix it, and
then together we‟ll be okay. The 6th line says there's nothing to fix. Why don't you
just treat me as if I'm the best thing that ever happened? And if you treat me as if
I'm the best thing that ever happened we‟re going to have a wonderful relationship.
And it‟s one of the things I tell people about the 6th line, because the 6th line is where
the adult partner plays child. What I mean by that is that, for example, normally if
it's a woman that has this line, she has a much older man in her life, if it's a man
that has this line, he‟s going to have an older woman in his life, and they are going
to be spoiled.
If you don‟t spoil an 18.6, you‟re going to have a terrible relationship with them. It‟s
just that simple. And it‟s not like you can fix anything. You just have to accept that
they‟re wonderful and you spoil them. And if you spoil them, they‟re really happy,
little Buddhas. For them partnerships turned out to be wonderful. Not only that, if
you have an 18.6 in your life, you're only going to feel good if you accept that you're
here to spoil them. And then you have a really nice movie.
Of course, the 18.6 is going to discover that very, very early. This is upheaval; it‟s
turning it all around. The 40-year-old woman with her 27-year-old beefcake
boyfriend; it‟s turning it all around. They love it, it‟s great. Upheaval; therapy does

the same thing. It's a rape, after all. I remind people that therapist spells the-
rapist. You get a real upheaval, you get wrenched around. And of course, what we
know about therapy is that it‟s exactly devastating. It's really upheaval. You‟re
unemotional and you have an emotional therapist, you keep running to the bathroom
and he sends you to the doctor to check your kidneys. Thank you very much; a very
wise man.
The 18th gate says: The vigilance and determination to uphold and to defend basic
and fundamental human rights. That‟s a wonderful slogan for a gate. And you can
see that even though logic doesn't have a heart, and it doesn't, you can see that it
truly does care about collective well-being, collective health. And at the very
beginning of this splenic process, after all, the 18th gate starts it so in many ways it
the foundation, if you want, that you begin with the recognition that human rights
are not a given, they must be earned. They must be developed through a long
process of correction, challenge. That we cannot be restrained in the end by fear
alone, that we will find a way to benefit each human being.
When I talk about Buddhahood, and we see it as an individual situation of one
partner spoiling another, remember that that is only because we're looking through
the lens of duality. If we see the cross as a whole, we‟re looking at something even
more profound, that we need to spoil those that need to be spoiled. Those that are
disenfranchise, those that are not educated, those who don't have clean water, those
that don't have education, those that don't have security, and on and on and on.
It's only when the Buddhist state is recognized in this way that we will begin to see
that we have an enormous process that we‟ve been involved in as long as we have
been so-called civilized. That is has been this process, the 18th gate, service,
correction, upheaval; service, correction, upheaval as a cycle. It‟s just a cycle. And
you can see that despite what we think about the world we live in today, that the
basic level of human rights that we have today, even though we have this globe,
then the way it is is a long way from what we started with. The 18th gate does its
work.

Introduction
When you get to the 48th gate you see that you‟re crossing the spleen in the same
stream. One of the oldest ways that I describe this process is that the 18th gate is a
faucet, a tap at your sink, and that basically it‟s a leaky faucet—one drop at a time.
Remember it‟s splenic. It‟s one drop at a time. And that one drop at a time of
correction, of recognition of what needs to be corrected, does not bring solutions.
The 18 is not here to bring solutions. They‟re here to say what's wrong. They‟re
here to point out what's wrong. They're here to direct where correction can take
place. But the 48th gate is a gate of the well, it‟s a gate of depth and it collects every
drop.
Now look at this gate. There is only one blue line and it's the 6th line. Depth is
innate. You don‟t become deep. One of the great jokes—everybody thinks that
because they read a thousand books they‟ve made themselves deep. But if you
don't have the depth in the first place, those thousand books are flushed as they go
through. Depth is something else. Depth is a well that fills and it fills so that
everyone can drink from it. It is a collective well, not a tribal well, not an individual
personal well, this is the collective well, and it is open to all. It's also the gate of
black magic. It‟s the gate of turning straw into gold, all those things.
The Right Angle Cross of Tension 3  48  39
 21  38
When we come to the 48th gate, low and behold the 38 and the 39 take on their real
power, because here you see them integrated into the Right Angle Cross of Tension,
third variation. I've explained many, many times that in order to understand the
Cross of Tension one must recognize that each of these four arms are there to bring
tension to the other through the harmonic gates. The 38 brings the demand for
purpose in the other. The 39 provokes the spirit in the other. The 48 brings skills to
the other. And the 21 keeps the tribe happy.
The Cross of Tension is not well understood. Think about The Well: The necessary
and qualitative foundation that is a prerequisite to establish the common good. The
common good; and you can see why we move from Buddhahood, spoiling, to this
well. If you could see the well filling up, the water that‟s at the very, very bottom of
the well is from the 1st line, if you could layer the water, in that sense. So when you
open up the well and you first look in you see the 6 first. It‟s the common good; this
is all for the common good, depth for the common good. Think about it. If you're a
scientist and you‟re logical and you‟ve got the 48th gate, what do you do? You give it
away. Whatever you know, you give it away. If you are tribal and you make a
discovery you don‟t give it to anybody. You get a patent. You make everybody pay.

The Well
I know that from my 48th gate. For years and years and years people in Human
Design have bitched how much I give away. But I‟m here for the common good. My
job is to make sure that this knowledge is available to anyone anywhere in the
world. That's my 48. It‟s for the
collective good. Yes, but you have
to make money. Okay. So my tribal
side comes in on the other side and
it says, well, all right, we won't give
them everything. And we don't give
them everything.
But see what the 48th gate is, it‟s
there for the common good. One
thing you have to understand about
the Cross of Tension people is that
they're not allowed to put their
tension into the other, they keep it
themselves. It‟s very simple. So,
it's very easy to see Cross of Tension
people walking around not-self
because they're so stiff. They‟re just
stiff. And they‟re wired and it's
because they‟re not getting the
tension out. The reason they're not
getting the tension out is they're so uncomfortable for what they get back. They
don‟t want to put tension into others because they get this horrendous response.
They‟re resented, disliked for it. So they end up being very tense.

Insignificance: An instinctive recognition of what is practical and deserves
attention. A taste for recognizing what is practical and deserves attention. The
other side is: A taste for trivia. So the very foundation at the very bottom of the well
is not the most interesting stuff to drink. It's the basis of depth. The basis of depth
is what you should pay attention to. And it‟s one of the things to understand in this
context of duality is that the 48th gate is the great gate of inadequacy. This is the
enormous fear of inadequacy.
I have both my Neptunes in the 48th gate. I have always felt so inadequate when it
comes to being about to be certain about my depth. It‟s not possible. And because
I have so many 1s it‟s frightening. There is this uncertainty about it. When you get
to this well you get deep down into this well. The very beginning of this process is
the only way you can deal with inadequacy is that you have to get to a point where
you know where to focus your attention.

It‟s one of the problems of the 18, an 18 goes into an environment and sees all the
things that are wrong but doesn't know where to start. This is the advantage of the
48. The 48 collects all of that, the drops of water in the well, and then out of that
can look and see where the focus ought to be. As a matter of fact, many of the
things that the 18 sees as a whole, the 48 can see one solution that'll cover all of
that. That's the difference between 18 and the 48. The 48 will feel inadequate
unless it can see that place where the focus can take place.
This line of insignificance is very much misunderstood. Most of the things that are
part of the knowledge base here at the insignificant level are not the kinds of things
that people pay attention to. They pay attention to the surface. And if you look at
the surface what they're looking at is self-fulfillment, that‟s the top of the well.
That's something you can grow into, that something that you get from your depth.
They don't see that the very foundation of knowledge is that you need to have all the
details in order to be able to find a focus, and that you‟re already born with it. That
is, you come into the world and you can already discern what requires attention and
it begins with trivia.
I often look at my intellectual process and I‟m really amused. I have in my memory
banks an unbelievable amount of trivia. I can still sing commercials from the 50s. I
have trivia inside of me that is unbelievable. And yet, I'm a well person, I see and I
actually tap into that a lot because it helps. It helps to bring clarity to something
else so that you can get to that focus.
Somebody says I have the 48.1, and my first pitch to the 48.1 was like well, enjoy
all that small stuff. Have fun with it, don't be afraid of it. Don't think that it is
insignificant. It's what that appears to be to the not-self. The one thing you have to
understand about that recognition process is that you need to have as broad a plate
as you can. It‟s the broader the plate, the more potential in the synthesis to really
be able to see.
The 1/3 is very good at this, by the way. They discover very quickly that if you try
to do all the things that the 18 points you at then you will feel inadequate,
immediately inadequate. And 3s in the 48th gate anyway have an ordeal in dealing
with inadequacy, because they do go through their trial and error process. And of
course, if they are not raised properly, if they do not understand the way that works,
that can be very devastating. Because what it ultimately means is that you assume
that you're inadequate in your depth.
In order to be able to serve the greater good or the common good we need to take
into consideration that the common good covers a huge spectrum. One of the
difficulties in the collective is that there's not enough trivia. There‟s not enough of all
of that spectrum. They tend to focus in certain patterns which tend to lead others
off. And though they think they're working for the common good for many it's a
problem.

The 1/4
RAC Tension 3
When you‟re dealing with the 1/4 maybe you get the joke. Here is this gate and you
have the fear of inadequacy, and yet everyone, at least the first five lines, is born
adequate. It‟s such a joke. You‟re born fully equipped, you‟re not missing anything.
You have exactly the right kind of depth. It's perfect. All you have to do is operate
correctly, which again is a logical theme. That‟s why we can in fact influence people
by offering them logical mechanics, because basically, logic is what takes us to the
future, the patterns are something we see that can work to our benefit.
But understand that people who have the well with the first five lines are born
adequate and it's what I tell them. Don't worry about this fear that you have. That's
not the point. It's not. It‟s just about operating correctly and you will see that your
depth will operate the way that it should. It‟s a lesson I had to learn myself with my
Neptunes.
The 1/4 is again deeply influenced by the way in which it is raised, whether or not it
is going to see depth as something that has to be practical or whether it's going to
see depth as something that is really not important. Remember that we are
impressed with people that have a lot of information. But having a lot of information
doesn't mean that you have solutions. And what you really see in the 1st line in the
1/3 and the 1/4 is that there really isn't much of a solution at that level of depth.
There isn't. It‟s simply if I'm going to live with the other and I'm going to feel
adequate, I really have to find the theme of what bothers me or what makes me feel
inadequate.
And remember, Cross of Tension; if you‟re the Cross of Tension and you‟re a 1/3 or a
1/4 here, you are provoking other people. And what is the 48? The prime
provocation here is the 48 to the 16. In other words, where the hell are the skills
that can take my depth and out of that we have an expression of talent. Trivia is
just a platform for skills, that‟s all, and it‟s a good platform.

The 2/4 RAC Tension 3
I love these 2nd lines because in the spleen 2nd lines reveal so much. This is the line
of Degeneracy. So we‟ve got terminal disease in the 18.2 and here we have
degeneracy in the 48.2: The awareness that to successfully establish a new form one
cannot neglect the most positive attributes just to accommodate inferior elements.
This would lead to deterioration; a confidence in awareness to resist inferior
influences. This is very simple. If your partner is inferior, you will degenerate and
so will the relationship. It's very simple.

Now, remember, that‟s very subjective, obviously, and that inferiority is going to be
wherever the inadequacy shows up through the provocation that you bring. The
Venus here in detriment: The misguided urge for harmony that degenerates when
associated with inferior values into decadence; a lack of confidence in awareness
that invites interference and decadence. So one of the obvious things that the 2
recognizes—again, it‟s a 2, it‟s a 2/4, it says, don‟t come in here. Leave me alone
because the moment you come into my life everything is going to degenerate.
You‟re an inferior force, you don‟t appreciate my depth, and you make me feel
inadequate.
You'll notice with Cross of Tension people that if they don't have partners that at
least have harmonics to half of their cross, and it doesn‟t mean it has to be to the
polarity, whatever, at least two, it‟s awful, because there is no natural connection to
the provocation. There isn‟t. I know how difficult that is.

The 2/5
RAC Tension 3
The 2/5 lacks confidence; confidence is a big problem for 2/5s. Again, it has to with
the 5, it has to do with losing your face, losing reputation, this need to be away and
yet at the same time the fact that in hiding that other people see that you have gifts,
that there is all this potential projection on you. And the whole thing about a 2/5 is
that they cannot be motivated by somebody else. They can only motivate
themselves. And remember something that for the Cross of Tension, unless there is
a positive response to their tension they have a degenerate relationship, and they're
the ones that are going to suffer.
Remember that this is really about suffering. They can really suffer, because they
end up holding all the tension inside of them. They can‟t get it out. If you can‟t get
the tension out, eventually it's going to be very, very painful physical process. One
of the things you‟ll notice about the 2nd line is that here you're really getting an
archetype for 2nd line interpretation. Because one of the things you can always
understand about the 2nd line is that the 2nd line does have a confidence problem.
That is, they can be not-self overconfident and end up in great problems, or lack
confidence. It‟s something you‟re going to find at an underlying level in all 2s.
Of course, it‟s natural to think of it that way. After all, they‟re the naturals, they
don‟t have the 1st line depth, they‟re not really able to dig in and to add up all the
information, so they're not really comfortable with, confident in, that they really do
have the depth, not confident in their adequacy. You can see how the 18.2 will feed
this, because if they're not confident with their adequacy, the 18.2 will come in and
say, well, God will help. God will make you feel more adequate. God‟s the one.

The 3/5
RAC Tension 3
Incommunicado. When that line came out I remember thinking, why don‟t I
change this. It was like really, shit, I don‟t want to be incommunicado; I want to
know my depth. Symbolized by the ‘no Moon’ phase, where the potential of light is
unrecognized, unavailable, and unknowable. The redeeming value is in the
transience of such a stage which is which can give strength to those so afflicted;
where the development of taste and depth is in a long-term process. The profound
anxiety when a profound intelligence is forgotten in the wilderness—I know that
place—the tendency in a long-term process (development of taste and depth) to
anxiety.
It‟s just something to see about the nature of the 3rd and the 4th line that both the
3rd and the 4th line are about a recognition that despite the fact that the depth is
there, the connection to the depth and the understanding of the depth is a process.
And that that well is constantly filling, that the potential to take in is enormous, but
there is no value in the moment.
When I look back at my life prior to my disappearance and ended up coming here to
Ibiza, I had gone through three wives, maybe seven careers in a very, very short
period of time, had taken in an enormous amounts of information both in the
classical sense and in the professional sense and in the private sense. And for all of
the potential that I had, whether it was my intelligence, my talent, my creativity, my
performance ability, and on and on, I was a lost being, and a lost being that
assumed that nothing had been gained by all that experience. I had no access to my
depth. I had no idea that there was a synthesis going on. I had no idea that I was
incommunicado.
One of the things about the well is that the 48th gate is deeply connected to Uranus.
And that you'll notice that not a single line here has Uranus mentioned. But this is
very much Uranian. It‟s Uranian in the sense of the way in which the lifespan works.
It's almost like the cover is on the well until your midlife. It‟s very Uranian in that
sense.
The other thing is that unlike the 18 that it is very specific in the identification of
correction, that the 48, because it is a natural synthetic field actually produces a
totally different solution. You cannot go directly from the 18 to the 48. You are,
after all, going through the spleen. It‟s not like they‟re harmonics. There is
something that is going on in this process.
The 3/5 incommunicado is somebody that really does feel useless. These can be
very, very unhappy people, very, very, very unhappy people. After all, you don't
even have the recognizable depth to understand why you're provoking people and
they're reacting to you on this Cross of Tension. You don't even realize that each
provocation that leads to problems, failure, the 3/5 typical crash stuff, that every
single one of those things is actually adding up to an enormous intelligence potential.

be paranoid. Only the not-self 5 is truly paranoid. The true self 5 is cautious,
because they know that they cannot satisfy all demands. They cannot satisfy all
projections and they know it's dangerous to give the impression they can. And that
is a caution, not a paranoia. But when you‟re dealing with the not-self you‟re dealing
with a not-self 3/5 Cross of Tension, 48th gate, they drive their partners crazy—
bonds made and broken, bringing all this 3, the partner who has fallen in love with a
5 only to discover it's a 3, and all the stuff that goes with that.
This line is wonderful. 3/5s run away. At some point the 3/5 just takes off, and they
take off so they can start again with a clean slate. And one of the most fascinating
things about 3/5s is that in many ways they are the real prodigals. They‟re the ones
that run away. They leave their village, their province, whatever, they may leave
their country. If they could they‟d leave the planet. Maybe some of them do. But
the fact is that they go somewhere else and then many, many years later after the
pain has gone away, it takes about 20 years, they come back, and everything, all of
that process that's been bubbling and boiling inside, suddenly can make not so much
sense, but suddenly it can display its depth.
When I was about 10 years old I had bought a new little notebook for drawing. I like
to draw. I love to draw; as a kid particularly. And I decided that I was going to
write a book. And I was going to write a book about everything. I was going to
create a planet. And I was going to describe how everything worked on the planet.
And then I realized that I couldn‟t. I realized that I actually had the depth, but I
didn't know how to use it. I didn't know how to describe it, because I'd never
experienced the depth that was already there. The whole thing about the 48 is that
you are adequate, but until you go through life, you don't realize how adequate you
really are. And the longer you are in the life process, the more adequacy you
recognize.
Many years later I would write a book about a planet and describe how everything
works. It‟s absolutely amazing. I still think back to that moment. It's something
that comes to me every once in awhile. It was like the Gods saying to me, you do
have the depth for this. Wait, you‟ll see. We‟re not going to let you in now, you‟re
not equipped. You have to go through the patterns. The one thing we know about
logic, the one thing I respect about logic is that logic is willing to say that this is
theory until proven. You are adequate until proven inadequate. This is really the
logic. You‟re innocent until proven guilty.

to my own personal experience having both my 48s activated by Neptune; having
been somebody who went through a number of relationships, if I look back with any
kind of structured objectivity I can see that basically I dealt with the same problems
over and over again and did not deal with them successfully. Most of which had to
do with the nature of my not-self related to my open solar plexus so that I was
somebody that avoided confrontation and truth and I really did not participate
properly in those relationships. I didn't know any better.
What I discovered is that so many of the things that brought me to a point of
relationship collapsed in my not-self are things that are not any more than nuisances
to my true self. In other words that over time—and this again is the advantage of
understanding the depth process—that over time solutions can emerge. And so one
of the things about the 3/6 in this particular configuration is that there is something
inside of the 3/6, and it's basically the 6, it is basically this underlying theme of
hopefulness and in that underlying theme of hopefulness is the possibility that at one
time or another the process can be perfected.
Taste is something very important grasp, because it's one of the things that has to
do with the nature of morality. If you want to know where morality comes from and
unfortunately it's really sad, morality comes from individuality and comes from the
43/23. It‟s the only place where you find an emphasis on morality itself. This
business of taste, we‟re much more comfortable with the instinct and intuition as
ways of understanding intelligence. Logical intelligence, deductive intelligence is
something that we understand, sort of, this collective logical intelligence.
But where I really want you to grasp it is taste. Remember that the 18th gate is the
gate of salt. And everything about the nature of logic is that logic will give you a
good taste or a bad taste. This is logic. It is on-off. It is the basic binary; it is the
way that we program for computers. It's all of this stuff. And all this is about a
taste that it is a good taste or it‟s a bad taste. This is not morality. This is not a
judgment that something is bad universally. It‟s taste.
For example, I'm not a moralist, I‟m a dualist. I accept that in the not-self clearly
and in the very infrastructure of what it is to be human that we are as much lovers
as killers. And from that perspective, I cannot make a judgment that states that
killing is bad and loving is good. I could just simply see that these are two things
that are basically polarities, and that there is no moral perspective possible because
all of them can have conditions that would make it morally feasible. It‟s like people
say no I wouldn‟t kill. You could always create a situation where you know damn
well that 99.99% of them would kill.
But taste is different. Taste is not morality, it is preference. It‟s not morality. It‟s a
very, very fine line of difference, but it's a very important difference. I don't have a
taste for killing. It's not to my taste. I don't think of it as being attractive. It's not
to my taste. I'm not opposed to it in terms of morality, but in terms of taste I don't
want a murderer in my—it‟s not to my taste.
And one of the things we have to see about the way in which relationships work at
the logical level, it‟s about taste. It‟s just about taste. They‟re to your taste or

they‟re not to your taste. And it‟s a refining of this taste. Maybe you need to add a
little salt, make it a little tastier. And the whole thing about the perfection of that
relationship is adding that tastiness to it so that it tastes good.

We get to the 4 and we get to the line of Restructuring: The good sense to take
advantage of restriction on short-term activity to assess the situation and restructure
for long term goals; the awareness that depth and its possible expression will face
restrictions with the resulting taste for short-term projects. Sun/Earth binaries
obviously are interesting. Anybody that has this particular cross, that they‟re going
to have their Sun in the 48, you know they're going to have the exaltation and the
detriment. It‟s going to be brought out because you have the Earth in its polarity.
The awareness that depth and its possible expression will face restrictions. Again,
this is similar to the theme of the 3rd line. You can see that the 3-4 are telling you
the same thing. What they're saying to you is yes, depth is there, but the 48 in its
depth understands that on the other side is the 36. And that the 36 is going to open
the door to experience. And without the opening of that door to experience there is
no way of being able to codify the depth. It was like me as a kid trying to write the
story of the planet. The story was in me, but I didn‟t know how to codify it. I didn‟t
know how to bring it out in perspective.
So restructuring is very important. And when I look back at my life and I look back
at my depth, the thing that it makes me interesting as a teacher is that there is a
panorama of information that is behind the description. If you‟re going to end up
having to explain things, which is my karma, what I've noticed is that all of the junk
I thought I was collecting, that that junk actually has value. And I've learned to see
that because I have a 3rd line mind I particularly relate to the 48.3 as a way of being
able to express to the 3rd line beings how important it is not to edit their resumes.
Not to see that those things that they went through that failed are not of value to
them in their life; they're wrong, even if it was not-self failure.
At least you understand the not-self consequences. But everything that went on in
your life, all of that is the necessary infrastructure for your depth. And it's only when
you accept that all of that belongs to you that all of that provides you with essential
material, only then are you going to have a true synthesis which will project
outwards your true intelligence.
I love all the mistakes and problems and stuff and things that I've done from the
past. As didn‟t as not-self; I resented it. And now every chance I get I pull one of
those little pieces of lifelong trivia out of the pot and use it as an illustration. And it's
wonderful because it resonates its truth. And the collective is the collective, you
take it all in, this is not a tribal well, this is not an individual well.
Now, think about what the Cross of Tension is going here. We‟ve been talking about
this only in terms of duality and you have to see that in the context of duality, this

48th gate is putting the fear of inadequacy into every one. Oh, boy can I make you
feel inadequate. You know it; in a moment, in a breath. And what I demand of you
is that you learn new skills. That's all. This is a classic 48/16 piece of business if
there ever was one.
Again, you have to see that one of the things that I did to my partners I didn‟t know
that. Why do you think there is so much divorce in my generation, we all have
Neptune in the 48, we all made our partners feel inadequate, all of us. So you end
up with this huge wave of divorce. And not only divorce, but an enormous rise in
alcoholism, drug use, families breaking up because mom is a junkie, and on and on
and on and on and on. All of that is Neptune in the 48.
My generation came into the world in 1948 and Neptune says, ha, ha. And this
Cross of Tension—I‟m not just talking about any other placement like my Clarion, so
that I can scream it out and tell you. Think about what it‟s like to be on the Cross of
Tension, you‟re a 48.4, you've got a partner and you say, you‟re inadequate, you
don't have the skills, you don‟t know how to live with me, you don‟t know how to

Restraint is a very funny thing about this line. You're always dealing with
restrictions. So, when you're dealing with a 4/1 you‟re dealing with fixed fate. And
in most cases, what you're dealing with is that you're dealing with someone who
always thinks that the only way to change their life is to study something new.
These are very odd people. These are the ones that have a career and then they
come home and they decide that they‟re going to stop being a doctor and they're
going to learn how to farm soya.
That‟ll make a difference in their
life. And that not so much that
they'll actually do it, but it makes
them feel good thinking about it and
finding out about it so that they can
pretend that they're going to be
transformed. And that they‟re
going to enter into something new,
a new life.
If you're looking for a theme of the
midlife crisis, this is the
juxtaposition cross of the midlife
crisis. And I don't mean that in a
sense that it absolutely has to be in
a Uranian sense of a midlife crisis,
it‟s the kind of thing where you've
processed your way through a
career and then all of a sudden you
want to change everything. You don‟t want to be in the suburbs anymore, you don't
want to be “this or that,” whatever the case may be, there is this: there's something
else to life. And then you start all these little things to try to get yourself to a point
where you can be transformed and truly enter into a new experience.
It's normally not very successful, other than the fact that it‟s a 4/1 configuration so
you have all this deep studying going on, not a hell of a lot gets done. But these are
people that could be instrumental in getting other people to do the same thing. They
can be very influential in saying to somebody, why don‟t you just change your life.
Why don‟t you take a sabbatical? Why don‟t you take a year off? Go to Borneo. Get
bitten by things, rub yourself against trees; do something different, learn a new
trade. All these people who take up a hobby, this is the great hobby line. It‟s a
harmony to trivia, so it‟s the great harmony—why don‟t you just get into some
trivia? That will help you.

This is very powerful. Action: The natural urge to apply energy to action; a taste
for action. Insecurities with one's depth that can fail to take action, but it's all about
taking action. Now, this is by far the most frustrating of all lines. The 48th gate is a
deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply frustrated gate. Why? Any student of
circuitry mechanics knows that even when the 48th gate gets to the 16, the best they
can do is talk. After all, the spleen is not a motor; this is not a manifesting channel.
This is a projected channel. It‟s why it‟s the great gate of black magic. There you
are with your depth—I can turn straw into gold, but nobody will hear me.
That‟s why we have so many committees; committees that are committees that are
for committees. That‟s why there are so many people running around on this planet
trying to find funding for their
theories. The 48 to the 16 is just
hey, I‟ve got a theory. I‟ve got a
theory, I‟ve got a theory, and
anybody have money? That‟s the
18/58, service, baby.
You can't imagine how important
the 18/58 or the 53/42 is to the
logical process, because logic is
starved of energy. You can't go
from the logical gates in the throat
and find a motor. You can‟t. So
this whole business about action is
that this is the driving force behind
depth. I look at the 5 as the plane
we live on now, as a completion of
this basic structure so we can get
to the 6th line mutation. That what
you're looking at now is everybody
wants to turn any depth into action. And you see it everywhere. Every cockamamie
piece of garbage has somebody throttling it down our throats on the television, on
the Internet, in advertising.
I‟ll never forget the horror of going to Los Angeles for the very first time and sitting
in a hotel room and the person that I was there with brought me—they called it a
magazine, it wasn‟t a magazine, it looked like a god damn telephone book. It was
one of these huge things, very big, very big thing and it was a free publication. It
came out every month only for the esoteric industry in Los Angeles. I want to tell

seen so much garbage. There were thousands and thousands and thousands of ads,
thousands of them. And it was in sections; 150 pages of 14 ads a page just for the
angel people. I don't even know you tell. And this person shows me my ad in there,
which I never would've put in there. And I thought, ah, God, no, no.
This is the age we live in where you see everybody thinks that anything in the well is
worth drinking. It‟s like these people that drink their own urine. This is a very old
piece of business. It‟s supposed to be very cleansing. The whole thing about
drinking your urine is that it's supposed to be the first urine of the day in the
morning. And that you can't take the first part, and you can't take the last part,
that‟s a problem, because I don't know how you figure out where you stop in not
taking the first part. How long do you actually wait? But anyway, you're supposed
to take only the liquid somewhere in the middle and this is what you drink.
One of the more recent prime ministers of India, Desai, was somebody that was
notorious for this. He claimed that it kept him healthy. Yeah, okay. He knew,
anyway, that you don't take everything. It‟s not like you drink the whole damn well,
you don‟t do that. There are some parts that you just don't want to drink. You don't
want to take everything in the well and put it out there. You don‟t. It creates chaos
and confusion.
So, this is the age we live in; the age of the not-self action of depth, the things that
people think are important to think about. And again, we go back to the 70% open
head centers and a planet that is absolutely overwhelmed with thinking about things
that don't matter; the fact that scientists at the jet propulsion lab are editing
photographs from the rovers on Mars so that people don't see the artifacts of the life
forms that lived there. And then you have a whole industry based on that. And
there are people in their lunacy who believe in all that shit, who pay attention to it,
because after all, we all need to drink.
The thing to understand about the well is that it‟s salt water. At the very bottom of
the well you have salt. It‟s from the 18. You don‟t want to drink all that. There‟s
stuff in there that if you put it on an open wound it really hurts. And the open
wound is the not-self. So this business about taste for action, you can see that the
48th gate is frustrated. It's got the depth, but it has no motor. That even in the area
where it's pointed it sees very clearly that that is not in any way the road to action.
There are certain gates that always look backward, rather than always looking
forward. And that the two gates that look backwards the most are the 48 and the
57, for different reasons. The 48 is always trying to see if there is an 18/58
somewhere. They would give up the skills just to be able to have the energy. The
energy is absolutely essential.
We have to see that what we teach people about the nature of the not-self what it
means to follow your strategy, to honor your inner authority, that basically what
happens is that only those things that have a right to come out of the well come out.
Every student of mine that I have ever had has always known that I know a hell of a
lot more than I teach them, and will always know a hell of a lot more than they
know. It is just the way it is. And I'm not going to let it all out of the well even if I

could because I don't know how to do that. That is, it‟s not my choice. It‟s just self
evident. It is the nature of things. There is a timing for everything. And not
everything is justified.
Remember the harmony between the 5 and the 2, that this line of action is deeply
connected with degeneracy. This don't put inferior depth into the world is basically
the harmony and what it says. So, the nature of the 5/1 is that the 5/1 is heretical
in that it demands that the well be allowed to be revealed and that everybody can
drink from it. And in the not-self sense, this has been very, very unhealthy in the
sense that it‟s made it ever more difficult for us to penetrate the not-self.

Remember here again, you have a situation where you do have the Moon in
detriment and you have the Moon in detriment in the 6th line as well. An over
reliance on the need for protection that in times of social renewal is obsessed with
the details of planning at the expense of action; insecurity with one’s depth that can
fail to take action; in times of social renewal. Now, remember if you look at the 5th
line always as the plane that we live on you can also see that by putting out all this
unnecessary depth that you've created enormous inadequacy on the planet. Do you
understand?
My very knowledge base can make you feel inadequate, because I can point to those
things that are not fulfilled in you. And when you have this enormous amount of
information out there, the vast majority of humanity feels inadequate. A great
statistic that came out about a year ago that reduced the entire world of six billion to
100 people as a statistical thing. So, for example, only one out of those hundred
people would have a computer. Now, we think of it as universal. We like to think
that everybody is connected. It‟s not true.
And imagine how much inadequacy we have created the world by releasing this
enormous amount of knowledge. Google world, this is Google world gone mad.
Think about it. This is Google. It says you want to know anything, anything, have a
Google, and go get it in any language. You have a little window. I love Google. It
sits there immediately in front of me, that white little window, I love it. I can put
anything in that window and all of a sudden it‟s there. Imagine how inadequate that
makes humanity feel. It used to be that you only needed to know a few things. You
only needed to know maybe 50 words to get by. And with that you felt inadequate.
Now you have the whole collective intelligence field all on display, these parents
whose kids come home with Grade Five Math—the inadequacy of it all.
So, what you see with this line is that the heresy of this line—after all, good news,
bad news, who knows. I know the disease inherent in this, and at the same time,
thank God that it‟s all out there, because the more inadequate humanity feels, the
better chance we have of having some impact. At least let them get to a point
where they realize how deeply inadequate they are.

5/2s and even 5/1s here, but particularly 5/2s, are afraid of the consequences of
telling somebody that they‟re inadequate. These are the kind of people that when
you have a discussion with them, they pull out a piece of information and use it as
an example and you don't know what they're talking about, and they‟ve got you.
You can't argue with them anymore. They‟ve got you. Well, there‟s this principle
that exists and it‟s a formula and if you do this and this and this, then you‟ll see right
away that what you‟re saying is crap.
The 5 doesn‟t like that because one of the things about the 5 is that it might seem
practical to allow somebody to recognize their inadequacy, but it's also dangerous.
People don't particularly like having inadequacy shoved in their face. And of course,
the 5 says, I'm not trying to show you you‟re inadequate. I'm out here serving the

Now, let‟s get to this wonderful line, the 6th line. You‟ve got a blue heading. It's the
only blue heading of all the lines, so you know that this is something that really
deeply develops from a beginning. And it says to you something that is very funny
about 6th line beings when they‟re born. Remember, Buddhahood, they have no
depth. They‟re born with an empty well. It‟s a dry well. All you have at the bottom
of that well is old salt crystals.
Now, there's something nice about that. If you come in and the well is already full
it‟s been full in the genetic sense; you come into the world and you‟ve got a dry well
you know that what you're taking in doesn't have any fixed way in which it patterns
depth. Like all 6th lines it carries a deep mutated quality and the keynote itself
expresses 6th line potential. That is, Self-fulfillment: The undiminishable resource.
What a great title for an empty well. That‟s a koan if there ever was one. It‟s
beautiful. It would make a great little piece of poetry: The empty well, an
undiminishable resource. You just leave it there. Do it in nice Japanese writing.
It‟s like thinking about Aquarius and the symbol of Aquarius of this person that is
standing there with this jar and there is water pouring out of the jar, but it's always
pouring out of the jar. And yet, how could it always be pouring out of the jar?
There's nothing going into the jar. When you get to the 6th line, like Buddhahood,
you get to see something. You get to see this identification with “I am not the well;
it is the well, it is the source. It‟s an illusion that it's my well. It is the source.”
Now, boy if you get to that point are you ever awake. This is a life process, if you're
lucky, because it's blue, we know. The valued center that as it gives—empty well—
that as it gives it receives and thus can continue to give; a depth and potential talent
that is of value to others. The Moon in detriment: A tendency to superficiality that
though generous and nurturing will lack the inspirational quality they can transform
its gift into a common currency. Where the depth is limited to taste and will be
superficial and affect the quality of the possible talent.

The Well
The 6/2. You go through the 3/2 phase and you realize something. There is a panic
inside of you, because the failure in experience convinces you that you have no
depth. When the 6/2 starts its process on this cross, it is endeavor, after all, there is
a place to go, and there are things to do. It‟s why there is action as this theme
underneath—the 53, the gate that starts things, the 54 that is so ambitious. Don't
forget the power that is here. This purpose is fulfilled by taking action in one way or
another and the 6/2 really suffers in that first cycle.
But then, this is the fool on the hill that you go to the fool and the fool says to you:
I'm stupid. Why are you asking me? And the other gets very confused. But I
thought you know. And they say to them, what's the problem? And they say, well, I
have this problem with this or that or the other thing. And in that moment they take
in that depth from the other and it mixes in there with the salt. That‟s an image.
And out of that comes some kind of expression. And they go away happy. They got
what they wanted.
Mystically to try to understand the 6, we are not yet equipped. We do not have
enough beings that are 6th line in their profile, who are living their design, who can
truly talk to us about what the Kironian phase really means. What it means to be
neither the observer nor the observed, what it means to be neither pessimistic nor
optimistic. And here you can have a sense of it. That the depth is not within, that

Introduction
When we get to the 57 we get to the very first individual gate in the quarter. Here
we are, and for the first time and not only for the first time do we get an individual
gate, but boy do we ever get a gate. The 6/3 is sitting there and saying they‟re all
afraid of tomorrow. The final wisdom in the depth of the 48 is to realize that
everyone is afraid of tomorrow. The fear of inadequacy is all about they don‟t think
that they‟re adequate because they're terrified of tomorrow. And that to be afraid of
tomorrow is the most basic of all fears. It is the heart and soul of all fears.
You can go anywhere in the spleen, you can say fear of this, fear of that, all the
fears that we know that are there, but you get to the 57 and you're really getting to
what it's all about. It‟s the fear of tomorrow that haunts every one. And the 57th
gate is no ordinary gate. It goes in three different directions. It‟s part of the circuit
and the channel system. And the 57th gate as an awareness gate provides
awareness, primary awareness, to the sacral, primary awareness to the identity,
primary awareness to the throat. What a gate.
The Gentle, that‟s a great name. in the old I‟Ching they talk about this gate in
terms of the gentle breeze, the kind of thing where it‟s evening and warm and
comfortable; you almost don‟t feel it but it‟s a cool breeze, and it immediately gives
you a tight back, a sore neck, you‟re sick in the morning, how it penetrates you. You
can see that there is something special about this gate just by the way that it's
described: The extraordinary power of clarity; just that. It is the intelligence of
perfected form, the intelligence behind the application of power. It's also the source
of what's called the brain wave.
Whenever anybody looks at that from the beginning they say wait a minute, wait a
minute, where‟s the brain here? It‟s not like this is ajna head center. This is the
mammalian brain. It‟s a different kind of brain. Our neo-cortex is built around it.
The neo-cortex is in the ajna. It‟s a much more primitive structure, and it is a
structure that at its core is acoustic. So when you're dealing with the 57th gate, one
of the things that you're dealing with is the fear of tomorrow and the fear of
tomorrow is either enhanced or not by what you hear at every level.

This is the Right Angle Cross of Penetration and the Right Angle Cross of Penetration
in itself is odd. It‟s the 53 and it‟s the 54 and it is the 57 and it is the 51. You‟ve
got all these 50s. Now, if you know the 64 evolutionary steps and you understand
that the evolutionary process follows a 1-2 to 63-64 track that you get to see that
everything about the potential of this cross—in 2027 we will enter stage 55. So,
we‟ll have the 51, the 53 and the 54
that we know something about.
We‟re still not at the potential of the
57. We still haven't reached that
stage of development. We still have
yet to complete integration. The 20,
the 34 and the 10 are long past as
evolutionary steps. But we are far
away from the completion of the 57.
We‟re still in the 54, which is part of
this.
The Cross of Penetration is just
that—break the surface. What
follows penetration is a clarion. And
it's one thing to see that in terms of
initiation and in terms of duality,
because this is where the clarion is
going to show up, that what
penetration does that penetration
opens the Earth and the clarion
plants the seed. But the Earth has to be broken first. To be a penetrator is to have
a very, very difficult process. You are never allowed to be deep. This is not the well.
This is intuition at its most precise on the surface momentary and weak. Remember
that it's not powerful breeze that makes you sick, it‟s a very weak one, very weak.
It sneaks up on you.

If you want a penetrator and you want the best penetrator you can possibly find get
yourself a Cross of Penetration 1/3, and you'll know right away that there is nothing
on earth like them. They can penetrate anything. The difficulty is the psychology.
The assumption is in penetration is that you can go further. And at the moment that
they try to go further, they are out of their depth and they're in big trouble. If you
have a Cross of Penetration that knows Human Design they‟re great at cracking

people to be open to the planting of the seed. But don't you dare ask them to tell
you what it's about. You'll be so confused, because it's so difficult for them. They
can open the door, they can‟t take you through. They‟re great initiators in that
sense, and it‟s their gift. But it's difficult for them to stop at just penetration.
Here you get the beginning of it in Confusion: The gift of penetrating to the inner
meaning that ensures timely action; the possibility of the intuition penetrating to the
inner meaning. Basically that inner meaning, don't confuse this. All that is, is that
the penetrator knows the weak spot; the penetrator knows how to bring the hammer
to find the fracture. But it's not going to polish the gem. It‟s going to do terrible
job, but it can fracture in just the right away that it's ready to be polished. Herein
lies the confusion, and this confusion can overpower the intuition; the Moon in
detriment.
So all penetrators are confused; and yet, the 1/3 penetrator is wonderful. They can
see the problem in the foundation, their 3 underneath. They can crack that.
Remember, they can really be anarchist. They can break things open without having
to replace anything. And if they stop there, that's what it's all about. This also tells
you the way the spleen works. This is the penultimate splenic gate. It tells you how
the spleen works. It‟s just surface and nothing more.
Alok and I yesterday were sitting in the restaurant. We both smoke hashish. And in
Spain they don't care except that they don't particularly like it to show to their
straight clients. We‟re sitting in the restaurant and two guys walk in the same suits
with pink ties. And my intuition, my spleen in that moment goes: something‟s
wrong. Just something's wrong. They‟re salesmen and these guys walk in, they
walk through and my spleen does not tell me anything other than something's
wrong. That‟s it; it penetrates, but it doesn't elaborate. It‟s not the mind, not at all.
Now, I‟ve learned because I‟m a splenic manifestor to trust my spleen when it does
that, and I knew. I said to Alok that there‟s something funny about these guys.
They‟re funny uniforms, as businessmen they look really silly, like the Japanese
companies where everybody has to dress the same. Two minutes later they come
into the restaurant, sit down at a table behind Alok and I who were smoking our joint
with our finishing coffee and who they bring with them is the manager of the hotel.
I knew, and I said to Alok, let‟s get up and get out of here. A few minutes later, the
waiter comes over to us and said, just don‟t do it in here. Now, my spleen knew, like
that. And my spleen also knew that this was not life and death. If it was life and
death I tell you without knowing I‟d be jumping because it's a different feeling in the
intuition. But the thing about it is that even though somebody like me—I‟m in my
third cycle—I know my intuition is telling me something. I also knew that we should
get up. But in the moment that it told me it does not tell me everything. It only
penetrates. It doesn't deliver anything else.
This is what you have to understand about the spleen. This is what you have to
understand about penetration. It‟s what you have to understand about splenic
awareness. Splenic awareness is very weak. It‟s that gentle breeze. It‟s just this
little hint. And if you're not sensitive to that very gentle breeze are you ever going

to get it. But the moment that you're sensitive to the gentle breeze, ah, it‟s amazing
to have a spleen. My mind says I don't see what's so impressive about your spleen.
It didn‟t tell you what was going to happen. And it doesn‟t because it can‟t. It can
only warn.
So, the whole thing about penetrators is to see that they can‟t go further; there‟s
nowhere to go. It‟s over the moment they break through. And in that lies their
confusion. Now, think about this in relationship. You don‟t want to have a
relationship with one of these people, because the way get you is they break the
surface and they can never go deeper. Now, for some people that‟s okay, after all, if
you don‟t want to go deeper with somebody. But the way in which we‟re conditioned
is that we think that there is this depth. And remember that the 57 as powerful as it
is, as much as there is the 34 and the 10 and the 20, it‟s not looking that way. It‟s
looking for a 28.
The 57 does not want to be caught going up before it goes down. Only the 28 can
make the 57 human. Only the 28 can bring out of the 57 true partnership. Only the
28 can give purpose to partnership. Remember that the 57 opens up to integration.
This is the basis of “I, I, I, I, I, I am, I am, I am. I am here now. I am surviving
here now by my power through my behavior in my life now.” And you take any 57
and you bring a 28 and they say, “I and them.” Eventually it can even become “me
and you.” But the only thing that humanizes, in that sense, brings duality to
individuality is the 28, and we‟re not there yet.
So, the 57, when it's looking in the other direction is simply a penetrator. Penetrate
the surface, penetrate the surface, penetrate the surface. They think that's the inner
meaning. I know somebody through my children at school and it's a parent that has
a very powerful social dynamics, the kind of person who superficially makes contact
with a lot of people with ease. And you can see the conditioning on the child to be
exactly the same way. So, it's a child that will say goodbye to every other child that
it sees. There is ability to just be able to penetrate the surface.
And yet, at the same time, the frustration that there is nothing below that surface
because they are not real friendships. The fact that you wave to somebody and say
goodbye, and they might nod or smile, does not actually mean that you have
penetrated them to the point that you can go deeper into a relationship. And 57s
have a very, very hard time in relationship. They just do. After all, if there is no 28,
if you're not fortunate enough to have a 28 in your design your 57 operates in a way
that really alienates it naturally from bonding. This is integration.
The only people that can really get me to pay attention to them are people that
either have the 28 or the 38. It‟s one of the things you learn about integration is
that the 57 is transformed when it's forced to be in the individual circuit, and thus be
involved in the empowerment business and so be able to empower the other. But
without the 28 or 38 presence, and by the way, it doesn‟t have to be there as a
definition, the 38 can just be there and do the same job. It‟s just not as easy
because there are gaps.

But the fact of the matter is that other than that the 57 stays very superficial and
isn‟t ready to get into those relationships. It‟s like with me, I have a very, very hard
because I'm so 57-oriented that my relationship with the other is always about what
I know about them in the moment through my spleen and nothing else. I don't have
real depth. I understand people technically. I see their design and know a lot. But
in terms of the way in which I live with other people, I am very, very much through
my 57 just taking them in that splenic way. I capture something, like the guys
coming through the door. There is no depth in that. There's just this surface
recognition. And for me that's the way my 57 connects to other beings. It's very
much this flavor that I take in in a moment.
And it‟s mostly triggered by the acoustic, what I hear. This is the gate of the right
ear. Now, think about that. Think about the telephone. The vast majority of human
beings place a telephone, because they‟re right-handed, they will pick up the
telephone with their left hand, and they will put it to their left ear. Right-handed
people do this. Now, if you‟re listening out of the left ear, which is the 22nd gate, if
you have a conversation on the telephone you will only hear what you want hear
according to the mood that you‟re in; in other words, where you are the wave. So
somebody calls you and says, by the way, a friend of mine died and that is part of
the conversation. Now, if you‟re down you may tune into the death part, even
though you may not know that person. If you're up you‟ll only remember another
part, and only later in the week remember oh, that person died.
If you have the phone to the right ear you're no longer dealing with an emotional
ear—your left ear is emotional—your right ear is logical in the now. You hear
everything that‟s said in a moment. So if you actually want to hear somebody on
the telephone, put the telephone to your right ear. It helps. Now, if you‟re
somebody like me who is a 57 one of the things that I did in my career is that as an
analyst I always put people on my right. So I could hear them in the now, instead of
putting them on my left which would have been a totally different procedure. We
wound not have had the same immediate effect spontaneous existential impact in
the now.
So the 57 is really the individual that appears in this thing of duality, and it says in of
itself by myself just as a 57, no, I'm not interested. Just as the 57 I‟ll penetrate
people on the surface, that‟s what I‟m going to do. But don't ask me to have a
successful long-term relationship. I have to look after myself. And the only thing
that will change that for the 57 is not what's in the 57. But what can come in the
Channel of Struggle, that only the Channel of Struggle with its pressure for purpose,
only that is going to turn the 57 from being a superficial penetrator into an
empowering force, an empowerer of the archetype, an empowerer of the perfected
form, an empowerer of existential correctness in the now.
This whole business of seeing the way in which relating takes place, remember
there's a real problem with being a penetrator. The problem is that because there is
the illusion that one could go deeper, the fact that one can't go deeper is often very
depressing and you're dealing with a melancholic individual chemical gate. In other
words, you cannot separate relationship from melancholy. Sadness is something
that emerges the moment that we're dealing with individuality.

RAC Penetration 3
This is a very interesting line. Please look at the 57, again, like the 48 there is only
one line that‟s blue and it‟s the 2nd line, not the 6 as was the case, for example, in
the 48. The clarity to establish proper values and ideals must be accompanied by
resolute determination to maintain them. Perfected cleansing through inner
realization or superficial cleansing that tends to hide the dirt underneath the carpet.
Remember our splenic 2 story, terminal disease, wonderful stuff. There are all these
lovely, lovely little 2 goodies—degeneracy. And if you only knew the 2s through the
spleen you'd think that being a 2 was really, well, you know.
As long as the 57 doesn‟t meet the 28 or the 38, the 57 is incompetent in any kind of
relationship. It really is; it‟s incompetent. One of the things is that they try to deal
with just the surface. Remember that we‟re dealing with empowerment. What they
try to do is empower some kind of: I guess we can survive this. I guess we could
make it to tomorrow, I guess. So, many of their problems are shoved away. Now,
understand what that means. What that means is that the 57.2 is about deafness.
It's about refusing to hear the truth and refusing to hear the truth in the inner sense,
these things that are hidden under the carpet.
By the way, it‟s a 57 trade. I'm a 57.5, that's my personality Earth. And if you walk
into my studio, it looks like my studio was arranged for a photo shoot, because
everything is perfect. But don't open certain drawers, because you'll immediately
see that the illusion of order will be broken instantaneously because what it takes me
to find a piece of paper sometimes in one of those drawers, I tell you. And I built
the desk myself so it has the longest drawers you can imagine. I have drawers that
are so deep that you can stuff things in there for years without ever having to go
through it. That‟s a 57.2. On the surface you can have this illusion. That's okay;
just keep this stuff in the draws.
I worked with gays in Hamburg, they were women and I worked with gays in Berlin
and they were men. It was in the mid-90s, the early 90s, 94 or 95. My associate
was bisexual, so he had a fascination about why. It was obvious to me from my own
early encounters with gays that I had done readings for is that I began to see a
trend. Basically that trend is the presence of the 10/57 along with an open
emotional center. Now, the 10/57 is Perfected Form, the 10th gate is the gate of
behavior and the 57, as we know, is an intuitive gate. And yet, the 10 is a gate of
love, and it is a gate of love that will deny behaviors. As a matter fact, is not just
the 10th gate, it is specifically the 10.5, which of course carries heresy within it.
The reason I bring this up is that this 2nd line is a closet as well. It‟s not just about
hiding things in a drawer, but it's about hiding things in the closet. Now, you can
have skeletons in the closet, or in the language of the gay world you can be in the
closet, that is, you‟re a homosexual but don't tell anybody. And you put that in a
closet and you pretend that you're going along with an orderly process. So

something to keep in mind about the 2nd line is that that 2nd line is going to carry
with it things that are hidden that are particularly about the quality of love in a
relationship.
The moment that you reach individuality you immediately come to the melancholy
that could be transformed creatively as romance, as an example, that what we learn
about romance through the 39/55, 12/22 where you have to have this building of the
fire of passion that the individual emotion is passionate. Now, obviously when you
come over to the spleen passion doesn't work in the same way. It‟s not emotional,
it‟s not mental. And yet, you cannot separate that quality of love, particularly from
the 10/57 because the 10th gate is the vessel. We are looking at love. We're looking
at the theme of love through behavior.
By the way, the open emotional system should be obvious. That is, if you‟re a
female and your mother is emotional and she is deeply disturbed it disturbs your
entire relationship is an archetype; the power of the emotional system to create
turmoil. I said same sex, it should have been said a different sex. The boy that has
a mother that emotional and a father that‟s not, and the emotional mother drives
him crazy, fills him with all kinds of guilt and shame and pain and everything else,
and the unemotional father doesn't do that, there is a tendency, if they‟re a 10/57 to
look for the perfected form of love that has nothing to do with sex drive. It doesn't
have anything to do with the emotional drive for sexuality.
It‟s why, by the way, that most homosexuals, particularly male homosexuals, have
almost uncontrollable promiscuity as one of their main themes. There‟s very little
way to regulate the drive because it's coming out of individuality, or freak-dom. So,
when you're looking at this cleansing, please recognize that cleansing is often
superficial. Remember, this is penetration. It's often very superficial. It looks like
it's been cleaned up on the surface, the person that says to their partner that they've
given up smoking and they do it on the side. And they‟re always hiding the cigarette
somewhere and they're always hiding the ashtrays somewhere. No dear, no dear,
I‟m not taking junk anymore. And they have their secret place where they have
their little stash and their moments where they do their nasty thing.
Obviously, when you're dealing with the 2/4 one of the things to see again is this
missionary capacity in the 2/4 to be called out to influence others to cleanse; in
other words, to look for inner relaxation. And basically what these people help you
do isn't supposedly they going to help you empty your closet. They‟re going to help
you open up that drawer and go through that mess that‟s in there. And it's very
difficult to do that with an individual that‟s deaf by nature. That‟s not going to be
very successful.

value to the spleen is anything that‟s healthy. And anything that's healthy in the
moment. Basically the only criterion for the 57 is whether or not a relationship will
make them unhealthy. Is it going to make me unhealthy? If it‟s going to make me
unhealthy I don‟t want it. What happens in the not-self because it's very superficial
and because of the way the spleen operates as an open spleen you can see people
holding onto things that are really awful for them, holding onto things in the closet,
holding onto things in those drawers, never being able to allow them out, never truly
getting to an inner realization.
I think the 2/5s rarely suffer from a dirt-under-the-carpet program. It‟s like if you
go to a 2/5s house, opening the door is opening the closet. And that's really what I
mean. It‟s like their whole life is a closet. I've often joked about the 2/5 sexually
that you see them in the office and they‟re prim and proper and up tight. It‟s the
last thing that you would expect from a seductive unconscious. And then you see
them at home with the blinds drawn. Do I need to describe it? Whatever your
imagination will take you to; you can imagine they do with blinds drawn. So their
life is a closet. Its why, by the way, they will be very successful virtually, because
they can stay mostly hidden and only allow out what they want to allow out.

RAC Penetration 3
Whenever I need to explain to a 3rd line being how beautiful they are all I need to do
is take them to this line, the 3rd line acuteness. For me there is no line like it. It
says you're born with this: The perfected intelligence. That's how it starts. Where
else can you go? This is the perfected intelligence; you‟re born with it. Now of
course, we have to understand that is intuitive, spontaneous existential acoustic
intelligence, splenic intelligence. Basically what that says is you've got an incredible
warning system: Acuteness. You can hear what nobody else can hear. You can
hear the breath of God. You can hear things nobody else can hear. The perfected
intelligence where clarity eliminates doubt and ensures manifestation; the possibility
of perfected intuition. No polarity. You're born with it.
It‟s the saddest place to be splenic. It's like the schoolyard scene where you've got
the little runt. The spleen is the little runt. And there are all these bullies around.
There‟s the mental bully that tells them they‟re inferior. There‟s the emotional bully
that tells them they‟re useless. They have no staying power. The spleen can‟t keep
up with the mind or the emotions; frequency. With the mind, you make a decision
and you live with it all your life. All your life you can bring it back—could have,
should have, might have—forever. The emotions have a wave, but some waves only
end when you die. You can process your feeling about life till the end; it's allowed.
But to be splenic is like having moment-by-moment amnesia. All you have is the
moment, and the moment you have the moment, the moment is gone and
everything is the next moment and then it's gone, and then the next moment and
then it's gone. There‟s no power. You‟re walking in the dark and your splenic
system says to you: stop walking. If you don't listen, it won't tell you that quarter

inch before you go off the cliff. It will not come back and tell you again. It can‟t.
It‟s on to the next thing.
So, this acuteness, if you don't listen, and this is death, if you don‟t listen, if you
don‟t respect it, it‟s not acuteness at all. It‟s just cute. These are the people in the
hospital who always say: I knew it. I just knew it. I knew that tree was going to
jump out at me, I just knew it. And so why are you here in the hospital? Well, I
didn‟t trust it, I don't respect it. My mind thinks my spleen is a retard. Well, it‟s
true. The mind really thinks that the spleen is inferior, seriously inferior. I know;
I‟m splenic, splenic authority.
The moment that your spleen says no or yes to whatever the hell it is, the mind
immediately jumps in and goes, could you elaborate? Elaborate about what?
Instant amnesia—it‟s gone. And the mind says, what was that back there? And
you‟re getting the next impulse. After all, the mind thinks that the spleen is
ridiculous and the emotions are a pain in the ass. This is not truly conceptual-able, if
there is such a word, if not we'll add it to our list of new vocabulary.
Okay, so the 3/5 acuteness, you know for sure what's going to happen to them. You
know that their intuition is going to say no and they're going to do it anyway and
boom. And you only hope that they learn. For me it‟s the same thing with any 3.
When I look at any 3 what I see is this line. It says very clearly, if you don't operate
correctly, you're not going to liberate yourself from fear; you're not going to be able
to hear. Human beings don't know—men, ask a man to honor his hunches, it‟s like
pulling teeth.
As a not-self, me, I've got this incredible spleen, I was one of these people who said
I just knew it. I had this very, very clever mind that would say, what did you say?
And if the spleen didn‟t answer back (sound)—I'm doubly deaf. I‟m also 43/23 deaf.
It‟s why the 3 is the secret to survival in mutation, this acuteness. And in this
acuteness is the ability to be able to penetrate in any situation to be able to really
see what's there, and to take advantage of it, to discover, to move on.

RAC Penetration 3
It‟s always a crapshoot whether 3s are really going to study in life or not. You never
know, they can. It depends on early experiences. The more educated the 3/6, and
by the way, that's true for 3/6s in every respect, the easier it is for them to deal with
life itself. Obviously, as a 3/6 with this line, as a penetrator you're truly going to
penetrate the wrong things. And more than penetrate the wrong things, we know
that the not-self is going to try to go deeper. And of course, in that depth is going to
be where the pain is.
The nice thing about the 3/6 is that it always carries a ladder. My old joke about
3/6s is that they go up on the roof and come down, go back on the roof and come
down, go back up on the roof and come down. They always have the 3. They have

RAC Penetration 3
Here we come into the power of the 4 and we have this line of The Director; Cecile
B. DeMille comes to mind. It‟s hard to believe this line. It says: The mastery of
relationships—excuse me, are you talking about the 57th gate? This very, very
deeply, deeply, deeply individual I don't care about you, get out of my face, I need
to survive 57th gate? Death to everybody; the director: The mastery of relationships
that through clarity can maximize productivity while the sensitivity to
interrelationships will ensure harmony; the possible intuitive clarity to master
relationships. I love this.
Maybe the detriment will tell us something. It says: A tendency given this position
to be dictatorial—ah, now we‟re getting a little bit closer to what it is to be an
individual—rather than directorial. It‟s the line of the dictator. With the gift of clarity
to master relationships, the possibility of being intuitively dictatorial. God, I love
that. What a description. I'm an intuitive dictator. Hitler was a 57. He was an
intuitive dictator; how nice; and Mars in that detriment.
You can‟t escape being a 4, continuity being continuity. It is a line of
brotherhood/sisterhood despite the fact it‟s going to end up in individual gates. In
other words, there is this social capacity that‟s always going to be there in the 4
because the 4, after all, can only move forward through being able to have
opportunity. And the way in which the individuality expresses itself is that the only
way that they can be your brother is if they‟re big brother. I'm the big dog. There
are dogs and then there's the big dog. This is the line of the big dog; which is a way
to master relationships.
Most of the time when you look at the 4/6, because I created that illusion of calling
them voyeurs, the 4/6 in Initiation or the 4/6 in Civilization is very much voyeuristic.
But the 4/6 here, if you have a party and have a 4/6, their rightful place is to be
invited to the party, but be at the edge looking at everyone. But here, you get
invited to the party and everyone looks at you. You become the focus of the
voyeurism. Yes, which makes them very, very powerful, or if you‟re you're in the
wrong group, the 4/3 phase at the beginning of the life, the first Saturn cycle, you
can end up having a great deal of focus of attention on you and you are able to be
either director or dictator.
And you know what the 4 is, the 4 is the line of the Abdicator—the 7.4 abdication—I
give up. I give up. And you can see it's very easy for 4th line directors or dictators
to give up. The director quits; the dictator is shot. But they both give up.

The 4/1
I like this Cross of Intuition. There is something very interesting about this 4/1,
we‟re moving into the polarity of the 61 and the 62. So we have Inner Truth, and we
have the Preponderance of the
Small, this gate of detail, this
metamorphic gate in the throat.
Clearly this juxtaposition cross is
actually very, very powerful. And in
here you really see the
director/dictator potential in the
sense of really being able to guide
people from being penetrated to
receiving the message. After all, it is
the Cross of Intuition that forms the
bridge between penetration and the
clarion.
And when you see that, you can see
very clearly that this is a way of—
penetration is going to break open
the Earth, in that sense, and
basically what intuition is rain. It‟s
rain. And then the clarion comes and
drops in a seed. And it's essential to
see that none of these processes work. That‟s why we go around this way to really
see that every profile, not just the focus, every harmonic profile has an extraordinary
job to do and they are always a minority.
Whether they are good at it or not, 4/1s are going to do their very best to master
the relationships around them and to be able to master those relationships for their
own survival; it is not anything more than the only way that they can care for
themselves. Remember, without the presence of the 28/38 that the 57th gate can
only effectively care for itself.

The 5/1
This brings us to the Clarion. For me, this is my mirror. I‟m a 51.1 Clarion, so I
come from the Arian side; my Earth is in the 57.5. And this is Progression and it
says: The natural ability to establish new forms while maintaining the powers of
reevaluation and re-examination. This provides the clarity to examine the data and
assess the process; the possible intuitive gift for evaluation. Or—I love it—Moon in
detriment: the misguided missile. Isn‟t that a great one, I like that—the misguided
missile. When in action, the intuition may become overwhelmed and unable to
assess and evaluate its progress.
Now, what is this really all about? This is the clarion, after all, so there is an
essential message that is given out through this. And the essential message is that
basically what it's providing is that
it‟s simply announcing a mutation
that already exists. It‟s already
announcing a mutation that is
already there. In other words, I can
only announce the mutation of
Human Design when the mutation
had already taken place. It took
place at the same moment that I
got it. It just took time, a slow
down in the frequency for me to be
able to concretize that and bring it
out in a concrete way.
The heresy is that there may be
other ways to be alone and still
have people in your life. This is not
the glue of the 4 anymore. This is
about an intuitive capacity to
mutate new forms. And again, the
57.5 to the 10.5 and you have the
potential that any kind of form will exist. And whether that‟s gay or it's or it‟s that.
The 10/57 is the only creative channel in integration. And in that channel you have
all kinds of people that we associate with the gay community, designers, fashion
people, architects, all of these kinds of form structure stuff.
So, what you have is you have a capacity in the moment to mutate and to form, or
for cancer to take over. That is, constantly mutating new forms to the point of being
overwhelmed. Now, I do both. I can always feel that. I have the Earth in this line

time. And I know both sides. One side of me says, okay here's the new form, it‟s
called Human Design. And I'm very grounded in that; it's my Earth, it‟s my
personality so I‟m aware of it. And on the other side is here is Human Design and
now I‟m going to be a misguided missile and I'm going to take you through
thousands and thousands and thousands of things about Human Design, new forms
all the time, new constructs out of that; 1/4. As a matter of fact, I even teach
forms—the design of forms. It‟s even called that; form principles.
The intuition is going to operate correctly or is going to be overwhelmed if the spleen
is not allowed to be the authority if that's what it's intended to be. The whole thing
about correctness, when you're dealing with a splenic center—I can understand
people trying to work out correctness mentally about mental things; it seems logical.
But what the splenic says, there‟s nothing you can do except be correct. You cannot
talk to your spleen. You can‟t. The moment it says something it has amnesia. You
can‟t talk to that. It says hello and you say hello back and it looks at you as if you're
a stranger. That‟s not what it's about.
So the whole thing to recognize about anything having to do with the 57th gate is
normally what you get out of this gate is sadness. There‟s a wonderful word in
English, I love it, it‟s called lugubrious. And lugubrious is what a basset hound looks
like, these sad droopy eyes, this lugubrious look. And whenever you see a 57 there
is this lugubriousness about them—I like that word; I‟ll keep on saying it for hours
now.
Being a 43/23 you always have a certain level of Tourette‟s; you know Tourette‟s
syndrome. These are people who get hooked on sound rotations, turning sounds
over in their head or saying things like that. With my kids, for example, I‟m always
making up words. It drives them crazy. And I‟ll repeat them endlessly. It‟s a
Tourette‟s mechanism. It‟s very funny, these kinds of things. And you can see that
it‟s just part of individuality. It‟s just part of what it is to be a freak, and I‟m truly a

are the people that other people say you've changed and they don't know why.
They‟re not 1s; they have no idea. They don't even understand it. They don't even
know. And again, 5/2s hide out.
The best you can say for progression is that the evaluation that is here is simply the
authority of the spleen. And I will tell you something else, that if you're emotional
and you have this gate, it never works properly. It doesn‟t. It can‟t. It‟s
overwhelmed. And the only thing that will save you and bring it back, make it a
value to you so that there is something that you can bring out, because there is
enormous pressure on Clarions to do their job, is being correct.

When we get to the 6 we have Utilization: clarity is a double-edged sword, and it's
what we learn. The 57 realizes that there's no point at the 6th line level to look
ahead anymore. There's no point. There's no point looking to the 34 or the 10 or
the 20 because they don‟t have the answer. This is where the 6th line takes the
individual at its deepest most isolated freak-dom, is that what happens to the 57 is
that the 57, like Rosemary's Baby, the head turns around like this. And instead of
looking that way, it says, where‟s the struggle, I want struggle. And of course,
they‟re not saying that, they‟re saying this is pointless without purpose. No matter
what I do, no matter where my intuition takes me, it does not resolve anything. It
doesn't help me to have a better relationship with the other; I don't care about the
other, I want to know how to love. It‟s the dream of the 57.
It says if I can only be in love, then I can turn my back on tomorrow. Now, that's
nice poetry. If I can only find love, tomorrow is not a problem anymore. I can be
complete in the now. When clarity points to a problem one is unable because of
circumstances to solve, a tendency to anger and frustration that provokes inevitably
futile action; intuition making the best of a situation. The difficult situation is that
the 57 knows it's alone, it‟s clear. And it cannot work its way through anything,
because every time it gets a message it forgets it.
If we were only animals, it would be so easy to be splenic. I know that when I went
to my deconstruction period, it‟s very easy to be integration. But boy, the moment
that there are humans around, wow, when you're a freak you know right away
you‟re out of your depth. This is not your world.

The 6/3 says the best thing I can do is offer my genes to the tribe, because that's

its eye is the 32. The 50 is over there. You come from the 50; you don‟t want to
talk about that. What catches its eye is the 32 because the 32 is right beside it. It‟s
like, okay, maybe this is the answer, and maybe this is where it is. Well, let‟s see.
There is an enormous problem with what is described in this line as frustration and
anger when that is something that is splenic, because of course it's not experienced
that way. It‟s just a way to try to describe the frustration that is inherent in the
spleen, and what it means to deal with the spleen, how difficult it is to trust your
spleen, because there's no sustainment. The thing about 6/3s is that they know that

way, maybe there's a way because I see over there that they seem to have maybe a
way. They call it transformation.
Remember the intrinsic relationship between the individual and the tribe. The tribe
cannot survive without individuals once in a while adding to their gene pool. The
traveling salesman stories—the farmer and the farmer's daughter and you've got
new genes and suddenly you have a freak that you add to the community and you
change the gene pool because if you don't keep refreshing the gene pool then the
tribe is going to lose its power. So, tribes have always been open to taking in
individual genetics to add to it, as long as the individual then surrenders to being
tribal, but that‟s another story.
What the 57 discovers right away is that the 32 is interesting, but it's not its lover.
It‟s just interesting, because the 32 says, the only thing to be afraid of is failure.
Because when you get to the 28, the only thing you have to be afraid of is death and
lack of purpose. The 57 goes, yes, baby, you‟re right. When the 32 says, no, no it‟s
all about whether you're a failure or not. The 32 is concerned about tribal survival.
The 57 already knows how to survive. It seems kind of silly that they worry about
that. Duration: The only thing that endures is change. Let us not forget.

Introduction
Duration: The only thing that endures is change; let us not forget. I guess it's the
deepest message of the 32; the only thing which endures is change. And we come
to one of my favorite crosses. What is maya? You have the 61, so the maya is built
on mysteries. You have the 62. It's built on details. You have the 32. It's built on
themes of survival, and you have the 42. I don't think there's anything more
mysterious than the 42nd gate. After all, it is the 42nd gate that says that everything
ends. The 42nd gate is the great gate of death, terminality, finality.
What the 42nd gate really says is that the thing that is the most consistent thing that
we have in the maya is that everything that begins ends. Everything, everything,
everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything,
everything, there is nothing in the maya that doesn‟t have a beginning or an end,
nothing. It is the basic formula of the maya.

The 1/3
So we have the 32. We have the Cross of Maya. And here we begin not with
conservatism, but Conservation. Remember that we‟re dealing with the tribe and
the whole thing about the 32, it's a personnel manager, it‟s a financial manager. The
whole thing about the tribe is what the tribe is interested in is tribal survival. The
32nd gate is the greatest talent scout in Design. It‟s always looking for talent in the
tribe. It's always looking for that potential 54 that can transform the destiny of the
tribe.
Life sustaining respect and attention to all aspects of a process, or the uncontrollable
urge to bypass essentials which inevitably lead to the disruption of continuity; this is
instinct. Instinct is just as confusing as intuition. They‟re spontaneous existential
expressions of the Spleen. The difference is that where intuition is acoustic, here
we‟re dealing with smell, aroma, the nose; scratch, scratch.
1/3s are very good at paying attention to detail. Everything about the maya is built
on detail. If there is no detail there is no maya. The denser the maya the denser
the detail, the denser the detail the denser the maya, it‟s just the way it goes. The
maya of today is much denser than the maya of 2000 years ago. We have a very,
very, very dense maya. So many things have names. You give something a name it
has power. It's takes a place in the maya. And everything that it takes to transfer
that name to others so that they recognize it so that it expands in maya—Human
Design is expanding the maya. We bring new language to the maya.

So everything about the maya is based on and begins with detail. All aspects of the
process is detailed attention. Now, 1/3s are super at that. They‟re brilliant, after all.
They have this deep potential intellectually. They have a 1st line personality, it‟s very
powerful. They‟re not like the 1/4 where there is a limitation of what they will study.
Basically they study where their
failures take them, in the sense of
what the trial and error of life points
them at. The tribe we know has a
deep, deep, deep responsibility to
the other. We call it support. One
of the ways in which the 32 solves
the process or the problem is that
the 32 separates the personal
relationship from the tribal
relationship.
Remember that only on the
emotional side is the tribe interested
in the pair bond. On the splenic
side it is interested in seeing that
the pair is a catalyst for growth. For
example, the 19th gate is the
archetype of somebody seeking a
partner. And the 49th gate is the
archetype of somebody looking for a
partner. That‟s for marriage. That's for bonding within the tradition of marriage in
the community. But when you come over to the other side, the 54 is looking for
somebody who will recognize their talent. And the 32 is looking for somebody where
they think there is talent.
Now, one of the reasons why that in the workplace we have so many love affairs is
the confusion between the 19/49 with its mirror, the 54/32, The Marrying Maiden.
It's not a marrying maiden in that sense. Remember that the actual lines were
written in a time where there was no nine-centered being. And the only hexagram
that varies in any essential difference in terms of its formula with the ancient I‟Ching
is in the 54th gate in the 4th line because the 4th line is so unique, this
Enlightenment/endarkenment, which has nothing to do with the original.
The 1/3 here has a tremendous potential to be able to recognize who really has the
talent but not to be confused in thinking that they're finding a partner. The
relationship between the higher up and their prodigy cannot turn into the bride and
groom relationship, and that is the great risk. But it's also a way of compensating.
In other words, there are many men for example who actually enjoy and appreciate
their secretaries more than they do their wives. But then their secretaries don't
have to live with them in the same way, and they don't have to live with the
secretaries in the same way. There is always this confusion that is there.

What you want out of this process is that there is a readiness to do the detail work
and 1/3s will do it. 1/4s are more interested in results. What they want to be able
to do is influence others with what needs to be conserved and what needs to be
conserved is talent. Remember that this is an inherent power trip. The 32 says I‟m
going to make you a star to the 54. And the 54 has to say, oh gee thanks, because
the 54 hopes to become a 45 and then it can tell the 32 to go stuff it, but that's a
long way down the road. First you have to sleep with the producer, this kind of stuff.
You really have to see so many things that are in here that are very distorted in the
way our sexuality works. Again, we‟re dealing with duality so you have to see that
the 32 is very much connected to this process that the other for me can really bring
about fulfillment but not in a personal way in the sense of a relationship, but in the
way in which it can be productive.

The 2/4
RAC Maya 3
When we get to the 2nd line, this is Restraint. This is one of these law lines. You
have Venus and Jupiter together, so you know right away that this is essential,
natural and legalistic kind of rulemaking. This is: The control of power for the
benefit and enhancement of harmony, or a tendency in frustration, particularly from
a position of strength to social withdrawal rather than persistent control.
So, you have two things. You have: transformation that can be beneficial for others
or the frustration with controls or being controlled. Right away you get an insight
into how powerful the 2/4 can be, because when we look at the 2nd line and we
always relate it to shyness, to the democrat that doesn‟t vote, and so forth and so
on, when you look at this line of restraint you can see that there's tremendous power
potential in these beings. Remember something about a 2. They don't knock on
your door. They already have power over you. You knock on theirs. They can deny
you access, they can frustrate you. And if they open the door, they bring you into
their web. They can be very powerful.
So, controls are part of that. And the whole thing about the 32 is that you want to
control your prodigy. You want to shape them the way you want to shape them.
But of course, if you're not aware this can be very, very uncomfortable constantly
trying to control somebody else. In these tribal configurations you put up with it,
because it is felt as or understood as support.

The goal, by the way, is harmony. It‟s one of the things that the tribe tries to insist
on. Is that within the tribe we have harmony, and that the rationale of the 32 is to
say to the 54, I am controlling you, I know that. But I have to control you;
otherwise, there will not be transformation. And once the transformation has taken
place, once you've moved up the ladder, I'll let go of the controls, because you will
have earned that place. This is the apprentice game. So, you can see what kind of
relationships these people have, you can see that very clearly.

The 2/5
RAC Maya 3
2/5s are obviously are terrified of controls, they're terrified of being pulled out, of
being forced into things that they don't want to do or are concerned that they're
unable to do, that I have to live with the failed protection that can happen to them
as a 5th line unconscious, that they are very concerned and paranoid about being
controlled by the demands of others. So, they are only going to enter into any kind
of relationship as a controlling mechanism.
By the way, the most interesting thing about 2/5s is that if you have an office where
you have an ongoing personnel program and people have to be trained, let‟s say
you‟re running a call center and you have to train people and there is a lot of
turnover, whatever. This is the perfect position for a 2/5; legalized tribal control.
That's their position. But they're the ones that in controlling everybody and bringing
them through the process are the ones that can also pick out who could really be the
best ones. And when you know who can be the best ones, those best ones are going
to help support everybody else. They‟re going to made money for the business,
they‟re going to help the business grow. So, the 2/5 can be very, very good in this
position of controlling for the benefit of everyone, teaching people, training people,
transforming them in that way.
Something else to always understand about the 32nd gate is that the 32nd gate is
here to know the price of things. No other gate is so good at weighing out the price.
And if you look at the constellation of Libra, you will see that the 32nd gate is in Libra
and you will see very clearly that if there was ever an expression of the scales of
Libra, it‟s right here. And it's not about justice. It‟s only about money, worth, value.
It's the 32 that will say to the boss above the 32, this one over here is very good,
give this one a promotion and bring them up the ladder.
So everything about the 32 is understanding that they are always measuring value.
I‟ve often told that story, women who love buying shoes on sale, and you wait for
that great pair of shoes to be on sale, it's finally on sale, you buy it, you‟re so happy,

The 3/5 & 3/6
RAC Maya 3
The 3: Lack of Continuity; maya, maya everywhere. Indecision and persistent
reevaluation that only because of its basic intelligence manages to endure, only
because of its basic intelligence and over reliance on traditionally legitimized
standards in times of change can be totally out of step and suffer unexpected
humiliation; a lack of instinct in times of transformation. Indecision, lack of instinct,
there‟s something wrong here.
You don't want to hire this person as your financial manager. The not-self version of
this has no idea what the hell is going on, truly. Where you really notice this is that
even though this gate supposedly is part of the Channel of Transformation, as a gate
it doesn't know that. It doesn't mean that the 32 can handle transformation. And
this is one of these cases where the 3rd line can be very, very indecisive. And if
you're looking at the whole 3rd line principle, you can see that the trial and error that
brings continued failure can lead to a sense of not knowing what to do, feeling that
no matter what you do it‟s not going to work out.
The most difficult thing for these people is that you pick somebody out from the shop
room floor, only to discover 18 months later that they‟re your boss. And you can't
handle it. You can handle it at all. These are the ones where you're going to meet
exactly that person that you are going to have to be responsible for and you‟re
training somebody who's going to cut you down. It‟s the way the tribe works.
Whoever can serve the tribe best will climb to the top.
The 3rd line has trouble here. The 3/5 obviously gets into a great deal of difficulty. I
do want you to understand that the 3rd line here and the 6th line here bring the
reality of the 32nd gate. It‟s a gate that can be deeply depressive and suicidal. It
can be enormously unhappy. Failure is something that it cannot tolerate. It‟s why
the 3rd line is so helpless here. Whether you're 3/5 or a 3/6, this is really a very,
very difficult place to be. It is a gate that fears failure. When I‟m meeting
somebody who is a 32.3 I say that failure is okay. Yeah, it sounds nice to say, but
this gate is terrified of failure. It‟s a kind of death. You don't want to fail.
So, this 3rd line, whether it's the 3/5 or the 3/6, despite the fact that the 3/6 is in
this quarter, it‟s very difficult. What you see in this is that you see people who feel—
again, like the shoes. You see somebody and you think that you can transform with
them only to discover that in the transformation they overwhelm you, that you can't
handle them at all, that in fact they are going to create difficulties for you. And that
you're helpless and that there's nothing you can do about it.
To be in a gate where the fear of failure is so powerful, that both the 6th line and the
3rd line, when we get to the 6th line you‟ll see that in its 3rd line phase you probably
have more suicides from this line, this activation than anything else. It can be very,
very distressing to have 3rd line themes in this gate because of its connection to

failure and because the 3rd line process so that it looks like failure. Now, obviously if
you're awake, if you're operating correctly, if you really get deep enough in all of
this, even with your Sun here you could manage. You could manage by simply
accepting helplessness, that you're helpless. It‟s okay. But for the not-self, no, this
is very, very difficult, because it seems like betrayal. There is a bargain inherent in
everything the tribe does. If I pull you up you always reward me from then on. You
remember me; you remember I made it happen for you. And of course, when that's
not there, it‟s failure for the 32.

The 4/6
RAC Maya 3
Right is Might: Even in times of change certain underlying principles endure; the
instinct to maintain one's principles in times of change. The other side is that where
Jupiter, which is the exaltation, will establish right action in the larger social realm,
Saturn’s will lead to inner strength and endurance as long as it is not threatened
from the outside. So, when you get to the 4th line here, what you're dealing with is
just how you stay secure in transforming times.
This is the key to the success of tribes. This is the success of raising a tribe up that
they don't get locked into the old tribal pattern that will lead to extinction. There are
so many tribes that are extinct or becoming extinct on a yearly basis on this planet.
There are tribes dying. Their language is dying every year. This is the great failure
for the tribe. This right is might is simply about the ability for any tribe to maintain
its continuity as long as it can find the right talent. And as long as it can find the
right talent, it doesn't matter what's going on around, its time will come.
You can see particular what happened in Asia after the Second World War, you can
see very quickly that the changing of the consciousness field, the technology field, all
of those things, were immediately taken in without really losing all of that tribalness
that was there. Oh, yes, some. You have to adapt. There are things that you have
to deal with in transformation, but here the 4th line shows its deepest influence, that
influence that says it's all right, we can still be a tribe even though we have
computers. As a matter of fact, we can be a richer tribe, a smarter tribe, a more
successful tribe.
One of the difficulties in the 3rd line is that the 3rd line is threatened by changes
coming into the tribe, because again failure is the theme and its 3rd line; whereas,
the 4th line realizes that without change the tribe will die, that there must be change.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Conservation  32  56
 42  60
The 4/1
The Juxtaposition Cross of Conservation, and interestingly enough this very line
brings us back to the 1st line, this harmony, in a sense. Of course, we have had a
movement that has taken place that we have now gone to the 60, we have limitation
and we have the 56. Now, I want you to think about the cross in a different way,
the moment I say 50 and 56 you should already be recognizing what's coming,
because the 60 and the 56 are an arm of the law, the Cross of the Laws. So you can
see what's floating in here
underneath now. There is law
creeping in here. Limitation is there
the moment that we start talking
about conservation.
Everything has a limitation. And the
one thing that we know is that the
one thing that is always consistent is
change itself. One of the things
they do see is that in the 60 and in
the 56 is this metaphor for limitation
and transcendence. The 56th gate is
so tuned to the stimulation of the
time. It‟s easily able to
metamorphose, to change radically,
believing it's so easy to change
because it has no grounding.
So, one of the things underlying this
is a belief, a deep belief that one can
transcend the limitation, the limitation of being a tribe, the limitation of the
circumstances that change can bring, that that is the magic. The magic is there's
always the potential for a solid foundation. Now, remember psychologically the 32 is
not healthy. The 3/6 which dominates any hexagram—after all, six of the 12 profiles
will have 3 or 6 as themes. And you can see here that the 3rd line and the 6th line
are very depressing and fraught with failure, which is why tribes do die. They don‟t
all survive. So many tribes have disappeared over time, those sweet old Mayans,
the Etruscans, whoever you want to talk about somewhere out there, they‟re gone
and tribes do disappear now, still.
The 4/1 will simply say here is the fundamental principle. The fundamental principle
as a tribe, as long as we maintain our territory, as long as we maintain our language,
as long as we maintain our traditions then we are able to survive any change. That
is our power. It is inherent in our principles, and that is our true value. As a tribe,

our true value is determined by the depth of the bond that we have to those things
that are impermeable that will never change, that will last forever. And so today,
regardless of how modern we are, you go into the most sophisticated societies and
you go to their festival and they'll show you their 250 year costume and their old
tradition. And everybody will be happy. There is this line of continuity even though
everybody is showing up in Mercedes-Benz‟s. There is this line of continuity.

The 5/1
The Left Angle Cross of Limitation speaks for itself. It‟s a pretty one. It says
Flexibility: Easy adaption to circumstances. I always like it when the Moon is
exalted, where superficiality is a valuable tool, that while masking the inner light
permits adaption to prevailing conditions; an instinct for adaption in times of change.
Now remember, adaption is my new word. I like adaption, I think it's better than
adaptation, but if you feel like you
want to add those extra syllables,
the hell with you, but anyway.
This is a blue line. It‟s something
that you have to learn. You have to
learn how to deal with change. For
32s this is so difficult. And yet,
they‟re the gate of change. Think
about where we are now—5th line
theme, this plane that we‟re living
on, we‟re all doing the best we can
to deal with the circumstances. I
watched this special the other night
on outsourcing in India; it‟s
incredible how we can adapt to the
way in which the circumstances
work and the tribe can take
advantage of these changes.
It's all about being flexible. If the
tribe is not flexible it dies. And this is the message of the 5th line here. If we‟re not
flexible we‟re going to die. If we‟re not open to a little of this and a little of that from
the outside, like not taking in individuals, the genetic pool is going to break down.
What you see in our world is that the societies that are vehemently opposed to
globalization are the ones that don't want to be flexible. They want to be rigid; the
Osamas that want to stay in the 12th century. They don‟t want to deal with change;
they don‟t want to deal with that. They think it's going to make them disappear.

They think that their traditions will disappear just because the kids are going to
watch TV. If your children are going to give up their traditions just because they're
looking at TV it means that their traditions are not well ingrained, not well taught,
nor appreciated. Let's face it.
So the 5 here is saying here‟s a message, flexibility or death, or the threat. You can
see that in these societies anyone who wants to be flexible is considered to be
dangerous. They want rigidity, Sharia Law, it‟s so obvious. At least grow up; you
don‟t have to cut off their hands. You don't have to stone the women. Let‟s just

The 5/2
LAC Limitation 2
The 5/2s are so different. I watch them, I don‟t know that many. As a 5/1 it‟s
always fascinating to me how different they are with this 2 underneath, how different
they are. And all the things that you would expect as a 5/1 just aren‟t there. The
5/2 will vote conservatively and be guilty because it's really liberal. There is a part
of them that would really love to be flexible, but they‟re terrified of flexibility because
it releases chaos and they're terrified of the chaos, and the tribe is terrified of chaos.
It‟s like these tribes where all the parents are illiterate and their children are learning
how to read. Wow, that‟s frightening, I mean, that's real power. So these are the
kinds of people that will be very right wing in their life and near their deathbed will
reveal that all along they were a woozy, fuzzy bear. These are the kind of people
that you think they're a hard ass son of a bitch and then you hear about their
friendship with some—who is the guy in the States—Strom Thurmond who was a
Senator for like 99,000 years. He even ran in 1948 for the Presidency of the United
States on a segregation platform that blacks should actually forever be an apartheid
kind of thing.
This guy was in the U.S. Senate until he died. He was the oldest serving senator in
history of the United States. I guess he was in the Senate maybe 60 years or so.
He was in his 90s when he died. And just before he died he recognized his
illegitimate black daughter. I thought here is a classic 5/2 in this position. And she‟s
saying, because it wasn't like he fathered her and had nothing to do with her. He
had a good relationship with her, he financed her education, and they had a warm
relationship. She was saying he was fine; he was wonderful he was my daddy. And
here is this hard assed segregationist.
What a joke, but that‟s something you can expect from a 5/2. They‟re afraid of that
flexibility. Now of course, they can be called out. And like any 5 they can
universalize, but remember to universalize and have a 2nd line it makes it so difficult.
You have to be so driven, because you have no support. A 5/2 would have to go,
here is the Human Design system and they would say why, and they would say I
don‟t know. And you know how far the Human Design would have gotten.

Okay, let's get let's finish the day on a pleasant note. Let‟s talk about suicide and
depression. We get to the 32.6 Tranquility: The need to calmly face
impermanence. Everything about being a 32 is coming to grips with the fact that
you can never be secure that the tribal will survive. There is no point where you can
finally say okay we‟re safe. We built this huge wall around us and now we‟re safe,
only to find out 50 years later that the enemy has canons and knocks down the
walls. And you keep on going, okay now we‟re safe, except the enemy has
airplanes. Now we‟re safe, now the enemy has H-bombs. Now, we‟re safe, now the
enemy has is the Internet in my kid‟s room; whatever the case may be. We never
stop this damn thing.
So, everything about the 32 that wants everything to be—I want to know the value.
I don‟t want any more sales that‟s going to make this cheaper. Why don‟t you stop
here at this price? Don't change it. It‟s going to really piss me off. This is the 32.
It‟s what the 32 always wants to do. The 32 wants to say to the 1 that‟s rising up,
you‟re going to be exactly like this. You‟re going to treat me this same way even
when you go past me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they‟re so annoyed it doesn‟t turn out
that way. They don‟t like it.
It‟s why I keep saying to people don‟t think that two gates make a channel. The
channel is something else. If the 32 really understood transformation, you think it
would get depressed? It wouldn‟t get depressed. It has no idea. It thinks
everything needs to be fixed; instinct, fix it. We fix it, it‟s okay. And what I mean
by fix it is not repair, it‟s freeze it. So you have all these retros who want to freeze
their societies in the past, the back-to-Earth pioneer boo-boos.
An underlying acceptance of change that may or may not lead to tranquility, or—
when you see Pluto and Neptune doing a line, don't even read it. And if you have it,
don't pay any attention. Talk about helpless. It‟s the frying pan into the fire. It
doesn't matter which way you go, you're never going to get it. There are lines like
that, forget it. Impermanence is proof of meaninglessness—if we can‟t stay in the
12th century, what's the point? I love that—depression, delusion, and in the extreme
self-destruction. Fear engendered when change is experienced as impermanence
and the potential of depression. This is a 6th line.
The 6th line says, let there be peace because I can‟t stand the noise. And why don‟t
we just freeze everything. Let's make sure that we all just say okay, we‟ve had
enough. No more change. There are all kinds of societies like that. You go into
Pennsylvania, the Quakers, these people that are living in the 1780s and they‟re
riding buggies. If we could only stop time, if we could only stop the movement
everything would be okay. If we'd only freeze things at a set price, everything would
be okay, how clear all of that would be.

The tribe is not individual, the tribe isn‟t mutative. Mutation scares the tribe. The
32nd gate is one of the few tribal gates that gets to experience the pressure of
mutation from the outside, the circumstances around it. These are people who wake
up and realize that their village is empting out because there's no future for the
children and they commit suicide. These places that turn into ghost towns, because
the children don‟t work on the land anymore, they go to the city to get an education
and a job in the future and all those things.
You can only calmly face impermanence if you‟re surrendered. There is no other
way. 32.6s have very deep concerns in their relationships. And most of it is about
whether or not the relationship can be permanent, whether or not the way in which
the relationship works can be permanent. These are people who say I wish it was
like in the first year when we were together. That was so perfect. Can‟t we go back
to that? Can‟t we rediscover that? That really worked. There is this sense in the
32.6 that the turning of the wheel only brings more problems. It never brings
anything else. And the tribe hates problems.

When you get to the 6/3 you have people that can really lose it very early in life. If
they can manage to make it to their post-Saturn phase, the roof phase, these are
people that you pat them on the back and you tell them well done, you did a good
job. Because when you move here and you move from the 32 and you go into the
50th gate the moment that you're moving towards that 50th gate you‟re going to have
to face the fact that there are underlying laws that govern everything. There are
laws that govern the way in which we deal with the other. And only in the 50th gate
can you sense that the Spleen as a whole has an understanding of the other. When
you fuse the instinct, the intuition and the taste, you bring it together in the 50 you
get to see something. Change is built into the law. As a matter of fact, if there is no
change there is no development of intelligence.
The failure of the tribe, the only failure of the tribe is that it does not embrace
change. The joke is that the death of the tribe is also the embrace of change.
There‟s something to contemplate about the dilemma that we face in our world now,
where tribes are under deep pressure, and we are getting to feel the violent reaction
to that. The tribe understands something as well; if you keep on adapting eventually
you become collective. Somewhere down the road you eventually become collective.
All tribes recognize that as they embrace change.
So in fact, there is a real fear in the tribe of extinction. That‟s why you have tribes—
you have a lot of that in Spain where they desperately are trying to hold onto their
linguistic territorial integrity because they can see the collective is pulling their
children into a much larger realm. For me, globalization is evidence of the attempt
that's taking place in the filtering of consciousness to try to find some whole, to try
to find that so-called one, that global village, that integrated reality, that non-

Introduction
In dealing with the 50th gate we‟re dealing with a very special gate. It‟s interesting
to see that in the context of what we call intelligence is and the necessity for what
we call law that all of this is rooted in the Quarter of Duality. In other words, the
only reason that we have law is that we have a duality. If we didn't have a duality
there would be no need for law. And the moment that we have duality there are
those that want laws and accept laws, and there are those that hate laws and reject
laws, because we are in a duality.
So, the 50th gate is a fascinating gate. It's one of those mystical gates. It‟s the
mystical gate of the WA. It is in fact, the gate out of which the streams of
intelligence—taste, intuition, instinct—originated. So when we're dealing with The
Cauldron we are dealing with something special. It is technically the gate of values.
And you can see that values is fundamentally a dualistic thing.
Everything about this Quarter of Duality is to see how ingrained in our process
duality really is. And how difficult it is to bridge it, which is why we end up with laws
and we end up with out of law more—it‟s a Catch-22, however you want to look at
that—that intelligence itself leads us to the establishment of law as the only way in
which we can have relationships that will survive the very difficulty of having
relationships.
Because this is a fundamentally tribal gate; that the law itself becomes the bedrock
of the way in which the tribe and the community preserve their young. And after all,
the channel 50/27 is the Channel of Preservation. If you look at mammalian design
you'll see that the 50/27 is actually about the herding instinct. In the mammal the
50/27 is what is sexual. They have no 59/6. It is very much human emotional
sexuality. But here when you're looking at the 50/27 there is a fundamental herding
instinct at work.
In other words, one of the things about the whole nourishment of the tribe is that
the tribe is nourished primarily through having the security of the herd as protection.
It's interesting that the way in which we‟re designed genetically to preserve our
young and nourish them until they are mature enough to be able to survive on their
own is that we herd them together, and yet the moment we herd them together
they‟re wild little bastards. You herd them together so you‟ve got to immediately
create laws. It's so interesting that the deepest concern of preservation is for the
awakening of intelligence in the young.

The 1/3
So, we have the Right Angle Cross of Laws and in fact what we know is that this is
the beginning of all law. If you look at the arms of the Cross of Law that we
examined in the earlier quarters you will see that they are laws very much for their
own. The laws of the mind, the laws of form; you can't do much about fighting
against Pythagoras. The moment you get to Duality, the moment you step in there
law is something totally different
and it's the bedrock of how we live
in the maya because the maya is
this vast dualism. So, law is always
there to try to find some way to find
security in the “this and that” world.
So here are the true lawgivers.
They‟re the ones that set the
framework upon which everything
that we‟re going to do in our society
depends.
The 1/3 is The Immigrant. It's a
very beautiful line. It says: The
humbleness of origin that benefits
rather than restricts destiny.
Obviously that could be
misconstrued in many ways.
Humbleness doesn't necessarily
equate with poverty. And so many
people will assume that when they
read a line like this. What it's really about is that the law, because it is so deeply
connected to our intelligence, that at its very deepest level the law recognizes that it,
too, must somehow become aware. There is a difference between mundane law of
trials and juries, and the laws of awareness that recognize choicelessness at which
point punishment is moot.
In other words, there is a movement here, this humbleness, and this movement
benefits destiny. In other words, we start off with very, very primitive laws, very
basic laws for preservation. And it's: The desire to be effective and successful that
builds on its most fundamental strengths while it refines its nature. This refining of
nature really is the core of where intelligence comes from. To understand that the
splenic system is our only connection to the mammalian roots that we have
biologically, and to see very clearly that the way in which that intelligence is
expressed is the sophistication of a mammal in being able to devise strategies for

security and in order to feed itself. The more complex the strategy, the more
evident the intelligence.
When you get to Homo sapiens you can see that our strategies are incredibly
sophisticated. This is the refinement process. And in the end these very strategies
that have bubbled into what we call the intelligent level of consciousness today, if
you really strip it of the gloss what you get to is simply an upgrade on basic survival
techniques. That's all it is, just an upgrade. We‟re still in the same game.
It's like people were so impressed that we could send a spaceship to the Moon. But
then again, it really is only the extension of David bringing down Goliath. He just
threw a damn stone. The fact that it takes vast technologies and all kinds of
evolutionary consciousness to get a point that we can use gas burning to fire
something with gyroscopes and get it to hit the Moon is only an extension of
throwing a rock. As a matter of fact, the very thing that goes to the Moon is actually
based on what was designed to be a weapon. Missiles are basically just fast stones
that unfortunately have real impact.
So, one of the things to understand about the law is that the law starts off being
primitive and must be refined. And nobody knows that better than a 1/3, because a
1/3 is going to discover right away that law is not perfect. Oh, do they make good
lawyers. You want a lawyer that is going to find a loophole, give me someone on
this cross with a 1/3 and particularly here. It‟s like they find out right away where
the cracks are in the law. And either they're going to take advantage of those
cracks, or they‟re going to scream bloody murder about them and try to cover them
up.
It can be very important to get to a point where the laws that you see are honored
around you are an embarrassment to you. This is the determent of this line. In
other words, one of the things about law is that primitive law can lead to intellectual
embarrassment. If the law is so primitive that it does not serve the evolved level of
intelligence, it is automatically going to lead to that embarrassment and again the
need to refine it. So there is a beauty here of the 1/3 in that it‟s going to go through
this process of finding out where the cracks are in the law. And we know very well
that that's going to lead to disillusionment, and in leading to disillusionment it
becomes a personal suffering being martyred by what are unrealistic primitive laws.
There is an anarchist in there; never forget it. And here in the 50th gate the

The 1/4
RAC Laws 3
If you‟re a 1/4 and you come in on this cross you take the law of the dominant
influence in your life and you carry it forward. I would really love to say all kinds of
wonderful things about 1/4s, but unfortunately it's so rare that a 1/4 is their own
1/4, what it takes to decondition them. Again, we‟re dealing with a very important
cog in the wheel, this movement between the 1/3 and the 2/4.
I said from the beginning that Human Design is for children. One of the best things
that you can do is that in looking at any of the designs of anyone that you work with
if they‟re a parent and you see their children's charts, if you come across a 1/4 you
make sure that that parent understands what kind of an incredible responsibility.
It's the most difficult parental responsibility we have, is to be the parent of a 1/4
because in most other cases if the parent is not-self and they a least deal with the
child correctly it works. The not-self parent who has a 1/4 child, you have a 1/4
that's going to bring out as a foundation whatever it gets from that not-self.
The greatest shock for me in my development as a teacher is that fortunately I have
not spent my life teaching adults. I spent many, many years teaching children. And
what fascinated me were situations where a 12-year-old would be taking a political
position that truly was beyond their grasp, or taking a social commentary position in
which they had no real grounding. And I suddenly realized that my own kids, what
were they saying in the classroom. It was very strange me. It happened to me here
when I was on the island and I was teaching in a little country school here. As I
began to teach the children I began to meet their parents who eventually became
my friends. So, I suddenly kept getting these incredible flashes of the political social
philosophies of the parents being regurgitated by the children.
Think about a 1/4, a 1/3 will reject those kinds of things. A 1/3 will have no problem
rejecting its parent‟s social political stand. No problem at all. As a matter of fact,
feel martyred that they don't appreciate that. But the 1/4 child is determined to
carry on that because their interest is not finding out whether the foundation is solid
or not. Their research, their investigation is how they influence the other. This is
the difficulty with the 1/4.
So a 1/4 on this cross, their way to refinement or not is absolutely determined by
their parents. This law is right. It will always be right. It's never going to change.
So, the child grows up saying this law is right. It's absolutely right. It's never going
to be changed and let me tell you why, because I can influence you. I know how
powerful 1/4s are, which is why I have this concern, because they do have the ability
to come up with the data. They‟re 1s, after all. And because they have this focus
from the unconscious of getting the information across, unless there's something in
their life that says to them, look, don't just be a parrot. This is the disease of the

The 2/4
RAC Laws 3
Determination: The strength of purpose that can enjoy overcoming adversity to
achieve its goals, or discomfort with adversity; a basic binary. If you can't explain
why a law is necessary you can only fight for it in terms of determination and belief.
In Western societies we are often confronted with the fact that politicians think that
we need a law for something that none of us ever thought we needed a law for.
These things happen all the time. It's part of the Orwellian consciousness of modern
bureaucracies to create absolutely absurd laws. And then we all end up having to
deal with them.
It's very difficult in ways to explain why the law is necessary. Whom does the law
serve? And one of the most difficult things about the 2/4s is that 2/4s as
missionaries have an enormous capacity once called to convince people of the need
for a law that may or may not turn out to be of value to society. Think about the 2,
think about it in this context. Somebody is looking at that 2 and what they say is
you really know what we need. You know what law we need. You know what we
need in order to keep everything together.
This doesn't mean that this is a law that advances our evolutionary process in terms
of our consciousness or intelligence. In no other place other than the 6th gate and
the 5th gate, no other place do you have hexagrams operating in such tight binaries.
The 1st and 2nd lines are connected to the instinctive process. They're a very tight
binary. And the same thing is true for the 3rd and the 4th lines, and the 5th and the
6th lines. One of the things to see about the 1 and the 2 is that they‟re both
primitive in a way that instinct is primitive. One is willing through investigation to
refine; the other is only interested in imposing the law. Nothing else; just to
maintain law. There is no refinement here. As a matter of fact, there is the attempt
to propagandize, the attempt to get others to accept the law.
The White Book lines, when you‟re looking at the lines of the Rave I‟Ching Every
single line has is a dual description; the original description that was written in the
original Rave I‟Ching and then a description that was written in The Book of Letters,
which was called the White Book. And you can see this aspect of the line because
it's always italicized. For the exalted you have: The strength derived from
maintaining one's values in the face of opposition or conditioning. In other words,
whether people are against you are not, whether the times have changed or not,
we‟re still going to follow Sharia Law. It doesn't matter. It doesn‟t matter that
everything has changed around us.
The other side of that is: A lack of strength where values are threatened by
opposition or conditioning. And there's so much fear here. But what is the fear?

The fear of the 50th at the mundane level is called the fear of taking responsibility,
the fear of responsibility. What law really is is a way of depersonalizing
responsibility. We do that all the time when we send our children to school. We give
up our responsibility to train them, to educate them. And we give somebody else
the authority to do that based on a law.
The 50th gate is where schools are built. There are all kinds of schools built here.
You can see here that this is a very, very primitive basic education, the most basic
education. And you can also see in the 1st and 2nd line of the laws that without the
3rd line what you're going end up with because of the 4s is that you're going to end
up with simply the primitive law being very powerfully disseminated so that it
becomes the foundation that becomes very difficult to break.
It also tells you something about the nature of law. The foundation of all law is
tribal. All law is tribal. It‟s why the collective and the tribe have this hands-on-each-
other's-throat process that they‟re dealing with. That 2nd line democracy, the ones
that don't vote are the ones that don't want to change the law because it‟s too much
trouble to change the law because you have to go out and vote. If the law that was
good enough for my father is good enough for my son. Why should I come out of
the house and go to all the trouble to vote. I may not even win.
You have to see that the not-self of the 2/4 is really kind of spooky because
underneath you have a 4th line and we know one of the themes of the 4th line, the
7.4, is The Abdicator. To be a hermit abdicator tells you about their commitment to
society. And if you have a 2/4 not-self hermit abdicator who is on the Cross of Laws,
come on now, they‟re not interested in amendments. They don‟t want to add any
corollaries; they don‟t want to make any exceptions. And eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth; eye for an eye, tooth for tooth for thousands of years.
Every time you go into a theater and the hero finally gets the villain and you have
your catharsis you‟re right in line with this law: an eye for an eye; a tooth for a
tooth. You come in as a 2/4 and you learn eye for an eye—well, ok. If they want to
change that, let them change that. I‟m very Democratic.
The difficulty here is that when you call this 2/4, it‟s not like you're waking them up
to change the law. You're not. You‟re waking them up to disseminate the law in an
even a more powerful way than before and influence even more people. There are
two kinds of missionaries. There is the dedicated missionary that can only help and
serve the common good, however fallible they may be. And there are missionaries
of ignorance and evil. They‟re dangerous creatures. These are the ones that say all
these new laws are garbage, let's go back to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth; very clean, very straightforward, very quiet, very obedient society.
Singapore got rid of bad behavior by whipping people all the time. After enough
people were whipped, you didn't really want to mess around. This is 1-2 law. As I
said, let us thank our lucky stars that there's a 1/3 at the beginning, because it‟s not
so much that the 1/3 wants to replace the law. It recognizes when it's not right, and
it breeds the anarchy that ultimately can lead down the line to these primitive laws
being changed. I want you to understand something. Everybody who carries any

tribal activation in their design, this is their law. I don‟t care how sophisticated you
think you are, unless you're totally devoid of tribal activations, and even then you
get it all the time, you have to see that this is part of us. We are many laws. And
it's a battle inside of us what wins.
The tribe cannot function any other way. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; it
doesn‟t know any other way. And it's not like it's going to wake up and stop being a
tribe. We‟re not going to get rid of this circuitry. And then you begin to see the
dilemma. You can see tribal law when it comes to Duality. It is very, very rigid,
everything from female circumcision, these rigid laws of ownership that chattel most
women are to their men, the way in which religion has created this wrap around the
bond, the laws that are all built into that.
In some societies committing adultery is sexy and in others it's a death sentence.
And you have to see that the tribal law is alive and well. It's not going away. That's
why synthesis is everything. We have to accept the eye for an eye in each of us.
We are killer monkeys. We are just killer monkeys, these bodies, these vehicles.

The 2/5
RAC Laws 3
The 2/5 begins the process of challenge, deep challenge to the primitive law. It is
the bridge to the 3-4 and the 3-4 carries with it what we call intuition. Remember
this is where intuition is sourced. The 5 obviously is heretical. There is always the
possibility of being called to the heresy. And unfortunately, 2/5s have learned that
rather than the 5/1 which normally carries the burden of heresy, that they are the
ones that get punished the most for challenging the primitive law.
Now, we already know that the 2/5s are reticent. Basically what they do is they
break the law in the privacy of their own home. And because they're a democrat
they will allow the outside to be very repressive as long as they can be behind closed
blinds and be able to break the law in their own environment. But every once in a
while they get caught, and it‟s when they get caught, when they're on their way to
another prison, not the one of their own construct, but the one that will be provided,
they become living symbols of the absurdity of the law.
It‟s the kind of thing that has taken place in the drug culture for many years. You
get some actor who's got glaucoma and he wants marijuana in order to be able to
get rid of his glaucoma and he gets busted for marijuana and suddenly he becomes a
wonderful spokesperson on his way to jail to let everybody know how absurd
primitive laws can be. We have this all the time in many, many different ways, but
they‟re the ones that get punished. They‟re the ones you don't expect to suddenly
be pulled out and say this is not right. You don't have to cut off my head for this. I
was just shoplifting. There must be another way to punish me than to cut off my
head. It really doesn‟t make sense. It‟s a nice place to be a 2/5.

In this day and age, you have the heresy blogs. There is so much anger directed at
primitive law or not directed at it, but as a result of it on both sides.
Fundamentalism is lost in looking for this law. And here we are, we‟re in the 5,
remember we‟re on the plane of the 5. That's the advantage of 2/5s today because
there is a harmony to the fact that we need vast collective laws. That‟s what the 5

The 3/5
RAC Laws 3
Adaptability; again here, what you're really getting is the taste of what happens
when the individual emerges with enough strength to challenge the tribe; the freak
in the family. The Moon exalted, that when unable to make it alone will naturally
aligned itself with nurturing and protective forces; the awareness that to maintain
one's principles and values the support of others is necessary. Now here, the
politicization of law begins here. In other words, the Magna Carta, if you like, all of a
sudden those that are serving beneath the law rise up and challenge not the right to
have a law, not the need for laws, but the fact that they must also be ready to
support the law and support the goals of the law.
It's a very interesting position to see the 3/5. Normally what we look at in the 3/5 is
a lot of chaos. A 3rd line personality goes through its trial and error can feel very
much like it‟s ill-equipped and can feel very much like it's a failure. There is all this
protection on its 5 that it‟s going to be the best of everything, and of course it means
when it does make a mistake that small molehill turns into this enormous mountain.
However, this line also carries a fundamental theme, and it's the theme of what is at
the heart of intuition. It is this adaptability, this moment-by-moment mutative
capacity to change, to change with the times. Because the law is caught up with the
dissemination of intelligence sooner or later intelligence is going to reject the
primitive law. This is one of the jokes. It's just the way that it works
What you see in our history is as the field broaden for access to reading and writing
and books, the Gutenberg revolution, the printed book, even though it was the damn
Bible, everybody at least had a chance to begin the process of personally identifying
with the word. There was an enormous transition that took place that as soon as
you educated people, as soon as that went beyond a certain level, boom you have an
explosion. It's just an explosion.
So, here what you have is the recognition that intelligence is going to govern law
that you can't just have primitive law, because every family has a black sheep. It‟s
why the tribe loves individuals. I don‟t know about you, folks, unless you're a single
child you know that families always have a black sheep. They always have the weird
one, most of you are black sheep of your families and you know it. I'm the great
black sheep of my family. I love it. And you have to see that the tribe actually loves
that. They don't like it, but it is always evidence that there's something in the
genetic material that's really alive and different. That's why the individual is always

in some ways or another welcome to the tribe, as long as they become tribal, as long
as they accept being tribal.
So, what you're looking at here is that the individual has a relationship with the tribe
that the tribe could never have with the collective. So the individual is able to
influence the tribe in that way. To maintain one's principles and values the support
of others is necessary. All this is saying is we can't afford to have laws in which the
majority doesn't agree with them. And of course, what I mean by the politics of law
is that you can see now in modern Western democracies that laws are basically now
being written for the preferences of majorities. That's what democracy is. You have
laws being written for the preferences of majorities. And what's really bizarre is that
in most democracies where only half of the population votes, the laws that are being
established or not by majorities in all, but they're actually being established by about
30% of the potential voting population.
Nonetheless, you can see how we can be manipulated by the 3/5 as well. In other
words, that the laws that this 30% can pull and force upon the rest of the 70%
creates problems. Most democracies, if they do not balance between left and right,
eventually get to a point of schism, because you end up with laws that have been
established that only serve a very limited portion of the society and in that it leads to
anarchy. And here we have a 3rd line anarchy theme.
The detriment is: A resentment when its natural mental gifts are ignored and is
forced to curry favor in order to survive. All you have to think about the Soviet
Union and communism to really understand what that means and how difficult it is.
The difficulty with the 3/5 is that it's so easy for the laws that they think that are
necessary is their very source of failure and embarrassment. Individuality, dealing
with the 5th line is seeking a way to avoid paranoia. And ultimately where the
anarchist ends up going is to libertarianism where there really basically isn't any law
and there basically isn't any government. And of course, that's far too radical; it's
just far too radical.
So, one of the things is that at the same time that the 3/5 is going to start this
process of bringing in heresy to the primitive law, you don't have to cut off their
hand, you don't have to poke out their eyes, you don't have to disembowel them in a
public square, all this kind of stuff. It‟s like the heresy that you could actually
educate them, that you could see that they were just individuals with problems, that
you can help them and all of this stuff. But at the same time, within the 3/5 is also
the fact that in the end they don't like the law. And yet, they‟re on the Cross of
Laws, and they don‟t like the law. So they become good prosecuting attorneys.
They savaged the law. And I don't mean that they necessarily become lawyers. In
fact, that's the way they're going to be as beings. They will know how to savage the
law.
I have a friend like that. He‟s an incredible attorney. He has no respect for the law.
He understands the structure, but it's so obvious to me that law on the surface that
we deal with is just a construct of the illusion. It doesn't govern anything, other
than the illusion within the illusion.

Remember that all laws are based on coming to grips with duality, we‟re here in
Duality. The 50th gate is here to show us the way by giving us constructs that will
allow us to survive, by educating us by providing these kinds of laws including laws
that bind us together. And by herding us together into groups that we will find
security and we will find harmony. It‟s not very personal, the way that the 50 looks
at duality. The 50 looks at duality and says, yes, very nice, but I'm much happier
when they're all herded together and they are all obeying the law. And the law itself
is a duality. There is obeying the law did not obeying the law.
The 3/6s are going to be quite radical here. They know very deeply that the law is
flawed. They're going to be punished early in their life by the vagaries of the law.
They‟re going to be much more anarchistic than anything else. Whether or not they
can be constructive will have to do with how much they've suffered. There are so
many people that spend so much of their life yelling at the law. Fighting City Hall,
they say.
I can‟t stand the law. My father wanted me to be a lawyer and I thought, are you
mad. What a thing. With the knowledge that I have, with the awareness that I have
now, it‟s so funny. It really is because you see how little respect the program has for
killer monkeys. The law is the ring in the nose. You can take the whole herd; they
all have rings in their noses. They all have strings. You just pull them all along.
I've broken the law all my life. I‟ve broken the laws of nature by coming early and
surviving, and ever since I‟ve been breaking the law. One of the things that I enjoy
most about my lifelong joy in smoking hashish is that in most places in the world it‟s
against the law. I got a T-shirt yesterday from a friend of mine in America. What it
says on the front is “Bad Boy” and I thought yes, how sweet. That‟s the anarchist in
me. The anarchist in me says what a ridiculous thing to do. Look at all these drunk
people killing people. I don't see anybody there smashing bottles. The world is
plagued by this drug of alcohol. It‟s absolutely disgusting.
You have 55,000 people a year killed on the highways in America by people who
have a high alcohol level in their body. That's more than all the men that died in
Vietnam. And then they take some 50-year-old ex-hippie who is smoking a joint of
marijuana and they put them in prison as the devil incarnate. When I see laws like
that, the anarchist in me goes (sound). I couldn‟t stand living in America for that
reason. People are so paranoid.

frequency is the frequency of energy exchange, which is money. There is no other
frequency. In America the person who grew it was terrified. The person who drove

Corruption; I love this line. Thank God there are corrupt judges. And I don't mean
that in the negative, they exist too. I mean that in the most positive sense of what
this can mean. In other words, if you look at the harmony from the 1 to the 4, the 4
has to deliver the primitive law. Think about that. Once you get to the upper
trigram here, you really are seeing very powerful influences in the way in which we
live out the law. And the 4 is the spokesperson. You could say that they‟re the
judge.
One of the things that we know is that judges are empowered with a certain degree
of latitude in the way in which they are going to sentence or not based on the
evidence they receive. The corrupt judge, despite the line that says lack of enriching
values, because again most of these lines are truly written for the not-self, that the
thing that is so beautiful about the corrupt judge is that the corrupt judge says I
can‟t cut off this person's hand for this. I‟ll take off one finger. One finger, okay?
Okay, one finger. These can be very, very conservative judges.
After all, they are the harmony to the 1. Yet, at the same time, there‟s something
individual that flows through them. There‟s an intuition about whether the person
whose hand is going to be cut off is a habitual thief or if it's really somebody who out
of circumstance, dire poverty, a child that's hungry, there is this slight freakiness in
this that says, okay, it‟s not really the same thing. We don't have to apply this
equally to everyone. And that opens the whole can of worms. We‟re finally going to
get out of the law. The 4/6 is the end of that.
So the very best you get on the right Angle Cross of Laws where the laws are
established the 50th gate is that you get to the 4/6 and the 4/6 says, I‟m a generous
man—one finger. And the victim is going, oh, thank you. I love it. Progress, that‟s
progress. You don‟t execute them; you lock them away in a box.
I love this line, and it‟s Saturnian, it‟s really dark. The malefic gift of turning inferior
values into material success; given this difficult position, Saturn’s exaltation is that
its actions are limited to selfishness and unsavoriness rather than criminality. The
capacity to maintain one's strength despite inferior values. The other side: The

potential disregard of values that may lead to corruption or the breakdown of the
defense system.
This is the one that's really the most interesting. The moment that the not-self
genetically is predisposed to control the law they will be corrupt. Please understand
that. If you have somebody on the Cross of Laws and they are a 4/6 they are
naturally corruptible. There‟s not much you can do about that. Not only that, but
they have the ability to be able to truly break down the other's defense system.
Remember this capacity to lessen the law. The fact that you're only cutting off the
finger, within the context of what you're doing, within the moment of that intuition it
all seems correct. But there are going to be others later who are going to look at
that, and remember, you‟re dealing with the 4, it‟s very influential, and they‟re going
to say, well, if you cut off a finger, then why do you have to cut anything off. Once
you go there, you can go anywhere. It's the beginning of corrupting the whole
system.
We can see what happens is that the moment that, for example, again, it‟s a classic
example. If you look at Eastern Europe, it‟s what happened when the wall came
down. You had very primitive laws that were in place. And at the moment those
primitive laws disappeared and there was an attempt to layer in this transition to
collective law you had gangsterism and hooliganism and all of those things at a level
that had never, ever existed before, because once you open the door, wow are
people going to jump through, because we are basically unaware and we are
basically not-self and we do not have that capacity necessarily.
There are so many people in those societies that want the old laws back. Give them
an inch, give them a mile; isn‟t that what they say? And this is the whole thing
about the 4 and its corruption even when it‟s going something good in terms of the
defense system as a whole, it may be doing something that corrupts the whole
system, because once you take away that absolute power, then everything begins to
break out and you have to have new kinds of laws that the 4/6 is not capable of,
even though they would like to be.
There is a great illusion in the 4/6 and the illusion is that it's a left angle. And it's
not. Yes, it‟s upper trigram. There's no question that's unusual, both lines, but
again, it's not left angle. It really does not connect well to the other. And in
essence, it doesn't really understand where to find a law that will be fair to everyone,
instead of the law being—well, let me change it slightly, because the moment it's let
me change it slightly there is no law anymore and this is the corruption.
Now it is the immune system. If you have this gate, if you‟re not living correctly as
yourself, you‟re going to end up with real problems in your immune system. You can
have an immune system that just shuts down. That is just the surface biological
phenomenon that‟s here in this.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Values
 3  41
The 4/1
When we move to the left angle we get away from this very powerful unconscious of
the 56/60. And of course we shift to the 41-31. Wherever you see a cross with the
41st gate you know that there is something new in the shifting. The 41st gate is a
start codon. When the Sun goes in the 41st gate we begin our rave year. The 41st
gate is an initiating point in the cycle of human experience. So, people who carry
the 41 in their cross, wherever it is because there are many variations, inherent in
their incarnation purpose is something new. That is, an experiential process that is
new or potentially new.
And it‟s very important here that
when you're looking at this
movement you can see that here in
this hexagram in the cross
movement, just looking at the
keynotes, you can see basically what
happens. The law becomes values
becomes wishes. From law you get
to, all right put that aside, you get
values, very quick put that aside,
what do we really want. And this is
very important for our development,
particularly our spiritual
development.
So we have the Juxtaposition Cross
of Values. We have the 41 and the
31. Obviously, the 31, influential; it
is, after all, the gate of influence. It
is the expression of leadership. So you have the beginning of the experiential way.
You have the pressure to feel. The law has no feelings. And the 4/6 it can almost
sense that what‟s making it change the law is not logic, but a feeling. The law was
never designed to be emotional. The law is splenic. The splenic is bang; judgment
now, off with their heads.
But emotions are different. They have an entirely different quality. So, when you're
looking at the 41st gate, what you‟re seeing in the 41st gate is that it's not emotional,
but it brings the pressure to feel. If you don't feel, you can‟t have the right
experience. And here you can see what the values are all about. The values are
about that you can only get to the values through feeling. And of course, this
corrupts the whole splenic system, because to seek out the emotions for the law is to

overwhelm the Spleen, totally. And emotional law can be frightening; mob
vengeance, the lynch mob.
It‟s not like if you run away from the concretized splenic law and you start looking
for emotion that the values are going to be anymore just. They're not. They‟re
going to be trying to appeal to the emotional being, to appeal to emotionality. It‟s
what Hitler did. What any dictator basically does in order to be able to claim power.
They appeal to the emotionality. Life has been terrible for you, you've been
oppressed, you‟ve been cut out and disenfranchised, and I will save you. I feel for
you. I know you‟re suffering, my people. What a trip. It‟s so easy to be dictator.

The 5/1
The Left Angle Cross of Wishes; there are only two kinds of them. There are the
wishes out of the 3 that says may there please be order. And here it‟s, is there not
some greater law for all of us?
Consistency; the 5/1: The disciplined and natural conservatism to avoid
unnecessary change; the conservative awareness that basic principles should not be
abandoned casually. When
effectively stimulated, though, the
drive to rebel against basic
principles. All right, we have a
Saturnian potential heresy and
we've got a Martian heresy. And
this is about: When continuity has
brought success, it should not be
tampered with. But remember
something, this is a blue line. Don't
interpret this as something that you
have at the beginning. You don't.
So, what happens to these beings is
that because of transference, they
will follow the 2nd line phenomena.
In other words, what they're going
to deal with is that they're going to
begin with seeing the power of
maintaining the conservative
principles. Now, they may see those
principles as they have been altered by the 4th line right angle process, but it's not to
say that they‟re born heretical, that they‟re born to go against the law.

Now, particularly in the 5/1 because you‟re dealing with an unconscious that is going
to explore things, going to investigate them, that the inherent practicality of the 5
can be satisfied by basic principles, but here is the criteria: when continuity, if
continuity has brought success. In other words, only when you actually get to see
that the basic principles that you‟ve been raised to have brought success for you,
only then would you stay with them, only then.
So, one of the things about the heresy here are at the 5/1 is that the moment they
see that the basic principles are not correct that‟s the moment when they take on
their role as a heretic. That's when they go out there and say I wish we had a better
way. I know that you're dreaming. Remember that the 5th line is the plane where
we are now, the way the law is expressed now as a collective process. This is where
we are now, trying to remain consistent on basic principles with all the variations
around them.
We're already beginning to see that certain laws for societies bring greater success
than others. And it's only when the laws prove not to be successful that we have
those who rise up and say, this law needs to be eliminated or changed. What we
have now is that we have the goal at the very beginning of the hexagram.
Remember that the 1 and the 5 have a profound relationship to each other. The 1 is
the foundation, the 5 is the hope for the future. It‟s the hope of what that hexagram
can be in its evolutionary process. The refinement of the 1 is that what you see is
that this is a heresy of refinements. In other words, constantly trying to eliminate
those laws that are not universal principles, and hopefully getting to a place where
we have universal laws.
I am a carrier as a 5/1 Clarion of universal law. I call it the Human Design System.
It‟s a universal law. This is the kind of thing where you say, all right; let us see what
the true law is. And all of the true spirituality that has arisen over the last 150 years
has been the search for the law. Crowley's Book of the Law, all these principles of
law that you find in the Theosophical structure that the way in which mysticism
evolved in the 20th century, all of that is about finding universal principles.
The same thing is true in the scientific community. That in the scientific community
the same process is taking place. Laws are being checked to see if they are truly
correct and thus successful and thus can be relied on so that we have a structure
that really works. My philosophy is that there is only one law and it is your law. It
can‟t be anything else; one law, your law. The teaching ultimately of the 5/1 is that
the ultimate universal principle is that each of us is unique and in that being unique
each of us are our own authorities, and therefore we are a law unto ourselves.

even there, because they don't like being seen through that 2nd unconscious. They
don't like the feeling of being visible to the other any time that the other wants.
Most not-selves through our 5/2s will simply accept the laws as they are, and any
law that needs to be broken they will break it privately. There is a basic
conservatism to the 5 that you can see you here. There has to be. It's like being a
general. You cannot be an avant-garde general. It doesn't work. There are certain
basic principles that have to be there. You can have nuances. But one of the things
to see about heresy is that heresy only works when there are basic principles
involved that are not violated, that all heresy is simply an evolution based on a solid
foundation over the various steps that have taken place in the structure.

LAC Wishes 2
Leadership: The gift in a position of power—it means you have to be there, you
have to get there, you have to have it—to maintain harmony even in severity; the
strength to maintain one's values with vigor and continue to have harmonic
relationships with others, or inherent moodiness, the strength to maintain one’s
values, but at the expense of harmonic relationships. Oh how classic a 6th line this
is. This is where the theme of leadership comes from when we talk about the 6th
line. It‟s right here. This is its keynote, and that every 6th line being has an
opportunity in its life to be a true leader. And who does it lead? Itself; it‟s not
leading anybody else.
Being a role model is not the same as being a trainer or a teacher or a messenger or
any of those things. A role model as the channel of the creative role model
expresses, a role model is alone. Period. You‟re something to be experienced;
nothing more, nothing less. And of course, this is the ultimate goal of the 6th line
experience is that when you get to the Kironian stage of your life that you're able to
enter into a life in which you simply are. This is being an example.
The severity that is here, the position of power that is here, the power is to be your
own authority. When you're your own authority you can be very severe, you know
that. Check me out. When you are your authority you can be very severe. And I
will not cut off my own hand. I am my own law. You don't like that, tough. I am
my own law.
Until we get to that place where everybody resonates to that, this is the 6th line
phase that comes in the great individual global cycle that's emerging in 2027. We‟re
not going to be in this 40/37 community bargain soup. We‟re not going to have all
this collective focus on collective programs on skills and institutions. We‟re not going
to have all that. We‟re going to have a rigidly, rigidly, rigidly, rigidly individual global
cycle where everybody's going to be on their own. It doesn‟t matter was in the air.
It‟s only the 6th line that is taking us there.

When you get to the 6/3, what a thing to look at. I love the 28th gate, but it isn't

universal principle of the law is. Even if I translated it on a mundane level, I was
created in the image of God. Therefore, I am God; therefore, I am my own God.
You can get to this universal principle of saying, here is this genetic matrix. Nobody
else is going to function or filter this way. I am unique. I can be my own authority,
make my own decisions. All of that is great and then the 6/3 is looking over there
and it sees the 28, and the 28 is looking back at the 6/3 and it's saying, yeah, that‟s
nice, but what's it for? What's life for? I don‟t care about what the law is. I don't
even care if I find my old law. What's the point? What is the point?

A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
There is only one gate in this quarter that knows anything about relationship; the
28th gate, Preponderance of the Great. The 28th gate has a power that is very
extraordinary. In some ways, it shares it with the 38 because of their intrinsic
relationship in the channel of Struggle. I have told you that, and this is long-
established knowledge in Human Design that because of the nature of integration
because integration basically involves gates that are in three different circuits—
Centering Circuit, Integration channels and the Individual Circuit—that the 57th gate
turns away from looking towards the 34, the 10 or the 20 for an answer and turns
around and looks for the 28.
What we learn in splenic sexuality, that is, the themes of caring, that the 57th gate
will only stop caring for itself only in the presence of either the 28 or 38, only then
will it begin to care about the other. In other words, it actually has no natural
tendency to not only not care for the other, but not be concerned about the other or
its circumstances. The moment the 28 comes it's much more powerful than the 38
in the sense that it is an awareness. This is the fear of death. This is the fear of life
without purpose. And to understand the channel of Struggle is to recognize that the
channel the Struggle is about one thing and one thing only, there is no point being
here unless we have a purpose. There's no point doing anything unless we have a
purpose. There is no point in having laws unless we have a purpose. There is no
point in having law or love or anything else, unless there's a purpose. What is the
purpose?
The 28th gate and the 55th gate are both about spirit. One is emotional spirit, one is
splenic spirit. The mammalian spleen simply accepts that just being is purpose
enough, no neo-cortex ultimately to raise these questions. And yet, in the human
dynamic, the moment that the 28th gate is integrated into the bodygraph, purpose
becomes a universal mutated principle of being. But it‟s something else.
I love that line: The transitory of power and influence. Sic transit gloria mundi, this
is the great line of all things shall pass. The 28th gate is part of a projected channel.
It knows that, in its own way. It knows that purpose is not something that it can
ever find itself. It knows that. That is what it actually knows. It‟s why you begin
with preparation.

The 1/3
The Right Angle Cross of the Unexpected and this is the unexpected. You go through
the whole Quarter of Duality with all this mushy tribe and collective stickiness none
of them can do anything with the relationship business. And then you get to the 28th
gate that everybody would figure would be a problem—struggle, the fighter, risk
taking. The 57th gate and the 28th
gate have a relationship, they have
an extraordinary relationship. They
absolutely need each other. The 57th
gate would never be able to fulfill its
genetic responsibilities without in one
way or another having some bonding
or relationship. After all, even if you
come into the world as pure
Integration like me and you don‟t
have a 59/6 and you‟re non-
emotional and you‟re non-sacral
doesn't mean your genes aren't
saying have more. I‟ve had three.
They say have more anyway. It's not
like I can go to the Danish sperm
bank to do it that way, but in most
cases it will mean I have to have a
person with me.
So, one of the things about the 57 is
that the 57 needs to find love even though it doesn't know what it is or where it is.
It just knows that somewhere along the line there must be a partner for it. And then
a 28 comes along. And it's not like the 28 is only interested in that relationship. I'm
not hooking up with you so that I'm going to have a child with you, you idiot, that‟s
over there on the other side of the chart. However, through you, because you're the
way, through you I can find my purpose. And through me you can find yours.
Here you have the root of love. And here you have the most beautiful part of what
empowerment is. This is where individual relationships can only find love. And the
answer that the individual comes up with is, it‟s not about finding a way to blend
with your partner and become one, but it's about mutually empowering each other to
be even stronger or even better, or even whatever. In other words, the way to be
with somebody else is to empower them as they empower you. It‟s a risk to have a
relationship like that. It‟s very cool. It's splenic. It can be full of tension—the 38th
gate down there. Whenever you hear about that gate, always think about crosses
that gate belongs to; you can smell the tension in the background.

So when you come to the 1/3 here, Preparation, the desire to be effective
manifested in an application of energy to detail; the intuition to potentially apply
energy to detail. It‟s all the detail work. It‟s all about preparation. There is a big
difference between being a 28 and having the whole channel. And I don't want to
get caught up here in giving you the channel description, because it is the gate we‟re
looking at. You have to see that the gate by itself does not bring the energy for the
relationship. It doesn't. It will look for that energy. It has to be prepared.
One of the things that it really says about the 28th gate is that before it can truly find
its purpose it must develop its strengths. These are strugglers after all. They have
to develop their strength and the development of their strength is really the honing
of their intuition. One of the things about the 1/3 is that obviously because you have
the 3rd line unconscious that you can end up with situations in which there is no real
strength yet. And the most dangerous thing for 28s is that because the Spleen is
weak to begin with, that if they don't have enough strength and they engage with
the other, that it can end up being very, very depressing. Remember that we have
all this melancholy that can move through this.
The other thing is to realize something about the 28 and it's finding of a purpose. It
is unexpected. It comes out of the unexpected. It is not a plan. That's why the
preparation has no direction. That's why in the detriment preparation can just be an
aesthetic that means that leads to nothing. It's all about developing one‟s strength.
And what is that? It is the intuition for survival first. You cannot be concerned about
purpose until you have survived on the material plane. We know that. You cannot
indulge yourself in this kind of journey to Ibiza to do all of this without having
already established a way on the material plane to make it possible. That‟s the
preparation. It makes the 28 at the lower trigram not-self level very, very material
because it's hard to think about purpose it if you're looking for firewood. You just
end up struggling on the material plane.
As we had the 50 before, remember that the polarity to the 28 is the 27. Again,
here you have a genetic role and a genetic role to nourish and to care. And it is this
hidden 27 because it‟s hidden, that really is the beginning of that love that can be
possible between the 28 and the 57. And when I say that understand that for all 57s
and for all 28s this is a basic relationship that is normally productive. And as I say
that, the same thing is true for the 22 and the 55. It just operates in a very, very
different way. But it's also something that clearly has a unique relationship.
Again, when I say that because we work at a deep level, the moment that you're
moving in a stream through a center there is always a relationship between those
gates in the center that are part of the same stream, and to one degree or another
they're all special. I don't want to just isolate is. I just want you to understand that
what the 28th gate does to Integration is unique in the bodygraph, and again to a
lesser degree the 38. It‟s unique. Basically what you're doing is that you're turning
Integration channels into a circuit. And what that really means is that the 28 is very
clever. Not only does it go to the Throat through individuality, the 57/20, but it gets
access to the 34, it gets access to the 10. In other words, it is able to change the

The 1/4
RAC Unexpected 3
The one thing about the 1/4 is that for the 1/4 in most cases the unexpected doesn't
show up very often. You‟ll see that if you‟re a 2/4, boy does it show up a lot. If
you‟re a 1/4 it doesn‟t show up very often. One of the things about the 1/4 is that
they‟re very good at collecting the detail and talking about the detail, but it is rare
that they get to do anything about it. And for most 1/4s what you find on this cross
is that they're going to be very densely involved on the material plane, which is
where they'll get to live out their influence. But that very density of the material
plane, these are the kind of people that say that it would be a real risk for me to
think about my purpose because I really don't have enough time. I can't afford it
right now. I can't afford to think about purpose. There are other things are more
important for me right now than think about purpose.
We‟re at the foundation with the 1/3, 1/4 and again, this is about preparation.
Everything that you case see is that if you're looking at a cross that‟s called The
Expected, then you might as well be prepared, it just make sense. You never know.
You never know. And it's one of those things for certain about meeting beings who
incarnate on this cross. They are full of the unexpected. There is no question about
that.
We talked about the 1/4 and in looking at the 1/4, and again aside from the fact that
the parental responsibility that‟s involved, to be able to see that for the 1/3
preparation is not something that is separate from action. In other words, that being
prepared for a 1/3 is learning from mistakes, taking risks. For the 1/4, it's much
more the detail without the experience. And so what you end up with the 1/4 is that
they can be very, very good at collecting detail; in other words, trying to be
prepared in an intelligent way.

RAC Unexpected 3
You get to my one of my favorite lines—Shaking Hands with the Devil—2nd line;
distasteful alliance. Between the 28 and the 57 is the only place where you actually
get in duality the sense that you can be advantaged by it, rather than disadvantaged
by it. This distasteful alliance that is built into the 2nd line is about understanding
something, that the devil is your partner. If you don't know that, you don't know
anything about love. That's shaking hands with the devil, I tell you. It‟s like saying
none of this works, we know that. However, I think it maybe both of us can get
somewhere that neither one of us can get to alone. Yes, it looks like that. Okay, so
let‟s see if we can get there.

This shaking hands with the devil is a real recognition of boy, oh boy, when you get
into one of these things, you‟re going to have to work—struggle and all the stuff that
comes with it. But in the end, what you're looking for is that the other recognizes in
you your potential. It‟s what I describe when you look at the romance process
through the emotional system that when individual lovers first meet each other they
spend an enormous amount of time trying to find out about each other, exploring.
When you come over to the splenic side you have to be able to see something in the
other that impresses you; otherwise, it won‟t work. And even if the other is the devil
there‟s something even about the devil that you should be able to find to admire, I
suppose. A means, however unsavory, that is justified by its ends; when the game
turns to a struggle, the intuitive acceptance of any alliance in order to win. Oh, I
love this. Remember, it is a gate of risk taking. And this is winning in the sense of
the Library of Babylon, the great lottery of Babylon.
If you can both get to a place that you want and you can only get there by going
with the other, it doesn't matter as long as you get to the goal. It doesn‟t matter.
The goal is the winning. It's like finding out that you really do have a purpose.
There is this enormous victory. Yes, it‟s not pointless. And the anxiety engendered
by sacrificing higher principles when there is no guarantee of success. How many
couples were there is one couple that has abandoned their higher principles in order
to find their purpose with that other person.
You have to see that there is a certain coldness here because it's splenic. It‟s like
my goal is that I don't want to be poor, so you've got money and I can make you
feel good because I'm beautiful, and you can made me feel good because you are
rich, and we can fulfill our purpose together. It can be very cold. But that isn't to
say it's not love. The interesting thing about individuality is that individuality realizes
that it's all individual anyway, that it‟s always alone anyway. And it‟s a nice illusion
to have as long as it gets you somewhere. You‟re only interested in getting to the
purpose.
So you have a 2/4 and you know very clearly that the only thing that's going to bring
that 2/4 out is that the devil is going to show up at its door and promise it something
that it didn't think it could get by itself. And it‟s far beyond the promise of survival.
It‟s about always having a mirror that makes you look good. It‟s just about having a
mirror that makes you look good. It‟s about somebody in your life that says, hey
you‟re doing great. It‟s about somebody in your life saying, I like what you did.
That's nice.
The whole thing about individuality is that individuality is always about “I, me.” You
go to integration and you get to the 20th gate and all it says is “I am,” it doesn‟t say
“we are,” it never says “we are.” It never says “we are in love,” it says “I am in
love,” there‟s no “we” there. It‟s hard to find a “we” anywhere. The potential only
lies in the 45 and it's really not there. Individuality is ready to sacrifice the principle
of love in order to reach its goal. I'm not married to him because I love him, I‟m
married to him or to her because we have a good life, and it works. He‟s ok. He
leaves me alone. I‟m okay, she leaves me alone. We empower each other. It works

out just find. Now, obviously there will be things that will be sacrificed in such a
relationship. But when you see that the 28 is only interested in fulfilling its purpose,
that it will take any risk to be able to find and celebrate the unexpected, that they
can actually find their purpose.
2/4s and 2/5s in this situation, because of the very way in which they are both trying
to avoid and the same time being open up to those calling them out, is that this is
where the deepest risks take place. It‟s very risky to connect yourself to someone
who is truly only interested in themselves. This is individuality, after all. And unless
both beings are equally interested in themselves, it doesn't really work. It‟s a real
risk. After all, it can't be a one-way empowerment. That‟s called support, and that's
tribal. After all, the collective is there to share.
What you're looking at in individuality is that only when empowerment is mutual,
only when it's mutual, only then are you going to have a successful bond. So, the
one who knocks on the door, the one who calls you out, not only are they there to
empower you, but there is no opportunity unless you can in return empower them.
The joke of that is that individual relationships in spirit, the better they are the
further apart they move. Now again, you're still flying in space. But there is this
fulfillment that is taking place in the inner process, because this is the individual's
way, to find their “I am,” and in that “I am,” their purpose through that.
One of the things about individuality is that if it lasts long enough it might last
forever. An individual finds something that they like, they will not go looking for
something else, whether it's a pair of clothes until it falls off their body or something
they like to eat or whatever the case may be, they will stay with somebody to the
end, even though in empowerment they are truly in their own worlds. But then
again, isn't that the truth? That is purpose being fulfilled, when you're in your own
bubble and you're not alone. There‟s somebody that you can still see they‟re moving
along with you.

The 2/5
RAC Unexpected 3
The 2/5 in this particular situation is really going to be subject to being allowed only
one failure. It‟s very deep, this thing. Nothing will destroy an individual more and
can for their whole life than to make a commitment to empower another who does
not empower them in return. When you talk about people who have broken hearts
you're always talking about individuals who did not receive empowerment for the
return of them empowering the other. And for most individuals in their melancholy,
because they are not collective, they do not say it's because of the other, they will
blame themselves.

The 3/5
RAC Unexpected 3
So, when you get to the 3/5 and you get to Adventurism you have to see that here
is a place where there can be excessive martyrdom. These are people that can
really suffer deeply. There is also a desperateness to the 28.3 and that
desperateness is that they can see how difficult it is to find purpose. And they can
see also very quickly how difficult it is to find somebody who is ready to empower
them. So they have unfounded risk taking. A basic conservatism that even in
adventurous acts is necessarily prudent. This is the Saturnian quality, obviously. An
intuitive caution in risk taking and the other side is the perverse manifestation, that
is, intuitive rationalizing of risk taking in times of struggle. What happens to the 3/5
in this situation is that again because we are in the Quarter of Duality the first focus
is I'm in trouble and I need somebody else, because otherwise I'm never going to
get to my purpose. So there is a drive in the very cool splenic sense, a drive to find
the other.
And when you get to the 3rd line you get to the anarchy and the chaos. You just do,
because you see right away that if you‟re individual you‟re not in any way ready to
share, which seems to be the way the collective expresses love. You‟re not able to
really support the other because you're not tribal. You're not even ready to make
that kind of bond to marry somebody or get contracted with them. You‟re a freak,
after all. It is a freak gate.
So, one of the things to see when you get to the 3rd line here there can be this sense
of desperateness that there's nobody out there that will look in your eyes and see
your beauty, see your greatness, see your value. Individual lovers are really cute,
because this is what they do to each other. They say, oh, you‟re a God, and the
other one says, oh, you‟re a Goddess. Now, they both feel good.
All of the expressions that we have, the nicknames that lovers give each other, and
all of this stuff, it's all this empowering game. It‟s very individual. It‟s how romance
works. And you can see how insular it is. It‟s coming out of individuality. It‟s just
an understanding that if you‟re going to fly in space with somebody and they‟re
going to be in your aura, it‟s better that they feel good because you‟re in their aura.
And if they make you feel good, you don‟t mind flying in their aura. As a matter of
fact, the fact that both of you make each other feel good might mean they can get
some place in your life together. It can be very romantic. Now, of course, it‟s
missing the emotions that would give it that quality. Even with the 41s sitting there
going come on, feel, feel it‟s still not there.
So, what we know about the 3/5 is that they are going to make a leap of faith. And
they're going to confuse the unexpected. Think about mutation. Mutation is a pulse,
it operates in a pulse. Suddenly it's there. And this is the way that empowerment
relationships work. Suddenly the other is there out of nowhere. Now for a 3rd line
that's natural, bang into you. You bang into somebody, you look them in the eye,

and the goo-goo machine starts working. You're looking at me as if you could
empower me. And I know that I am looking at you as if I could empower you and
you have the beginning of the potential of the building of passion and romance.
So, what you get with a 3/5 because of the 5 underneath, that naturally it‟s
interested in individuality, it will go, oh, this is going to be the best empowerer ever.
Yeah, if it doesn't work, you know what happens to their reputation and you know
how devastating that can be here. And they get the unexpected, but the negative
unexpected, the other side, the unexpected things that happen that you don't want
to happen, that hurt you and you do suffer and then you run away.
What‟s interesting about risk taking is that Saturnian risk taking is that you're pretty
sure you can beat the odds, and Jupiterian risk taking is, ah, give it a whirl. And you
can see what the 3/5 does. It‟s just based on that criterion. It will just jump into
something. And in this context looking for not so much for the empowerment itself,
but the unexpected that can arise out of that.

The 3/6
RAC Unexpected 3
We know in this quarter that the 3/6 is well-equipped for failure, it‟s well-equipped
for the relationship problem, but then again, we‟ve been talking about that in the
context of collective and tribal activations. It doesn't matter what 3 you are. And if
you're a 3/6—well, in the 3/6 it‟s quite different because it is alignment—but here
with the 3/6, to be very clear about something. They will make early mistakes and
may never recover. After all, the reason it takes so long for individuals to
consummate their relationship is that they really need to be sure. And remember,
they have no bargain. They‟re not 40/37s. They don't have an intrinsic bargain.
The whole thing about their relationship is, don't ever stop looking at me that way.
If you ever stop looking at me that way, it‟s over. And more than that, because
we're dealing with individuality, is the voice and the words that mean so much. Only
individuals demand that they hear love expressed. Only individuals demand that
they hear empowerment expressed as words. I love what you're doing. You can‟t
imagine how wonderful and empowering that can be to somebody who needs to be
empowered. They need to hear it. It‟s why individual lovers talk and talk and talk
and talk and talk before they do anything.
So, there‟s no bargain, and so you fall in love and you offer empowerment and you
don't get it back and it is so painful because what it's saying to you is you‟re never
going to get to your purpose. These are people that the whole question of
relationships can drive them mad. They can be so deeply, deeply melancholic, so
unhappy, because these aren‟t people that are satisfied with sharing and support.
They need that word of love, they need that look in the eye, they need to be seen as
something that is unique and special and beautiful and wonderful. Well, you know
what that's like. You think that's easy to find anywhere? Damn right they‟ll take
risks.

What they have to understand is that they‟re like beings that if they live properly
through their 3rd line process, if they're correct, they won't crash. Any behavior that
is correct you always get what is correct for you. So, again, there is a caution here
that the 6/3 is over-equipped for failure, in a sense, particularly obviously in their
first 3rd year phase.

The 4/6
RAC Unexpected 3
Holding on—I want to stop right there with that holding on. It is one of the things
to always be clear about this nature of the Spleen is that it is the most unnatural
thing for the Spleen to hold on to anything. It‟s one of the things I teach you about
not-self strategy of the Spleen, you're holding onto things that aren‟t good for you,
and then you're letting go of things that are good for you. And it's all about this
holding on process.
Now, remember, this is what an emotional person does with emotions. It‟s what
makes them ill. They take the emotion and they hold on to it rather than just letting
it pass through. It‟s the same thing for the Spleen. The Spleen will hold on. And it
means that it can hold onto a virus rather than letting it go through, and in holding
onto it become ill. And so it's very important to see that here in the 4th line you're
really very much in one of the archetypes of the Spleen, of the Spleen as a whole.
The ability—and I love this twist of phraseology here—the ability through whatever
means to keep one's grip. Now, that has a double entendre meaning, to keep one‟s
grip is not to lose your marbles, to be able to stay the steady course. But yet, it is
grip. And not to lose one‟s grip. So, one of the things about the 28.4 is that the
28.4 is trying to figure out a way to really hold on to the other, not just “I empower
you and you empower me,” but something else, something that goes deeper. That
is, I‟ll empower you and you empower me but you let me see your mailing list and
I'll let you see mine. In other words, I also want certain opportunities out of this.
It‟s okay that I empower you, but there‟s something funny that happens here.
The application of knowledge to exploit—it‟s a strong word—to exploit opportunities
and usually (spoken drawn out)—I always love those. Whenever you see that
expression from me, you really have to say it just as I do—usually (spoken drawn
out). Not always (spoken drawn out); usually, but not always. One of the most
important parts of our work is the depth and quality of Human Design vocabulary, its
preciseness as a language. And we really have to make sure that our students pay
deep attention to language. Every word is a formula. And if you just slide over the
surface, you miss what's being said.
One of the reasons that people have trouble with the Rave I‟Ching is that they don't
know how to read and deconstruct at the same time. And it is deconstruction in a
way. In other words, you have to see that there are all these codes that are built in
that are layered with little stories or mythologies or whatever. But you can

deconstruct these things and come up with—it‟s what I do unconsciously for you, is
that I'm deconstructing—I think he just died, didn‟t he, the father of deconstruction
in Germany. What is his name, this philosopher? He just died. I read a very
interesting obituary for him because he is very much misunderstood. But anyway,
this idea of being able to take something that the intention supposedly is one thing
and that‟s people get when they read a line. They say, okay, the ability through
whatever means to keep one's grip, but there are many things in there. It is an
ability. So it's already built in. There is an ability here, there is a gift here of holding
on.
It‟s one of the things that the Spleen learns to do. It‟s a blue line. The Spleen
learns to hold on. That‟s not good. And why does it learn to hold on? It learns to
hold on because it's deeply conditioned, because the not-self rules. And you can
begin to go in and deconstruct—the ability through whatever means; that‟s any way.
The application of knowledge to exploit opportunities, and usually for the greater
good; a depth of intuition at its best in struggle and often a value to others. And the
side, the application of intelligence to hold on exclusively out of self-interest. A
depth of intuition that is stubbornly selfish in its capacity to hold on. There is only
one way to hold on to the other. It is either by conditioning them or being
conditioned. There is no other hold on. And the moment you see “hold on” you‟re
always looking at the realm of the not-self.
Now, understand that from a splenic point of view, that the splenic system must hold
on temporarily, in the splenic sense. Otherwise, your Spleen, your immune system
would not be able to identify things and to be able to recognize what kind of defense
mechanism is necessary to combat it. It holds it to examine it and lets it go. And of
course, this is in a constant flow. The lymphatic system that we relate to the Spleen,
please remember that you have lymph glands all over your body, that the Spleen is
deeply connected to your entire process, your whole process, in that sense.
And everything about the Spleen is that the open Spleen is absolutely and deeply
insecure. It‟s insecure in the most fundamental way. There is no consistent way to
survive. So, it learns to hold on very early in its life. And what is happening here is
that the love, right angle love, self-absorbed love, that right angle love is beginning
to fade from the unexpected. And again, this is our 4/6.
Something to understand about the 4/6 is that the 4/6 wants to be left angle. We
saw that in the way in which the laws were changed. So, what you‟re getting here
is, it's not enough that there is empowerment. It's not enough. I want a guarantee
that you're going to keep on empowering me and the way to do that is to get you to
hold on to me or for me to hold onto you through conditioning, whatever means. It's
always struggle. I‟m going to stubbornly hold on. This is the opening to the not-self
of the Spleen.
Remember, that it's the 4th line that infects. That this the immune system breaking
down and allowing infection to come in, which is very important, otherwise, you can‟t
build up your immune system, and then putting it back out and passing it along. So
here in the 4th line, what you're having is that you're moving away from what is the

much in love with the other, and to be in love with being empowered by the other,
not so much being in love with the other. And that you see this becomes something

The 4/1
We shift here to the Juxtaposition Cross of Risks, we're going to move to the 33rd
gate and 19th gate, so we‟re getting very close to the end because the moment that
you see these gates you know right away that the Cross of Four Ways is not far
away. In other words, we‟re getting these two gates that represent ways, that
represent completions of quarters.
So the 19th gate is the completion of
the Quarter of Mutation and the 33rd
gate is the completion of the
Quarter of Civilization. So, we have
a very, very different frequency that
is here. And one of the things about
the 4/1 here is that the way in
which they condition the other or
are conditioned by the other is that
empowerment is fine, but territory is
better. And one of the things that is
inherent in this is, is the drive, as
we increased our intelligence and
the spectrum of wealth to have as a
by-product or as the key to entering
into any bond that we have a shared
territory.
Every creature knows this. After all,
the 28th gate is there in the mammal and you look at a way in which mammals bond
and you can see that built into their bonding is the need to establish territory. The
territory itself becomes essential because the territory is the place where the web or
the grid of connections out of the 4 can be made. But the risk that they are really
bringing as a bridge here, what they're really saying is that it's much easier to hold
on to somebody if they have to sleep in the same bed as you; something like that.
It‟s much easier to glue them.

I am a true lover of the 28.5—my mother, my wife, my daughter and a large number
of people in my life. Remember I'm a 57.5. That's my Personality Earth. I‟m always
looking towards the 28, and I am specifically looking towards the 28.5. And they're
great empowerers for me, because the 28.5 is a delicious line. This is about
alignment, the Left Angle Cross of Alignment, second version. Treachery; people
look at this line and go (sound). I love it.
Do you know what treachery is about? Treachery says that empowerment is a great
idea. All that's really nice. I don‟t know about living with them, but empowerment is
a great idea. But the thing is that I think that I can find somebody who can
empower me better than you are
empowering me. If you don‟t
empower me good enough I will
look for somebody better to
empower me.
I know that when I meet somebody
who has the 28.5 that if they're in
my life 20 years later I can pat
myself on the back with that they
didn't find anybody better. It's the
real joy of understanding what a
28.5 is all about. If you meet a
28.5 and they‟re empowering you
and all of a sudden they leave you,
call them treacherous bastards.
You hate them for it. This line gets
a lot of bad press.
The manipulation of the collective,
that while pitting one faction

seriously. They just do.

treachery, treasury. She knew that somewhere there was going to be a better yoga
teacher.
These beings who have the 28.5 they will just keep on going until they get the
empowerment that resonates for them. So, that's what alignment is about. To align
yourself, literally, to align yourself to those forces in which you feel like you don't
have to go any further because here is where your purpose can be. Now remember,
the theme of our time, treachery, ain‟t it so—better car, better dog, better wife.
Everything is about leave the old and come to the new. Every product that‟s sold on
the market is called new and improved. You can do better. Give up A for B, sell
your house, and buy this one. This is our world and it ends up in all of our
relationships because mutation changes the planet. Everybody wants something
better.
Treachery; the abuse of trust. I always like to point out that there is a “rust” in
trust. Trust is something that does not stand the test of time if you're a freak. You
can only trust the freak to empower you in the moment they are empowering you.
And the next time in the pulse, if it's not there, it‟s just not there. You can't trust
mutation. I don't trust that any the 28.5s in my life are absolutely forever content.
I don't trust that. I‟ll wait and see. All I can do is be a good 57.5 and empower
them in return.
There's no question that the 5/1 here as not-self—these beings have really
transformed the era that we live in from one in which we‟re waiting for the
unexpected to one in which we‟re demanding it. Basically, this is demanding that
you find purpose. And it doesn't matter how many beings you go through, it doesn't

LAC Alignment 2
We get to the 6th line we get to Blaze of Glory; this is a well-documented line in
that it brings out in the Neptunian detriment this self-destructive phrase: Sacrifice
rather than capitulation to the law of deterioration. Remember that with the 5 and
6, the 5 is tells you where we are and the 6 is telling you what the mutation in the
future is taking us to. It's taking us to the blaze of glory. It is. Regeneration and
renewal, and if you don't regenerate and renew, it‟s goodbye to you. It‟s nice that
rhymes. And one of the things you can see is that the 6th line blaze of glory for
humanity is also self-destruction. It's always there as a possibility. If you can't find
your purpose, then why not blow something up. That's going on every day today
now, it‟s a new plague. If you can‟t find your purpose, just blow something up, set it
on fire.
Self-destruction; the deep intuitive fear of defeat and a potentially profound
hopelessness in times of struggle: Blaze of glory. Sacrifice rather than capitulation.
We are not here to give up. And to become oneself is to sacrifice the dreams of the
not-self. As not-self, even with this knowledge, you still don‟t know the hell what
your purpose is. You don‟t. It's the whole point. When your cross takes you and
you start turning all around that wheel, the first cycle on that cross, you‟ll see. You
are sacrificing all the dreams of your not-self, what your not-self thought purpose
was going to mean for you.
All 6th line beings face destruction. I warned about the good dying young with a 6th
line profile, the plague of early deaths of Kironian 6th line profiles that this blaze of
glory is there for them, that the destructive path is there for them if they haven't
found regeneration and renew no matter what the price. To wake up, to accept and
surrender your place on the wheel is to sacrifice any of the illusions you've had about
you and your connection to the world around you. It‟s a deep profound sacrifice.
And only the 6 through renewal, it is resurrection after all, what I talk about is the
Kironian phase, you have to see that it is a way of resurrection. It is the first part of
a life lived again, but lived again as a transformed sum total. On a mundane level
these people can have a very, very hard time. And they can have a hard time
because they don't know what to make a sacrifice to.
After all, they‟re intelligent, this is the 28th gate, and it‟s intelligent. They don‟t know
what to sacrifice to, where do I make the sacrifice, what sacrifice is worthwhile. How
can I regenerate? Where is renewal? All these basic questions, and if you don‟t give
them an answer and they learn in their 3-3 phase how difficult it is to find that
answer, then despair is natural, particularly when the 38th gate is there and the
struggle is all around and without purpose it seems so hopeless. Why don‟t I just die
and come back again? Do it again. Start fresh; another round.

ruled the world, for 300 million years. We barely have 90,000 under our belt; 4
million if you really, really stretch it to little brainless monkeys. 300 million years,
wow. We think that we run Mother Earth. They were the world. It was one rock,
one rock, going on vacation in Mexico, one rock, whack, and two years of no
sunlight. Say goodbye to reptiles and say hello to fuzzy warm little rat like
creatures—my great, great granddaddy.
So, when I touch the 44 it‟s like—I always told the story about the 44 the 26. The
26 goes fishing and comes back and says you should have seen the one that got
away. And the 44 walks in the room just is he saying that and his hands are slowly
moving like this. And when that 26 looks down that deep hole of the 44, it‟s the only
thing that the egoist ever bows its head to. It‟s like, I better leave my arrogance at
home right now. What makes you think that me, this great warrior, the 26, the
great warrior—I‟m a great warrior. I will survive anything. The tribe will live
forever. Yes, yes, yes, yes, tell that to the dinosaurs. Talk to them; 300 million
years they thought they had it made. It was their planet.
Every time I see a bird it‟s like looking at the homeless. There is this dysfunctional
rapture. It used to rule the whole damn world. The best it can do now is shit on
your head. You see them and they‟re pissed. The bird flu is a real revenge of the
dinosaurs. It should have been clue to everybody when we found out that birds and
dinosaurs are really the same track.

the 44th gate because it truly is the secret to all relationships. It says: The success
of any interaction is based on the absence of any preconditions. Now, think about
that. If you look at the mirror, in other words, if you go instead of from the 44th
gate you drop over to the emotional side to the 37th gate, you will see that there is
no way that interaction can be based on the absence of any preconditions, that the
conditions are being established on the emotional side.
But there is something deep in the knowing of the 44 that will emerge when the 37
is truly born as intelligence rather than emotions. It‟s that there can never be any
preconditions, never, ever. This is the only way in which we can be one with the
other. And this is the way of no
preconditions. It doesn't mean that
conditions cannot be established.
That‟s very important to grasp. And
everything about the 44th gate and
this so-called gate of manipulation is
to understand that manipulation is
trying to build successfully on what
happens. I‟m not saying that well.
The 44 recognizes that without the
cooperation of the 26 that there is
absolutely no way that the tribe is
going to have the resources that it
needs. This is what the 44 knows.
And it knows as well that the ego is
something that can never be
controlled. You cannot place
conditions on the ego, but you can
wrap the ego into living with
conditions. But it's entirely
dependent on the relationship between the 26 and the 44. It‟s one of the themes of
our time with Pluto in the 26, the bird flu business, all of this, to really understand
how profound this channel is. This is the thing that holds the core together, the
tribal core around which we have framed the individual and the collective, this is the
core, and it holds the core together.
It maintains the continuity by saying okay, no preconditions. Let's see if we can
work together. This stream of instinct is a stream that has deep material values
attached to it. We have seen through the 54 the ambition to rise up and the 32, the
financial manager looking for things, looking for their value. And here when we
come to the 44 we have the personnel manager. In other words, there are no
preconditions, but skills at being able to handle interrelationship.
Get the joke of the name. It's not the gate of meeting. It's Coming to Meet. It
doesn't mean they meet. That‟s an assumption. It says: Coming to meet. In other
words, there are no preconditions but an intention to meet. And that intention to
meet that can be realized based only on the unknowable, the quantum that will
result when the 44 meets the 26. Remember something, we have seen in the

Spleen gates that look in a funny way. The 48 and the 57 turn their heads and look
to the 18 and the 28 respectively. But, the 44 rigidity looks to the 26.
Now again, in the lower trigram it‟s not consciously recognizable. We know that the
upper trigram is always going to be much more aware of the gate at the other end.
But it's one things to see about the 44/26 is that it's so deeply connected to our
immune system in the way in which our body defends itself, that the 44 for the very
sake of the defense of the species is always on the alert for the 26. It's always on
alert for ego power. It's always trying to recruit the ego. And this is the whole to
understand about the 44th gate. People like to think that it is a manipulating gate.
It‟s not, it's a recruitment gate. Join the Navy, see the world. It's a recruitment
gate.
We have Conditions—did you see what it said at the beginning? What is this? It
says no preconditions and the 1st line is: Conditions. Remember, it‟s a blue line.
Again, this is one of those hexagrams that split three and three. The 1st line
Conditions: The establishment of frameworks as a result of interaction, and you get
the whole point of what the foundation of this is. It‟s as a result of interaction that
conditions can emerge. And Pluto, by the way exalted. A mastery of the collective
they can establish restrictive conditions for inferior components, and with the ability
to enforce them. By the way, for the Spleen the ego is always inferior, and
whenever you see the inferior mentioned here understand that‟s the ego. For the
Spleen, the ego is inferior. It‟s a beast that needs to be tamed. And you can see
the 26th gate is the Taming Power of the Great. It needs to be tamed and the 44 is
the lion tamer.
The alertness to patterns that can lead to mastery of the collective, or in the
Venusian, the failure of the instinct out of need for harmony. Now one of the great
difficulties of the 44 is getting confused with being a 37. The 37 likes to schmooze
the ego; buddy, buddy with the ego. That's the way the 37 tries to get into the ego
willpower. But on the 44 side that doesn't work. As a matter of fact, when the 44
start schmoozing the 26, the 26 already can smell the holes. It doesn‟t work.
The 44th Gate and the Sense of Smell
So, harmony or feeling that harmony is a prerequisite is something that can get in
the way. In other words, it becomes a condition that isn't necessarily going to prove
to be effective. The moment that the 44 tries to be a 37 it loses its ability to smell
trouble. No gate has a more profound sense of smell, and I'm not talking about
surface smell. Surface smell is the 21st gate. The 21st gate can smell one millionth a
part of something in the environment. But the 44 can smell things that even dogs
can‟t smell. It can smell at a level that is so profound. This is where you smell a rat.
This is where you smell trouble. This is where you smell a break. You smell all kinds
of things that have nothing to do with smelling, but in fact are deeply connected to
aroma and to smell.

Coming To Meet
The 44th gate is connected to our oldest sense, this sense of smell. When you think
about a dog, for example, a dog can smell at a level that is 80,000 times more
profound than human capacity for smell. Think about that. You have no idea what
that means. Honestly, you can‟t. The only thing that says to me is that it must be
three-dimensional. It‟s so dense as an aroma field that must be layered, it must be
multiple in a sense almost visual.
Now, this is something like what happens in the 44, is that its ability to be able to
smell the aura, it‟s highly alert. It is, after all, the gate of alertness. So, the very
foundation of the way of Duality is that don't worry about conditions until after
you‟ve interacted. First interact, and accept that you can only interact without
preconditions. In other words, you can‟t choose whom to interact with. You have to
wait and see.

The 1/3
RAC Four Ways 3
The 1/3 in this configuration, the 1/3 is going to have its difficulties in the sense that
the frustration, it‟s just basically frustration, the frustration of trying to do things
without Conditions only to discover that everybody else has preconditions. It‟s the
most difficult thing to realize and the 1/3 realizes it right away. It‟s like there
shouldn't be any preconditions, but the preconditions are everywhere. And they see
that this is a manipulation. Their potential anarchy, their discovery is to be able to
take advantage of this materially.
In the 44th gate, the 3rd line can make its greatest profit. It's very, very easy,
because you actually make the profit off the back of the ego. You‟re a sales
manager, you‟re a 44, and you have a whole stable of 26s. You make something
from all of them. It‟s part of the way in which the 44 can benefit. So obviously,
when you're dealing with the 3 they can find ways in which they can establish
conditions that will allow them to manipulate the ego.
But the whole business about suffered and the whole business about getting things
wrong and the punishment that comes with that is that they end up being like
everybody else. That is, they‟re always trying to have preconditions themselves.
Remember how difficult it is. It's very difficult. You can see that individuality, even
in its best in the 28, that it already has a precondition. The precondition is that you
have to empower me as I empower you. It's already preconditioned.
Only here in the 44 do you get this recognition that preconditions don't necessarily
mean anything, but you can, once a connection is established, you can then begin to
apply conditions. And the 44 has the drive of its fear, this fear of the past to realize
deeply that these conditions must be established and that they think they're the
ones who can establish it. It‟s their way, after all.

The 1/4
RAC Four Ways 3
When you‟re dealing with the 1/4 whether it grows up with precondition or condition
is going to be dependent on the nature of its environment, its family, all of these
things. But the whole thing about condition is that it is still a 1st line theme and
remember that whether it's the 1/3 or the 1/4 what you're dealing with is a hell of a
lot more investigation than actual application. And as much as the 44 has enormous
power over the ego as a potential, the ego physically and technically can overwhelm
the Spleen at any time.
You watch and see how difficult it is for people who have this definition, the 26/44,
to find that balance that their Spleen can really reign in the ego because the is a
motor after all, the Spleen is not. The advantage the Spleen has is that it's
intelligent and the ego is not. And with intelligence it realizes that the ego cannot
always be on. It also has to be off, and when it's off it‟s weak. It‟s one of the things
to see about trying to catch a dragon while it's asleep. This is the secret of dealing
with the ego. You get to the ego when it‟s at rest, not when its will is being
exercised. And the intelligence of the 44 recognizes that.

The 2/4
RAC Four Ways 3
When you come to the 2nd line you come to Management. And it's right there in
the blood. The development and management of a proper collective structure—this
is a tribal gate—a proper collective structure which restricts inferior elements by
creating cooperative modes—restricts ego beings, restricts the ego by creating
cooperative modes and integrates these forces with progressive and superior forces,
meaning them. This is one of those things that you see in the factory. The 54 is so
jealous of the 26. The 54 takes a bus to work. The 26 is the salesman and the
saleswoman. They've got a very expensive car that the company gave them, they
have a great place in the parking lot, and they have a special place in the cafeteria.
They don't even have to show up for work every day.
The relationship in the whole material capitalism of this stream, that the one thing
that has to keep the lid on is the 44. It has to always remind that 54 that one day
that, too, could be you. And at the same time it needs to reward him and massage
that ego. Na, you don't have to come in today, that's fine. Just make sure it‟s on
my desk tomorrow. And anyone who manages an ego has to see that you can‟t just
press them. You have to give them their rest, their rewards. Otherwise, you don't
get the power of their will.
So, the possibility that alertness to patterns will result in management capability.
When you‟re managing the ego, the 37 and the 44 understands something. They

don't like it, but nothing is going to happen without that ego thing. And they all
have to find a way to make an ego thing their friend. And they both work on the
massage principle. The 37 is affectionate and warm and appreciative and loving and
all that stuff. And the 44 treats you specially if you're productive. In other words,
26s get to feel that they‟re special because their 44s treat them different than
everybody else. And the ego is massaged.
It‟s like when somebody dies. The first thing you try to do is massage their heart.
And you really have to see that that's where the 37 and the 44 work on. How do we
massage this thing so that we can control it, because it‟s not aware and it‟s very
powerful? Remember that they're both pointed at the two great gates of denial. The
26 says to the 44, and I know because I'm a 26, don‟t you even think of
manipulating me. And the 40 says to the 37, and I know because I'm a 40 and I
have no 37, don‟t give this affection shit. What do you want? Denial is denial. So
they‟ve got to be good. And you can‟t do it with everyone. It‟s like marriage. The
44/26 is just like the 40/37, this is a marriage. It's a marriage without
preconditions, it‟s a marriage without the contract, but it‟s a marriage.
In the detriment, Mars: The instinctive memory for the patterns that bypasses the
development of managerial capability. This is about simply being goal oriented. In
other words, rather than the focus simply being on the management of the being, it
is a management on the being with a specific and very precise goal, which means
you don't necessarily align yourself with egos that are correct for you. This is one of
these things. After all, we‟re talking about a 2/4 now. And the fact of the matter is
that we can see that there is tremendous potential to manage society in the 2/4. The
missionary that I keep talking about, this incredible capacity once called to be very,
very influential. And this is a classic 44 position. To be a 2/4 on this cross is really
to have the ego call on you, which is rare.
In other words, usually it‟s 44s because it's their job to preserve the tribe and
they‟re the intelligence, they have to search for 26s. But the 2/4s obviously aren't
on the search. The 26 is. The ego has to come to the 2/4. This gives them certain
advantages. In other words, they have less of a resistance in the way in which
they're going to create the conditions that will be the result of the relationship.
Remember something; the 44 can only hope that the 26 that it sees has what it
takes because when they're together and they are the channel, they become
something else. We know what that is. This is the channel of the transmitter. This
is the channel of Surrender. This is something that is enormously powerful as a life
force. And that the real conditions that exist are the conditions that emerge from
the presence of this life force.
The other thing is that the 44 is very, very, very cold, like the reptilian source that it
comes from, cold-blooded. The 26 is hot-blooded. This is the hot and the cold. And
you can understand that the heat can bring the cold to a boil. And the cold can
freeze the very life out of the heat. This is a dangerous recipe we‟re talking about,
dangerous stuff. It‟s a cold place.

It‟s why it‟s very important that they don't confuse themselves with being 37s. The
44th gate can't have that confusion. It‟s not hot. It‟s not warm, not at all. As a
matter of fact, don't play hot with an ego. You play hot with an ego and you‟re in a
fight. The ego says I‟m in charge of hot.

The 2/5
RAC Four Ways 3
The 2/5 in its lifetime will have many opportunities to be of managerial value. And
much more in the sense of being—because I‟m using these metaphors we have to be
careful. I don't want you to just think about this in the traditional business context
that I'm using as a metaphor. That is that the 46 can preserve its aspect of its tribal
continuity through aligning itself with an ego, they can bring productivity. And it
operates at many levels, managing one ego which happens to be a friend is just as
viable as a context. I just don‟t want you to get lost in only the business application
of that.
Obviously, in the 2/5 there is always this projection in being called out. Remember
that the 2nd line personality here will not look for egos. As a matter of fact, that‟s
quite a burden. If you're cold, it's hard to deal with hot. And egos can be very, very
annoying. And the vast majority of the people who walk this planet have undefined
egos which means that the 44 is so often fooled that they think that they‟re dealing
with an ego when they‟re dealing with the not-self and that's why we have so much
failure in this channel to truly find surrender and to transmit the truth.
So, in the sense of the 2/5 here, there is always going to be this projection that they
can help me. You know you're an ego being and you have this sense that they can
be of service, they can be of value. But if it doesn't work then the very cold 44 is
going to get burnt at the stake and it doesn't like that. Then it will really go into
withdrawal and hide behind its hermit personality.

response to interference that gets stuck in projection, and as a result is unrealistic in
its appraisal and error prone. The possibility that the instinct cannot handle the ego
of others. There is no more powerful 44 than this 3rd line in dealing with any ego.
And the secret is that the 44 in this case does not interact.
In other words, it makes no pretense of interacting. It may be present; it can handle
the aura connection of any ego. Where it has difficulty is in trying to figure out
which one can be productive. After all, it‟s the failure to interact based on

circumstances, so if the circumstances are correct you can interact. But in the
general circumstances of the way in which the world operates and in the way in
which the 3rd line sees the world, it is so obvious that it is pointless to interact with
most egos, that they are savage.
There is this very interesting, very male movie that came out awhile ago. It‟s called
The Hunted with Benicio Del Tora and Tommy Lee Jones. It's about basically a very
earnest profound man who in the early part of his life trains people to kill, special
services kind of stuff, he just trains people to kill. There are these people that
become killers, and become killers that are so good at killing that it is second nature
for them. And the story is about how the teacher and the student eventually have to
confront each other in a fight for life or death.
The whole thing about the 44 is that the 44 carries within it a deep visceral fear of
the 26. They actually not so much train the 26 to kill, but manage its killing, and it's
frightening, because at any moment there is this fear that it can turn against them.
And there is this great fear in the power of the ignorant ego, how dangerous it is.
One of the things you notice about 44.3 people is that they appear to be weak. They
give off a frequency that says I don't challenge the ego world. When in fact they're
deeply equipped for it, but they're not fools. They know very clearly that the ego is
a killer and that that ego is going to crank them up one way or another. And that if
it is not suitable for them they don‟t want to deal with it. And nobody but a 3/5 can
figure that out faster. It's like they get it right away.
So, they learn to take advantage of it, basically. They learn to financially take
advantage of it. These are the kind of people that can work around enormous egos
and never be affected, never provoke and never be affected. If they‟re correct, if
they really get to live out a correct life, this is a very important way, that to
recognize that ignorance and lack of awareness can never be allowed to interfere
with the need of the tribe to survive.

That is, the early part of their life, the 3-3 phase in this life, they're going to get

ego without management should be killed. That‟s their thing.
Once you train them, once they're there, they have all that ability to be the soldier,
you know that they have to be controlled and managed; otherwise, they're a loose

We get to the 4th line; I guess it's time for me to say something nice about the 4th
line in this quarter. Come on now, the 4th line in the first two quarters, we have an
Academy award, so let's keep things in perspective here. You have to take a little bit
of the dark with the light. However, this 4th line, Honesty: The refusal to engage in
hypocritical interaction. Now, it‟s obviously something that you have to learn and
grow into life. But look at what's underneath this. What's underneath this is:
Indifference at its most logical and cutting; the indifference possible when guided by
instinct of memory. The Sun in detriment is about the sacrifice of the differences for
survival. But the theme here is indifference.
It‟s what the 4 learns from the 3. The 4 recognizes that if you're indifferent to the
ego, the ego is attracted to you. The 4 really knows how to create that sticky web
that holds everything there and here it is, honesty, oh I love that. What a sweet
keynote. Wouldn‟t you like to have that, how nice. Well, the honesty is the
indifference that's possible, and it is a fantastic manipulation. The 37 can't get the
40 without that massage. It‟s this: You‟re so important to me and I love you for
what you're doing and aren‟t you wonderful. And the 44 says, I don't really think
you can do this job. No, I don‟t really need you. As a matter of fact, I don‟t really
think you've got what it takes.
You say that to a soldier in boot camp and the soldier says to you, who do I kill, who
do I kill. Nothing pisses the ego off more than not being given a chance to do the
denying itself. The 26 wants to be able to say, no, no you want me, you need me,
you need me to work for you, and you need me to keep your damn tribe alive. And
here is the 44.4 going, “I don't think you can keep the tribe alive, I don't think it's
worth my time to invest in you.” You‟ve really got them, right. You‟ve got them so
tight they can‟t breathe anymore.
The refusal to engage in hypocritical interaction; I love it. Indifference—and you can
see what it means to be cool, cold. Really have to see that about the Spleen. The
Spleen is really cold existential business. This is a real cool place. These are people
that can put on an incredible cool—I don't need you. You‟re not the one. These are
the kind of people that when they give you a quota that you‟ve got to deliver 100
and you deliver 175 they say, gee I thought you‟d do better than that. And then
they say why don‟t you go home and take a rest. You‟re really not up to your
regular energy. And the poor 26 is going to hell there. What do you mean? I broke
the record. What do you mean it‟s not enough? I‟ll show you. Yeah, yeah.
The 44.4 knows how to turn the heat off. It just turns the heat off. It air conditions
the whole environment. It cools the ego right down. But of course, we're at the end
of the right angle process. We‟re at the 4/6. And you can see again that this is

that‟s okay. We have to learn all these things; we have to live all these things.
But one of the most important things to understand is we‟re in the 26.4 now—
Censorship. Censorship resonates to honesty. Isn‟t that wonderful? Can you
imagine what a 26.4 and a 44.4 will do—the indifference to censorship; as long as
the goal is achieved. And what is the goal? Well, whatever the whole is that‟s
greater than the sum of the parts gets transmitted. And by the way, like any good

that they get what they need.

power is going to take. This is
about shaping will. And shaping will
through the establishment of roles—
the 7th gate, the role of the self in interaction and the 13th gate, the role of the self in
its openness. You bring a role into this.

The Left Angle Cross of Incarnation 2
 24  13
The 5/1
This Manipulation here, I like the way that word is so misunderstood. The root is
hand, mano. So, it‟s just about what one does with one's hands. You can see the
whole gesture in Coming to Meet, the open arms, the outstretched hand. You have
to see manipulation in the 44 is tribal. Within tribal circuitry you have the
sensitivity, you have touch, and you have smell. You have these things that are
very, very, very physical. And when we get to the 5, which is going to be the way
which we‟re going to be able to look
at the plane that were on now that
we get to this very, very influential
cross, something that we began to
look at in sequencing, that is, the
Left Angle Cross of Incarnation. It's
one of these initiating points in the
incarnative sequence, and obviously
it carries that quality in its very
name.
It is the very end of a quarter here.
And so at this very end of the
quarter we‟re about to move into
the transition to move into this
Quarter of Mutation and this quarter
that finally will bring us back to a
focus and a singularity in our
process. In other words, you really
have to see that as we‟ve been
going around the wheel we‟ve been
going in this tight line and then suddenly we split like a highway that divides. We‟ve
been on a single road. The highway is divided in the Quarter of Duality, and now
we're going to be coming back in. Basically what you're seeing is that the first
quarter, mind, the second quarter, body, the third quarter is reproduction and the
fourth quarter is that life, the reproduced life.
Now, that‟s a larger symbol of that whole process. In other words, you come in as
personality, you go into the form, through the form you make more and the more
than carries the mutation to the next cycle and you go around again and again and
again. So, what we‟re looking at here is something very difficult that incarnation
does is that it fuses the duality of the Quarter of Duality and fuses it towards a single
direction. And this requires manipulation.

Coming To Meet
The ability to transform interaction with inferior elements into the energizing of
progressive process with the additional benefit that in tapping the inferior elements
they remain weak; where the instinctive recognition of the patterns leads to the
possible manipulation of others. Now that's the Uranian exalted. I‟ll do the
detriment: The tendency in this form of manipulation to become abusive and
degenerate to their level; the possibility that the instinctive recognition of the
patterns could lead to the abuse of others. This is what we live with today. This is
the way we deal with the ego today. And this is our transition of the way in which
we move from duality to singularity. And you know how we do that? We beat down
our partner. Isn‟t that odd?
This is about mastering and overwhelming the ego. When I look at this line and I
think about it, I resonate—I have the 26.1 so my relationship is with the conditions
line or with honesty, which I quite understand that movie. When I look at the 5th
line I see that this is really disturbing. In other words, basically what it does is that
instead of getting to the end of Duality and saying, look, here is a solution; here is
how we can try to become one in mutation. Instead of actually doing that, what it
really says is, I've done the whole duality trip. I've been through the whole thing. I
have seen it for what it is. And now I want a divorce.
You come in, you go into the body, you meet the other, you make more, you leave
them and you try to find yourself. And this is the not-self formula that's lived out in
the quarters. Most human beings don't even imagine purpose until after they've
successfully raised their children. There‟s too much pressure until then, and then
they wonder what they do with the rest of their lives.
It's a very, very heavy interpretation, by the way, that I'm giving you of this 44.5,
but I would like you to understand how aggressive the control mechanisms at work
now, the manipulating mechanisms at work now at this tribal level. And that the
tribe is desperately, desperately trying to maintain itself against an onslaught of
destruction. And one of the things that this 5th line demonstrates is a recognition in
the program that this is inevitable. And that when you do get to the end of Duality
that you still end up in the same position, that there is truly nothing you can do.
There isn't. And this isn‟t a way anymore.
This is just what incarnation keeps on telling us because we keep on incarnating into
these same forms over and over and over again, and they're still duality forms. It
can never be liberated, we can never be one. We‟re not raves. The rave may have a
chance. It will deal with consciousness in a way that we do understand in our
binary. We are just body and mind. We know nothing about spirit. We‟re just stuck
with that. And the very, very coldness of this 44 is that it‟s just looking for the heat,
any heat.
So what do we have? We have a world of ego slaves, and not ego slaves like me,
I‟m not a slave. I have a defined ego. I'm talking about a 70% of humanity who
have undefined egos. They are the ones that are manipulated. They are the ones
that are the true inferior forces, and they are the ones that could be manipulated to
do anything coldly and nastily and they are the ones that are abused. All of them.
Show me somebody with a defined ego, I will show you somebody who is abused.

They just are. And what is doing to your body, to your heart, to your stomach, to
your immune system, all that stuff.
The not-self ego is so deeply, deeply manipulated. And of course the great power of
the tribe today is that with the communications that the collective has provided, the
tribe is able to abuse the not-self ego so efficiently. Only here in the 44th gate,
because it is the fear of the past, the intelligent leadership necessary to preserve the
tribe, that every single one of the horrors that we see relative to tribal conflict on the
planet today you can find in this line. The tribe is nearing its close. The era of the
40/37 is coming to an end. The enormous power of the tribe is coming to an end.
It‟s dissolving.
So, at this level, this 5th line rather than being progressive heresy is regressive. It's
very different. They will never be able to truly be my counterpart and give of their
ego in a relationship that is rewarding for the whole. They can only be manipulated
to do this. It is the only way. And in that way they can be manipulated to serve the
tribe, to be the tribal army. After all, so many of the tribes that are violent, what
they do is that they take very young children and they really brainwashed them.
They brainwash them into being the ideal abuse soldiers and abusers that go with it.

The 5/2
LAC Incarnation 2
The one thing you can say about the 5/2 is that it opens the door to the 6. It‟s true,
it does. There is this perspective that comes with being a hermit, that for those that
carry the 2nd line there is always the potential of magic in this life to be called. It‟s
there. The 5/2 can be called and it can be called to universalization. It's rare. They
don't like being projected on that they can do something that they're not sure they
can actually do. They don't have the security of the 1st line foundation.
But it‟s this recognition patterns that‟s here. The 44.5 says it's so simple to
understand how the ego works. It‟s so easy to see. All you have to do, because
they don't understand ego, all you have to do is get them to agree to make a
promise. And you have them. The not-self ego; I promise. And then you die trying
to fulfill the promise because you‟re trying to prove your worthiness. And the 44.5
takes enormous advantage of the fact that the ego world from its perspective,
because it's not-self that they feel, that the ego world feels so worthless, so why not
treat them that way. If you see the pattern, why not just work with the pattern? If
the undefined ego thinks it is worthless then hang impossible carrots in front of its
face and whip it along in its life, get it to do what you want. Why not?

The 6/2 & 6/3
LAC Incarnation 2
Aloofness; we know that what you're seeing here is the limitation of the tribe. Why
do I say that? Think about what I have taught about the 6th line process in the
profile. We have this tripartite life process. We have this deep involvement in the
first Saturn cycle and then we have the on-the-roof cycle, the interregnum between
Saturn and the Kiron return, and this is what we call being on the roof, and being on
the roof is described as an aloof state.
So, one of the things to understand about the 44th gate is that the 44th gate is in no
way prepared for the mutation that's coming. The 44th gate is not prepared for the
mutation that's coming. Not all 6th lines are ready for this coming mutation. They
aren‟t. And here you can see the limitation. The limitation here of the 6th line is to
get stuck in a place. It says: A perfected renewal in which the establishment of a
new form inures one to the condemnation of the rejected; the awareness of patterns
which ensures one's instinctive well-being; and intolerance and arrogance of lesser
mortals; the awareness of patterns which can bolster the ego at the expense of the
well-being of others.
Now, remember that the 6th line is here to be a role model. And they are here to
move from the objective, they go through the subjective into the objective and then
the transcendence that is expected of them as a mutation. The 44.6s don't make
that leap. They stay on the roof. They are enormously, enormously capable of
hypocrisy on that roof.
Now, when I say hypocrisy, again remember that all I'm saying is “do as I say, not
as I do.” And I'm not saying that's wrong and I'm not saying hypocrisy is bad. I'm
just saying; do as I say, not as I do. And of course, this is one of the things that
inures them from the condemnation of others. If you don't do what I say, you‟re
inferior and a lesser being.
So, one of the things about the 44.6 is that it doesn't know how to be an example.
It knows how to be a leader, but it doesn't know how to be an example, and is
deeply threatened by being an example. Now, if you come in on this cross, the 44
with the 6th line, one of the things that I'm concerned about is that with these beings
their immune systems are not prepared for their post-Kironian stage. Their immune
system is not prepared.
I think this gate is an indication of why I talk about the fact that the human species
is beginning to die, and it‟s beginning to die out. And you can see the beginning, the
roots of this, in this 6th line. It's the beginning of the end for the species. So I have
certain biological concerns about these people. I don't know how well equipped they
are. It will be interesting to see statistically what that really means.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 3
A Digital Book for Students
The thing that is so impressive about 3rd line beings is that they learn to have a thick
skin, otherwise they die. So if you‟re a 6/2, it‟s one of the things that you learn in
the beginning about the condemnation that can be there from others. How painful it
is to fail when you're dealing with ego. Yet, over and over and over again
throughout all of these lines what you get is this keynote of patterns.
Now, this isn‟t the 5th gate. I described to you the aroma density, the dog world, if
you will; this is where the pattern is. The pattern is in the instinctive aroma density
and it's the pattern that‟s referred to throughout. And there's a limitation here. The
limitation is that there is no mutation possible when you get to the roof. There isn‟t.
There is no mutation. It‟s just stuck. You‟re up on the roof, you‟re going to stay on
the roof, you‟re going to keep watching the movie and you‟re going to watch the ship
sink.
And of course, what are you facing? You‟re facing the Quarter of Mutation that
brings only one thing absolutely for certain, 16 gates pointed at death. It‟s what you
get. 16 gates pointed at death. So when you're at the very edge here, you‟re sitting
on the 6/3 horse here, you have to see very clearly you know what‟s out there in
front of you. You can see it; you can smell it. And in the end, everyone cries out
the same thing. I don't mind, but is there a purpose? As long as there's a purpose,
it‟s all okay.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 4
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
It begins with the 1. It begins with the yangest of all hexagrams. And when we‘re
dealing with the yangest and we‘re dealing with this concept of the mirroring of
civilization and mutation to see very clearly that the 1 is not something that is
mirrored in a manifesting Throat gate. The binary to the 1 is the driver itself. That
is, the true core of what Sphinx is, this drive, this direction, this movement in our
evolutionary journey.
The Creative is: Creation as a primal force. The energy potential to manifest
inspiration without limitation. So, what we're looking at in any cross configuration in
which the Personality Sun is going to be in that 1st gate is what we're seeing is the
primal force. And we're seeing the primal force in the context of Personality, the
deeply creative Personality. You can have a deeply creative Personality and a
terribly uncreative body. It is one of the dilemmas, after all. And it's one of things
to recognize about Personality and Personality potential because every once in awhile
I wonder if it clicks that every single incarnation cross is rooted in the perception of
the Personality, because it is that solar Personality that is the root of the way in
which we interpret the different variations of the cross.
So, we're dealing with a very powerful creative Personality and this is the most
difficult Personality in terms of giving up the form, or giving up the ghost, as they
used to say when somebody died, which I always thought was an interesting
expression. He‘s given up the ghost. The 1 does not want to give up the ghost.
After all, the 1 is at the beginning of a 16 hexagram progression and you have to see
the very beginning of this deep yang process is that what you're looking at is people
who are going to come in on Sphinx as a scorpion, in other words, they‘re going to
come in with a Personality Sun in the 1st gate, these are beings that have a deep,
deep resistance to physical decay and death. They don't like it and they don't enjoy
it as a direction.

The 1st line is always about authority and it's about authority that has to be
established through a strong foundation. And yet, we‘re dealing with the yangest of
forces. There is no secure foundation. The first thing that the 1st gate recognizes
because it is about direction is that it sees right away what the purpose is
instantaneously.
A 1st line Personality Sphinx comes out of the womb and says, oh no, I know where
this is all going. It‘s going right down the drain. And you want me to enjoy this?
Not only that but the 3rd line underneath says, oh and not only are we going down
the drain, but it's going to be messy all the way. We‘re going to screw up and it‘s

not going to work and I have all this wonderful primal creativity inside of me and no
place to put.
The thing I find so interesting because I know many of them, I know a lot of 1st
hexagram Sphinxes and they really get off on building things. It‘s like, let me be a
2. Let me go over here to the Earth side, okay, let me just be a 2. If I can build
something maybe it'll last longer than me. And you see all these 1st hexagram
Sphinxes who have no idea where
the hell to go. It‘s the most
interesting thing about the 1st
hexagram Sphinx. They are so good
at guiding others. They‘re really
good at saying there's a direction for
you, there is a direction for you, and
most of them are very lost. And the
way they get security for their 1st
line foundation is that they get into
building things. This becomes a
substitute and it becomes a way that
they escape the dilemma of their
Personality.
The beauty of the 3rd line here is
evident here more than just about
anywhere else. That is, what the 3rd
line learns in the life process is that
the creative capacity ameliorates so
many of the problems. In other
words, the 1/3 Sphinx moving along in a direction where there is going to be
dilemma and problems, that there is a creative potential to rise up out of the typical
3rd line fall down business, but rise up stronger and rise up with a creative possibility.
In other words, in the same way that the 1st hexagram tries to escape the
terminology of its process, it‘s the very process itself that really releases its creative
potential, but to get it to that place where it accepts the process, this is very, very
difficult for the 1st hexagram because it is so purely energy.
Energy in of itself seems eternal. Form appears to decay. And as a Sphinx, the
moment you deny someone direction you are resented. It's the greatest dilemma for
Sphinxes and it doesn't matter what configuration you have, everybody knows you‘re
a Sphinx whether they know it or not. There is something that is inherent in the way
in which you aura is felt that leads the other to assume that you can give them
direction of one kind or another. In the core of the 1 is not simply that because it's
all yang it doesn't understand decay, because it's all yang it recognizes the potential
of never dying. If you're looking for immortality, immortality lies within that 1st
hexagram, the potential of immortality.
So, when I talk about how hard it is for the 1 to surrender to creation being the
beginning of a dying process you have to see that inherent in that 1 is this, yeah, but
it‘s not necessary. This is what drives the medicine and drives the therapies and

drives so many things in which we‘re trying to maintain the longevity. It's also
essential. If we didn‘t have this yang force, this yang mutative force, we wouldn't
live long enough as a species to eventually develop a level of consciousness we
need. So, everything is a binary. In the same way that the yang by refusing to
surrender to death pursues all kinds of things that lengthen our lives and all this
stuff, at the same time, when they get to the end of their lives as not-self, they‘re
the ones who suffer the most. They're the ones who are so distraught by the
process coming to an end.
When I first began looking at designs and I knew many Sphinxes in my tribal life
here, I realized that they were very much unaware of the fact that they were
providing direction to people, because it wasn't done in a formal sense. It was never
somebody coming up to them and saying, can you tell me which way to go. It was
always people being with them and hearing them say something that became their
way to go. And the Sphinxes in and of themselves rarely recognized their power.
And the Sphinxes that the least recognized their power are 1st hexagram. They just
don‘t. They‘re so absorbed in their own dilemma, they‘re very, very much caught in
the fact that they have this deep creative urge within them, and there's all these
limitations around which are limitations of their body, after all.
Most cases for the Sphinx, that's why the Sphinx has great outer authority. Their
inner authority it's so frustrating for them, because the moment that they hand over
the control to their body their creativity is not only limited, but it‘s channeled and it's
channeled into the body‘s process, not into what the Personality thinks it can do. No
matter how much Stephen Hawking wants to dance, it‘s not going to happen. It
doesn't matter how much the Personality consciousness is creative and can see itself
dancing in its consciousness and it can do wonderful choreography in its
consciousness, to integrate that into the body is another story. Your body has to be
willing.
What you get to see with Sphinxes is this outer power, who they think they are as a
yang force, who they think they are, is a primal creative force. And when they talk
to you out of their outer authority, and they say, I've been there and that was really
terrific and I loved it, bang you're gone. There is enormous power in that on the
outside.

RAC Sphinx 4
Everything about the 1/4 is to recognize its fixedness. And yet, at the same time to
see that in many ways in Mutation the 1/4 is much more significant than the 4/1
juxtaposition. That is, that it is the unconscious ultimately that can be influential,
the form itself. And this is one of those places where the 1 can see the advantage of
its form. That the form is a way in which it can get its creativity out.
The relationship between the 1/8 is the relationship of the artist, the 1, with the
gallery owner, the 8. And there is something about the searching of immortality

through creativity that‘s so much a part of the 1 process. With the 1/4 the potential
always lies in the form. The form itself may be the way to express the creativity
because the 4 being transpersonal is going to be able to influence others with that
creative feeling.

The 2/4
RAC Sphinx 4
It's a beautiful line, the 2nd line. It says: Love is light. These are very lonely
people, the 2/4s. The 2nd Personality is something that is really is such a filter, a
very strong filtering force. It doesn‘t let everything in. Because it's open to the call,
one of its basic things is that it's very picky. People think that the 2 is just this
shyness business. It‘s just picky. So, it doesn't put off that vibration that says I'm
here, you can call me easily. It puts up barriers to block away those forces that it
doesn't want to be forced to respond to in terms of the call.
Now, when you're dealing with a 2/4 Sphinx you have to see that there are all these
people outside saying, excuse me, could you tell me where to go and the Sphinx
does. Get lost; don‘t bother me. I don‘t know where you want to go. You figure out
where you want to go. And as a Sphinx, the moment you deny someone direction,
you are resented. It's the greatest dilemma for Sphinxes, and it doesn't matter what
configuration you have, everybody knows you're a Sphinx, whether they know it or
not. There is something that is inherent in the way in which your aura is felt that
leads the other to assume that you can give them direction of one kind or another.
And the moment you meet a 2/4 Sphinx and you know that they could help you, you
also realize right away that they may not.
One of the things about the 1st hexagram is why bother to show them the way when
in the end it's meaningless anyway, and how influential that is. They‘re at their best
really alone. And only alone can they finally find their way. Now, that's very difficult.
Most 2/4s get stuck in their family aura. It‘s very hard for them to get out of that.
It‘s not an easy thing. It‘s very difficult for them to escape the direction that they
have inherited both genetically and socially.
One of the things about the 1 as a 2/4 is that they belong in a cave somewhere, at
least once in their life. It doesn't have to be an uncomfortable cave. It‘s just about
isolation. It‘s just about seeing that it's only a process within themselves that
ultimately is going to give them the ability to be open to others, to be open to others
to actually be in a situation where they can actually give that kind of direction.

lot as children, particular the 3/5s because there is a projection on them that they
are going to be ―better,‖ that they're going to be the ―best.‖ And that places
enormous pressure on them and it's not possible, after all.
When we‘re dealing with the 2/5, again what you have to see is that this is a Sphinx
that is saying to you, leave me alone, find your own way, and at the same time there
is this unconscious that is calling. This is always the dilemma of the 2/5. This is one
of those cases where the 2/5 could be very beneficial. Remember that 2/5s and 5/2s
are self-motivated beings. So when you're looking at somebody who is a 2/5, the
very fact that they're pulling such a strong force towards them it opens up the
possibility for them, if they're correct, where they can benefit in a deep material way
from their ability to put the creative direction into others, and it is a creative
direction. In other words, they can be very inspiring.
Now, the whole thing about 2/5s and their inspiration ability, the same thing with the
3/5s, they can be very inspiring as long as they're not held responsible. It's so
interesting when you look at the 1st hexagram that its basic tendency is not to
recognize that it is directly giving direction. So the moment that you meet that 2/5
and you get inspired by them, if it‘s indirect everything is wonderful. If there is a
moment where they really assume it's because of you, there are all kinds of
problems, because the 1st hexagram does not want to take that responsibility.
It is a primal individual melancholic creative force. When it does something, it
doesn't do it for anyone. It doesn't do it to share; it doesn't do it in any way other
than the secondary quality of empowerment. And this is basically this kind of
Sphinx. It‘s an empowering Sphinx, but it's not a directing Sphinx. It's not like the
Sphinx of the 2nd hexagram that says: This is the direction. This is 1st hexagram that
says I going here and the other person says, wow that's a great idea. It‘s like why
don‘t I do that. In other words, it's a very different power of Sphinx.

The 3/5  2  13
RAC Sphinx 4
The longer I know 3/5s, the more I recognize that they‘re the experimental rats in
the lab. It‘s really what they are. At every level you look at them you think, how do
they do it. You‘ve got this 3rd line Personality; we know what a 3rd line Personality is
all about, there is this process for them that‘s difficult. If you're not a 3, and it
doesn't matter whether you're somebody who is a 6 who drops to a 3 in the thematic
of the phases, I mean a real 3, if you‘re a real 3 you were born on this side of the
good news world. If good news is over here, when you‘re born as a 3, you‘re over
here. And it‘s like, what do you mean good news. When a Sphinx who is a 3 says to
you, that‘s the way, you can already tell that it‘s been censored. It‘s like, it‘s so bad
this way you have no idea. I don‘t want to tell you about all this because I don‘t
want to go over it again, but you'll find out, go ahead, and go on, I dare you.
The moment you‘re a 3 you start off with this—I see the look, I know the look so
well—it‘s this look that says if anything is going to go wrong, it's going to go wrong,

and I'm going to know about it. All of this on the other end, yes, it‘s a nice world
down there and the 3 is going, yeah, yeah, you‘ve got to get there. And it‘s going to
cost you on the way. You know how much it‘s going to cost you on the way. For the
1st hexagram this is very painful. The 3/5 Sphinxes are almost chimeras, ghosts
themselves. To be a 1st hexagram and you've got this 3rd line and you‘re trying to
avoid the fact that you're in a damn body and the body is going to deteriorate and
this 3rd line says, not only is it going to deteriorate, but it‘s going to be fast.
Anything that is going to go wrong with my body is going to go wrong.
The other thing is the outside. The 3/5 kid, he‘s eight years old and is standing on a
street corner, somebody who desperately needs direction immediately goes up to
them and says I‘ve got this problem, I'm bleeding to death, where‘s the doctor. And
the 3/5 goes like this—who knows. There is absolutely no guarantee that that's the
right direction. As a matter of fact, it can be totally off. The kid goes like this and
the guy goes like this and dies on the way. You don‘t want to go to a 3/5 Sphinx 1st
hexagram and say to them, excuse me, I'm really desperate, tell me which way to
go. And they don‘t want to tell you because they know that 99 times out of a
hundred, no matter where they tell you to go, something goes wrong and you get it
all back, all of it.
Not only that, but they're angry with you. The 5 underneath, the expectation that
this is going to be the great Sphinx, this is the person that is really going to tell me
where to go—I have a great place for you to do this. Ha. The 1st hexagram gives
out its direction without really seeing it. They don't recognize what they're doing.
They don't understand the responsibility in what they're doing. They don't see it.
And of course, 3/5s from the very beginning of their life are going to be constantly
doing this. These are the kind of children that are going to have trouble figuring out
what's left and what's right; which is my left shoe and which is my right shoe.
They can be extraordinarily different, though, as creative beings. For me the 3/5 is
the heart of abstract art, as an example, or surrealism, all of these very odd, odd
ways in which the creative force can emerge. These are the kinds of artists that
nobody sees that they've got the right direction. Nobody can understand that
direction. Why are you creating statues out of Coca-Cola bottle caps? You look at
that direction and you think whatever.
They have the worst reputations as artists. If you‘re a 3/5 and you paint like Renoir,
everybody's going to shit on you until your dead. Oh, it‘s terrible, it‘s retro, it
doesn‘t‘ really doesn‘t work, it doesn‘t look good. These are the kind of beings that
they learn out of their trial and error, they develop things out of their trial and error,
but always there‘s the projection on them that they're going to be this or that and
when they don't give you this or that, like giving you the wrong direction, they take
all this heat.
So, I was just trying to show you the positive side. The dilemma of the 3/5 is to
really see that there is also this creative side. But again, everything you notice
about the 1 is that ultimately it tries to find a way to concretize immortality. And
that's its theme. In other words, the yang spirit understands we're going out the
door. And the yang spirit is deeply upset with the form that it's given. In other

words, the passenger is saying, if this form was immortal everything would be okay.
Then I could have my creative force forever, but the form is lousy.
What you end up with is that they try to create immortal forms. Whether that's as
literature or art or music or architecture, you name it, they try somehow to create
something that will live longer than them. And it has become an archetype for the
yang. It is an archetype for the male psyche. If you touch the male psyche, what
you will get at the deepest level is that they want to be able to do something in their
life that will survive their death. In most cases, it ends up being your children.

The 3/6  2  13
RAC Sphinx 4
The 3/6 in this case is very different from the 3/5. First of all, we're dealing with the
first of the 6th line profile, so we‘re dealing with a mutative process. We're dealing
with very, very deep depression in the early part of the life. Now, again, it's going to
depend a lot on the overall design. The 3 is a signal in the 1st hexagram for creative
production; in other words, the ability to creativity out. After all, the 3 is about the
mundane, it is about living in the world. It is about dealing with the consequences of
the world. And their pessimism is well earned. If you‘re going to live in the world
you‘re going to learn right away that things don't work as promised.
But the 5 at the unconscious level always deals with very severe consequences to its
actions; whereas, with the 6 it's different. After all, the process of the 6 is one in
which they are ultimately here to be examples. They are here to be leaders. They
are here to be trusted. And that is based on them properly going through their
process. If I had a child, who is a 3/6 Sphinx, this configuration, I would be very,
very concerned about their mental stability in their first Saturn, not their creative
potential. In other words, I wouldn't be nurturing their creativity; I would be
nurturing their psychological balance . It‘s very, very depressing to be a 3-3 dealing
with a 1 Personality. It's depressing. It's obvious that it‘s all a joke and it's not a
joke that's funny. It‘s not funny at all.
Babies are amazing when they‘re born. You look in their eyes when they‘re born—I
had that privilege where you see the first time you look at those eyes. The 3-3, 1 in
this case, the eyes will tell you right away, it‘s like oh no, no, why. Let me go back
out. There are certain things I know that are very spooky. 40,000 babies die every
hour. How many of them are 3/6s or 6/3s? There is something about this oh no,
because they know they're going to have to go through all the shit of the concretized
plane. All it, and they're not going to miss a foul smell along the way. And they
know it. And they know it before they take their first breath, before they say their
first word, before they take their first step, they know it right away. And here, boy
do they know it.
What is very powerful for these babies will be a tremendous amount of love. They
will have to have this sense that contact with the physical body brings enormous
reward and that the physical body is something wonderful. These are babies that

The 4/6
RAC Sphinx 4
If you meet a 4/6 Sphinx on the road they will always give you directions. And
depending on what phase of their life they‘re in, the directions will range from being
wonderful to being ridiculous. However, there is a difference between subjective and
objective. And no more is that evident than in dealing with the 4/6. After all, to
have a 4th line Personality is to be deeply, deeply influential. And when you think
about the 4 and everything that we know about the 4, when you look at the 4th line
of the 1st hexagram, which is about aloneness, you see right away about the risks
involved in receiving direction from a 4/6 before it has done its homework, shall we
say. Give me a post-Kiron 4/6 Sphinx and I will listen to their direction. This is the
thing; and for them to go through this process.
In dealing with the direction, their direction is not so much physical direction as it is
social direction. In other words, we could call this the fiddler on the roof

saying that you'd be really good with this one over here. This is a great job. This is
kind of like; you‘d be really good with this one over here. But don‘t trust them when
they‘re in their Saturn cycle, because that‘s how they learn. They learn to recognize
the social forces that can help move their creativity.
Remember, you cannot escape with the 1st hexagram this deep, deep, deep primal
force to be creative. It‘s a line of tension. And everything about the 4/6 is about
they have to see. These are the kinds of beings that will really begin to flower
creatively on the roof. This is the only time that they really can release their
creative potential.

the 49 and the 4 really changes the dynamic because we're not talking about a
Sphinx anymore.
It‘s very important to see that juxtaposition is really a very abrupt shift in energy.
And it's only after we go through juxtaposition that we can settle into the four
variations of the left angle. So, juxtaposition takes a lot of weight. All transition
profiles and juxtaposition is a harmonic profile, a transition profile, that all of them
have a 6th Color Personality with a 1st Color Design. So we know that whenever
we're dealing with a transition profile
we're dealing with something that is
inherently vulnerable physically. In
other words, juxtaposition, in and of
itself, in taking the shock of this
switch at the unconscious level, it is
much more vulnerable.
It's important to see that whenever
you're looking at transition profiles
or harmonic profiles you're always
looking at the fact that the very
ability to be a bridge is also a
physical limitation for them and a
risk. Self expression; all of a sudden
the directional capacity that is
inherent in the 1-2 becomes only
personal—your formula, your
principles, to express your
principles, to express your formulas,
this very, very tight very narrow out.
This is one of the things about the 4 as the Personality and that the Personality has
this split personality quality. It's easy to get confused between a 4/6 and a 4/1 with
the 1st hexagram. It's very easy.
The very quality of the networking that‘s in the 4, so you end up going to a 4/1 for
direction and they look at you like you're mad—what are you asking me for. I don't
know. This typical ―I don‘t know.‖ I‘m just doing my thing. There is a lot of
pressure on 4/1s because it's assumed that they are Sphinxes, and they're not. So,
they end up alienating a lot of people. And they end up alone, which is really good
for them.

The 5/1
I find this left angle cross to be one of the most curious that I have been able to
watch over the years. I‘ve been able to watch it in a friendship I've had for over 20
years. I'm now watching it in my little son's best friend. It is fascinating to see this
at work. And this is the Left Angle
Cross of Defiance. Now, I have
described this cross as the person
that goes into the desert and God
shows up and God says, I will make
you my servant and you will have
this glorious life representing me,
what you think. And the Cross of
Defiance says, no, I don‘t want it.
And then the Devil shows up and
says I‘ll give you everything that
you want, you be my servant. And
the Cross of Defiance says no I
don‘t want it.
It doesn't really matter what you
offer the Cross of Defiance, it‘s
going to say I don't want it. It
doesn't even know why it says I
don't want it which is why it
suffers. The great suffering of the
Cross of Defiance is that it has no idea why it says no, or why it is defiant. It doesn‘t
know why it is defiant. And then it‘s going crazy inside. It‘s like, that was a great
opportunity, I just missed that, and there I am saying no.
It's so cute with my son's friend. It‘s a game we play with him. We‘re always
offering him something to eat and he always refuses. He always refuses. And it's
not that he doesn't like what's there, you can see his eyes, but there is this
helplessness in being the Cross of Defiance. The most fascinating thing is that he
doesn't say, ―No, thank you.‖ He says, ―No, please.‖ There‘s this guy—I‘m really
helpless in this. Please, don‘t do this to me. It‘s really hurting me that I‘m saying
no to this. It‘s killing me, please. It‘s so funny. And I‘ve watched this with my
friend over the years. It doesn't matter. You can go up to this guy with a bag of
whatever, of endless wonders and promises—Cross of Defiance. And they don‘t
know why.

So, when you get to the 5/1 this is The Energy to Attract Society, and this is
what's so interesting about these beings is that they‘re very, very attractive forces.
They really are, but they never do what you want them to do, never. It‘s what
makes them so interesting. My friend here over the years was one of my teachers.
His very path of defiance was so beautiful to watch that he would defy everybody
else's rules, everybody else's standards, and out of that would emerge this creative
force with its own unique process. But everybody would look around at it and
complain, because nobody could get what they wanted from it.
Now, if you‘re an attractive force and you're not giving anything, this is the whole
dilemma the 1, it‘s in it for itself. It doesn‘t understand the responsibility to the
other; it doesn't see its creative primal direction as something that is truly of value
to the other, is surprised when the other is attracted to it. And of course, it‘s a 5/1,
it‘s all projection. The moment you're attracted to force like this, the projection says
oh, this is going to be terrific, right, and then the moment that you're really there
you realize you're not going to get anything, nothing at all. As a matter of fact,
you're going to have to give up a lot, because they take. That's the other side.
It‘s a Mars line, and it's about ego endurance. They will defy God and the Devil with
their last breath. And you can see that in this defiance is the ultimate transpersonal
1st hexagram statement about death. NO. No, I don‘t want to have anything to do
with dying, nothing. You want me to die, no; I‘m going to defy you. So, for them,
the whole process of life, because of denial, because of this constant defiance, they
end up with very, very difficult processes. And they are very paranoid; it's a 5/1.
And because of defiance they actually turn down the possibility to gain at the
foundation level.
The 1st line is a great study line. It's a great investigation line. It‘s a great learning
line. In most cases whenever you see the 1, the one thing you can be sure of is that
these are people that have cared about taking information in. But when you have a
5/1 that‘s defiant—I don‘t want to learn that. And there‘s nothing you can do. I
keep telling the mother of his child, look, you have to play reverse psychology
almost all the time, and because they‘re clever, without letting them know that
you're doing reverse psychology. Because if you want that child to learn something
and you say to that child, you‘re going to learn this—no, no, I don‘t want to learn
that.
This is the horse that you bring into water and it doesn't drink. It will refuse. You‘re
going to learn how to play the piano, and you drag this kid off and it‘s saying no, no,
no. And you drag it off and you force it to go through 20 minutes with a teacher and
when you pick him up and you say how was it, they say (softly and not understood).
And the next time it‘s the same thing, no I don‘t want to go, no I don‘t want to go.
They end up with lives in which they‘re dragged through things they don‘t want to
do, so they don‘t learn.

The 5/2s that we‘ve looked at, this Buddha in the cave, and here is the real Buddha
in the cave. They can be so impressive. Remember, this is about attracting society
with your creativity. And it also gives you a hint about the way in which the Cross of
Defiance can be healthy. Again, we're dealing with the deeply creative principle.
Whenever I do the charts of musicians, it's interesting for me that whenever I see
the 1, you know that somebody is deeply musical but you can‘t tell what kind of
instrument they're going to play. But the piano players that I've worked with over
the years who are really good all have the 1. And there is this capacity within this 1
to be able to touch the creative spectrum. It can be very beautiful. And obviously
this is a deeply attractive force. But of course, the 5/2 has this self-motivation
problem; it has this 2 at the unconscious that says my body is not calling you.
You're just attracted to my personality and aside from that, no. This is the great
―no.‖
My concern for the Cross of Defiance is that they have a very difficult time with love.
You can imagine how difficult that can be, because there's always a part of them that
wants to say no, that wants to be defiant in terms of the game, the rules, how it's
played. And of course, this can be very, very difficult on somebody who has to be
with such a being. It's not easy. These are not easy people.
The 1st gate is a role gate, and in genetic continuity each of these lines represents a
creative quality in all of us that we can see through our Personalities. I have a 5th
line Personality; I do understand the power of this, to attract society and not know
how you do it. It‘s just like something that comes out. It‘s part of every heretic.
It's part of the underlying thematic in genetic continuity to any 5th line.
And yet to see that within this configuration how difficult it is, because the very
attraction, the very society coming is immediately met with, ―I don't care if you're
here, I don‘t want to have anything to do with you,‖ or, ―if you are here and I don't
want to have anything to do with you, before you go, let me take something from

the ultimate stage in the roof process for a 6th line being. In other words, what
you're really looking at in genetic continuity is that this 6th line expresses the roof.
And you can see that there is no creative infrastructure for the post-roof process.
The creative process is a balance between the subjective and the objective. But

there is no quantum beyond that. In other words, the 1/6 moves towards objectivity
in the extreme without understanding that objectivity is only to be pursued as a
balance to subjectivity, and that beyond that is a quantum of being the example.
Objectivity is about clear assessment. And one of the things about the Cross of
Defiance is that this may in fact be the ultimate objective configuration. They‘re
very, very good at that. They're very good at assessing talent. They will defy any
kind of standard established by anyone else. And they will put out their standard.
They will put out their assessment.
If you meet a 6/2 who is on the Cross of Defiance, and as long as you're not dealing
with them on a personal relationship basis in the sense that you have to deal with
them as somebody directly in your life, these are the kinds of beings that will tell you
if you're good at what you do, if you have potent in what you do. They‘re the kind of
person that you want to ask about a book, a philosophy, a painting, an artist, a
movie, whatever. They have a tremendous capacity to be able to assess it
objectivity as long as it's away from them. They're not objective about themselves.
They‘re not capable of it. This is a 6th line theme. What they go through in the first
28 years of their life is devastating.

You have to realize how difficult it is to have the 3-3, which is a form principle.
There is no greater former principle in all of the number associations of lines than
this phenomenon of the 3/6 or the 6/3 living the 3-3 in the first 28 years of their life.
And if you're dealing with this through the 1st hexagram you have to see wow, is that
difficult. You are really drawn into the deep dark decay of form, that bodies make
mistakes, that the form is full of mistakes everywhere you look.
Remember you're looking with the potential of a very clear creative eye that sees
these things. Most of all, it sees ugliness. When you touch any 3-3 you are touching
the ability to be confronted throughout your life with what is ugly. And so much of it
rubs off. This is about seeing the worst part of life, so you end up seeing the worst
part of people. You end up seeing the worst part of everything that you look at.
And not everybody that goes up on the roof goes up on the roof in a healthy way.
They don't. Most of them are in recovery when they go up on the roof trying to deal
with the shock that they've gone through.
And this process of objectivity, they would like to have more than 20 years. This is
the dilemma of the 1.6. You have to understand that if you're dealing with the
Sphinx who is a 6/2 or 6/3 you have to recognize they don't want to come off the
roof, because they think it's just another step closer to death. It's like staying up on
the roof is almost a kind of immortality. They get so aloof, they get so cool, and
they can stay up there forever as if nothing is ever going to happen to them again
because in juxtaposition to what they went through in the first part of their life, this
is almost heaven.

Whenever we‘re looking at a 6/3 we‘re looking at the doorway. And we're looking at
the doorway to the next cross. When we're moving from the 1st hexagram we‘re
going to move to the 43rd hexagram, and we're going to move to explanation.
Objectivity leads to explanation. Objective creativity demands explanation.
But the 6/3 goes through a tremendous process on this particular cross. I doubt
very much that most of them have a creative life, because of what goes on in the
first 28 years of their life and how difficult that is. If you cannot get to a point where
you can find the equilibrium of objectivity, then it is not possible for you to embrace
life as it is, that life that leads to death, that this in fact is the great art.

Introduction
Whenever we have a cross where the Personality configuration is in opposition, then
obviously we have a cross that has unusual power. And the power is rooted in the
very defining of it. Not all crosses are part of what is the hardwiring of somebody's
design. For many beings having their cross become something that they experience
is quite a complex process. Those four different gates can be in centers that are
defined, undefined, how they connect, whether they generate, whether they
manifest, are they projected, is it dormant, there are all these many, many different
configurations. But the moment that you have, as we have here in any of these
configurations out of the 43, we have definition. What we have is the root of
understanding this cross, whether we look at it from the 23 or we look at it from the
43, it is the channel that we are discussing.
The 43/23 is about efficiency. Those of you that have participated in my teaching
process over the years know that one of the things that I'm very good at is that if I
teach something the first time when I teach it the second time I've already
compressed what I taught the first time and I'm able to elaborate even more in the
same time frame. Ultimately, if I keep on doing that, the end result is an enormous
amount of information that has been compressed into the same time it took me to
teach the original beginning of that process.
Now, this is a 43/23 process. The 43/23, because it recognizes that the body is the
problem—think about that, the 43/23 isn‘t like the 1 by itself. The 43/23 is a defined
mechanism, it‘s a defined channel, it's always running, it's always wired, insight
leading to the potential of explanation, explanation leading to new insight, on and on
and on it's always there and it's always working. Now, if you grasp the underlying
mechanic, here we‘re dealing with five yang lines but one yin. The yin line is the 6th
line at the top. And that 6 yin line at the top changes the process completely. It‘s
like the difference between who has one gate in the center and somebody who has
none—apples and oranges.
All yang is enormously different from mostly yang and one yin. That one yin
changes everything because that one yin tunes into another process. And you can
see that the moment we leave the 1/8, the opposition, and we go to the 43/23 we‘re
immediately seeing this drama that we're going to look at, which is the opposition to
the Throat. The 43/23 begins this process of seeing eleven of the mutative gates of
the sixteen hexagrams. They are going to have an opposition that‘s a Throat gate.
And the Throat gate because it is a manifesting gate that the yang version of the yin
form is the way out.
In other words, in order to understand how to get out of the form successfully you
look to its opposition on the other side. So, when we're dealing with a 43/23 the
insight of the 43 and the explanation of the 23 is let‘s make life more efficient for the

body. If the body can benefit from greater efficiency we will at least live longer, and
maybe we can get to the point that we‘re so efficient that we may not die. This is
the potential of mutation.
If you have a mutative mind, you know that at any moment at any time anywhere a
miracle can occur. You just know that. It‘s not like you count on it, because if you
count on it you‘re going to go to die sad, but you do know that the potential is
always there. You know there may be a moment of inspiration that will change the
world. It's happened before. It will happen again. So basically this is sort of like
cryogenics. Cryogenics is the science of freezing bodies so that they can be
preserved perfectly so that they can be revitalized later when science provides the
infrastructure to look after them. This is a 43/23 craziness.
The 43/23 is great all these ideas.
They‘re wonderful with these
concepts. Okay, so the body is going
to die. What we‘re going to do is
figure out a way how to freeze this
body and then 150 years from now
when that spark has happened and
the solution is there, then we‘re
going to be able to come back into
the world and live forever—the 43/23
efficiency.
It‘s a 43/23 mind that created the
kinds of ways in which we‘re able
to—if you have to run around chasing
game, you‘re going to spend a long
process in your life being vulnerable
to quick death. But if you have a
nice little fence in the backyard and
you‘ve got a couple of cows there and
sheep, it‘s very efficient. It's very clever. Everything about the 43/23 is it is
structuring. So the whole thing to understand about the approach of the 43/23 to
death is let's find a structure that makes it more acceptable. And let's find a
structure that may put it off.
Now, I‘m a 43/23 and what do I teach you, I teach you that the body is not yours
and that the passenger should really relax. Not only that, I describe the Bardo
states when you die going out. I give you all these efficient ways to live in your
body without resistance and you live longer and you‘re healthier. That‘s 43/23
thought. This is what the efficiency is about.

The 1/3
So we begin with this Cross of Explanation and we begin with Patience. Isn‘t that
wonderful? The 1st line is Patience: The recognition that new forms cannot be
established until resistance has been eliminated. New forms—this is not about new
ideas, new concepts, but new forms. And remember the 43 is directly connected to
the Throat and the Throat is capable of ultimately manifestation. So, what you have
is this patience. Look, it‘s okay, we‘re going to die. But let's work on our
structuring, if we can make things more efficient. And nobody's better at this than
the 1/3.
When you‘re dealing with the Cross of Explanation, when you have a 1/3, it‘s not like
you want any explanations from them early in their life. You have to let them go
through their experiential process. But because of the depth of the 1st line
Personality, because of the need of the 1st line Personality to be an authority, then
having a 3 underneath they will quickly get rid of faulty explanations, structures that
cannot really work. And they can be very, very inspiring. After all, it‘s an
empowerment channel. They can be very empowering in terms of what we need to
work on as a better form.
So, what you get from the 1/3 is that it begins to see that there are problems in the
form. They can be very, very good in terms of the health industry. They‘re very
good in creating structures to maintain the viability of the human life. A 3 is more
likely to recognize a new form faster than anybody else, because they will bump into
the. You‘re walking along the road and there is something that doesn't belong there,
it‘s the 3 that notices that because they bump into it. So in the 1/3 is this possibility
to learn about developing the form.
When I look at the hexagrams, I'm often simply inspired by how they look. And the
moment that you look at the structure of the 43 and you've got these five yang lines,
and you‘ve got this yin sitting on top, and if you watch the process it gets heavier
and heavier and heavier until you can see the whole creative force smack down; just
looking at it. So the 43 is the first one after the pure six yang lines, it‘s the first one
to feel the pressure of the form. And not only does it feel the pressure of the form,
but you can't get that sucker off your back. It‘s there.
The point is that the moment it's there, it is more powerful than all those yang lines,
because the form principle is the channeling force for the energy. And it doesn't
matter how powerful the river is, the river will obey the laws of form. It can‘t do
anything but. If there is a damn in its way it will not go beyond it. It's going to have
to deal with the consequences of the form.

And whenever you're thinking about the 43rd hexagram, look at this image because it
is such a compelling image. It tells you so much about the pain of the mutative
process. It‘s this heaviness that‘s coming down onto all the yang-ness, weighing it
down, bringing it back into the world. In the same way that Civilization is this
heaviness to the point of inanimate that‘s finally liberated into its energy. Create the
form in the energy has something to flow through. So, in the 43/23 we've got
melancholy. We have death and the weight of the life that is sitting there and the
response is let's create better structures.

The 1/4
RAC Explanation 4
When you‘re dealing with the 1/4 it‘s different. One of the dilemmas of the 1/4 is
that it tends to lock into the structuring that was given it by its family, its family
environment. Remember that whole story about the 1/3 and 1/4 children, the 1/3
child will challenge its parent, the 1/4 child will not. It‘s just a basic difference in
them. And the 1/3 child is ready to see the faults and flaws and problems of its
parent and the 1/4 child doesn't want to. It's rather disturbing for them.
So, when we're dealing with this whole concept of the form, these are children that
will say the best way to stay healthy is that you have porridge every morning.
Remember they‘re freaks, and they can be very consistent. They say, well, you have
porridge every morning, you eat alpin every morning. This is their thing. And this is
the thing that they will pass on because it‘s what they learned from their parents, or
they have a grandparent that's 102 and this is the way grandma extends her life.
Never, never, never under estimate how paranoid the mutation hexagrams are about
death; death really frightens these people. And when you look at any aspect within
yourself that is troubled by death, which is in fear of the consequences of a life,
you're going to see that it is an attribute that is in this quarter. The 43/23 can be
fixated with death as a concept. I know what that has been for me in my own
process, this morbidity morbid poetry that comes out of 43/23s when they're young,
this whole darkness about the form itself.

RAC Explanation 4
When we get to the 2nd line of the 43, which is Dedication, this will later be the
name that we will see in the left angle variation of this cross, the Left Angle Cross of
Dedication. The maintenance of specialized attitudes; dedication to action. What
you're looking at in this 2 is the recognition that one cannot—it‘s very rare to find
2/4s that are waiting to be called. Most 2/4s are being forced by the call. But in the
43/23, again we‘re dealing the channel, so it's very different. Because the wiring is
there, the impulse is different. And that in this impulse the 2/4 wants to do
something with the structuring. Not just explain it, but get it going in some way.

So, here you can begin to see the way in which mutation brings new forms into
society. Just about all the ways in which we have organized our physical life—
remember that Civilization builds the forms. But in fact, mutation makes them
useful. And not only makes them useful, but expands upon them because it's the
creative force working through a form and through mutation the form can be
changed, but only slowly. The 43/23 says it makes a lot of structural sense and it's
very efficient if you‘re going into surgery that the instruments are clean. Now, that
extends an awful lot of lives.
It‘s the kind of thing where the 43/23 says not only is this an explanation you idiot,
but you‘d better start using it. And they‘re the ones who insist that for themselves,
hey, look, are those instruments clean? Because they understand that the form
itself is not efficient. Everybody knows that when you buy a house or bought a boat
or a car, you only realize that you bought something that is fundamentally
inefficient. And that you‘re going to spend all your time trying to get it to work
properly and maintain it so that it will work properly. It‘s just the way it is,
Every single form that comes into existence has a built-in flaw. They‘re terminal.
They all have shelf life that is limited, every form. So, the creativity on the other
side is immediately upset by this. The yang says to the yin, see, you‘re not so good.
It‘s like, yeah, yeah, you built that but hey, who is going to run it. Who is going to
make it work? Just because its there doesn't mean it's going to work. So the 43/23
is into all its structuring and its efficiency and this is the way we‘re going to get the
best out of the form.
So, dedication is a very, very interesting capacity, to be dedicated to the proper
expansion and development of the efficiency in forms. Of course, this is genius to
freak. And if you're not correct, if you don't operate correctly, some of those
wonderful suggestions are going to be treated with enormous contempt. The 2/4 is
sitting there saying, please call, please call, please call. The 2/4 that‘s the
democrat—let me tell you how to make a better voting machine so people can
actually have a legitimate vote. Let me tell you how to organize this—they‘re sitting
there going, why don‘t you come.
And the difficulty is because they're not operating out of their inner authority that
energy is coming to them, it's natural, a defined channel, the energy is coming to
them, but in fact they're responding or however their function is, that they're not
getting involved with the right things. Oh yes, I‘ll help you structure that. So many
42/23s are wasted, bringing structure to things that have no import, but they‘re
freaks, after all. One has to recognize that.

structure. But rarely does anyone listen to them. And they learn that very young.
Most 2/5s and 5/2s lose their power in the first seven years of their life, most of
them it‘s gone. Because remember about them that they really have to have it
within themselves to bring that out. It can't just be pulled from them. They have to
accept that it will be pulled.
Again, we‘ve see an anomaly here where we have a 2/4 configuration that says,
come I'm waiting for you. I‘m waiting to influence you in the way of structure. But
a 2/5 is different. Very, very early the 2/5 tries to explain to its mother, don't do it
this way. And all hell breaks loose. It doesn't work. One of the things about the
43/23 is that like any of the definition channels, the 43/23, the 20/34, the 40/37
they carry deep prejudices. They carry grudges, deep grudges. It‘s something to
understand about them. If a 43/23 says to you, look the structure is this way, let
me explain it to you and then you don't do it they will never forgive you. It‘s like a
40/37 and the bargain doesn't work. They never forgive you, regardless of who's to
blame.
It‘s like the 20/34, don't interfere with them. They will hold a grudge against you for
the rest of your life. And you have to see that these hardwired oppositions carry
their prejudices. So, you have a 43/23 child who is a 2/5 and they see right away
that their parents, who are supposed to be blah, blah, blah, don't pay any attention
to their brilliant understanding of changing the structure and from then on it's very,
very difficult for them to motivate themselves to bother. After all, they've got the 2
Personality that can very easily step into this, ah, leave me alone. They‘ve got the
paranoia underneath, they‘re not going to listen to me, it isn‘t going to work and of
course they become very, very isolated as beings.

The 3/5
RAC Explanation 4
There is viciousness in the 43/23 that is evidenced in the 3rd line, and I do know it
well. I am a 43/23 with the 3rd lines in my Nodes unconscious. It's one of those
lines that wherever you see Pluto in any hexagram anyway in any line you already
know that it means more than what is written. It has to, Pluto being what Pluto is.
The same with Neptunian lines, for that matter.
In this line of Expediency it is the powerful drive for regeneration that will, when its
insights when its structuring, when its ability to explain, when any of those things
are threatened, it will use any means aligned with any force, endure any
condemnation to achieve its goal. So, it's a very powerful force. And because it‘s a
freak and because it's deeply, deeply individual this is one of the deepest, tightest
tunnels that you're going to meet. I know how narrow this tunnel is that I live with,
with my unconscious 43/23. And any means; I‘ll deal with demons, devils and dogs
in order to get this knowledge out the door. I‘ll deal with idiots, not-self fools,
assholes, I‘ll deal with all of it; expedient. You have to.

So, there is a very, very powerful force. And of course, there is a dilemma in this.
The 43/23 makes mistakes in structuring. It's only natural; that's how it learns.
And so there is always this dilemma that it is expedient and uses all of its power and
ends up doing all of that and it turns out not to be a value; and the price that can be
paid in all of that.
It is about, ultimately, empowerment. And when we are dealing with the 3/5 on this
cross, we're dealing with an enormously powerful force. I've seen them. They‘re
wounded beings, hurt by the fact that no matter how their genius works, the world is
a toilet. And they can't clean it. And no one feels that more deeply than the 43/23.
It's so obvious, that you can‘t fix the structure. So, this whole business of efficiency
that the reaction of the 3/5 because it learns right away in its relationships with
others, that what happens to it is that it gets very, very insular. These are the
runners. These are the ones that run away from their homes, they run away from
their families, they run away from their cities, they run away from their countries,
anything to try to find a place where it's possible, genuinely possible to have a
structure that is efficient. And they will do anything to get there.
When you see these utopian communities you're going to see somewhere in its
hierarchy a 43/23. You see these sects that go off into the jungle, they‘re 43/23s.
I‘ll never forget the guy that gave Kool-Aid to everybody and killed them all off—Jim
Jones—43/23. I have this efficient structure for you. Death is going to come
anyway, but I've arranged for a ship. Let‘s all go together. It‘s so typical of the 3/5,
43/23. They‘ll go anything to put the structure in place, even pretending that the
structure will be in place after you're gone.
If there is ever a profile of hopelessness it can be here, a deep, deep hopelessness.
If you look at the detriment of the 3rd line, it is: individual insight abandoned in the
face of condemnation. These are people that can really give up—the hell with the
world; the hell with this life. This can be more suicidal than any suicide line you find
anywhere. After all, the individual wired mind is very, very melancholic. These are
the kinds of people that commit verbal suicide and not physical suicide, these people
that call up suicide hotlines—I‘m going to kill myself. They don't necessarily have a
body that does the job, but the Personality is just so upset. It‘s like, it‘s just
pointless; again, this on-going battle.
When you think about words, I love words, at the very opening of this hexagram it
says: In order for achievement—and inside of me bells go off—achievement. And
you begin to understand that for a 43/2, if they cannot achieve the implementation
of the structuring, how painful it is. It's all about achievement for them. This is
what they‘re here to do, they‘re here to achieve something, and they‘re here to bring
the structure. And the moment that they see that they cannot bring efficiency then
it's hopeless, that no matter where they go it doesn't work. Ah, do they suffer.
Remember this is a pulse. You have this pulse that says you‘ve got it; you know
how to bring the structure. And nothing new is going to come; maybe nothing ever
again will come. And the world around you doesn't want to listen to that explanation
of that structure. What a life. How sad that is. After all, this is about empowerment
and empowerment through outer authority of mind.

The 3/6
RAC Explanation 4
We know that from other discussions particularly about dealing with the 6th line
profile and the understanding of the vulnerability in the mutative process and the
recognition that when you're dealing with a 3/6 or a 6/3 that you're dealing with this
double 3 phenomena and within the context of this quarter that this can be very,
very, very depressive.
The 3 is everywhere, after all. And not all 3s will experience the trial and error
process as being potentially depressive. But the moment that you're dealing with it
here, when you're dealing with it in a defined channel, that is, a defined individual
mutative channel that has the potential of melancholy, then you have to see that this
is a configuration that I think represents an enormous amount of mental instability in
the first Saturn cycle. These are people that can really lose it. After all, this is very
freaky and can be very freaky. If it is deeply pessimistic and very depressed and
given the environment that it's raising in, if it's not nurtured then there's going to be
a great deal of potential for the kind of madness that you find in the individual
process. In other words, somebody that is totally out of step.
But more than that, what often happens to these beings is that because of the
inherent stubbornness of this 3rd line, so much of this expedience is stubbornness,
the stubbornness to only have what will become in the 4th line of a one-track mind;
in other words, this stubbornness to get that explanation out and to manifest it
somehow. Remember that it seems to the Personality in mutation, that the only way
to extend the vehicle is to deal with the opposition. So the whole thing about the 43
mind is that the 43 mind says I've got an insight and the expectation is that if you
can explain it, it will make a difference in your life; it doesn't necessarily.
Not only that, the individual discovers very quickly that its capacity to be able to
recognize the need for efficiency in structuring isn't necessarily what the collective is
interested in, nor what the collective sees as a problem. The collective has its own
process, which is a pattern process organization and organization doesn't like new
strategies of structuring. It's trying to organize the old structures. And here comes
the 43/23 in the middle of the process and it is shouting that this is not efficient,
stop. And the collective looks at the 43/23 and says, not interested. Well, we don't
have time to test out this new possibility. We have all this investment in what's
already here and we‘re trying to work with this.
I was watching last night, for example, on the news, in England they‘re having an
election campaign and there were some doctors that were discussing the problems of
the health system in England. They were complaining about what doesn't work and
then there was a politician explaining the improvements. All of it is about trying to
be more efficient within a structure that never changes. In their case they have a
national health system, you have a structure that's been established, and the

collective is only concerned with making that structure work, not renovating it, not
going into a new structure, not trying anything different.
You can see how that's expressed all the time. So when you‘re dealing with the 3/6
you get this immediate deep, deep pessimism. And because they are going to use
any means anyway to try to establish that in the first 28 years of their life they really
risk hitting a brick wall in which their ―I know‖ is smashed. In that experience you
can see how difficult it can be for them to ever find some kind of stability on the
roof.
When I look out at the 43/23 cross people that I know, I have this whole Cross of
Explanation in my design, but it‘s not my cross, and I see how much more difficult it
is when it is your cross, the confrontation with the limitation of the concepts of
efficiency as applied to the application of it. And this is the great dilemma of the
43/23. Any cross configuration of the 43/23 is the dilemma that they can know what
would be more efficient and nobody listens to them; no one. They‘re constantly just
barking into the wind. They end up being the kind of people that shake their fists at
the television, because what are you going to do. They won‘t listen. In many
instances you're dealing with incredible insights and nobody listens. These people
can really go mad. They can really feel that they are totally outside of the world.
And out of that you can end up with many different kinds of things that they do to
try to escape, whether that escapism is one kind of addiction or another or obsession
or another, whatever the case may be, they end up being further and further outside
of the norm and they end up having to deal with the consequences for that.
After all this time, it‘s not necessary for me to constantly to remind you that
whenever we‘re dealing with 3s, the 6/3 combination that we need that particular
attention in the way in which we raise these children. It is obvious to us by this time
that a child who is a 3rd line that understands the consequences of being a 3rd line,
who is treated according to their design is going to be able to have a life process in
which trial and error is something of value. The same thing is true for the 43/23
child is that it is an obligation of the parent to be open to the potential structuring
that the child can bring. It‘s very difficult for parents. You don't like it when your
children tell you that it's inefficient the way in which you‘re doing whatever it is
you're doing.
These are the kind of children where—it‘s like working with blocks. It's like working
with Lego. If you have one of these children you try to show them the potential of
how they can apply their efficiency. How they can change structures, how they can
learn to see that structures can be manipulated, that their creativity can operate in
different ways. It's a learning process. It‘s also about trying to get them to add to
the efficiency of the family. These are natural efficiency experts.
Again, according to their design, the way in which you engage them you can save
them a lot of grief. The other thing is that you know that when you‘ve got a 3/6 on
this cross that they are going to very early in their life see the problems in every
structure they meet. The way in which the heating system works in the house, the
way in which the school operates, the way in which the television works. They‘re the

kind of child that looks at it and says what do we need the buttons for? Everything is
about their ability to see that there is a much more efficient way.
Remember, one of the oddities is the 43/23 Projector—I‘m talking about the pure
mental Projector that is a 43/23—no inner authority, very powerful efficiency mind.
It‘s all about efficiency. The moment that we realize that 43/23s are here to
conserve energy this will make a big difference in the way in which listen to them. It
doesn‘t mean they‘re right.
But the fact is what they are really doing, what the 43/23 does as a fixed defined
channel that is a projected element is that it's always try to figure out an efficient
way to use energy because energy is a limited resource. That's why efficiency is that
if you‘ve got a 43/23 in the house they always turn off the lights. It's a very
interesting thing about just habits in different forms. And if they're not turning off
the lights you know that they're dying in a hurry, because they're also wasting their
own energy.
Everything about the 43/23 is to be able to get the same results with less effort. As
a matter of fact, better results, less effort. The amount of effort it takes me to
project my voice to the back of the room diminishes the amount of time I can work
as an effective teacher, so my whole future is virtual. It‘s very efficient. I‘ll end up
being able to teach more people more often with less expenditure of energy and get
a better result for the same work. This is 43/23 thinking. Everything about the
43/23 is how do I manage to achieve the same goal with less effort.
You should see me make breakfast. I‘m a classic because I'm a single definition ego
Manifestor. The timing, everything, nobody on earth, I know this, nobody on earth
can make two eggs, toast and a cup of coffee, make it, clean it, eat it faster than
me. Usually it takes less than 10 minutes, and everything is timed. I know precisely
the condition of the egg relative to when the toast is going to pop up. I know exactly
how much time it‘s going to take to butter the toast and clean the pan. 43/23s are
bizarre. I‘ve got it down to an art. Where it takes people a half an hour to get food
into their body, I use much less energy in a very compressed formula—get it all in
and I‘ve got 20 extra minutes to do something or nothing.
This is the magic of the 43/23. It says let me change the structure for you because
you're finally going to get a vacation. I can show you how to use exactly the right
energy to get that same result from this structure, and you'll still have energy to
spare. And this is the archetype of Projector consciousness.

underneath the 4th line because it is the breaking place where you're going to move
from right angle to juxtaposition.
The genetic continuity of the 4, the 4 is very fixed, this fixed destiny that you see in
the geometry of juxtaposition. Everything about the 4 is that the 4 does not want to
go into the study of the 1, it simply wants to bring outwards the results through the
4. It is here to be of influence, it is here to bring things across. The difference
between the 43.3 and the 43.4 is that the 43.3 is willing to move from one thing to
another to try to find a way, so many things can be transformed. But the moment
that you‘re dealing with a 43.4, they‘re interested, they get fixed in their life in one
thing only. If only if only this was different, everything would be different.
There is a power in that because this is strongly put out, it‘s transpersonal, this is
the thing that has to be efficient. It's great for any kind of specialization. In other
words, these are beings that if they enter into an intellectual specialization this one
track capacity can be a real value to them. But you must always see that inherent in
the 43/23 is mental depression. It's always possible, and it's possible when things
are inefficient. Inefficiency is the thing that kills 43/23s. The misuse of energy, the
misapplication of energy, the failure to be able to transform or transcend or leave a
structure that doesn't work. The one-track mind can't. It stays locked in the battle
and the battle is with the collective.
The moment you talk about the mind there is only one battle. It is between the
collective and the individual and the collective is two to one. The collective has much
more influence on the way the mind works because it's always operating in its
pattern and stream; whereas, individuality is a pulse. And so it doesn't have the
same kind of presence as the collective does in the way in which we work with our
consciousness.
Everything about the 4th line in this context is about understanding how you deal
with obstacles. These are the kind of beings when there is something in their way,
they end up being fixed on only getting that thing out of the way and it becomes
their life's work. How do I break through that obstacle, how do we find a cure for
cancer, how do we break through the obstacle, what is the most efficient way to get
through that obstacle, and then the whole fixedness at trying to break through that.
Obviously, because this is about it, that is, dealing with obstacles, and because it's
about the power of the mind to be able to deal with any obstacle that you're going to
meet in the first phase, the 4/3 phase, you‘re going to meet the inability to be able
to deal successfully with obstacles. The trial and error is going to be very
depressing; the assumption that one is right. What happens to these beings is that
instead of giving up their concept of what needs to be changed they stay obsessed
with it. And each failure brings a deeper obsession until they become crazy people,
the kind of people that gets stuck in wanting to change something that nobody ever
wants changed and they stay with that all of their life as this is what it's all about.
There are still 43/23s who are stuck in 1950s concepts, what should work and what
shouldn‘t work, that have long been passed. And there they are holding on to
whatever that thing is.

Time on the roof is very good for these beings, but again, we always have the same
dilemma when we're dealing with the 6. Wherever we look, wherever we see the 6
we have to accept the fact that their process is not a predictable one. These are
mutative profiles and we k now they're going through three phases in their life and
we also know that the first phase determines everything. It‘s not like you come to
Human Design when you're on the roof and somehow that instantaneously will heal
what happened to you when you weren‘t, it‘s quite a process.
It‘s so important to see that most 6th line beings have been distorted so deeply, so
early, and it's not because it‘s a 3rd line. We know that the 3rd line is really
spectacular. It‘s simply the way in which they have been conditioned to deal with
things not working. And because they're so mental, and because they‘re so
convinced of—they will not accept that something doesn't work because it can't
work. That‘s their deepest problem. When something doesn't work their thing is
there‘s something that we can fix, and not everything can be fixed. So, you get
these very obsessive 43/23s that they can fix things that can't be fixed. And we do
begin to see them as freaks. We do begin to see them as people with mental
oddities. I‘m being polite.

Remember the deepest fear of the 43 is that nobody's going to know what you
mean. You hear a 43/23—me—and if you listen to these recordings unedited, how
many times do you hear me say, ―you know, you know, you know,‖ and this is the
mechanism of the 43/23 looking for the acknowledgment that somehow the insight
has been transferred. Do you know what I mean? Because it's not ―do you
understand me,‖ that‘s a pattern. It‘s not ―do you believe me,‖ that‘s just enjoying
the story. This is about ―do you know, have I put the mutation in you, can you catch
it the way I just caught it?‖ That's very different.
So, constantly what you see with the Cross of Insight is that there is this recognition
in the 4/1 that it's going to be very, very, very hard to get this across. The
advantage is that it‘s a 4 Personality. Basically the way the 4/1 operates is that it
will wait until it has the kind of friendship where it can in casual conversation drop
the cookie. It‘s like, by the way I had this insight. In other words, the first thing
they do is they try to secure the acceptance of what they are, so they‘re almost
secretive. It‘s there inside, it‘s every individual and yet at the same time there is
this possibility because remember it's still a one-track mind. It‘s just a juxtaposed
one-track mind. It still wants to get it across, because it is transpersonal, but its
methodology is deeply connected to the bond it makes with the other.
They wait for those moments where there is a political discussion going on amongst
friends or a philosophical discussion going on and then they just sort of let it out as a
little thing. It's almost like they see if it makes a ripple. And if they immediately get
no reaction or they immediately get a hostile response, they suck it back up, but
they'll never be friends with those people again. Oh yeah, dump them like a stone,
because the 4/1 doesn‘t change. What‘s around it is the only thing that can change.
So, if you have a 4/1 that‘s invested in its network—remember what I told you about
the 4th line; it has to invest in its network even though the whole network isn‘t
rewarding. Now most 4s, depending on their design, will hold onto extended
networks most of their life, even though most of the network will never reward them,
but there's always the hope of the opportunism. But what you see here in the 43/23
is that the network will only be maintained until that point that it's determined that
it's not worth the investment. You‘re not going to hear my insight and be
empowered by it if you don't belong in my network, so I'm going to cut you off.
The frequency of the 4—kindness/meanness—if you want to see meanness, all you
need to do is have an extended conversation with any 43/23. There is a savageness
in structuring. Everybody, because they're not-self, are inefficient within a structure.
There is this quality that is there. So, one of the things that happens here with the
4/1 is that it builds its network, it waits for its timing, it releases its inside, and in a
moment of the insight is not taken in its, they‘re an idiot. I invested all this energy
in them and they‘re an idiot and I'm never going invest this energy in them again
because they're idiots and I didn‘t see that they were idiots.

The 5/1
The 5th line of the 43 is an interesting line. It‘s: Progression: Step-by-step
adaptation to relationships which hinder insight, hinder breakthrough, through
practical actions which will not jeopardize eventual success. This is the most devious
of all 43/23s. They‘re devious because they know something about you and they
know something about themselves. This is not like being an explanation that doesn't
understand that the person they're giving the explanation to is deaf.
But the moment that you get to the left angle, the left angle has transpersonal
qualities. It understands in its own way the fractal. And it also recognizes that in
order to put something new into somebody that you can't just stuff it down their
face. You slide it in. It‘s seduction.
It‘s this step by step—my
Personality resonates to this—it‘s
this step by step process; subtle.
The beauty of progression is that it's
the most sophisticated that the
individual mind can be in its
relationship to the other. It is built
into it an ability to be able to
accommodate the resistance of the
collective in order to be able to
empower them ultimately with
something new. It's quite a gift.
The dilemma in this is that the
moment that the 5 puts too much
effort into the social accommodation
they suffer. In other words, the
social accommodation is useful, but
they're not 4s. These are not
network people. These are the kind
of beings that build an artificial network of strange encounters, to be the stranger of
consequence, but a stranger of consequence that has a way of fitting in, familiarizing
themselves with the others as a methodology for releasing their insight.
But the moment that they get caught up in the relationships, that's when they get
into trouble, because what happens to them is, is that they don't put in the
efficiency, they don't put in the change of structuring because they get to a point
that they're so engaged in the relationship that they are afraid of sacrificing the
bond. So they end up swallowing the very efficiency that needs to be brought to the

situation, but by that point they know if they tell that person look, what you're doing
doesn't work because of this, this and this they will lose them, they will be gone.
So it is a balancing act when you're looking at Dedication, it's a real balancing act.
And the dedication is a funny thing. They carry all this thing that the 43/23 has
which is to find a way to get efficiency into society. When we look at these three
channels that are oppositions that are defined, we have to see that this is the work
of the gods. We must have these things. They‘re very, very important to our
development. And this is the only that‘s mental.
You can look at the 20/34 and see its importance in the dynamic of the way in which
the world is active. You can look at the 40/37 and understand the bonds that need
to be maintained in order to hold the societies together. The 43/23 carries this
mental work that says everything can be made more efficient. Just because
Civilization made the form doesn't mean the form is perfect; the yang transforming
the yin. This is the whole business that is at work.
So when we get to Dedication the dedication is it's a long haul, not a short haul. If
you're a lower trigram 43/23, the insight is already the biggest reward. It‘s like ―I
know!‖ then the horror that nobody listens. But the moment that you‘re a 5/1 you‘re
left angle here, the insight is ―aha,‖ and the rest of it is ―how do I get this across to
these beings; how do I let them know. How do I bring them into this? How do I
bring them to recognize this is the way?‖ There is a subtlety of approach. There has
to be. Every 43/23 confronted with anything goes through this process. It‘s there.

The 5/2
LAC Dedication 2
We lose a lot in the world that 2/5s and 5/2s, because of the way they‘re raised as
not-self, will make a contribution that could make a difference to the plane that we
live on. And there's no question to me that the 5/2 on this cross has enormous
potential. But again, it does not mean that that potential—any time that you see a
5th line, whether it's at the unconscious or the conscious you know right away that
there was psychological damage done to that person in their first three years and
that most human beings never recover.
The difficulty for Dedication is the fear of losing their voice; it‘s the fear of losing
their unique voice. In the accommodation with the other, in the step-by-step
process of trying to bring people into that recognition, are the conditioning elements
that either buries that unique voice of theirs or that unique voice is lost. That 5 that
comes into the world, almost immediately, usually the first time that the baby cries
at a time that's inconvenient for the mother is the moment at the 5th line child
already suffers psychological damage. And it's not because the mother is a bad
mother and it's not because of anything, it‘s just the way in which the aura of the
mother and the aura of the child are going to work. The mother does not expect this
child ever to cry at the wrong time, even though that's absurd. We know that. But
it‘s a 5, after all.

You‘re going to be the best baby, you‘re going to be the best this, you‘re going to be
the best child, you‘re going to be wonder, and you‘re going to be this. And we know
that by the time that you‘re three you‘ve already figured it out in your aura, in your
deep unconscious, that you're a disappointment to those around you. That leaves a
deep psychological mark. And depending on the way in which you operate in this
life, depending on the other things and elements that are there, these scars could
become deep, deep wounds.
So when you're looking at a 5/2, very, very early in life they learn that projection is
dangerous. And they also learn to see something, that when they let somebody in
and recognize because it‘s their nature that they can only bring them to structuring
and efficiency in a step-by-step process that they can‘t bear to have these people
around them. They just can't bear it, because nothing they can do seems to satisfy
these other forces, and they‘re always dealing with the projection, the projection that
it should be faster, all of these things that go with it.
The other thing is the projection working the other way. If you have a 5/1 or a 5/2
they‘re always projecting on the other. So that 5/1 or 5/2 here with progression,
they‘re the ones who are projecting that the other may be able to handle this step-
by-step. And it's also their difficulty in not really seeing who the other is and
whether or not they really can grasp what could be offered to them. Most seducers
don't understand the consequences of their seduction. I‘m always reminded of this
delightful Frenchman in Matrix, you have cause and effect (spoken like the
Frenchman).
It‘s one of the great lessons for the 43/23—cause and effect—to really understand
that when you're looking at the other and projecting on the other that you do not
know if they are correct; the mental dilemma. That's why it's so important again,
this whole process of returning to the simple—be correct, enter into things
correctly—it makes a huge difference in the life because you're not going to have
those kinds of blind mistakes.
There‘s nothing more magical than the potential of structuring efficiency and
empowering others. In the sense that we are living in a mutative environment, in
the sense that we are living in an evolutionary program that constantly we need
updates. Look at what farming was 5,000 years ago and look at farming today. It‘s
still farming, but we‘ve become incredibly efficient. Any stories about inventions and
you get to the heart of the 43/23. The invention of the cotton gin, what that did to
change society is unbelievable. In terms of clothing and all of these things and how
amazing it was, this process of you picking cotton and preparing it and how labor
intensive.
Every single one of these efficiency programs end up benefiting so many beings.
They don‘t benefit everybody. You have to see the inherent prejudices in the way in
which the 43/23 is going to structure. They‘re going to structure for what they see
as those that will need a structure. It's rare that it's universal.

The moment that you're dealing with 43/23s with universal structures you
immediately have to get nervous. People like me, people like Krishnamurti, the
kinds of people with a 43/23 that say there is a universal structure. And then they
try to seduce you step by step by step to enter into the empowerment of that
structure. But obviously, for all the 43/23s it doesn't mean that you have all these
universal structures. Most of them are very narrow structures that claim
universality.
So you end up with all of these efficiency systems—plan your work and work your
plan. That‘s only good if you can plan your work and work your plan, and not
everybody can. It sounds good. It‘s very efficient. For me, it was a wonderful thing
to learn. I learned that when I was 19 years old. I had a summer job working for
an insurance company. That was their motto: plan your work and work your plan. I
thought it was really silly at the time. I understand. That‘s very efficient. You plan
it; you do it. That‘s all. And then it‘s over and you see the results at the end. So,
this kind of progression.

The 6/2
LAC Dedication 2
When you get to the 6 you get to the funny business. This has nothing to do with
anybody else. There‘s this wonderful line between the 5 and the 6. It‘s a wonderful
line. The 6 looks at the 5 and says, how good for them. But then again, they don‘t
care. It‘s not like they did it. When the 6 looks at the 5 they think, ah, look at what
they‘ve done, look at what they have to put up, look at all the people they have to
deal with, look at all the work they have to do, look at all this step by step by step,
look at all this old way. Everything about 6s can be understood through the 12.6. If
you go to the 12.6 you will see the metamorphosis of all social processes, the
metamorphosis in individuality.
When you get to this 43/23 to the 6, what they are looking for is their
Breakthrough, nobody else's, no interest in: wow, I know; you have to know. They
learn that very young. They learn it in their 3rd line phase. One of the first things
they hear in their life is ―you don't know anything‖ as a response to what they are.
But it is about: Actualization and centering. Knowing is more important than any
other aspect of life. This is their whole thing. Their whole thing is it‘s knowing; it‘s
just for the knowing.
Remember our dilemma of mutation, the dilemma of mutation is that all of a sudden
when you get to the Quarter of Mutation and you get to the 43 and you've got this
yin sitting up there pressing everything down, that the reality is that the ultimate
structure itself, no matter how efficient you make it, it‘s still going to end. It doesn‘t
matter how efficient. The 6th line understands that. And in understanding that it
also understands something else, that if you're going to be yang, knowing is more
important than the body. Knowing is more important than the form. Knowing is
more important than implementation.

What the 6th line is really saying to the yang is, if you‘re occupied, you won't notice
that you're dying. This is one of the magical things in the formula. It says, look,
what do we do with this yang energy. We don't want all this yang energy to get
depressed. We also realize that there's only so much efficiency that you can put into
the world and it‘s a difficult business anyway. So we might as well be busy. And for
the 43, the 6th line, the dilemma for them is they don‘t want to be busy; the ultimate
hypocrisy. They see that the only thing to do is be busy. If you‘re busy, it‘s all
okay. It‘ll all go by, everything is all right, don‘t worry about it, and you‘ll get to the
end so fast that you won‘t even have time to worry about it. At the same time, they
can‘t do that.
So, it's a wonderful place for those that are going to examine the psyche of the
collective consciousness field. Just examine it. These are the kinds of beings that
simply get lost in knowing and they‘re very freaky, obviously, for that very reason.
There doesn't seem for them any application of their knowing to action. In other
words, they‘re not a 5. The 5 says I know you do and I'll trick you into getting there.
The 6 says, I know, you don't, fuck you, because it isn't going to make any
difference if I tell you. As a matter of fact, if I tell you, you're going to look at me
like a dumb cow because you‘re not going to understand a damn thing I'm saying.
And when I say to, do you know what I mean, you're going to go, no, I don‘t.
So the 6 says I‘m just going to know. And I‘m going to watch out of these roof eyes
and I‘m going to look out there at the world and be very content. The only problem
is there's a spanner in all of this, because we've got a mutative life and the 6 has to
come off the roof. The moment they come off the roof they realize that was a
mistake not telling people about structure and efficiency, because now I'm down
here with them and this is a really messy place.
Unlike any of the other 43/23s, they all try to work with the form principle. They‘re
always trying to bring the structuring, the efficiency, the whenever. But the 6 is a
fool on a hill. They‘ll create their own very, very closed off private little efficiency
and try to remain outside of the world, the 6/2 in particular, so that they can go into
their hermitage, but their heritage breaks down after their Kiron. It just does. The
moment it breaks down they realize that oh, it doesn't matter that I know what's
efficient, they don‘t know what‘s efficient and I have to be with them now. In that
sense, they become very powerful examples despite themselves. But it's not easy
for them psychologically and it's not easy for them physically.
Again, because they‘re 6s, the very roof experience for them is determined by the
level of problems that they met at the beginning of their process. It always goes
back to that 3rd line process. If they are not centered in the first 30 years, then they
end up with ego problems, which means that they will end up with heart, stomach,
gallbladder, immune system problems. In other words, there is unhealthiness. It's
very important for them, this early centering process.
Also, their privacy needs to be nurtured. If you‘re dealing with a 6/2, which is the
majority of the 6th line phenomena, you really have to see that for them the
nurturing of their privacy when they're young is something that‘s important for
them. It‘s like a 6/2 child on this cross should always have their own room so they

can create their own inner efficiency world, that they can structure their environment
correctly for themselves despite the fact the rest of the house may be very different.

The 6/3
LAC Dedication 2
We‘re dealing with a transition profile which means that we‘re dealing with a 6th
Color underneath the 6th line and we‘re dealing with the 1st Design Color, so we‘re
dealing with the potential for many, many problems rooted out of the Ajna and the
Throat. Now, this is pituitary/thyroid combinations. One of things to see very
clearly about the 6/3 in this process is that this movement from relative stillness to
activity is the biggest risk that they face. In other words, that they're not well
equipped to be able to operate in a high activity environment and yet that's the thing
that is pulling them in that direction.
And for 6/3s who are coming off the roof, and remember a 6/3 experiments with
many levels of up and down, when they're coming off the roof this process of activity
has to be graduated. These are the kinds of beings that will have a very kind of safe
environment for 20 years only to discover that they have to do many more things
that they never thought they would have to do and suddenly they have to do all
these things because there is this pressure off the roof pushing them towards this
14.
My assumption is that the majority of the 6/3s on this cross have very severe mental
problems—mental institutions, addictive environments and all of these kinds of
things. It‘s a real challenge for them. Again, as we've seen wherever we‘ve been in
the quarters there are always certain configurations where the only blessing is the
awareness of your parents.
It was always my concern from the very beginning of my work that for so many
beings it‘s really late to get certain things. For some it's easier. You can see that
just by going through the cross configurations. You see where it's easier and where
it's not. But, this is one of those situations where the quality of the process that one
goes through when one is young is an enormous determining factor in how healthy
one can be in coming off the roof.

Introduction
That brings us to the 14 and it brings us to the most material of the individual gates.
This is by far the most material. It‘s only material in the sense that in the traditional
I‘Ching you're dealing with the wagon, you're dealing with the ability to accumulate
resources. But in a way that we understand it in Design is that this is the
accumulation and retention of power. It's interesting; this is not just the
accumulation of power, but it's the retention of power. And that means that the only
way that power can be accumulated and retained is if it isn't wasted. If it isn't
thrown out all over the place, if it isn't just spread out all over like manure.
So, the structuring and efficiency of the 43/23 leads to this recognition, that with
proper structuring and proper efficiency, if you have the power you can then attain
the direction. The 43/23 as the expression of projection, that the moment that you
move from the 43/23 you go to one of the archetypes of generation, this deep, deep
generative power that lies in the 14th gate.
One of the things that you‘ll notice about the 14th gate is that if you look at the 14th
gate in the Rave I‘Ching remember that whenever you see an intro to a line and that
intro is in blue, whenever you see that intro you know that this is a lifelong
development process. Every single one of the lines of the 14th gate is a long-term
process. In other words, that the accumulation and retention of power is never
something that comes to you too quickly. It doesn't. You‘ve got to go through this
process where you have to accumulate the power and know how to hold on to it.

The 1/3
If you don‘t know how to respond, that power is going to get blown out all over the
place. And that creates as many ways as confusion will permit, because we're
talking about the central system. Whenever you're dealing with the 14th gate and
Possession in Great Measure you get this very funny line at the beginning: Money
Isn't Everything. Now, the 1st line is hungry for power, money isn't necessarily
power. It can be; but it isn't necessarily. And so many 14.1s try to pursue power
through money and become disillusioned, because wealth will only come to them
through the power that is natural for them to respond to. It's not the money that
will allow them to retain and use the power efficiently.

Possession in Great Measure
1/3s learn this right away. But given the nature of the conditioning of our
environment, the 14th gate that goes through this 1/3 process that what they get out
of that is, there must be a way to make money. It becomes deeply material. The
3rd line is material in its nature. They discover right away that the structures don‘t
work, it's inefficient. Remember that this is the source of the energy that gives us
our mutative direction in life. And that when we‘re here on the 14.1 we are on the
Right Angle Cross of Contagion and
Contagion is just that. Anything that
is contagious is going to affect
others. Beings on the Cross of
Contagion cannot help but affect
others.
Now, you‘ll notice that I'm not
talking about positive or negative
effect. I'm just talking about affect.
And in fact, in talking about the Sun
in the 14 we are talking about
impact. Every mutative gate has as
its opposite a Throat gate and that
Throat gate is the form principle that
it has to deal with. The 14 has to
deal with the 8, that the 8 is the way
in which the potential for the
expression of power is ultimately
displayed. It's not the 31, it's not
the 33. It can only be displayed
properly through the 8. And you begin to see that the dilemma of the 8 is that the 8
can only affect others if it can properly display its power. Remember, the 8 doesn't
say anything other than, here I am. And you have to see the value, the other has to
see it, has to recognize the power, has to recognize the potential.
The lust for lucre and the delusion that you can throw money at problems; these are
the two dilemmas of the 1/3 on this cross. What you can see is that rather than
seeing that life is about the ability to accumulate power, it all becomes about life
being the accumulation of material. And these are the people that are always crying
that they never have enough, they‘re always crying that they never make enough
money that they‘re never paid what they're worth. It all gets translated into money.
The whole money class system is rooted in this line, and it's contagious. And money
isn‘t everything.
Now, think about that as an expression. It isn't saying money‘s nothing. It isn‘t
saying that money isn‘t important. It isn‘t saying that money isn‘t a root to power.
It isn't saying any of that. It‘s just saying that it‘s not everything. And this becomes
the dilemma of the 1/3. Money becomes everything. Every time they meet
something that doesn't work, that doesn't work right for them, their assumption is
with money it would work. If you could grease the wheels of illusion, everything
would work fine. If can't get into that restaurant if you could pull out a fin, maybe
you could.

In other words, there is always this sense that money is going to be the answer.
Throw money at it; the more money the more power. Well, yes and no. The
retention of power is not rooted only in money. You cannot just hold onto power
because you can pay a bodyguard. Ask Saddam. One moment you're rich and the
next moment you buried up in a hole somewhere in the middle of nowhere hiding.
Money isn't everything, but power is. Power is everything. And for the individual
power is the mantra.
Wherever you look at individuality, wherever you look at any channel of individuality
what you're looking at is the potential display of mutated power. Empowerment is
an impactful thing, which is why there is a natural resistance to individuality in the
collective tribal realm, a natural resistance because it is an impactful thing.

The 1/4
RAC Contagion 4
The 1/4 never gets to learn the lesson that a 1/3 can. That is, that the 1/3 raised
correctly can recognize that money is useful, but not everything. But the 1/4 gets
locked into this whole material chain. Now, the interesting thing about that is that
they develop the skills—remember that this is a gate of power skills—they develop
ways of using material that is creative. There are some people that can take very
little money and build it into a lot of money. And there are some people given a lot
of money that can barely hold onto it.
When you're looking at a 1/4 on this cross, on the 14, you're looking at somebody
that can really work with money. But again, money isn't everything, but that's not
what these beings are going to feel because they‘re going to have this one-track
mindedness of the 4 and they‘re going to have the built-in opportunism that always
brings the 4 to the edge of the material. After all, we live in an illusion that has a
material dimension, a deeply material dimension. Materialism is natural. It's natural
and it is normal, because we are a material form in a material world. God bless the
material girl, wherever she may be.
The 1/4 is locked into this material one-mindedness. They‘re the kind of people who
will say to you, I know I can make money this way, even though everybody is saying
excuse me. But there is this ―I know I can make money this way.‖ And there's no 3
underneath to bring out the dilemmas and the problems. If you go to a 14 that‘s a
1/3, if you go to a 14 that is a 1/4, if you present them both with the same proposal,
the 1/4 will focus on ―how do I make money on this thing,‖ the 1/3 will say, ―I don't
know if I can make any money doing this,‖ because right away the 3 comes in with
its inherent pessimism and says wait a minute, wait a minute, the 1/4 doesn‘t even
deal with that. The 1/4 is only interested in, ―will this work. And if it will work, this
could be my track to get to where I want to go to,‖ which is ultimately that 8, that
expression in the Throat.

The 2/4
RAC Contagion 4
The 2/4 understands something that is so natural for the 2/4. It says, ―I don‘t want
to be bothered, but this could really work, so I‘ll hire you and you do it. I‘ll have the
power to appoint you to a direction and you do all the work. I‘m very democratic.
I‘ll give you shares. I‘ll make sure you‘re well rewarded. But while you‘re doing all
that, leave me alone. I‘m going to be over here. I‘ll check the bank account.‖ That
is the ideal of the 14.2.
Remember, it‘s Contagion: The wisdom that investing in expertise brings rewards.
This is all about the dilemma of either you're going to invest and expand or you‘re
going to do it all yourself and fuck up, because you can‘t do it all yourself. And the
not-self 14.2 says, ―Leave me alone, I‘ll do it myself. I‘ll do everything myself.‖ And
we know what happens to these beings, they cannot do that. They can't. This is a
much deeper understanding of the nature of power and its relationship to material.
Everything about the 14 is this relationship: power and money, how do we deal with
all this? Is the power the money? Or is the money just something that is around
power. So when you get to the 2, the 2 says, if I have the power I don't have to be
focused on the money. I have to be focused on using the power to get the money to
come to me: Management.
So, when you're dealing with these 2/4s, you have to see that their network at the
unconscious level is going to make an enormous difference in their lives. One can
never forget how important opportunism is to the 4 and whenever we're dealing with
the material dimension, particularly when we're dealing with tribal materialism, that
the presence of the 4th line represents material opportunities, money opportunities,
and business opportunities. So here in this context, when you're dealing with this
2/4, it‘s very, very powerful. In other words, there is a tremendous amount of
material potential in management skills; the energy and power for management
skills.
Now, 14s have a dilemma because if they're not operating correctly, and if we're
dealing with somebody who is a Generator in this context, and two thirds of them
will be, to really see that if they're not responding correctly, if they‘re not entering
into things as they should, then this becomes a very painful exercise in which they
can have all of this power to be able to delegate and never get the delegate to
anyone, and nothing grows. The 14 is here to bring—what was this guy‘s name—
Stockman. He was finance in the American government under Reagan, and he
brought in this trickle-down economy, this idea that if you stop taxing basically the
very rich that their investment of monies into the expansion of their businesses will
trickle down into more jobs and increased income within the chain that lies
underneath.

Now, theoretically in terms of economic formulas there seems to be some validity to
that, in the economic formula. And the thing to recognize about the 2/4 is that this
is the ultimate trickle-down. This is all about recognizing that this is where pyramid
schemes were first invented. The ultimate hustles are here in the 2nd line, really
good hustles. It was so much fun, not for those people, but for me to watch that the
moment that the Iron Curtain came down in all of these East European countries
were all of these pyramid scandals that emerged overnight. The kinds of things that
they were doing in America in the 1920s, these incredible hustles where you give me
a hundred and I'll give you back fifty, interest, in a month. And then you get all
these people that are pouring in all of this money and a few of them get paid that
and then eventually the people who do that disappear and they‘ve got all this
money. This is the delegation business; this is the moving down business. This is
the trickle-down business.
So, what you get out of that is that there is nothing more powerful than a 2/4 on this
cross that is called. The moment they get the call, they have a gift of being able to
bring that contagion into others, to delegate the management and ultimately be able
to get the reward. Now, in most cases, that does not happen. You can tell by the
beginning of that because it says: The wisdom. And one of the things you‘ll notice
about the 14th gate is that if you look at the 14th gate in the Rave I‘Ching remember
that whenever you see an intro to line and that intro is in blue, whenever you see
that intro you know that this is a lifelong development process. Every single one of
the lines of the 14th gate is a long-term process.
In other words, that the accumulation and retention of power is never something
that comes to you too quickly. It doesn‘t. You‘ve got to go through this process
where you have to accumulate the power and know how to hold on to it. If you don't
know how to respond, that power is going to get blown out all over the place. And
that creates as many ways as confusion will permit, because we're talking about the
central system.

The 2/5
RAC Contagion 4
2/5s have a tendency to fall into the detriment theme. And the detriment theme is
thinking that they are their best expert. Remember that we‘re dealing with a self-
motivated phenomenon. So, it's very easy for them in that context to see
themselves as the only expert because projection has shown them that they're going
to suffer whatever they try to put out across to the other what they want the other
to do.
The great dilemma of the 14 is that it‘s individual. If this was collective it would be
really easy. I'm only here, I have this; you're over there, you have that, you do
that. But when you're an individual it doesn't work. There‘s resistance to the
individual. It‘s something that‘s new. The individual is very selfish in the way they
hold onto their uniqueness. There is not this ―we.‖ The collective always speaks as
―we.‖ And when you‘re dealing with individual empowerment on the material plane

you're dealing with ―I.‖ There‘s no ―we.‖ ―I give this to you.‖ And then it becomes
your ―I‖ and it goes on and on and on.
So, you don't have the same kind of bond in the way in which management can
operate. In other words, this is a very different kind of management system that you
would ever see in the collective or in the tribe. It has nothing to do with either,
because it's not about money. It's about power. The 14th gate is obsessed with
power. This is its theme. And it‘s legitimate, in a way, like all things. It powers the
driver. So there it is fueling the Monopole, giving that 2nd gate the impetus it needs.
And then you begin to see the dilemma. The fuel dictates the quality of direction.
So with a 2/5 it is a dilemma.

The 3/5 RAC Contagion 4
I particularly like this 3rd line because I think again, and I'm always searching for
nice things to say about the 3rd line because I think it's an essential balance to their
pessimistic reputation, that the 3rd line here in the 14 is Service and is one of the
most beautiful lines, bar none, in the sense that here you have the utilization of
talent and wealth for the highest good, and even in its detriment it's okay. Even
though it's a hard line to see that way, it‘s also okay.
One of the things to understand about the transition, for example, that‘s taken place
in the world in the last 50 years, at one level globalization is a horror. You go into
that little village in the Third World and they have a television and they see
Baywatch. It‘s like, oh my God I want that, too. On one side you say, oh, isn‘t that
cruel. They‘re poor and they‘re hungry and they‘re this and that. But then again,
the very fact that that's been going on in the world for the last 50 years is most of
the places that were dirt poor when they first saw it, now have those TVs and all the
things that go with it. I don't know if they have all the silicone girls that stand on
the beach, but they have all the other accouterment that goes with it.
One of the most astonishing things to recognize is that most of the First World
economic nations of Asia had a lower per capital earning than the major states of
Black Africa at the end of the First World War. A Nigerian was earning more money
than a Korean at the end of the First World War, more than somebody from Taiwan.
When you see the statistics it‘s astonishing. So, it's one of the things to understand
about the other side of service, which is greed. One side is it is selfless and the
other side it‘s greed driven and both of them do a great service in that binary in the
way in which we have to deal with power, money and this movement into the future.
But think about how difficult that is for a 3/5 on this cross. Greed is not something
that is welcomed in society. It isn‘t. Supposedly one of the great moral sins is
greed. The other thing is that to utilize talent and wealth you have to have it. And
there is nothing more depressing, in a sense, than this 3rd line. It speaks the whole
story of the 3rd line process of trial and error. Unless you fail you do not learn.
Unless you experience the plane itself you do not gain any advantage. So it's very

nice that you can be of service this way or that, but first, you have to accumulate
these things. You cannot be of service in terms of wealth unless you have wealth to
be of service with. It is just something that is logical.
And talent is nice, but talent that isn‘t developed, talent that isn't nurtured isn't
talent that can be of service to anything. And one of the things to see about service
is that all service must begin with a certain level of greed. You have to be able to be
driven to the talent and its fulfillment or the wealth and its potential in order to be
able to have that turnaround in your life so that you use it for the advantage of
humanity.
It's always so interesting to watch and you see it every day—it was something that
was very common a hundred years ago, we saw it again in the computer bubble of
the 90s, all of a sudden you had people who made absolutely astronomical amounts
of money and the very first thing they do once they get those astronomical amounts
of money is they set up charitable foundations, philanthropies and they start putting
out, regardless of what the percentages are—for all the dislike of Bill Gates, which I
never understood and Microsoft, which I still don't understand, he‘s somebody who's
already given away several billions of dollars to very good things. The fact is that he
couldn't have done that before he accumulated the wealth and power. And the fact
that he had a talent to know how to build a business didn't mean he was ready to be
of service to humanity until the business was built. And by the way, that's been a
great service to humanity.
But I want you to grasp something about the 14th gate. It's a baby. It comes into
the world, it really is innocent, it needs to be nurtured, and it needs time. And
because it is essentially Sacral and particularly in those cases where it's going to be
part of a Generator‘s design, how important it is that these children know what
response means. As a 3rd line being, particularly as a 3/5 that suffers so much from
the misperception of what they can be, that unless these children are raised in a
healthy way, they never get that chance.
Remember something about the 14th gate, whenever the 14th gate fails the result is
greed for money or materialism. And because this is Cross of Contagion, the
material hunger on this planet, the sense of material disenfranchisement, those
beings that don't think they have enough, those beings who think they should have
more, all of them are a by-product of this contagion, the failed experience of the 14
and the contagion that goes out in the world around it.
The other thing is that as a 3rd line business, any of the mutative beings on the
planet who carry a 6th line in their profile, when they go through their 3rd line stage,
half of this planet is under 30, half of this planet right now is looking for a career and
most of those beings who are under 30 on this planet today have no work in front of
them, no career in front of them, no future in front of them.
I watched last night a program that is very popular in Iraq right now. And it's a
reality show of prisoners who have been caught—people who have been doing the
bombings and whatever—and they‘re totally ignorant. They have no education.
They‘re the lowest level of the society there. There‘s a guy who admitted that he

blew up a place and he did it for 200 American dollars. It had nothing to do with
ideology, had nothing to do with being a Jihadist, it had nothing to do with anything;
he was getting paid.
One of the things to see is that when you're looking at so many of the revolutionary
environments, where you‘re looking at societies like Palestine and whatever, you
have to understand that the young people have no future. They look ahead and they
see nothing. They see no potential for career; they have this deep, deep pessimism.
And so you end up with this enormous greed and hunger for money. And power
seems to be the way you get to it. So if you kill the leader, if you rob the leader,
you can take the leader‘s money, instead of, if you're developed properly you're the
power, you become the leader, you can honestly earn all of that, and then be able to
give it back.
But the thing I want to leave you with this 3rd line theme is to understand that all 3rd
line beings are here to be of service. And they're here to be of service in the largest
sense of the word in that they are the ones that are designed to see what works in
life. And that is an ultimate service. As I told every 3rd line being and it's based on
this line in this hexagram is that if you learn from your experiences, the potential is
always wealth and power, always. This is the path of discovery.

RAC Contagion 4
If you‘re a 3/6 on this cross and you‘re born in Algeria, the chances of you becoming
a crazy jihadist are about 99.99%. 60% of their society is under 25. They have a
theoretical unemployment that‘s probably about 40%. When you look at an
environment like that, if you are 3/6 and you‘re born into that environment, that 3-3
phase for the first 28 years is going give you such a deep pessimism about your
ability to be able to accumulate power and wealth. And you'll get to see the other
side of that. It is frightening how powerful the Sacral is in dysfunction. And we're
talking about the Sacral theme of frustration at perhaps its most violent.
The frustration that arises that there's no opportunity to accumulate or retain power,
there is no opportunity to be able to establish a viable material environment. And so
for many 3/6s the very pessimism of the early part of their life, these are the kind of
people that resign themselves to the lowest level on the rung. The kind of people
that will end up doing the most menial work, and then you look at their design and
you see they‘re a 14.3 and you think Jesus, what are they doing here. But if you go
back to what happened to them, to what they experienced, the way they were
conditioned by their family, by their society, you'll see right away it‘s a choiceless
descent into hell. It was choiceless, with nothing they can do.

The 4/6
RAC Contagion 4
The 4th line is the line of Security and here you begin to see the sensibility system
of the 14. Remember how difficult it is for individuality to create the bonds that will
allow for this kind of material development, and particularly when you're dealing with
lower trigram, which is an essentially introverted process. So here we get the 4th
line and we get the security, what we're dealing with is that the 4th line understands
that its ability to accumulate and retain wealth is going to be rooted in its network,
that the investment is in the network and from the network comes power.
All 4s understand the power of having a network. They all do, because it is a form of
power. Here you can see at its root what it is about. That is, this is about security
and it's: The concentration on establishing a strong foundation. It‘s interesting that
this is the harmonic theme. Protection from assault. Now it's all about competition.
In other words, when you're dealing with the 4th line here, what you're dealing with
is you have to be able to protect yourself from the competition. You‘ve got to be
very secure what you're doing, you've got to retain your power and you're wealth in
order to fend off those that want to take away what's yours.
Darwinism, this is Darwinism. This is the survival of the fittest. This is real
Darwinism. And then you have to see that the 4 really understands that they‘ve got
to hold on to their line because if they don't hold on to their line, they can be wiped
out so easily. And again, to see these two sides of materialism that‘s in the 14. And
to realize that the dilemma—you can always see the dilemma when materialism is
the theme, because it's not the theme. Power is the theme. So, what you see in the
4 is that you can't afford to lose your power, because if you lose your power all is
lost. In other words, you will be the victim.
It‘s a 4/6 so you're going to have to go through the dilemma of the 4-3 phase. And
everything about the 4-3 phase is that the networking is never right. Whenever
you‘re dealing with somebody who has the 4th line in their profile, their relationships
in their first 28 years, most of those relationships, the networks that they develop,
the networks they still maintain, it‘s very hard for 4s to give up their networks, that
most of those connections were simply incorrect.
And not only is that a matter that you're investing in a network that brings you, or
you‘re investing in an aspect of the network that doesn't bring you a return, but
worse, they will offer you returns that are of no value. They will offer you returns
that will eat away at your power and that would eat away at your wealth. And the
thing about the 14 is that its wealth is a by-product of its capacity to empower. The
more it empowers, the more likely it is that wealth will come its way, but it has to be
able to empower. It has to empower the right thing at the right time.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Empowering
 8  55
The 4/1
The juxtaposition of the 4/1 is the Juxtaposition Cross of Empowering. Here you
have the empowerment of the strong foundation. When you look at Pentas and you
look at the importance of the 14th gate, which is absolutely enormous in the Penta,
you can see very clearly that at this 4th line you begin to understand that
empowering is the only foundation. In other words, the moment that you have a
foundation from which you can empower, you're always going to be guaranteed your
proper return, but the foundation must be there.
Now, the problem with the 4/1 on this cross is that it may not always be there. After
all, this is not-self. It‘s quite a process. It doesn't necessarily mean that they have
responded or however their configuration is, it doesn't mean that they‘ve entered
into things correctly, it doesn't mean they've acquired—remember it‘s a timing
system—it doesn‘t mean they
acquire that wealth, that depth, the
power necessary out of the
experience.
If you‘re a 6th line being on this
cross, you know that there are none
of these things available to you until
you begin your process on the roof.
That the first part of your life is that
it gets torn away from you, you lose
power, you lose wealth, or the
potential of it. So, on this 4/1, this
very, very fixed, you can see that
the basic business principle of the
individual and the basic business
principle of the Penta is the same.
Out of a strong foundation
empowerment is possible. So,
everything is about the strong
foundation. It‘s like building a
business. If you‘ve got a solid product line, then you can begin to empower. But if
you don't have a solid product line, you're going to have a lot of problems, because
it's just not going to work and then you‘re going to end up with all these sidebar
dilemmas of trying to figure out how to mask the fact that the product has a
problem, and so forth and so on and all of this stuff.
Solid foundation is the security. Now, that says something else about the fact that
this is about a directional movement in space, and it says that the way in which

mutation works is that only when the mutation has found its foundation, that it's
solid, can it empower others. You'd see that in the exponential growth of Human
Design. As it has empowered it has become more empowering. This is just one of
those things. Once the foundation was established as valid, which was a different
process, out of the solid foundation empowerment was possible. And this becomes
contagious. I find it amusing. My Kiron cross is Contagion. So, it's just interesting
to look at it from my own perspective.

The Left Angle Cross of Uncertainty 2

The 5/1
The Left Angle Cross of Uncertainty, what a great name. I love this cross. It says so
much about the empowerment business. It‘s like, here‘s this solid foundation, we
have this ability to empower and then who knows. It‘s like, who knows. It‘s what I
said about the recognition in the 43/23 that at any moment a miracle can happen.
But it's also the recognition that
any moment that the sky can fall.
And the 14 really has that down.
Arrogance: The ever present risk
inherent in positions of power.
Now, think about that line very
carefully. Most 14.5 never get to
experience this line, because they
never get power. They go to their
grave trying to get the power so
that they can have their moment of
arrogance. And of course, the
dilemma of the not-self is they‘re
arrogant the whole way.
Ever present risk—and in positions
of power. You know right away
most 14.5s come in and it‘s like
where‘s the power, I need to have
the power. And there's this
projection on them that they already have it and they don‘t. Cross of Uncertainty
people get smashed a lot, because when you presume that somebody has power you
use power on them. Think about that. Individuals always meet power. You cannot
be an individual and not live in a power world where there is power confrontation.
And when it is projected on you you have power then you get it. And if you don‘t
have it and it's just an illusion, ah, do you get it.

For these beings, the 5/1s on this cross how difficult it is to really be a heretical
caller, to have the power to call and not be crushed. This is one of the few heretical
positions where the heretics rarely ever emerge. These are the heretics that they
stand up and before they can say anything they get stoned. Shut up, don‘t say
anything, we don‘t want to hear it. It‘s very difficult for them. And most people
think this is a line of arrogance. It is what it says. But arrogance is the by-product of
the retention and accumulation of power in the not-self. And we all know that. You
met any not-self consciousness that has power or money and they are a pain in the
ass 99 times out of a hundred.
And you know it right away, there is a certain arrogance in them, but you don‘t get
the arrogance until you get to the place. So, these are wannabe arrogance. I want
to be arrogant because that would have meant I have my power, I have my wealth.
The exaltation is: Innate dignity—dignity. The beauty of this line is to be able to
have dignity regardless of your state. Power comes in many ways.
For me the 14.5 is the line of the beggar. And I don't mean that in a negative sense
at all. We don‘t know this in the West because in the West we are so deeply
materialistic that we see a beggar as a failure in life. We do. But there are many
societies on the planet where being a beggar is a job. It‘s a job, because there's no
room for other jobs. You go to India and you‘ve got zillions of people. It‘s not like
there's zillions of jobs. It‘s a job.
The whole thing about a beggar is that beggars are only interesting if they've
retained their dignity. Money isn't everything. It's just—I have no power. I have no
wealth. I am at your mercy. I‘m fine, thank you. I have no power. I have no
wealth. I'm at your mercy. Remember that one of the deepest things about the 14
is that it's here to empower for the benefit of humanity. This is a material life. It‘s
here to provide the material opportunities. We've gotten much better on this planet
in trying to provide material—we actually provide material opportunities for more
people now than ever in the history of the planet. It isn‘t to say that it's great
because we‘ve also had this vast expansion of population, but in pure numbers, what
we‘ve been able to do on this material track to benefit humanity.
So, the opposite of this arrogance is this dignity to be powerless. Of course, this is
one of the great heretical teachings. I teach it myself. Powerlessness is grace, and I
have been a beggar. I begged on this island, really, truly begged. I know what it's
like to beg and not lose your dignity and to see how much power that actually brings
to you. It‘s quite amazing.
So this is a very complex line. Like all left angle processes, there are mysteries in
them because it has to do with its interconnectivity with the geometry or fractal of
others. And so much of what happens to a 14 in their life is about who is in their life
and the opportunities that may arise, the possibilities that may be there, to learn
about power and wealth. Not all are given such opportunities in this life.

The 5/2 LAC Uncertainty 2
One of the things that is part of the dilemma for the 5/2 particularly is that the 5/2
looks out at the world around it and sees that those who have wealth and have
power are basically incompetent. And we come to a great heretical principle.
Whether one has wealth or poverty is a choicelessness and not a responsibility, not
fault, not a flaw, not a result of this or that, not a matter of cause and effect, not a
matter of karma. And of course, it is only the heretic on this line that can actually
present that, because the 5/2 better than anyone on this Cross of Uncertainty knows
this deeply.
There are these old stories about the man who walks into the desert and everything
blooms; the person that walks into a garden and everything dies. What to do. This
is the 5/2. It says why should I bother. If it's God's grace to give me wealth and
power, I will wait and see. And this is one of the deepest religious themes that run
in individuality. There are not a lot of religious themes in individuality. This is one of
the most powerful streams running through this particular 5th line, and it's this
theme that says, it's clear to me that I can't get the power that I want by trying to
get it. I can't get the wealth that I want by trying to get it. And I realize that no
matter what I do I can't get it. So, if I‘m going to have it, it‘s going to be God‘s
grace.
These are people that go to the lottery. This is the lottery of Babylon people. These
are the ones that are always waiting for the miracle. The gods are going to shine
and suddenly I‘m going to go from my five buck an hour job and I‘m going to be a
zillionaire. This is one of the calls. But the other side of that is a much higher level
of consciousness that recognizes the limitation, and in recognizing the limitations
surrenders to the dignity of place, which is where I go back to the beggar. That‘s
the extreme, obviously. To return to the simplicity of the acceptance of place; this is
also part of our direction. Not everyone is here in the genetic mutative strain to get
in this and that. Not everybody gets the gold. They‘re always people who get the
silver and the bronze. There are always those that are out of the running. It‘s just
the way it is.
So here, particularly in the 5/2, because the 5/2 can‘t understand at a certain point
why there is no motivation inside of it. It loses its motivation. And remember that
we‘re dealing with a transition profile so we‘re dealing with the dilemma of the 6th
Color Personality and the 1st Color Design, so there is a certain infirmity that‘s
possible within the vehicle itself. In other words, the limitation of the excuses—I
could have, but I didn't have the eyesight. I could have, but I had the wrong body.
I could have, but; I could have, but; and then the surrender to it.
Now, in the not-self that surrender could be painful. After all, this is a deeply
melancholic channel; it‘s a deeply melancholic gate. And to really see that for so
many on the Cross of Uncertainty that uncertainty itself is a reason for depression.

The 6/2
LAC Uncertainty 2
There‘s an interesting combination in this line. You‘ve got the 6 and the keynote is
Humility, and then you've got the line that says: Wealth and power at its most
exalted. 14.6s love this line. But it doesn't mean anything. It really has to be
earned. And 14.6s have the most complex roof program. Like any 6, they‘re going
to go through dilemmas. And this is a Sun/Earth access, by the way, in terms of the
exalted and the detriment. All of it is nice. All of it sounds wonderful. It‘s all very
positive. Even the detriment is positive.
The enlightened recognition that material success is God's will. Well, how nice. But
you don't get that when you're born, and you don't get that when you're in your
Saturn phase. As a matter of fact, in your Saturn phase there‘s no enlightened
recognition of anything. There is simply the upset-ness of the pessimism and nothing
else. The other side is that material success was unavoidable. In other words, you
go from God to no choice. It‘s the same thing. It doesn‘t matter how you look at it.
God gave it to me. I got it because it just happened. And it ends up being the same
thing on either side of the coin, but you don't just get there. Nobody just gets there.
For years and years and years—in 94, when I designed the first self-standing
I‘Ching, I made a point of making these intro lines a different color, telling people
over the years what they are, but still there is an assumption when you look at
somebody's design that when you're seeing a line you see it whole. You don‘t. It‘s a
developmental growth process. And whenever you‘re seeing 6th lines, you know
right away that this is a process that in fact doesn‘t mature for 50 years, if you're
lucky enough to live that long.
I was in Toronto about two months ago, and I got a real blast of American
commercial television. You would get these ads where somebody is very, very ill and
they‘ve been saved by a certain medication. It‘s usually a middle-aged couple with

relieved and oh my God and thank you, this drug was the answer, whatever. And
then you have at the end of the commercial the drug is shown and then there's this
voice. It's invariably a male voice for the authority and it's talking very quietly as
compared to the commercial itself, and it says: side effects of this drug may range
from diarrhea, the explosion of your kidneys, and the inability of you to be able to
breathe for weeks. And they have all of these corollaries afterwards. It‘s amazing.
And you have to see that when you're looking at the 6th line you have to understand
this dilemma. You‘ve got to go through the 3rd line business. Never mind about the
wealth and the glory and the blah, blah, blah. The wisdom has to be earned. You‘ve

got to get there. You have to get there and you have to be able to see that all 6th
line beings are threatened by their first 28 years on this planet, that they are locked
into a way of seeing the world that creates a maya that‘s very difficult to shatter.
And the moment you see a line like this you have to understand, yes, there is the
potential. All 6th lines carry this metamorphosis. The enlightened recognition that
material success was God’s will. Now, you think about materialism as a greed engine
and everybody says materialism is not God's will, it‘s my hard work. I get paid for
doing my work. I do my job.
Forget about God‘s will, and forget about no choice, whoa, sorry you‘re poor, that‘s
the way it is. Hey, bang, bang—don‘t tell me that story; I don‘t want to hear no
choice. So you can see that the 14.6 is exalted as it may be, and it really is—I would
love to see everyone understand that the way is a way in which it is choiceless, it‘s
all choiceless. And it‘s truly enlightened to recognize that and to see you get what
you get. And if you don't get it, you don‘t get it. It is what it is.
For the individual in many ways, it‘s more natural to grasp this. The individual
doesn‘t have the same dependency. When the collective sees a lack of material it
worries deeply, because it worries for what it shares with. When the tribe is
threatened materially, it worries deeply because it knows it needs to support others
or be supportive of others.
The individual can actually find grace with nothing. That‘s why the potential of this
exaltation in this very, very individual energy, this metamorphosis that recognizes
that for me alone whatever is there is sufficient. Now, obviously that is a
transcendent expression of consciousness. Not everybody gets there.
So, not everybody gets to this wealth and power. Not everybody that has the 14.6 is
going to be able to either exercise power or going to be able to retain power. And
they're not going to necessarily be enlightened in their recognition. What you will
see is a false humility and you will see the hypocrisy of the 6 emerge. And whenever
you're dealing with a 6th line you're always dealing with the potential of that
hypocrisy. And it is the hypocrisy that can make this aspect so ugly.

The 6/3 has a real dilemma and the dilemma is that it comes out of this exaltation of
power, how beautiful it is to finally have the power and to finally have the power to
drive the direction. But then, as I was trying to allude to this morning out of step,
the dilemma that in order to really put the power to work, enormous activity is
necessary. It‘s just necessary. This is an incredibly busy planet. When we‘re
dealing with the 14, the 14 is saying, look, I know I‘m going to die. It‘s clear that
I‘m going to die. But the only thing that‘s going to make it worthwhile for me to be
here in this process is if I get rich or I have power. In other words, if I have power
or I have wealth, it‘s worthwhile to have been here in form. That‘s quite a criterion.

Possession in Great Measure
And you can see that there's going to be an awful lot of melancholy and depression
that's rooted in that kind of—and of course, that‘s what‘s contagious. It‘s
everywhere. People are always saying, if only I had the money, I could do this, that
and the other. Like people who are always to me in the early years, all you need is,
let me get you some money and everything will change. Yeah, yeah, but the truth is
if it comes, it comes. You can‘t get stuck in that. You can‘t get stuck in saying, well,
I can't do this because. But the contagion in society is life is worthless if you're not
rich or powerful, and that means on all levels of the strata. It's not about super rich
or superpower. It's all of the variations in between. And then you end up with class
structures, you end up with financial problems; you end up with all this stuff.
It‘s kind of like, I wish we could do a comedy routine, because the 6/3 looks at the
34, 1/3 and it‘s like, oh boy. The 14.6 is really good at getting the power. After all,
that‘s its job. Get the power; it knows nothing about using the power and using the
power is something else. Whoa, is it something else. It's like the first time
somebody tries to learn how to drive. And what happens when they put their foot on
either the gas or the brake. You know right away that your life is at risk and you‘d
better have your seatbelt on, because you're either going to be slammed forward as
the car lurches ahead, or you‘re going to be slammed again when they jam on the
breaks, because there is no subtlety and nuance in how you use this impactful
empowering power.
It‘s like when people learn how to use a gearshift. It‘s the same thing. (Grinding
noise) You go back and forth. And it‘s great you have all this power, but if you can‘t
drive the car properly you‘ve got a problem. So, it's this movement to the use of
power. And the 6/3, because it's always up and down, and it's always looking over
there, the 6/3 is always trying to figure out how to use the power. And for them it's
often a block, because it ends up being how do we use the power, but they don't
know how to. They‘re just there with that resource.
And worse than that, for them their resource is for the G Center. It's not what's
beside them, that weird 34 that is over there on the side, they're pointed up here
and the use of power is over here and they get very confused. They‘re not exactly
the ones that you're going to see with great material success. The 14.3s, the 14.4s
are the ones that can really be deeply into the material process and find the right
outlets for it. They can learn how to find the people who have the ability to take
advantage of their power.
Whenever you're looking at the channels between the Sacral and the G, it‘s always
important to remember that they are not comfortable connections. They‘re never
comfortable. Just like the 15 and the 5 when they meet each other, this can be very
uncomfortable for both. And the same thing with the 14 and the 2, because the 14
says, hey, I‘ve got all this power, and the 2 says good for you and drives. They're
very different. And the driving isn't using the power. It‘s using the energy that‘s
within the construct of the Sacral. But it's not using the power. Only the 34th gate
knows how to use power. It‘s the only power gate. This is the real ability to use
power, which is why it's not sexual; it‘s why it doesn't have time for anything else.
It only has time for the display of power.

Introduction
Power is only great when its display or use serves the common good. Amen. This is
the collective prayer whenever they're looking at an individual God. If you want to
understand how to use power all you have to do is look at these six lines. You start
off being a bully. This is the foundation. It‘s the basis. This is the person that
doesn't quite know the subtleties of the gas pedal in the brake. They end up
throwing the power out, not really honing the power.
Remember that when we're dealing with this cross—and of course we are on the
Right Angle Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix, which means we've entered into the
domain of Mutation, so we're dealing with a cross that's deeply mutative in the way
in which it operates. That we‘re dealing with the other one of the three opposition
definitions. We‘re dealing with the 20/34. The 20/34 is the only true manifesting
generating channel. Somebody who has the 20/34 in their design is a true, or pure,
Manifesting Generator. All other attributes that we label as Manifesting Generator
are Generators with a manifesting possibility. This is the only Manifesting Generator.
In the same way that there is only one emotional Generator and that is the 59/6.
There is no other emotional Generator. There is only one pure ego Manifestor; that‘s
the 45/21. In other words, in each of these examples that I've given you we have a
pure version of this construct, and then we have the odd characteristic that gives us
a sort of similarity to it. But it's not the same as the pure example. And as I said,
the 43/23 alone is the only true, true Projector. Everything else is qualities of
projection.

The 1/3
The Bully: The indiscriminate use of power. Karma is a funny thing. Karma says
what you put out you get back. And of course, this is just another one of these
cause and effect things. One of those things to understand about the 34 is that
because, I love these ‗becauses,‘ because the 34 is the most powerful utilizer of
power, it is also the place where power is received. What I mean by that is that if
you put out the bully eventually you get the bully back.
And this whole business of comeuppance, this whole business of karmic retribution,
all of these things is rooted in the 34, always. So the 34 puts out its brute power, at
some point that bounces back on it. It‘s the classic story of the bully in the
schoolyard. Sooner or later there's a bigger kid. Sooner or later there's somebody

that will take the bully down to size. It always happens in life. And if it doesn't
happen in the schoolyard, it'll happen somewhere on the street, but it's one of those
things where the 34 always, when it puts out its power, gets it back. It‘s how it
empowers others.
So when you're dealing with the bully: The energy to display power as a response to
frustration. That‘s the exalted. And you can see that the not-self Manifesting
Generator, the pure Manifesting Generator which will give you a framework for all
Manifesting Generators is that when
you look at the pure Manifesting
Generator at its very, very
foundation what you see is that they
are naturally deeply frustrated, which
is what drives them to skip things, to
jump over things. And of course, the
comeuppance for the MG is when
they skip something it comes back to
haunt them. Comeuppance is an
interesting thing.
Oh, a beautiful example right now
there are committee hearings going
on in the United States Senate, that
George Bush has appointed a man,
Bolton, I think his name is, to be the
next ambassador to the UN. And this
is a guy that constantly trashes the
UN. So, he‘s in this Senate meeting
and there was a description of him
from somebody else that's one of the best descriptions I've ever heard. It‘s: kiss
up/kick down. He‘s a kiss up, kick down kind of guy. It‘s so interesting that here's
is this guy, he‘s going to get a really big position, lots of power, and what he‘s
accused of is being a vicious bully. So, here‘s this bully who's been bulling his way
to the top and nobody hears anything and he gets appointed to this high office and
all of a sudden here comes the comeuppance. Imagine what that was like for him to
be described on live television for all of America to indulge in as a kiss up, kick down
kind of guy. I loved it. That‘s comeuppance.
Putting out power doesn‘t mean that the comeuppance is equivalent in nature or
quality to what you put out. This is the great risk for 34s. They put out their bully
power and the assumption would be that the cause and effect you‘re going to have
coming back to you is the mirror of what you're putting out. It never happens that
way. The comeuppance is something totally different. And nobody understands
karmic punishment better than 34s. These are the people that really get it in the
end, one way or another, by the way.
Retaliation is one of the themes of this line. So, when you're dealing with a 1/3 what
you want to do is clasp your hands in prayer and do the best you can to teach them
when they're young. They're going to make mistakes in the display of their power.

It's only natural. They're going to use brute force at the wrong time in the wrong
place in the wrong way, and they're going to get their comeuppance. There is
nothing more dangerous than repressing the Sacral system. A 34 that cannot use
their power is going to have enormous Sacral problems. The Sacral will lead to all
kinds of problems, physical problems, and energy problems. It begins to eat at
them.
The advantage always in the 1/3 is that the 1/3 can discover that using brute force
doesn't work. The first time they try to bully their mother and their mother gives
them a shot is the first moment they understand well, maybe I should use my power
a little more subtlety. Remember, it‘s so powerful. I‘m integration; I have all
integration except the 34. So all my life I have been very, very sensitive to this
power, and it is the power that both amazes me and a power that at the same time I
look at it and I just shake my head, because there can be such a lack of subtlety in
the way in which the power is used, and you really see that in the 1st line. Because
you‘re dealing with the 1/3 it‘s understandable. Where it really becomes frightening
is in the 3/5 application of this because it's no longer just the innocence of the 1/3.

The 1/4
RAC Sleeping Phoenix 4
1/4s bully their friends. They‘re the kind of beings that—4s after all have their
investment in their network and they have their network, and this is one of these
forces that is always—and when I say bully their friends, they use their power in
relationship to their friends. Power displays are acts of selfishness. What else can it
be? There‘s nothing more selfish than the 20/34. I don't say that in a bad way. If
you look at the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix in its 55 configuration in the 6th line,
you‘re right there—selfishness. It‘s not like it‘s alien to any of this. Individuality by
its very nature is selfish. It‘s absorbed in its process. And then you have a 1/3 that
has a 20/34 fixed that is always pushing their power to their Throat. You begin to
see the dilemma right away. They're going to have their problems.
So the 1/4 is going to drive its friends. The Manifesting Generator in its pure form is
the ultimate slave. 20/34s have no direction other than through 43/23s. It's very
difficult to guide a 20/34. They are the ultimate loose cannon. They are running on
this endless, endless treadmill like a hamster in a cage. And they run everybody
around them. When you're looking at the 1/4, they‘re running their whole network.
They‘re pushing everyone in that network and they‘re charismatic. It's not like they
don't have their power, they do. Remember, it's one of those things that the gods
said we must have as a regular definition—43/23s, 20/34s, 40/37s, we need to have
them. They‘re the basis of the soup.
So, this busy, busy, busy, busy, this display of power, this individual selfish display
of power is a basic ingredient. We know in the end that the 34 is part of integration
and is there to supply the essential power for a mechanism that has no power. If
you look at what I have you see very clearly that in integration I am powerless—the
Throat to the G to the Spleen. The Sacral is the secret to integration. The 34 is the

secret to integration. It‘s the thing that gives it its power, the power to establish the
archetype, the power to follow the convictions, the power to be charismatic and
active in the now with awareness.
So, the 34 has a sense of importance. And because it seems to be able to do, this is
the great slave part, it is constantly empowering those around it. It‘s a chaos
system. If you pay attention to the activity cycle of the 20/34 and then you
recognize how many people are caught up in the same activity cycles, it is this busy,
busy, busy, busy, busy so that you don‘t have to think that you‘re going to die. It‘s
busy, busy, busy so that you don‘t have that moment to reflect on the fact that all
this may be meaningless. It‘s busy, busy, busy so that you don‘t reflect on the fact
that the very use of your power is a waste of your time and energy. More than that,
you don't want to pay attention because you don't want to be reminded of what you
missed and you don‘t want the comeuppance that‘s due. You just keep running;
running on the treadmill, running on the treadmill, running on the treadmill.

The 2/4 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 4
The 2nd line is interesting because the 2nd line is about the smell of victory. Every
time I hear that line I want to do Robert Duvall. Love the smell of napalm in the
morning, it smells like victory. This is all about power assumes success. I was
trained as a boxer. If you go into a ring and you don't think you have the power to
defeat your opponent you're going to get beaten up. It‘s as simple as that.
One of the things to understand about the smell of victory is that it isn't the same as
victory. These are very different things. To assume that your power is not going to
be challenged, to assume that just because you have power you're going to be able
to succeed. The fact you can control power doesn't mean that you were the only one
who can control power. This is the great comeuppance for all 20/34s. They will go
into a situation assuming that they have the power only to discover that it‘s not
necessarily true.
The 2/4 has to learn that the display of power that brings victory is only a stage in
their development. Now, what's interesting is that if you look at the 34th hexagram
you will see that the only line that isn't a blue line is the 2nd line. We know that the
2/4 has this blockage. It puts up its barriers, it has to receive the call, and it needs
to develop the network in order to be able to succeed in its life. And if it doesn't
answer the call, then it's never going to be transformed in anyway. Yet, it's very
difficult for 2/4 to accept the call. They‘re naturals, after all.
The one thing that's interesting about this 2nd line is that these are the kind of beings
where each display of power that works gives them strength. So, they develop their
power slowly in life, naturally, not unnaturally, but naturally. It is a step-by-step
process. However, the fact that they can feel their power growing doesn't mean it
will always grow and doesn't mean that it will lead to victory, whatever that victory
happens to be. Then you can begin to see something about the 2/4 is that the 2/4 is

only here to be called to victory. It's interesting to think about it. They‘re only here
to be called to victory.
You knock on their door and say, I think you‘ve got a chance to show everybody that
you're the best, that you‘re the one that can be whatever. And every 2/4 knows this
because every 2/4 meets this in their life. So, Momentum is something that's
inborn. The other thing is that it is the perfect counterpoint to the bully. The 2nd line
doesn't know it has power. It‘s there inside of its environment and it‘s doing its
thing. It's always surprised. It‘s very busy in its environment doing its thing being
busy in its own life. It does not realize its power relative to others. The lower
trigram, inside process doesn‘t know. It‘s very surprised when somebody says
(sound); and for them each of these recognitions within their network brings
additional strengths so that at some point they can break out of their shell.
Let's take the archetype of the 20/34 woman that‘s on a 2nd line, and most of the
time they want to be left alone. Most of the time the idea of a lover is just going to
be an inconvenience. They‘re not particularly sexual. They‘re very busy in their
lives. They have things that have to do. But because of that and because of their
insular-ness they don't know that they are powerful. They may not know that they
are attractive because they‘re powerful. In other words, none of that‘s there.
Every time that somebody can penetrate their barrier and just let them know they
become more and more powerful, and more and more open to displaying their
power. I used to describe how somebody who seems to have this shy infrastructure,
they're not necessarily shy people. They can really surprise you. And here, they can
really surprise you. They can hold things in for a very long time—the 2/4 not letting
it out—and then all of a sudden, whoosh, I have the power now, and I'm going to
display it.
These are the most powerful missionaries on the planet, whether they‘re
missionaries of quit smoking, quit drinking, quit screwing, quit whatever, they are
incredible missionaries once they have this feeling that they really do have power.
Like all naturals it has to be pointed out to them. When you see somebody who is a
2/4 and you see their doodles in a notebook and you see it‘s really talented, the
moment you say to them, gee that's really good, wow, does that make a difference
in their life. It gives them the next step in this finally building the momentum to put
their power on display on the outside.

When you‘re dealing with 2/5s there is this incredible dilemma of having to motivate
oneself. And that any display of power is going to receive the backlash of the display
of power. And to be a 2/5 is the assumption that you're shy and docile, and then all
of a sudden you're capable of lashing out. The one thing about a heretic is that
when you have a 2/5 you really have somebody who has the potential for very, very

that, whatever and you have this projection about them and that they're absorbed in
that and you can‘t really access them—these people can really surprise you. They
can end up displaying power you'd never imagine and it's an incredible shock.
The whole thing about the 20/34 is that it is a loose cannon. These beings are
caught on that. There is no other place where Sacral response is more important
than to a 20/34 because it helps put the brakes on. They‘re not a 14. They don‘t
have to accumulate power in life. All 14s have this lifelong process of trying to get
the power. The 34 already has it. They just don't know what the hell to do with it.
And they don't how to use that power, particularly when that 20/34 is in isolation

Machismo: The indiscriminate display of power. I don't think there's anything that
better describes the incredible strength of the 3rd line than this line. In the context
of genetic continuity I think that it really gives you an understanding of the incredible
potential of the 3 to survive just about anything. Now, many people when they look
at this line treat this line through its negative—it‘s a very negative description—
indiscriminate display of power—it‘s called the great malefic, the exalted is called the
great malefic.
Now, if you‘re a Saturn fan, I happen to be a fan of Saturn. I like Saturn. I always
think of Saturn as—I don‘t want to piss Saturn off—but I always think of Saturn as a
kind of transsexual. To me Saturn is a female always trying to look like a male. I
don‘t know why, but I think that's the way the female power sneaks into our lives
against Roman doctrine. But anyway, the other side of this is: A reasoned and
calculated display of power. But the thing about machismo that is so fascinating is
that this is the brute power of the 3rd line.
Now remember, one of the difficulties of the 34 is that the 34 without being guided
by awareness, in other words, without the archetype, the 34 in its direct connection
to the 20 there is, in the lower trigram, an enormous difficulty in understanding how
much power to use. This is always the dilemma. The dilemma of the 34—the 1, 2,
3—is how much power to use. Now, what often happens is that it's much harder to
use less than more. This is a very, very powerful mechanism. So the tendency is to
use more power than is necessary. This is why we get this kind of bully, machismo
kind of feeling from this gate.
But remember that the description of the potential of the gate always has to be seen
in the context of the quantum. And certainty in the context of this cross you‘re
looking at the definition. You can't just look at the gate. And when you're looking
only at the definition what you get is that this use of power is a use of power towards
activity and where there's too much power used. This is one of the tendencies that‘s

inherent in a Manifesting Generator. In other words, they actually use more energy
than is necessary.
This is the handicap of not being this or that if you're a pure Generator or if you are
a Manifestor it is very easy to be able to work from wherever the source is. In other
words, the pure Generator is modulated by the response mechanism of the Sacral,
the Manifestor has the ability through the thyroid to be able to control the way the
manifesting takes place. But the Manifesting Generator is always in conflict. Do I go
yes, or do I go uh-huh? It's always in conflict. It is always there in this underlying
conflict.
So, one of the things to see about the Manifesting Generator is that they're actually
using more energy than a pure Generator and they‘re using too much energy for
their activity, which is why when I talk about MGs skipping things is that they don't
have the energy to go through every one of those steps because they take huge
amounts of energy to jump. So, in somebody's analysis, and they‘ve just got a 34
there and it happens to be the 3 and it's hanging around, then you can see that this
is the potential for them to be carried away with the power when that power is
activated by conditioning.
But when you see it in the 20/34 I really want you to grasp what it actually is
pointing to, it‘s pointing to so much energy being used in the now that there's no
time for anything else. I'm busy dear, I'm sorry I can't do that. No, I can‘t meet
with you, I'm busy. No, I can't work with you, I‘m busy. No, I can‘t talk with you,
I'm busy. So, this is where this machismo in terms of the context of the cross the
way that it works.
So, what you have from a 3/5 is that they‘re going to make a mistake anyway. Not
only that, it‘s going to be projected on them that they're not going to make the
mistake. And the real difficulty for the Manifesting Generator is that when it makes
that mistake rather than going back to try to figure out what happened they try to
use more energy to compensate for the mistake. And of course, this leads into even
deeper, deeper problems.
So, the 3/5 on this cross, the Sleeping Phoenix, you've got to die to wake up. If
you‘re on the Cross of the Sleeping Phoenix until you come to the point where the
Personality can even ponder surrender, there's no possibility that you're going to
wake up, that you‘re going to be able to rise up as something different. Remember,
this is the cross that carries the great mutation. It's the cross that says things are
changing. And in fact, it makes this cross very unstable in any value we give to it.
When you have the 5 at the unconscious the projection field is very, very difficult to
deal with. When you have a 5 Personality as I do, you recognize early in life that
people will think things of you this way or that way that are not necessarily aligned
to how you see or experienced yourself, that there‘s a projection field at work. And
so you learn to compensate, you learn to figure out how to deal with that.
But, if you have it at the unconscious you don't know that. It's not who you think
you are, it's not what you can work with. It's the way in which your vehicle works.

The Power of the Great
And what happens to so many beings with the 5 at the unconscious is that they don't
recognize their intense responsibility to those that approached them because they
don't know why they're being approached. They don't understand it.
What I mean by that is that the moment of the 3/5 says to somebody, I will not live
up to your expectation, and when I say ‗says that,‘ that the 3 shows up and
problems arise and whatever else, that for them this is a devastating experience
because they don't understand why there is such a radical reaction. They don't get
it. What did you expect? Life doesn't work. Well, you thought that I was going to
do what you can‘t. The 3 Personality looks at that and says, what‘s going on, things
don‘t work the way you want them to; relax, calm down. And they go (sound of
deep breath), I thought that you could, and on and on.
So, what happens to a 3/5 in this configuration is that nobody expects to get
smacked and all of a sudden they‘re getting smacked and it's too much for what the
situation called for. And there is this visceral reaction to them. And the 3 is says,
oh, gee I‘m sorry I stepped on the gas so hard. I didn't realize. It happens. In the
end 3/5s on this cross could be real masters of how to use energy. Not only that,
discover how to use this energy. The whole theme of the 20/34 is that until they
have a true focused response to something that there's no place to properly channel
their kind of power. And this is all about power.

The 3/6 RAC Sleeping Phoenix 4
My concern on this cross for the 3/6 is that because it is mutative, because it's
aligned to cross that‘s mutative, it's all a 6 process, I think that they're very, very
vulnerable in the early part of their life through visceral reaction to their misuse of
power. 3/6s on this cross can end up, as a kid for example, using too much power in
a confrontation with somebody and ending up being severely wounded in that
process. In other words, the cause and effect of this kind of power—you put the
power out, you get the power back. This is why the use of power has to come with
technique, has to come with subtlety, and has to come with experience.
So the 3/6 is going to have, particularly in the 3-3 phase, enormous problems with
using the power correctly. Again, always think about it as not knowing how to subtly
give gas. They stomp on the gas pedal. And in stomping on the gas pedal they just
blow people away. And then it all comes pouring back at them and they're not very
good at taking that because in the first Saturn cycle with the deep pessimism that
can be there from experience that these are beings that violence is never far away
as a solution because it's just nothing but frustration. It‘s just frustration.
Anytime that you're dealing with 3s, anytime you're dealing with particularly 3/6s
and 6/3s, the quality and the level of intelligence and how they‘re raised means so
much. I‘m never concerned for the people that know Human Design about their
children. What astonishes me, what is so spooky for me, are the billions of children
who are living in the not-self of all this, who carry these kinds of configurations and

you know damn well where it's going to lead. Don‘t give me a Cross of the Sleeping
Phoenix with the Sun in 34 child soldier with an Uzi in their hand when they‘re 12
years old. I don't want to see that. There is nothing more frightening on the whole
planet, this indiscriminate display of power out of deep frustration.
The 3/6 in this configuration is going to misuse this power. And not because it's bad
or anything, it‘s just what happens. The lower trigram never understands that there
is an upper trigram. It ever gets it. It‘s so closed in on its own process that it has
no idea the consequences of its actions. It doesn't realize it. The 34.3 goes whack
and doesn't think anything of it, and assumes that it all stops the moment that the
blow is gone. And it doesn't realize that this like a ripple in a bathtub, like a tsunami
from the sea that when it goes out, oh boy, does it build power and come roaring
back and then they‘re all surprised. They say: Moi? They‘ve got a 6th Color
underneath the Personality.

The 4/6
RAC Sleeping Phoenix 4
Let‘s go to the 4/6, and we get to the beginning of why the 4 has influence. So
much can be seen in the archetype of this 34th gate because it powers integration.
So we have the line of Triumph. And remember it is a blue lead-in so it‘s a lifelong
process, you don't get this right away—the freedom in absolute victory—but first you
have to have victory. I'll explain that in a moment. The freedom in absolute victory
to unlimited use of power. Now, that's quite a blessing. But there is a criterion here
and the criterion is ‗in absolute victory.‘ So, what is this victory? The victory is
learning how to restrain excessive power. If you learn how to restrain excessive
power, then you're going to be able to use power efficiently without limitation. But
you have to find a way to control this power.
In this context it leads to confidence to use power subtly or lack of confidence, which
of course is going to lead to misuse of the power. But, the thing to see about the 4 is
that the 4, because it has built into it a mildness—after all, the 4 is the theme of
brotherhood/sisterhood, it is a theme of general friendship. It is a theme of the
interlocutor between the lower trigram and the upper trigram. It is a networking
agent. It is the foundation of what becomes juxtaposition and this great bridging of
the two sides.
So, the things to see about the 4 is that here begins the understanding that the use
of power is always determined by who you‘re using the power with or to. In other
words, it is the power being seen as it affects the outside. Now, that's totally
different. The moment that you begin to see how power impacts the other, you then
can very easily learn how to suddenly change the methodology. And when you learn
to see how power influences the other then you can gain confidence in the use of
your power.
Again, this tells us so much about the nature of the 4th line. What it's really saying is
that this ability that I describe of the 4th line building and investing in a network, all

of this is about the proper use of power. If you're investing in a network and you put
too much concentration over here and start to ignore over there you‘re going to lose
the potential advantages and opportunities that were over there. And so you begin
to see that they need to be able to discriminate, they need to be able to be very
subtle in their technique of how they use their energy to maintain a broader network.
But 4/6s are 4/6s. You‘ve got a 6th line profile; you‘re going to go through deep
transition in the life. And again the dilemma; the 4-3 phase, if you're aligned with
the wrong fractal community, if you‘re aligned with the wrong geometries, then the
way you learn to use your power has nothing to do with the way you need to learn to
use your power. It‘s like getting hooked up with a bunch of people who are the
archetype of peace and love and you end up smoking marijuana and going to love
fests, those things don‘t exist anymore, well, marijuana does, but nonetheless, love
fests are out, but anyway, that kind of thing where all of a sudden you're aligned
with these kinds of beings and the display of power is something that has to be
minimized to a level where it's almost innocuous. It has to become something totally
different.
And any rise of that power to anything that would display any kind of brute force
would immediately receive rejection. And yet, that being may not belong in that
crowd at all. What will happen to them is that like any sacral dysfunction, slowly but
surely their energy system does not work correctly. The other side of the coin is you
end up with a very rough crowd. And in a very rough crowd it‘s very easy for the 34
to use power in a very physical, dynamic and violent way. And again that may not
be; but, the consequences for both.
In other words, again, this goes back to if you've got a child that has the 4th line in
their profile, if they‘re a 4/6 particularly, then you have to pay a great deal of
attention to who their friends are when they're young. And to be able to see very
clearly that for them to guide them one way or another, if they're a Generator it's
not about you wanting to belong to that group, that that is not the way for you, but
does the group want you. If the group wants you and they call you and you go
naturally to that, then it's okay. In other words, those early friendships are going to
be very important with the Sleeping Phoenix. They‘re essential, because otherwise
you go through a whole cycle in which the possibility to learn how to use your energy
efficiently really is lost; not the physical costs.
When I talk about going from subjectivity to objectivity, from pessimism to optimistic
in this movement of the first cycle to them being on the roof, you have to see that‘s
chemical. My description of it is an adjective of a chemical process. And you have to
see that if you're operating with the 34th gate as your theme and you‘re a 4-3 and
you‘re not with the right beings the chemistry that you are producing is different.
And that very chemistry is the chemistry that brings out the quality of the
pessimism. We know that. We take drugs to change our moods. How easy it is—
we‘ve got all kinds of receptors in the brain for endorphins that will immediately give
us a chemistry that makes us feel good. And you have to see that the chemistry
that makes you pessimistic, the chemistry that gives you this terrible feeling that's
all it is, is a chemistry.

One of my biggest things about trying to awaken the Personality is to remind you
that the vehicle operates as a chemical thing, that the experiences of this or that,
the up and down, the good mood and bad mood, the upset and not upset, and the
melancholy and the not, it's all just chemistry; nothing more, nothing less. But that
chemistry—the whole thing about operating correctly through your strategy and your
authority is that you align, you balance this chemistry. And that you don't distort it
so that you're moving more towards the pessimistic or more towards the other side.

The 4/1
That brings us to the 4/1 and it brings us to the pure display of power, the
Juxtaposition Cross of Power. These are incredibly focused people. There is always
the potential in the 4/1 to be focused to the point of being stupid. And this is one of
its dilemmas. In other words, there is a narrowness in the 4/1 that does not allow it
to see beyond its own nose at
times. And it is a narrowness that
locks it into a framework that makes
it very, very difficult for it to see the
consequences of its actions. It can
only see the consequences of its
actions directly down its tunnel.
And this is the dilemma of this
Juxtaposition Cross of Power.
Whenever you have a shift at the
unconscious level, you've got this
shift taking place at the unconscious
level, you're moving away from the
55 element. So, the moment that
you move from the Cross of the
Sleeping Phoenix, this variation, into
the Juxtaposition Cross of Power,
you move away from this mutative
imprint underneath. There is no
need to die to be reborn as a 4/1.
There has been this shift. And the moment that we see this shifting, we also know
something else; this power is only there for the narrowest activity.
We talk about 4/1s having fixed fate. There is no better example of fixed fate than
this particular example. In other words, this Juxtaposition Cross of Power is just
going to display power, but relative to one thing. If you meet a 4/1 on this cross and

you have this knowledge in you, you expect them to be someone where you feel at
any moment they're going to blow you over.
Now, 20/34s do have a frequency anyway. But the reality is, unless you happen to
step into their tunnel you don't notice it at all. Not only that, but of all the 20/34s
they‘re the least busy. What I mean by that is they‘re the least busy in a diversified
way. 20/34s tend to be the kind of beings that there is always something that is
occupying them, and they‘re always busy about something. If they happen to be
splits it's even worse because they will be busy with multiples of things at the same
time.
But when you get to the 4/1 because there is this very, very narrow direction, a very
narrow activity direction, that whatever energy they have is focused there. And
what I mean by that is the power part of the energy is focused there. And there is
nothing left over to be carried away in other things. This is the kind of 4/1 that if
you don‘t go their way you might as well forget having anything to do with them.
It‘s not just their way is the highway; their way is the only way. And they‘re going to
do that with a great deal of power. Remember that the 4/1 works out of a single
foundation. It‘s this very, very basic foundation.

The Left Angle Cross of Duality 2  20  37
The 5/1
We're dealing with the opposition to Civilization and in this opposition to Civilization
the form that is created in Civilization then has to go through its energy, its yang
experience and the yang experience is the recognition of the decay of the form.
Everything about the 20/34 configuration is that the only way in which we can
successfully deal with the fact that we are terminal is to do as much as we can and
be as busy as we can along the way. To be able to drive our consciousness in
activity is the driving force in the 20/34.
So, when you step into the Left Angle Cross of Duality you immediately have the
bargain underneath, you immediately have the arrival of the tribe. Now, Duality is a
very strange thing. And it is the place where you see the meeting between these
two very special definitions, that is, oppositions that are definitions. There is only
one way to connect the ego and the Solar Plexus. There are some things to look at
from the point of view of singularity in Design. And I mentioned to you that the
43/23 is the pure Projector, the 20/34 is the pure Manifesting Generator, the 45/21
as the pure ego Manifestor, and the 59/6 as the pure emotional Generator. There
are these archetypal primary examples. And when you're looking at the 40/37 you
have the all only connection between the ego and the emotions.

Now, the interesting thing is if you could take that channel, the 40/37, and slide it
over to the Sacral, you would have immortality, and when you pull it back to the
emotional system you have a human life. It‘s really something to think about. And
you have a human life that is terminal. So if anything understands the terminal-ness
of what it is to be human it‘s the 40/37. And this is ultimately one's bargain with
God.
It's like, okay bless you Lord for giving us life, and take us back when we go. So you
end up with the 40/37 as a mystical bridge, the seeking of spirituality, the seeking of
religion, and the attempt to codify it
into a bargain. But the bargain is
already there. The bargain was
written long before humans could
think. The bargain is there. And we
have to see very clearly that when
you're looking at the 40/37 you're
looking at the mouth and the
stomach. And the mouth and the
stomach is life as a symbol.
So the moment we move into
Duality we move into something
entirely different. There is a tension
between individual selfish activity
and the demands of the mouth and
the stomach. So here you begin in
this cross, this is the purest
example of what we call split
definition. This is the birth of split
definition. And you can see that the
gods said, there shall be split definition. This is it. And when you look at this Cross
of Duality and you see it in that context then you begin to understand what is really
going on within this cross itself, which is the dilemma of being a binary: individual
imperative, communal responsibility. And that you begin to see the basic tension of
what it is to be human.
Remember these three channels that are oppositions that are defined are the
bedrock of the whole program system in terms of how we are designed over all to
operate. So the moment you bring these two together is like, okay, here's our
dilemma. How do we cross this bridge, how do we cross the bridge between
individual selfish activity and communal responsibility, how do we do that?
Everything becomes that. And when you think about civilization which starts this
form principle, by the time that you get it to here, the whole thing becomes okay, if
we can figure out how to bring that individual selfishness and align it with communal
support that will keep us busy until the end. The line in between is called love. It‘s
very interesting. All split definitions are on Earth to remind us that we need love,
which is a nice thing to say about them.

The Power of the Great
All right let‘s get to the 5th line because it‘s really scary. The Left Angle Cross of
Duality, the 5th line is Annihilation: The total elimination of resistance; the power to
destroy completely or the difficulty in destroying completely. It really is that way.
This total elimination of resistance is an incredible concept because it is at the root of
the heretical program. Everything in the heretical program has been let's reduce
resistance. Let's get rid of resistance. If we get rid resistance everything is so much
easier. If you live correctly, you eliminate resistance. It‘s a 5th line heretic‘s pitch to
you.
Me with integration and no 34, I really understand this concept, this need to use
power to eliminate resistance. But remember the trickiness of this cross. It's not
just about eliminating resistance so that the individual can flourish. It‘s to eliminate
the resistance in the distance between individual selfishness and communal necessity
and communal demand. And the individual is deeply resistant to giving up their
individuality to the tribe. And the tribe is absolutely demanding that the individual
come to the tribe. There's tremendous pressure in that. And when they come to the
tribe, it‘s to be like them, like the monkey song in Jungle Book: I wish I could be like
you.
34.5s scare the hell out of people, just their auras, not about them as beings, just
their auras. They will not allow anything to get in their way. Now of course, if you
understand the 20/34 is the archetype of the Manifesting Generator, you see
somebody who could be seriously fucked up because they won't allow anything to
get in the way and they end up being Manifestors. They end up trying to slam
everything with its power, break everything down with its power, fight its way
through and yet at the same time it feels guilty as hell. Oh, I have friends of mine
who are the embodiment of this split and the horror of their existence.
The moment that you have the Sacral to the Throat and the 40/37 is hanging to the
side, you have people who live the manifesting delusion. And every time they come
into contact with their other side they break down, they just breakdown. And so
there is an inner conflict, a deep inner conflict. The Cross of Duality as an
expression, as a heretical expression, can be the example to show us all how to deal
with our own internal dilemmas. We all carry mixes of this and that within our
designs. And to see that even when they're not as purely accentuated as you see
here, still we deal with it within ourselves.
The other thing is projection has a hard time in being accurate. Projection is just
projection. The 5/1 on this cross sees itself as being a single definition. This is one
of the dilemmas of splits, and I‘m talking about basic splits, not triples splits, but
triple splits are 11% of the population. They always have an understanding that
they are a split. But many pure splits which represents 45% of humanity most of
the time they live consciously in one split. It is the part that holds them.
So, this projection field can be very, very difficult. You go up to a 5/1 of this cross
and you approach them through their community they may not recognize you. You
approach them as an individual through their activity they might. In other words,
there are all kinds of limitations. The other thing is to project on a 5/1 on this cross
that they're going to be your communal support mechanism is almost suicidal.

The 5/2s will not bother. Whenever I heard about the concept of spontaneous
combustion I immediately thought of this cross and 5/2s. It's like they're in their
room and it‘s been building up for years and all of a sudden just oh wham and it‘s
gone and all that is left is a little bit of dandruff, it‘s over. They are so aware of
resistance. To be a 2 is to understand people are looking at you. To be a 5 is to
understand that people are looking at you. You know; it's part of the projection
field.
To be a 5/2 on this cross you don‘t want to have anything to do with it. It‘s like I
don‘t want to deal with all that out there. I‘m going to have to spend the rest of my
life hitting people with a hammer. I don‘t want to do this. So they close themselves
off into their own environment. And particularly in this day and age when you have
all kinds of virtual possibilities, 5/2s are actually better equipped in many ways than
they ever were. You can now have a cave that‘s online, so that you really have a
way in which you can be withdrawn from society.
The other thing is in the virtual world the display of power and activity are very
different things. And so there is a subtlety to it. The other thing is that in the virtual
environment there are so many possibilities that the 5/2 is always looking for the
place of least resistance. And so rather than using its power to find resistance its
activity tends to be towards finding the place of least resistance, and they're only
motivated to find a place of least resistance.

the Sacral system is to know when enough is enough. And this is really so
important. Everything about the Sacral life, whether it be Sacral or non-Sacral, is
about knowing when enough is enough.
So, this line is very special in that sense. It's interesting the way it‘s phrased: The

this to be overwhelmed by enthusiasm and this is very much the 3rd line thematic of
the first phase of the life, and very much a not-self potential.
The lack of restrictions can sap one's strength. Now, this is the perfect expression of
the dilemma of the Manifesting Generator. Please think about this 20/34. If you're
an MG, if you want to understand what it is to be a Manifesting Generator, this is
where you can understand it, and then you can look at your particular variation. But
this is where the whole nature of the Manifesting Generator rides. And the fact is
that it is about coming to grips with knowing when enough is enough, how to use
power correctly. That‘s all. It‘s just about using power correctly and knowing when
to turn it off.
Have you ever noticed that there are some people in their display of power that will
have a victory, whatever it is, in an argument, in a whatever, and you've got the
white flag up and you‘re saying okay, I accept, I agree and they keep on hammering
you and you‘ve got the flag up and they keep on hammering you. At some point you
drop the flag. They don‘t know when enough is enough.
It‘s like seeing a child kill an ant. Have you ever seen a child kill an ant? (Pounding
sound) it‘s like please, isn‘t that a little overstated? One little pound and it‘s over,
but (sound of more pounding). This is the whole thing about the Sacral; you don‘t
know when enough is enough. And of course, that‘s not just energy; the energy
converted into whatever. An emotionalized Sacral being who doesn't know when
enough is enough is spooky as hell. They just keep on putting it into you, putting it
into you, putting to you and putting it into you. And you‘re there begging, pleading.
You‘ll admit to any crime. It‘s like being under interrogation by mean people.
Whatever you want me to say, I did it. It‘s still not enough. Tell me more. I told
you everything. Tell me more. I told you everything. What to do.
6/2s on this cross have to learn because knowing when enough is enough is an art.
The open Sacral can learn this more quickly, obviously, because it is open. It takes it
in. And it can, if it understands the process, realize that it doesn‘t need to hold on to
this frequency and it can let go of it. But that‘s not the same for a Sacral being.
Once a Sacral gets rolling, it's going to roll until it's exhausted. It‘s the thing about
the Sacral.
So, it‘s not about changing the Sacral, it is about regulating the response. Most of
this not enough is enough is the Manifestor aspect of not anger. MGs display rage,
like road rage, it‘s not anger. Rage is frustration mixed with power. It‘s just
powered up frustration. So one of the things you see in 6/2s when they‘re very
young is this display of rage. And often the rage brings the enough is enough.
You‘re stuck in traffic, it‘s hot, there are idiots around you, you go into a full-blown
rage, you take out the baseball bat from the backseat your car, you get out of your
car, you go up to the car in front of you and you smash the window screaming at the
top of your lungs, and then you go sit down in your car and you‘re calm. You turn
on some nice music. The police show up. You‘re very polite. I'm really sorry. The
Sacral out of the 34 is really spooky.

So, when you get to the top of the ladder and you get the 6/2 you have to see that
this can really be a distortion for them. That act of rage that ends up putting them
in jail when that‘s not where they're supposed to be in their life. There are all kinds
of consequences to this. It can be a very heavy gate, after all. It‘s also about you
learning enough is enough by overloading yourself. The exaltation is after having
bitten off more than you can chew. It‘s after. This is the thing to realize. This is
this after; you‘ve got to get it afterwards.

The 6/3
LAC Duality 2
6/3s are always caught between two worlds—the madness of their own hexagram,
because they‘re a 6/3 and they go through that typical 3-3 process, and the
unknowable of what's next. And it is an unknowable. We have this thing where we
have this connection between Throat gates and Sacral gates. We‘ve been following
this connection. The 14, the 34, now the 9, we‘re going to go to the 5. In other
words, we have this very special connection between the Throat and the Sacral.
So, the 6/3 here in learning what is enough is enough that the whole thinking about
the Generator, the whole thing about the Manifesting Generator is that unless they
have the right thing to be focused on they cannot use their energy properly. And in
not using their energy properly, all of the problems arise.
What you see when you move from the 34 to the next step is that you go to the 9.
And in going to the 9 you go into a logical process, you go into a logical format and
you go into a format of energy detail. In other words, we‘re beginning to see a
maturation from the brute power and its potential display that we see both in the 14
and the 34. These are two very, very difficult gates to deal with, because both of
them have to deal with power and both of them have to deal with power in a
different way. But they're the ones where the volatility of the power inherent in
those gates can make it particularly difficult, and the consequences for the not-self.
But here we‘re taking a different step. We‘re moving into a very, very focused
realm, exactly what the 34 needs. In other words, the 6/3 looking in that direction,
when it comes off its roof, it will come off its roof in an activity pointed towards
detail, focusing the energy.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 4

Introduction
The Cross of Planning has worked very well. It‘s been very effective. The last 400
years have given us an incredible infrastructure for the expansion of our intelligence
and ultimately our awareness. So much of that is rooted in the 9th gate; the deep
need for detail. And how important it is for us to be able to focus on the detail
because it's only through this global spectrum of detailed foci that we actually get to
a point where we can see glimpses of truth in ultimate synthesis.
The 9 also in its relationship to the 16, because they are both logical we still
maintain in the right angle the 40/37 underneath. And again, whenever you have a
cross that has a defined channel, regardless of the fact that we happen to be where
the Sun is in the 9, this cross is dominated by this definition. And there isn't
anything you can do about that. It isn't to say that we cannot analyze out of the
Personality Sun, but you need to understand that this is the definition and the
definition is going to dominate, it's going to dominate because it carries with it a
fundamental responsibility. The 40/37 was given to us because community has been
the bedrock of our evolution, this way of being able to come together for protection,
security, resources, nurturing all of those things.
The Taming Power of the Small, the gate of focus: Potential can be fulfilled
through detailed attention to all pertinent aspects. It‘s my comment about all the
bizarre in the New Age, may it all survive. How important it is that it all has a chance
to be investigated, that everything needs to be seen. In order for us to grasp the
essence of the maya no word must be missing. Maya is an interesting thing. In
order to understand maya you need to have all the detail. If you have all the detail
you can really understand the maya.
If I had a computer I would need a quantum computer which will never exist, but
nonetheless, if I had a computer that could calculate the number of atoms in the
universe in a matter of minutes then I could actually then input every single birth on
this planet, every single human being along with the program and their
interrelationships in terms of where they are through GPS positioning and I can
actually sit back and see anything about life on Earth, at least in terms of us. Now of
course, it‘s not possible. But this is what detail is all about.
In other words, there is no real understanding of the global maya until you have all
the detail of the global maya, which is why we do statistical analyses. We want to
see, like in the global survey, which is now 44 or 45,000 entries, we're beginning to
see this very clear mapping of the way in which type and profile and all of these
things are out there in the global body. So the detail work is important.

The 1/3
The 1/3, Sensibility: A balanced and responsible approach to problem solving. How
beautiful for a Sacral gate to begin with the ability to avoid frustration through the
creation of new forms. This is also the line where after running around like crazy
looking for something you kick in the door and you find the keys in your pocket.
That's not very sensible. The tendency in the 9.1 is that, again, this is a Sacral
condition, if you're in the wrong
thing you don't have the energy for
the right thing. If you're born to be
sensible, if you're born to have a
practical way of balanced and
responsible way of solving
problems, and nothing better for a
1/3, give a 1/3 this configuration
you can end up with incredible
genius. But, if you're using your
energy incorrectly you‘re not
learning how to solve the problems
that you need to learn how to solve,
nor the way to solve them.
Remember, this is, with the
exception of the 2nd line, this is all
blue lead-ins. This is all
developmental processes. You're
not born sensible. So, it means that
conditioning plays a very important
element in all of this. The 1/3 who is the natural enclosed intellectual can have
within this the ability not so much to find answers as to be able to see methodology.
In other words, this balanced and responsible approach to problem solving, doesn't
mean the problems are solved. But the approach is very clever.
And if we‘re going to work with the detail you need to see that how you explore the
detail, the way you try to work out a problem is really giving you already the
solution. It‘s one of the most beautiful things about the detail process. So here,
what we‘re looking at is the foundation of what we would call scientific methodology.
In other words, here is a methodology for solving a problem. Here is the way we're
going to have to do it. Remember, this is a root of the whole logical, theoretical,
practical process.

The 1/4
RAC Planning 4
The 1/4 has a dilemma that the 1/3 doesn't have. The 1/3 will develop its own
methodology and the 1/4 will accept methodology. In the life of the 1/4, the
deepest influence is going to be their parents in that first seven-year cycle. So the
way that the father solves problems or the way the mother solves problems is going
to have a deep influence on the way in which this being is going to approach problem
solving. If the father's idea of solving a problem is calling somebody on the
telephone to get them to come over, the child will never learn how to solve the
problems himself. If the mother‘s response to difficulties with a problem is to be
frustrated and to get annoyed and all of these things, this is going to be part of the
way in which the child is going to approach problem solving.
So, the 1/4 is going to inherit this. The 1/4 is going to inherit the problem solving
technology from the parent. This is one of those places where you see these
children that get prodigal training, they get special training from their parents
because the parents have a problem solving approach to life so they teach their
children mathematical things very early or very complex things. You have all these
people that have methodologies for being able to teach people how to answer, how
to solve problems.

The 2/4
RAC Planning 4
The 2nd line is where you let out that secret about the 2s that they don‘t want
everybody to know. And the secret is that they love company. They really do, but
of course it has to be very special for them. It has to be just the right company. But
it‘s not one of these things where you see that all 2s are piss-off; I don‘t want to
have anything to do with you. I‘ve got this barrier and you can't get in. Remember,
that that's a genetic technology. It's just the genetic saying in order for you to take
somebody in you have to have barriers, you can‘t just let everybody in. But to really
see at the heart of the 2nd line being is this Misery Loves Company. They love
company, but they love company for a purpose.
Collaboration with others to temper frustration; by the way, this is not a blue lead-in.
If you‘re a 9.2 you‘re born with this, which is very important because it means deep
within the genetics—it‘s not a matter of something that is drawn out over the lifetime
by experience and conditioning—here is something that is inherent in the very
dynamic of the being. And so what they need is that they‘re looking to collaborate in
order to end frustration.
Now, think about the Generator. If a Generator is alone in a cave and it's cut off
from the program it will die because it will not know what to do. Generators are

Taming Power of the Small
born to respond. You‘ve got to have something to respond to. And one of the most
important things in the Generator‘s life that they‘re going to respond to is other
human beings. And it's built into this. And the only way to temper frustration is
through collaboration—do you want to do this? Uh-uh. Okay. It‘s through that
collaboration.
So, it is one of the underlying themes of how the natural can be brought into the
detail program. After all, the 2nd line is a line of natural gifts. The 1 will study, the 1
will investigate. That‘s its gift. But the 2nd is born with it, just as you see in this
line, the archetype of the 2, you don't even have this blue lead, you don't have this—
here it is, it‘s just there, it‘s natural. It's a natural gift for working with others if it
will temper frustration. And it tells you something about 2nd line beings when you go
to their house. If you frustrate them you're never getting in again. They‘ll change
the locks on the door, their phone number, no chance, never again, because it‘s one
of the most important things.
The other thing is logic doesn't like frustration. You can see that so clearly in the
18/58. Most people see only the negative of the 18/58; that is, that it‘s critical. And
negative only in the sense that they're not necessarily against the criticism, it‘s the
way it‘s delivered. But the fact of the matter is that only illogic can be satisfied.
Nothing else can be satisfied. Logic can be satisfied. This is the whole goal of the
58. The 58 says we can get to satisfaction, get those corrections, work it out,
practice, prefect it. Let‘s get it out and in the end we‘re going to be satisfied with
our logical product, whatever that may be. So, satisfaction is something that's
possible.
Frustration is terrible. There‘s nothing like not being able to get the collaboration
you need in order to investigate something and get beyond the frustration to a point
where you have enough details and the energy for the detail to get the damn
solution and be satisfied. It‘s like examinations when you're in school as a kid.
Some examinations are very straightforward. You have a math test. If you get 100
in a math test, you're incredibly satisfied, because it's an absolute. Right? One and
one equal two; you get a tick, good, yeah, I got it, I‘m satisfied. It‘s wonderful.
But the same thing for an English exam, like literature and this kind of thing, and
you get a high mark, you don‘t even know what that means. Not unless they‘re
counting spelling mistakes and you can actually see them taking things off and
whatever. Logic is wonderful that way. Logic says we can be satisfied. So, Sacral
logical gates are always trying to overcome frustration because that means they're
on the right track and have the right details and are going to get to satisfaction.
Everybody who carries a 9th gate in their design is under risk of missing details. And
as you progress through the lines, the consequences of missing the details become
more severe. The 2nd line has a possibility in missing the details, in not having the
energy for the details that collaboration will fail and frustration will be the result.
And remember that this is a format energy and is subject to depression. So, the
frustration in the 9th gate is much more intense than frustration in any other of the
Sacral gates.

The 2/5
RAC Planning 4
One of the advantages for the 2/5s and the 5/2s is this new age that we live in, this
technological age that we live in. It's much easier for 2/5 to collaborate virtually, as
an example, than it would be for 2/5 to be able to collaborate in the flesh; any 5.
For a 5, distance is always a wonder, because you're out of the projection field itself.
So it provides you with an opportunity to not constantly have to deal with trying to
balance your reaction to the projection field.
When you're dealing with a 2/5 here there is a deep suspicion—the 5 is paranoid, it‘s
suspicious—there's a deep suspicion of the approach of the other. And yet, because
it‘s 2nd line there is this underlying ‗I really need another.‘ The natural is not good at
details. It‘s looking for collaboration with somebody that makes detail work fun that
takes away the frustration of doing detail work because you‘re doing the detail with
somebody else and out of that you get a very positive energy.
The 2/4s in this process are the ones that will bring somebody into their hermit‘s
environment and there they are, like kids doing homework together who apart
wouldn‘t enjoy that detail process at all, but together they're having fun looking
things up on the Internet and checking things in research books or whatever. But
the 2/5s have to motivate themselves. What they realize is that there is much more
potential frustration in trying to collaborate than there is in suffering the misery of
having no one to collaborate with. So, they end up with this equation that pulls
them further and further away.

The 3/5 RAC Planning 4
When you talk about the consequences of missing details, the archetype of this is the
9.3—The Straw that Breaks the Camel's Back—which I‘ve always loved as an
expression. There are many camel expressions that I like. The overlooked minor
element that always—that‘s a frightening line—always predetermines failure. When
you read a line like that—always?—always. The only difference is that the failure can
be tiny, tiny or it can be really, really big. It just depends on what that overlooked
element happened to be.
It's a very funny reverse. I'm always fascinated by when the Earth is exalted and
the Sun is in detriment and you have some of these in this configuration. The Earth
exaltation: The use of force to temporarily overcome impediments. In other words,
this is one of those ―I missed the detail. I will just use power to push past it.‖ And
you can‘t. This is always the tendency in the Sacral. The Sacral has a very hard
time when it's not-self in accepting that they've made a mistake because their
energy is driving them.

Taming Power of the Small
This is the ultimate 3rd line theme, in that sense, the overlooked element. All 3rd line
beings are here not to overlook things, not to just go like this, they don't do that.
They have to go in them, because if they miss something it can be everything. And
when you're dealing with the theme of the 9 which is to provide the energy for the
establishment of proper patterns, if you miss something, everything that follows is
going to be wrong.
It is amazing how many of research projects in the advanced scientific world are
projects that go on for years based on a flaw that was at the very beginning of the
research that was never dealt with and at the end the whole thing collapses. So, it's
one of these things about these little details. It was my concern when I was talking
about Color—got to have all the details, because if you miss anything the
consequences can be vast, because from the 9 you‘re going to the 5, you‘re setting
the pattern. If there is something missing in the pattern it will collapse; details. It‘s
like that lovely passenger bridge at Charles de Gaulle airport. They left out a few
little details in the original plans, and the damn thing gets built without those little
details and the thing collapses. And then they say, why? How did you overlook
that?
So, this is the calling card. When I was doing a lot of business analysis I would come
to lines like this and they would say what do we do with people like this. The thing
to recognize is if this being is operating properly they're going to recognize the detail
that's missing. Remember, logic can always achieve satisfaction. The straw that
breaks the camel's back can also be a gift of seeing where the straw is that could
break the camel's back. And this is one of the deepest potential gifts when you're
dealing with the 3 here and particularly when you're dealing with the 3/5. The 3/5
for me always has the potential of being the great scientific theoretical mind. 3/5s
have an enormous potential to be able to universalize the recognition of what's
wrong. And in that gift of being able to recognize and universalize what's wrong, the
potential of being able to universalize the detail that's missing that made it wrong.
I always talk about how 3s can discover out of the trial and error process, and this
line is what it's all about. Most people just see it as ―uh-oh,‖ but it‘s not. If you‘re
operating correctly as a Sacral being—it‘s much more difficult if you‘re non-Sacral
and you have this gate—if you‘re operating correctly as a Sacral being you have the
potential of recognizing that ―uh-oh.‖ That's the detail that if that's missing,
everything is going to mess up. And if you're not operating correctly, it happens to
you all the time because this is ―always.‖ Because the moment that you see that
this 9 is rooted in collaboration—after all, it‘s collective, it's about sharing—there's
always going to be missing detail, always. There‘s always something missing.
It doesn't necessarily mean what's missing at the broadest extent of it means that
anything is wrong, but you have to see that the maya is a vast. You can‘t get all the
detail, like me getting all the designs and be able to see the whole thing. So the
Sacral that's operating correctly will recognize those details that will make a
difference that can break the camel's back.

But as we well know, wishing for somebody on the Cross of Planning who was a 3/5
who is really going to be able to function in this way, you can see what the program
wanted. The program wanted detailed to be missing, because if all the details were
there we would have been able to arrest the mutative process and we would have
been able to save ourselves a lot of grief, would have had a world in which people
were more likely to wake up than not, and so forth and so on. Details were intended
to be missed.
So, what's interesting about giving Sacrals the opportunity to abandon slave hood to
the missing detail we end up with the possibility of Sacral beings being builders
because they know precisely what's been missing in the past, because they know
through trial and error, and what can be brought to that experienced in the future or
that pattern in the future.

The 3/6
RAC Planning 4
The Cross of Planning as a global cycle is slowly going out the door for us. So
obviously this cross is something that is very, very powerful in this time. And again,
as I go through this always remember that the 40/37 is underneath. Always see
very clearly that the work of detail and the work of focus on detail through this cross
is inherently there to support the establishment and maintenance of community. It
just is.
So, when we go to the 3/6 we have this dilemma that they're going to make
disastrous mistakes when they're young. It‘s why my whole thing with 3/6s and
6/3s is like wow, you‘ve got this far, did you? And you can really see built into the
3-3 is that you're going to have this overlooked details and those overlook details
can be devastating. You forget to turn off the gas. It‘s amazing what kind of details
can be overlooked that can be devastating in your life.
So, so one of the things with this whole business is caution. I have a child that's a
9.3, my oldest son. And it's obvious to me with his Mercury there that there are
details that he misses. And yet, I've begun to see that he sees details that I would
miss all the time. In other words, there is this gift in this line to be able to see that
missing detail, and this is something that we have to nurture in Sacral beings on this
cross and particularly this misunderstanding.
But again, with 3/6s, even more so than 6/3s because they never get to really enjoy
the conscious optimism that the 6/3 gets to enjoy, is that so much for them is about
their upbringing, so much for them is about whether or not there is going to be
awareness in the early part of their life. Anybody who's a 3/6 who comes to this
knowledge as an adult knows that they're lucky to be here. And also knows how
difficult it is to deal with the consequences of that first part of your life.

The 4/6
RAC Planning 4
That leads us to the 4/6 and to a line that‘s called Dedication. There is genetic
continuity throughout Design. Regardless of the pressures or stress the disciplined
attention to detail. 4s have to be dedicated to their networks and in being dedicated
to their network they need to know the detail. A great deal of what the 9th gate is
about, particularly at the transpersonal level, is about bringing together others for
the common pursuit of a focus.
Now, we see this in the way in which the Cross of Planning era has operated, so that
for example instead of having the mad scientist or the alchemist for the witch all by
themselves somewhere trying to figure out the mysteries of the universe, that you
have giant scientific factories where you have thousands and thousands of highly
educated beings all focused on being able to produce a cheaper iPod, or whatever
the hell it is. This is really the way in which it has worked. And this is very much a
9.4 phenomena.
It's the power to act on the potential of the focus; but please understand something.
It‘s the power to act when the network is established to work on the focus. It‘s
getting others to participate. Everything about this is really very deep here in the
natural element of the 2nd line that says, you‘ve got to have company, you‘ve got to
be able to collaborate. If there's no collaboration, there is no future for logic. Logic
cannot stand on its own. And that the only way we‘re really going to understand
anything, and I mean understand, is that we have to be able to collaborate and the
9.4 is the beginning of the recognition as a skill that they can network with those to
create this collaboration.
However, it is a Sacral gate. It is going to go through the 4-3 and one of the things
that you can see about any Sacral gate is that the moment it's not operating
correctly it doesn't really matter what the line is, that there is this frequency of the
Sacral that gets locked into the wrong thing. And as long as it's locked into the
wrong thing it is practically impossible to do anything until they are exhausted with
it. So, if you get into the wrong track, you get into the wrong detail, until you have
reached your point of exhaustion. No matter how many people are around you,
you're not going to respond. After all, the world is not-self. It's very different when
you're talking about a Sacral being that is operating out of response. It‘s very, very
different.
The other thing is that this is about being able to act on potential. And the only way
that you can act on that potential is if you create this pool of energy, this sharing of
the energy to do with the detail work. It's all about whether you can do the detail
work. So often what happens with the 4/6 here is that they just want to run in and
do something even when all the details are not fleshed out, even when the
collaboration is not arranged properly or completed. And any 4 who tries to operate
without the backing of their network ultimately fails.

The 4/1
The Juxtaposition Cross of Focus—transcendence is always a funny word. Whenever
you look at the 64 and the 63 and when we move into Focus this becomes the
unconscious arm. We lose the 40/37. We lose the tribal and we get the collective
on top of the collective. We get a logical collective gate and we get an abstract gate,
the 64-63. But remember something about the 64-63—you see that more clearly
when we look at it within the context
of the Cross of Consciousness—but
to recognize that the 64-63 isn‘t
really connected to this world. It
always requires being pulled back
down to earth in a way because the
speculation is everywhere.
The moment you go into the 64-63
you realize something about focus;
it‘s hard to hold it. It‘s hard to hold
the focus. There is so much activity.
It's a very important movement.
The polarity to the 9 is the 16 and
the 16th gate is the gate of skills, it‘s
part of the channel of talent. The
thing to recognize about the 16th
gate is that the secret to reaching
the point of satisfaction in the logical
process is the capacity to be able to
identify, which is another word for
focus. And everything about this Cross of Focus is about identification, being able to
identify the potential. Just the identification of the potential is enough to give these
beings their track in life, even though it may never become a substantiated pattern.
What's important for them, because this is so fixed, is that they are identified with a
specific focus. And what you get to see with the not-self 4/1s on this cross is that
they're not focused at all. They are unfocused. They're looking in different
directions, and they're not looking clearly. And even when they're looking down the
line that is correct for them, it's like me looking out here. I can recognize you, but
it's still kind of fuzzy. It‘s just kind of fuzzy. This is the dilemma of the 4/1. It‘s all
kind of fuzzy unless they are responding, unless they're entering into things
correctly.

That leads us to the Left Angle Cross of Identification. It's the way that we came
from in the sense of global cycles, this need to identify. At the very beginning of the

the equinox goes in another direction. This is something that was at the very
beginning of our process in this whole construct. And to see very clearly that at the
beginning what was required was identification, to identify where the focus was.
Now, if you go back to 1615, which was the time of the bubonic plague in Europe as
an example, that what you will see that what was identified immediately was very
clear. There are many things that had to be dealt with—the infrastructure for
healthcare, change the sewer
systems, the introduction of the
beginnings of cleanliness in
healthcare, the beginning of
educational institutions for more
advanced medical stuff, the
beginnings of organized schools,
and so forth and so on. In other
words, different streams were
identified for detail work and
development, and all to the benefit
of the tribe.
So, it‘s also interesting in terms of
the many things that we get to think
about in Design, it's interesting to
see that for me the plague was
really a very important mutative
instrument. It changed so many
things. It was amazing how much
change it brought to the way in
which we operate. And then you see that that is coincidental to us entering into the
era of the Cross of Planning where identifying where the problems are, identifying
what the solutions happen to be, getting to a point of satisfaction was everything.
Faith. It‘s an interesting line: The trust that detailed adherence will lead to
fulfillment. This is a very mystical line. Loyalty to the letter of the law, or like the
mystery of God, doubt engendered through the perceived illogic of a process. This is
identification with the recognition that the pattern cannot just the logical. And also
something else, the satisfaction that's possible is not diminished by the fact that it
has to be lived out illogically. This is one of the most interesting things about logic

as opposed to the emotional abstract. Logic is splenic; the abstract is emotional.
The logic can actually appreciate the illogic, which is why within the logic construct
we have Chaos Theory. Only logic could postulate Chaos Theory and be satisfied.
So, one of the beauties of understanding why logic is the universal format for life is
to be able to see very clearly that it is open to the experiential abstract process as
part of essential pattern. Unless one can identify and be identified there is no
progress; none. There is no way for us within the Cross of Planning to be able to get
to that place where we are able to fulfill all of its demands. And of course, we know
very clearly what 5/1s are like. It‘s very difficult for a 5 Personality to identify with
anything. It‘s all a projection field.
The only thing that's possible for them is that they are fortunate enough in their life
to be able to experience the potential of their 1. Remember, if you're a 5/1 and you
grow up in a dirt village and there is no library and no whatever, the chances of you
being able to have the depth necessary to live a 5/1s life is limited. It doesn't mean
you won't investigate relative to your resources; you will. But of course, that in and
of itself is going to be a deep limitation. And what you're going to be able to identify
with is going to be deeply limited. So, it's a real dilemma for these being. They‘re
the ones that are going to have an enormous problem in being able to realize
identification.

The 5/2
LAC Identification 2
The 5/2 has a much deeper concern in all of this. That is, the 2nd line is here to be
called. And as you know, whenever you're dealing with a 2 configuration you're
dealing with the potential for the real outside to be able to impact you. There is this
extraordinary call that is possible. And in that call is the potential for a spiritual
regeneration. The 5/2 on this cross is very, very, very open to mystical
transformation. Now, when I say mystical transformation or spiritual transformation,
you never know what's going call these beings. It‘s hard to figure out.
But one thing that's clear about the 5/2 is that they can be called to faith. And in
being called to faith they are very, very powerful forces in calling others. So many of
these beings are converts; the convert energy. When I say faith, I‘m not just talking
about somebody who becomes this religion or that religion. It‘s somebody who
becomes anything that they weren‘t. You're a smoker and you become a non-
smoker. You‘re a sex freak and you become a celibate. Whatever the transition is,
to be identified and in that identification to actually be able to say that it was God's
work. Thanks to God I am no longer masturbating 18 times a day. I want to thank
God for that. What to do. Nodal cycle; anyway, tough for them, self-motivation is
always difficult.

LAC Identification 2
This brings us to the 6th line, to the 9.6. Gratitude is a wonderful thing; it‘s a great
line: The joy which comes with accepting small awards for small victories. If there
was ever something important to understand about the life process is that the life
process is built on detail. Joy isn't something that you're born with. Joy is
something that you have to find in life. And one of the teachings for me that is the
deepest, because I live it and I recognize it as a truth, is that joy has to be available
on mundane plane or there is no joy. It‘s not about bliss. It‘s not about moments of
epiphany and satori and all of the things that are so dramatic and interesting, that
joy itself comes from the detail work.
You see that in Design with what it means to find out about your design and what it
looks like seven years later after you've gone through the detail of the process. In
going through the detail it's possible to find the joy. It's possible to find that place of
gratitude. And it also says something very significant about the 6th line being is that
joy is possible for them. But they‘re going to have to go through the detail. And
they're going to have to go through the stages; they‘re going to have to go through
the process. And of course, that‘s quite something.
It's also about the beauty that comes with just enjoying the focus rather than its
purpose or value. It's the nice thing about the 6 in this context. Again, you're
always dealing with the consequences of the tripartite life. But the fact is that for
the 6.2 on this cross, as long as they've had a viable learning curve, as long as
they've been given those things in their life through their parents, through the
conditioning, through the society, that going onto the roof for them can be an
extraordinary experience.
The gratitude of all 6th line beings can emerge the moment that the first cycle ends.
6th line beings are not going to be joyful and full of gratitude in their first Saturn
cycle. Saturn‘s tough; it‘s tough. And it's particularly tough if you're 6th line being.
But there is a great potential for joy and gratitude on the roof. I'm not talking about
off the roof again, but the phase, the interregnum, between the end of the Saturn
cycle and the Kironian event. Here‘s the place where joy and gratitude can be found.
It also says something that is quite impressive, actually. It says that joy and
gratitude is something that can be natural for any 6th line being when they‘re on the
roof, but it doesn't necessarily mean they keep it when they go back off, which is
something to think about.
The tradition before 1781, if we were to talk about the role model process, is that
the role model process would be going from inexperience to experience, going from
the pessimism to the optimism, and becoming more and more optimistic, cooler and
cooler and cooler as you go along. And in that joy and gratitude can become
something that is easily accessible, and also the basis of one's hypocritical response
to others: do as I do, then you will find this joy. It‘s one of these things.

But coming off the roof? Coming off the roof is full of risks. It‘s always full of risks.
You are stepping back into a frequency that you left behind in pain. And you‘re
stepping back into a frequency where your perception was pessimistic and dark. And
then you get that lovely, oh I feel so good, the joy that comes when the pressure is
over, the joy that comes when the 3 isn't dominating for the 6/2. Then that joy can
go away. So, 6th line beings, unless they're operating correctly, are always going to
be at risk when they come off that roof.

The 6/3 is staring ahead and it‘s staring ahead at its very, very clear direction.
There are some 6/3s that sit on a roof and they look to the next location and it's like,
what is this. There is a real threat in its difference. But when the 9 is looking
towards the 5, this is very, very natural. And it‘s a very important progression.
The 6/3 identification—the difficulty with identification is that in order to first of all
find your identification, the whole realm has to be identified. The possibilities are
endless. And remember that the collective is responsible for the not-New World. In
other words, the collective needs to establish an understanding and a sense of what
it is to be us in our time. The 6/3 is going to go up and down in terms of the
potential in its life to be rewarded in small ways.
After all, one of our dreams is that we get enormous rewards. And life turns out to
be tiny little rewards, step by step by step. It‘s a great teaching. For 6/3s that‘s
often very, very difficult. It‘s very difficult in the beginning of their life. It‘s very
difficult when you think of it in the context that they need to be identified and they
are so unstable in the way in which they operate, particularly at the beginning of
their life.

Introduction
The other side of the 5 is the 35. The 35 is a gate that has to handle enormous
consequences. It is the gate that catches the flying whatever that is the result of the
experiential way. It is really quite something for the 35. And to see that this 5-35
combination, like the 64-63 combination because we‘re in the Right Angle Cross of
Consciousness is to see that this is a perfectly balanced abstract, logical construct.
In other words, this is a deeply collective cross. And as a deeply collective cross it
imprints the collective deeply into those that carry it and the collective responsibility
of it.
You can also see that inherent in the pattern, that the pattern is rooted in only one
thing, the collective. The pattern is the collective. So, here when we get to the 5 we
get to the beginning of this process of establishing the fixed pattern. The
fundamental attunement to natural rhythms. Waiting as an active state of
awareness. How many times have we been in discussions about what is Sacral
response, what does it mean to respond, what does it mean to wait. This confusion
that waiting is somehow a stop and an empty space in which you are waiting, and to
see that waiting is an active state of awareness. This is the pattern. Civilization says
that we need to have progress. And what we get when we get to the Sacral answer
to that is that progress can only be possible through patterns. If there are patterns,
if you can master the patterns, if you can operate efficiently within the patterns, we
can operate correctly within the patterns, and then we're going to be able to fulfill
the potential of any pattern. And as such, be able to establish transcendence.
It is much easier to be on this side of the cross than to be on the unconscious arm of
the 63-64. The 63-64, because it is rooted in the inspiration of the Head center, it‘s
very disconnected to the physical process and often leads to a lot of problems in life
because of the way in which the mind can easily confuse the situation. But here
when you're dealing with the 5 you're dealing with a very deep physical Sacral
grounding of pattern frequency coming out.

The 1st line tells you everything about what a pattern is for. If the captain must, he
goes down with the ship. Ah, I love this line. You must; and this is the whole thing,
this is the deep recognition in mutation that says when you‘re part of the pattern the
pattern includes your demise. Even if the pattern is the ship going down, you go
down with the ship. And it‘s the captain that goes down with the ship. In that

sense, it‘s really the passenger accepting that the ship is going to sink and there‘s
nothing that you can do; nothing. You go down with the ship.
This is called Perseverance. I love that. Courage in the face of adversity. What is
the adversity? The pattern is terminal. You need to persevere. You see this in
children. The other day Giva said to me, ―I don‘t want to get older.‖ I said, ―Why
not?‖ He said, ―I don‘t want to die.‖ You get old, you die. That‘s coming, that‘s
down the road, slow down. So, this thing about the pattern is that right at the very
beginning of the pattern is the recognition that this pattern is a terminal pattern.
It also says that every 1st line carries potential suicide in them. It‘s just one of those
interesting little sidebars. And you can see it here in this line. The premature and
often disastrous urge to cut one's
losses. Weakness in maintaining
one’s rhythm when challenged.
Now, I'm giving you this at a larger
level, not at the personal maya
application of this line, but to really
be able to see that when faced with
the challenge of survival that there
are those who will just say, from my
investigation it appears that I might
as well just step out.
Now, when I say suicidal, suicide
works in many ways. You can
volunteer for a dangerous
occupation. You can be a suicide
bomber. You can be somebody who
likes to be on the front line of war
and threat and whatever. In other
words, you can see that it doesn't
matter that it's going to go like this,
it doesn‘t really matter because the damn thing is going to end anyway and there's
no point. So, it can be quite heavy, but the recognition is that the goal is
perseverance.
There is a reward to accepting life. The only forces that try to bring that into our
lives are religious forces that say there's a reason, there is a sanctity to life, a dignity
in life, and so forth and so on. When you're dealing with a 1/3, the 5th gate, the 1/3
on this cross are the first people who will tell you right away, aha, we‘re not
immortal. Right away they‘re the ones that know. The first time that they meet
death it‘s such a deep shock for them, because this is a failure that cannot be
repaired. This is a trial and error that you cannot circumvent.
This is this thing on the mundane plane that you can't get over. It‘s why resurrection
is so attractive. And it's a three-day process, which is really cute, which is also the
amount of time it takes for the Crystal to leave the body and return to its source.
It‘s very interesting. But it's also this 3 in there. The 3rd line is like what do you

mean we die? We should be able to figure out a way to get around that. And of
course, there‘s this recognition finally as you try to figure out a way around it, you
can‘t get around it, so the only grace is that maybe there's something to this.

The 1/4
RAC Consciousness 4
When you‘re dealing with a 1/4 and you're dealing with a 1/3 you‘re always dealing
with this fundamental difference in the way we start our lives. The 1/3 is going to
discover that it is a terminal process, and in that is going to have to deal with its
pessimism about the nature of life. But in fact, it may enrich them. For some
beings, knowing that life is terminal is a good excuse to get the ball rolling. You only
have so much time, and this is one of the lines that comes out of the 5.1, hey life is
short. Go out there and do your thing. Enjoy life while you can.
But when you have a 1/4 they don't discover this on their own. It has to be
explained to them, demonstrated to them. And this is what's very difficult. It‘s such
a difference between the way in our modern society a 1/3 or a 1/4 on this cross
would watch a program, television show or movie or cartoon where somebody is
killed. There‘s a totally different reaction in these two. One is really a shock. The
1/4 is very fixed. It knows right away there is no cure for death; instantly. The 1/3
always has this dream, it has the dream. It says, well, the pattern, if we get all the
details maybe we can figure out how to yank that 40/37 and yank it over and drag it
over to the Sacral and we‘ll live forever. But not the 1/4; the moment that death is
introduced the 1/4 has to deal with the psychological impact in its life.

The 2/4
RAC Consciousness 4
There are such wonderful lines in the 5th gate. The 2nd line is Inner Peace. By the
way, every line of the 5the gate has a blue introduction. In other words, these are
all processes of getting into and working with the pattern. The 2/4 rooted in inner
peace: The ability to ignore the temptation to take premature action. It's about
composure or lack of composure. What it means for a Sacral being to know when
they don't need to use their energy, what inner peace means. I always thought this
was interesting, most people think of inner peace as being a mental state. It‘s a
Sacral state. Only a Sacral can experience inner peace. This is the perfection of the
frequency of the motor. When the motor is just perfect all the tension is taken out
of the body. This brings peacefulness. There is an assuredness, a security, a sense
of well-being that arises out of this line when the Sacral is operating correctly.
Where it‘s a problem is that you have a lot people who have 5th gates that are not
defined in a defined Sacral. And if it‘s not consistent, it operates very differently. So
often what happens is that you get this inflation of the Sacral, so you get this
frequency that's always overtoned. Think about it. If you've got an open Sacral and

Waiting
you're with somebody with a defined Sacral and the defined Sacral being has inner
peace and they‘re actually correct and they‘re peaceful, that does not translate to
the open Sacral. The open Sacral will take in an overtone frequency that's distorting
and they will not feel that peacefulness, aside from the fact that they‘re an open
Sacral and they‘re being conditioned with energy regardless of how it is for the
Sacral being.
And it's one of the things that is so important about the Sacral-to-Sacral relationship.
If you're a Sacral at peace, any dealings with anything other than another Sacral are
not going to be rewarding, because you're not going get feedback that satisfying.
You're not because the overtone is going to be there regardless. But when you're
dealing with another Sacral being you can actually have a very powerful impact on
them because the first thing that is going to happen is that they're going to say to
you, you feel unusual, you're not your whenever. They‘re going to sense it right
away. And then lies the opportunity of in some way responding to that however way
you can.
But it's all about not taking premature action. It does not say it's against taking
action, which is often misunderstood. In other words, you can have complete inner
peace and taking correct action at the right time and still be fully peaceful, this
image of the absolutely clear and peaceful Zen warrior who cuts her head off and
does that with complete inner peace. It‘s almost serene in the way in which they
eliminate you.
Now, it‘s a radical description of this, but again, I want you to understand what the
line says. It says: the ability to ignore the temptation to take premature action. It
does not say the ability to avoid taking action. Action is always a part of the Sacral.
The Sacral at rest is deaf. There is no Sacral at rest. The Sacral is not at rest when
you sleep. It‘s just operating on a different compression. But it‘s not inactive; it
can‘t be. If it‘s inactive, if all Sacrals were inactive all night who ever lived in their
time zone would die. We cannot live without the Sacral vibration in the world. It‘s
what keeps the world going.
2/4s have no difficulty in avoiding premature action because they rarely are ready to
take any action at all, other than wandering around inside of their environment
feeling secure in being protected and only ending up in those situations where there
is this profound call to their unconscious. Remember that when you're calling a 2/4
that has the Sun in the 5, the 4 in essence is calling that 35, that progress, that
demand for moving on, a demand for an increased experience, a demand for another
experience, that demand to take the action in order to get to the progress. So
they're always under the threat of being called to taking action and here is the
beauty of what the 2 is for. The 2 says I'm not here for just any action. I‘m just
not. I'm not here for just any action.
When the 2/4 is operating correctly it is always going to hear the call. But it's going
to hear the call in the sense that among many different calls there's only a certain
call or certain calls that they will truly resonate to. Now, if they‘re operating as a
Sacral being, then this becomes essential for them. That is, their response is going
to bring them to inner peace.

RAC Consciousness 4
If you look at the secondary descriptions of the 2nd line you will see that it talks
about power. It says: The power to be comfortable with one’s rhythm. Or, the drive
for power that is constrained by its rhythm. The whole thing about the inner peace
is that everything about inner peace is the focus, and the focus of the power into a
pattern. It's all about the focus into the pattern. As long as they're operating within
the pattern, as long as they are responding within the pattern, then that inner peace,
physical inner peace will come to them.
Generators as a whole have problems with the results of the inconsistency in their
physical frequency. And the by-product of that is many problems, most of which are
related to digestive things, all kinds of things that are dependent on metabolizing
energy and the way the energy is used. Sacral beings are the only beings in which
the way in which they operate dictates the quality of their life. In other words, the
very quality of the motor, the very ability of the motor to run properly changes
everything in their life including whether or not they're open to any spiritual
dimension.
The 2/5 needs to be self motivated. The only thing that this 2nd line has is a gift for
composure. It‘s the only gift. Everything else has to be learned. What composure
can do for you is give you the opportunity to wait before you make your move. And
the rudimentary background about what the Sacral is and the way that the Sacral
works when we talk about Generators, if you look at all the things that I've talked
about Generators over the years, you can go to any of the Sacral gates and find all
the keynotes I‘ve used because they're all there, these different qualities of what it is
to be a Generator, what it is to be a Sacral being.

helplessness resulting in unnecessary stress and activity. Oh, how I yearn to be able
to teach the 3rd line surrender, because you can see what happens when the 3rd line
does not surrender. It has all of this compulsive activity. In other words,
helplessness is the enemy of the not-self Sacral. Helplessness is its enemy. The

moment that the Sacral has the assumption that it is helpless in its power is the
moment it‘s in its deepest dilemma.
Compulsiveness can be limited in its negative effect through flights of imagination.
Though still stressful, they do not lead to action. Or, it cannot stand still. Unable to
surrender and at odds with one's own rhythm. The whole thing is that the Sacral is a
compulsive motor. It is such a thing. Feeling my children gear down at night, I can
feel this incredible power of the Sacral and then just waiting to see this Sacral
slowly, slowly move toward its exhaustion point. Unnecessary stress and activity—
now, connect this to a 3/5—unnecessary stress and activity in your consciousness.
It‘s the Right Angle Cross of Consciousness. Stress and activity, but all the things
you‘re thinking about. 3rd line beings on this cross is that there's all this stress and
they want to do something about it and then they do it and then it backfires and
then there's all this stress and there‘s all this activity running around.
Helplessness—and the Sacral is so powerful. Helplessness is not something that you
get just like that. My whole thing about waking up the Generators, my whole pitch
to Generators that they're the holy ones, it‘s true. I wish you'd get it. Until
Generators accept and understand and live helplessness, we are all in trouble,
because we all end up with all this stress and activity rooted in frustration. And
everybody is saying I don‘t like this pattern. I don‘t want this pattern. I want that
pattern. And the people who have that pattern are saying I like this pattern, I want
this pattern. Nothing works.
We know what happens to the 3/5. The moment that the pattern doesn't work they
pack their bags and run away because everybody says it's their fault. When I first
titled the first Human Design book as a no-fault manual I was only thinking about
3/5s. May the gods protect them, because 3/5s can really go nuts. No fault, no
blame, no choice because we‘re all helpless. There‘s nothing more difficult to get
across to a Sacral as I‘ve discovered. If you tell somebody who is non-Sacral that
they‘re helpless, at some level they know that. They just know it because they're
not the life force. And they know that the sustenance in life comes from elsewhere
even though they don't understand the language or know how to deal with it.
But when you‘re dealing with a Sacral being and you tell them they‘re helpless, this
is holding a red flag to a mad bull. They don‘t like it at all and they become
incredibly compulsive. Who else is going to teach us surrender? It‘s my 3rd line
mind that teaches you surrender. No one else is going to teach you surrender. And
every time we see the dilemma and the negatives of the 3, remember its positives.
It‘s not about one is weightier than the other. It‘s a balance. But it's essential to
recognize that the very journey into the mundane that the 3rd line penetrates so
deeply is that in the end is the potential to recognize helplessness, and in
recognizing helplessness, surrender to response.
Most Generators when they hear about response don't see it as a surrender
mechanism. They think that they're doing something because they're responding. It
gives the Sacral this illusion that it's still in charge. But this is the beginning of the
true surrender process. If all generators were surrendered, everybody else
automatically would be because they condition the life force. One of the things

about the 3/5 is that it's so difficult for them in this context to surrender. They‘re
pessimistic. Every time that things don't work, they lose their reputation. They
don't want to surrender to the fact that they have failed, that life isn't right, it
doesn't work for them. They keep on going somewhere else; they keep on trying to
start over. It‘s the keep-on-keeping-on power. It‘s a 3rd line thing, after all, this
deep power to just stay with things.
And yet, here for the 3/5s this is really a dilemma for them. I know many 3/5s on
the island because this is a great escape island and the level of compulsiveness as a
general phenomenon is so evident, and the complete opposite to surrender. In other
words, the Generator turned Manifestor insisting that there is no such thing as
helplessness, there are only weaknesses.

The 3/6
RAC Consciousness 4
I would imagine that 3/6s, and particularly 3 Personalities in this day and age are
offered more Prozac than anybody else to calm them down. It is amazing, by the
way, how much of our allopathic medicine is designed to slow down the Sacral and to
distort Sacral frequency without really understanding what it is in fact that they are
doing. The 3/6 is going to be particularly compulsive in the early part of its process
and that compulsiveness is simply that the pattern has so many variables and every
variable they seem to touch seems to lead to a confrontation with the forces of
power. In other words, the whole thing about surrender is that if you're a Sacral
being and you're endowed with power you weren‘t born with a white flag in your
hand. You were endowed with power to make things happen and in the not-self
program to build everything—a great display of power.
For the 3/6 it's obvious right from the beginning that the whole thing is awful. It's
really sad and depressing. And their compulsiveness is in the sadness and the
depression. They‘re compulsively pessimistic. They can't help it. By the way, if you
wake up and you‘re a 3/6, if you're no longer pessimistic you haven‘t woken up.
Pessimism is the theme so you deal with pessimism, but it's a theme as a starting
place.
If you're going to do any logical research you have to start somewhere. If you‘re
going to do anything logical in a pattern you start somewhere. You can start as a 3rd
line being with pessimism. It‘s correct. And you're always starting from that point,
but it doesn't mean that that point is accurate. It‘s just the beginning of the
process. And it doesn't mean that all pessimism leads ultimately to optimism. As a
matter of fact, in the 3/6 particularly pessimism can lead to even greater pessimism.
In other words, you first discover that people aren't nice. And then you discover
they're really not nice. That is the pessimism leading to the pessimism.
It‘s so difficult to be a 6th line being and you're in one of the most rigidly pattern-
fixed gates of the Sacral Center, and how difficult it is for mutation to find a place in
this. So, one of the tendencies of the 3/6 on this cross is that they prefer to be in

the mud than on the roof. It‘s interesting about 3/6s. If you're dealing with the 4/6
or the 6/2 you‘re dealing with aspects that really appreciate and enjoy the roof. The
roof is wonderful. As a matter of fact, they're the ones that find it very difficult to
come off the roof.
But when you‘re dealing with a 3/6 or a 6/3 they don‘t necessarily prefer the roof.
Sometimes the roof is really boring. And they always have this ability to climb down
and to go slumming and get into the mud and get into the rumble and get into the
dirt and get into the stuff. So, it‘s one of the things here about these 3/6s is that
they indulge themselves in compulsive pessimism. In other words, these are beings
that are looking for things that will only get worse. And they go deeper and deeper
and deeper into it. It‘s quite a phenomenon.

The 4/6
RAC Consciousness 4
I love the 4th line here, the line of The Hunter. This says so much about
consciousness. After all, every once in awhile I look at the 5th gate, as I do with the
15 and I think how amazing it would be to elaborate all of the life patterns just out of
these constructs, because they‘re all there. And for me, the hunter line says so
much about what is to be human: Waiting as a guarantee of survival. The 5th gate
does not speak. As a whole, Sacral gates do not speak to non-Sacral beings. That‘s
very important to grasp. If you‘re a non-Sacral being, if you‘re not a Generator, the
Sacral doesn't talk to you in the same way. It's not speaking directly to you,
certainly not speaking to me.
Waiting as a guarantee of survival. The creative genius—there are only six lines of
genius in the 384—the creative genius to transform the most passive experience into
active achievement. The other side is the vanity of a personality so strong that
unwilling to hide behind the blind threatens its very survival. The hunter and the
stupidity of the Generator. The Generator can be two things. You‘re sitting there in
the woods and you‘re hunting deer. Now, there are two things you can do. You can
run all day looking for deer trying to chase down their tracks and going everywhere.
This is the Generator as Manifestor. This is this vanity trip. You can chase after
things and it's going to work for you and you‘re going to get what you want. It‘s also
a great lesson for all 4s.
The other side of it is waiting as genius. You get yourself a nice place in the woods.
You set up a nice blind. A blind is camouflage. And behind that camouflage you set
up your radar. You have your headphones on so you can listen to music. You have
a nice little warmer so you can drink tea. As matter of fact, you can set up your rifle
on a tripod and connect it to your laptop and just wait with your mouse to click the
cursor. And not only that, but you can automate the whole damn thing, that the gun
will shoot the moment that the beast is in front of the weapon because the radar
pinpoints it. And then you sit there. You read a newspaper. You listen to Mozart.
What a wonderful way, and sooner or later a deer is going to walk by. It‘s going to
come by and the gun will go off and it‘s time for dinner.

Now, these are the two kinds of Sacral beings. There are Sacral beings we know are
not-self. There are Sacral beings that chase game all the time and they never get to
fulfill their appetite. And there are Sacral beings who sit behind the blind, they‘re
waiting to respond, and whatever they need is simply going to walk up to them. So
this line of the Hunter is one of the great, great magical lines. It‘s very, very
beautiful and it speaks so profoundly to the nature of what it is to be a Generator.
It also says something profound about the 4th line networking. You cannot build a
network by chasing after it. You can only build a network through response, no
other way. All these people that try to create networks end up in a lot of trouble
instead of seeing potentials where they can respond to the creation of a network; the
hunter. So, when you're dealing with the 4/6 you don‘t learn how to hunt from the
wrong people. The susceptibility to conditioning of the Generator that comes into the
world to have the insistence that its parents want it to be a Manifestor, the
Generators are never told about camouflage. They‘re never told about listening to
Mozart and waiting. They‘re told to get out the door and go chase that deer and
don't come back until you have it. Well, we know what happens. Remember what
this line is about. This is not a line to be messed with. This is about survival and
we‘re not talking about individual survival, which is something that integration deals
with. We are talking about collective survival that threatens everyone.
Whenever you have a problem that is profound in a human being you can always
find the source in vanity. It's one of my favorite tunes—vanity, vanity, vanity.
Solomon‘s line, everything is vanity. It‘s true. This enormous dilemma that the
Sacral because it's endowed with so much power assumes that it‘s the master of that
power. That it is not going to succeed unless it chases after things. So the whole
thing about the 4/6 is that it never really gets to use its hunter's capacity to
perfection until it's gone through the whole process. In other words, it's got to get
to the Kironian stage of its life before it can really integrate this as a life process, and
in that sense, to be influential to others.

The juxtaposition gives us a different kind of understanding of this 5-35 combination
without the 63-64. We‘ve shifted to the 22-47. In other words, we have a very
different dynamic that's underneath. We don't have the stress and activity that can
be centered mentally that can be the by-product of the Cross of Consciousness
always. In other words, this stress and activity aspect at the mental plane is
something that gets removed when we move into the habits.

However, habits are very fixed things. It‘s one of those things to see about the way
the program insists that things work. That 4/1, Cross of Habits, will never leave one
side or the other. In other words,
there's two kinds hunter—the
chaser and the waiter. And they‘re
going to be one or the other by
habit. It's going to be their habit,
and they're not going to break that
habit. And it's practically
impossible to get them to break
that habit. There is nothing more
addictive than the Cross of Habit,
and this Cross of Habit is addictive
in the sense of the life pattern.
The program has insurance always.
And its insurance program is let's
make sure that they don't get too
healthy too fast too soon. Let's
make sure that we've got enough
bad habits to keep the program
running. And it‘s true. So, when
you‘re looking at Sacral in this
context, you can see that as much as I'd like to turn on all the Sacral beings on
earth, it's clear to me from this line that's not going to be so easy, because built into
the Sacral pattern is this habitual lock.
Now, most of it is the fact that I don't think it's possible for a Sacral being not to be
impacted by this knowledge, even if it's rudimentary. But then again, even at the
furthest extent of the knowledge that is reached today it's a fraction of the Sacral
beings on this planet. It‘s so important to recognize that this chasing after, this
attempt to manifest is a habit that is part of being Sacral that‘s stuck in being Sacral
and it does tell you not about the 20/34, but it tells you about the other Manifesting
Generators what kind of a dilemma that is because the presence of a manifesting
potential drags them so powerfully into that as a habit.

moments where I go through this process, because this is a very profound process, I
get to certain lines and I go, oh, yeah, the aesthetic part. Joy is about beauty. And
the thing that‘s so incredible about patterns is that they are really beautiful. Have
you ever seen the pattern of Venus‘
movement in the sky? Have you
ever seen that? Any of you? Some
of you must've seen it. It‘s
gorgeous. We don‘t think of it that
way because we don't see these
lines of movement, but if you see
the pattern of things, there is this
incredible beauty. The joy is in the
beauty of the pattern, not in the life
within the pattern.
Imagine that you're in the Prado,
this wonderful museum in Madrid.
It‘s a great museum. If you ever
have a chance, it‘s a museum to
visit. Imagine you're standing in
the Prado and all the lights are off.
And then they turn on the lights.
And the moment that they turn on
the light, the patterns of beauty are
revealed. This is enlightenment. It is bringing this light to the pattern. And when
you bring light to the pattern you get it right away. You get to see the beauty. And
the moment you begin to extend that further and further and further you get to see
the beauty of the larger pattern, the cosmic pattern.
And to stay calm; what a thing to ask the Sacral. It's like asking the Solar Plexus to
be patient. It‘s one of these requests that you just shake your head, it‘s like, what
balls it takes to do that. Be calm, you say to the Sacral (sound); be calm (sound).
And until the Sacral can embrace the beauty of its own pattern, only then is this so-
called Enlightenment possible. And the interesting thing is to read the Pluto
detriment of this line is really to have—yeah, there are epiphanies waiting: Joy
dismissed as an illusion. But the joy is there. Think about that. It‘s not saying
there‘s no joy. The 5th line of this configuration is always going to see joy, but at
what level and in what way.
Here‘s joy dismisses as illusion; waiting is a failure. Disillusionment with recognizing
one's place in the flow. Here you get to the transpersonal essence; you get to the
whole karmic geometry business. And that the only way that you can begin to find
joy is the aesthetic of the larger pattern. Whenever I look at anything in Human
Design—it‘s why I love to do illustrations. Every illustration I've ever done in Human
Design has struck a deep aesthetic something in me. To me the bodygraph is such a
beautiful thing. It‘s exquisite. If you hand the bodygraph to a mathematician and
you ask the mathematician to analyze all of the angles and configurations they go
nuts. You have no idea how incredible that pattern actually is until you start as a

programmer would to deconstruct the pattern and to re-create it just through
understanding the angle. It‘s all pattern.
So, the ultimate potential is to separate oneself—separation—separate oneself from
the physical dilemma of life to see the beauty of the larger pattern. Life is leading to
death, but so what. You can also see the beauty in the process. It‘s very easy for
me to talk about the beauty of a cycle and not to be caught that the beauty is the
birth, or the beauty is the journey. It‘s not one or the other. It‘s the whole thing.
It's the whole pattern. And it is a pattern that is a microcosm for other patterns and
other patterns and other patterns and other patterns. Then you get to see what
waiting is really is all about, and the great teaching of Sacral waiting, because if you
wait, if you enter into things correctly, the self evident aesthetic of life is revealed.
Life is here to be experienced aesthetically for all its beauty. My North Node is the
2nd gate, 1st line. It‘s all about aesthetics in life. I detest ugliness. I detest it in all
its forms. I detest ugliness in form, in action, in words. I detest it. There is no
place in my life in my direction in this life for anything that is ugly. It‘s not that I
don't accept it; ugliness is part of the world. But beauty for me is holy. It's
subjective, but it's holy. And it is this capacity of the 5 to embrace the aesthetic of
death itself, to see that death can be beautiful. That being in a form that dies can be
so beautiful and there is no need for the Personality to reflect the decay of the body.
My 93-year-old mother five or six months ago in a conversation we were having, I
call her up on Sundays and I ask her how she is and how she feels. And she said to
me, this morning in the bathroom I looked in the mirror and she said, until I got to
the bathroom and looked in the mirror I felt really young, and then I saw myself and
I realized I‘m ancient.
It is one of these things about the separation of the Personality from its physical
destiny. It‘s like me. It‘s hard for me to understand that my body is 57. It really is.
It‘s hard for me to understand that my body is getting old, it‘s deteriorating, and my
poor bronchioles are going down the toilet. But my spirit inside is still sort of 14 or
15. It‘s young. If I didn‘t look in the mirror I wouldn‘t know how old I was. I‘d have
no idea.
It's this separation that is so magical, because who we think we are, Personality
consciousness, if the Personality can actually accept in its helplessness that there is
beauty in being, it doesn't matter what your state is. It doesn't make any difference.
This is magic. But to get there, we are dependent on not manifesting teachers like
me who are 5s who can see this and express it. It has to come out of those Sacral
beings that say to us and teach us that progress leads to two tracks. One track is
the body and it‘s in a terminal pattern. The other track is the spirit and it may, in
fact, be enlightened. It may, in fact, recognize its helplessness, find its spirit. And
in finding its spirit, begin to tear away the ugliness of the world and see for itself its
relative subjective beauty.

The 5/2
LAC Separation 2
We‘re in the 5/2 of the 5th hexagram and this incredible line of joy and waiting as an
aspect of enlightenment. Again, we‘re going back to the dilemma of being self-
motivated. It‘s so difficult for the 5/2. Their Personality is deeply, deeply suspicious.
And it's very difficult for a suspicious and paranoid personality to be calm. You have
to think about that, how difficult that is. You‘ve got a 5 Personality and the 5
Personality is only attuned to being suspicious. It's not calm. It's not naturally calm.
For the 5/2 where there is not only this Personality that‘s suspicious, but there is a
design that is resistant anyway, it‘s closed off; it wants to be closed off. Joy for
these beings is not something that they really get access to. How interesting to
think about joy as such a logical thing. You can see that in the 58 in the Joyous. It‘s
funny to me that joy is logical. And yet, to really grasp it is to recognize that it is
this business of the potential of satisfaction that makes joy possible. It‘s the
satisfaction. And for the 5/2 it is rare that they will get that opportunity in this life to
really be able to find joy in the process.
Again, it's a matter of the way in which you are conditioned when you're young, after
all. It has to do with the way that you‘re raised; it has to do with particularly when
you‘re dealing with a 5 because you‘re dealing with an inherent pattern in the Sacral.
And almost all Sacral beings are conditioned negatively away from their generative
experience.

The 6/2
LAC Separation 2
Let‘s talk about the 6. Waiting is never free from pressure, physical or mental and is
often punctuated by the unexpected. What an interesting line. Whenever you're
looking at trying to understand concepts in Design always look through the eyes of
genetic continuity. When you're looking at the 6th being, understand something.
The whole process of a 6 is yielding. When you're driving on the highway and you
see those triangles, this is the yield sign, and it's saying to you you've got to make
way for the potential of merging with another geometry. That‘s what it is saying.
Everything about the 6th being is that there is no consistency in their geometry,
there is only Yielding to the flow. And if you yield to the flow, whether it's the
chaos in the beginning, the aloofness of the roof or the return to the world at the end
of the cycle, it is all about yielding and it means that there's going to be physical and
mental pressure. You cannot escape it.
It says something about what it is to be a 6—no escape from mental or physical
pressure because you are mutative. And that pressure is going to be uncomfortable

unless you can settle into what it is to be correct for you. The growth of awareness
that comes with bending to with the universal flow. Accepting that it is in one's fixed
rhythm despite the pressures, growth will be empowered and often through the
unexpected and there is no polarity, no planet in detriment. Lovely; it‘s a really nice
line, eh?
But then you have to see what it takes to grow into that, because how do you free
yourself from the pressure. And then you see right away that all 6th line beings are
under this deep pressure and the only way that they're going to remain healthy,
regardless of what stage, is that they have to be able to yield. And you‘re yielding in
the form, you‘re yielding to the pattern and in the larger themes we‘re talking about
you‘re yielding to the inevitability that the road leads to death.
Remember, as long as we‘re in mutation that is always the punctuation that is at the
end of any process. To be free of pressure is to be able to grow. The moment you
allow yourself to accept yielding to the flow you see that the flow will fulfill its
promise. It‘s what I tell Generators about responding. And ultimately that response
is going to bring you the reward. It first starts with eliminating resistance and then
it grows into something. It grows into your unique power. All Sacral beings are
power beings. You cannot say that of any other center. These are the power beings.
This whole business of power is all the problem of the Sacral—how to use power,
how to find power, how to focus power, how to remain calm.
It‘s like these guys that they put into these rockets to go to the Moon. There they
are sitting there very calm in their suits, clicking off numbers. And they‘re sitting on
top of 200,000 horsepower. This is what it‘s like to be a Sacral being. You‘re sitting
on a rocket. You have to stay calm. And you have to yield to the trajectory of the
power of that rocket. But you have to stay calm.
So, yielding becomes one of these beautiful themes for the Sacral being, for the 6th
line being. And in understanding yielding, yielding doesn't rob you of your direction.
When you have to yield to enter into a flow of traffic, you're only doing so because
that is your direction. Yielding isn't giving up who you are, what you are, what you
do, where you go. It‘s just a way of merging with the general flow.

things about the Left Angle Cross of Separation when you're dealing with the 6/3 is
that they are deeply anti-tribal. Oh, yeah, they don‘t like the tribe. They don‘t like it
at all. They don‘t like that they have to yield to whatever the tribe is selling. Oh,
they don‘t like it.
When you look at the mind, you understand the collective will accept only
individuality as something that is tolerable, but the collective does not like the tribe
and the tribe does not like the collective. And if you have that in your own body you
understand the conflict, because people have it in their own bodies as well.
So the 6/3 is in this dilemma. It is very, very collective. It wants to yield so it can be
in the collective flow and the collective flow is saying to it, look, the collective has to
be built on the tribe. And where does the collective come from? You try to
collectivize all the tribes. You try to pull out components from all of it, which means
that the collective has to sell its line to the tribe. And there‘s only one place you can
do that. You can do that in the 26 because the 26 is the only tribal mercenary gate.
It‘s a mercenary. It will work for anyone. Look at me; I work for the Voice. I‘m not

Introduction
The 26 is the only tribal mercenary gate. It‘s a mercenary. It will work for anyone.
Look at me; I work for the Voice. I‘m not joking. It‘s true. It‘s my Jupiter. I teach
out of that. When you get to the 26th gate you get to the right Angle Cross of
Rulership. Then you can understand why there is this movement from the 5 to the
26 if you're just looking at the dynamics. You can see that one of the ways to instill
the flow to the tribe is through their leaders.
Take the example of Christianity because it‘s in the news these days. Constantine
was a Roman emperor, and before Constantine Rome was whatever, they had their
typical Roman gods, and they had gone through various phases of who is better and
which and the different kinds of things, but nonetheless, there was no Christianity
even though there had been Christians for a very long time.
For 300 years there had been Christians in the Roman Empire. And yet the Roman
Empire wasn‘t officially Christian. And Constantine has an epiphany. He has an
epiphany before a battle in which he has a Christian moment and he wins the battle
and he had sworn beforehand that if he wins the battle that he will become a
Christian. He changed the whole Roman Empire to being Christian overnight. He
didn‘t have to go evangelize one by one by one by one. He didn‘t have to convert.
You got the ruler; the ruler turns around and says to all the people, we‘re now all
Christians. That‘s it; over.
So, this is the magic between the movement of the 5 to the 26. The 5 says, all right
if we want to get them in the flow, let's get the leader. Let‘s sell this to the tribe
from the top. And what's on the other side of the 26? It‘s the 45; the ruler of the
tribe. So in order to be able to move the flow and extend the flow into the tribe you
need to use the 26.
The maximization of power of memory applied to the nurturing of continuity. It
sounds good doesn't it? This is one of the great memory gates. But look at the
name of this gate. This is The Taming Power of the Great. Now, taming is a
funny word. You only get that in two hexagrams: The Taming Power of the Small,
and here The Taming Power of the Great. What is being tamed? It‘s not detail. It‘s
memory. Now, taming memory is not the same as just remembering. It‘s not like
this is the power to remember. This is about taking advantage of memory,
manipulating memory, using memory—I have a statistic that says that over the last
10 years more people have enjoyed this product than ever in the history of
humanity. Well, it‘s not true.
The tribe loves exaggeration. Most people think that the 26 is terrible because it
exaggerates. But the 26 is designed to exaggerate because this is what the tribe
loves. They think it‘s the best. When you go to the tribe and you say to them, I
have the very best, the very best, the very best they go ‗yes!‘ If you say to them, I

don't really know how good this is, they say, don‘t bring it to us. If you have a piece
of garbage, a machine that has a built-in shelf life of 26 days, you can go up to them
and say this is the best machine that God ever made. They love it; they‘ll buy it.
When it breaks down they actually don‘t complain, because it's embarrassing that it
wasn't the best and they got fooled. Do you know many people in the tribe buy
ridiculous things all the time, because they‘re told it‘s the best and they find out
immediately it wasn't and they don't tell anyone? It‘s astonishing. In America there
are products that have been sold for 10, 20, 30 years that supposedly do something
and they've never done it. They still have the same ads and people still buy it and
they don't tell anybody afterwards.
So, the 26 knows that in order to get to the tribe you have to say this is right, this is
terrific. And the logical collective cringes. They say, oh, but there is no detail.
That's not really the pattern. The collective says I need a salesman and then the
salesman blows everything up that the collective wants presented. And then when
people buy into it, they go to the collective to complain. And the collective says no,
it was the salesman, he lied. It‘s the gate of the coyote, it‘s the gate of the trickster,
is a gate of Prometheus and Loki and Mercury and all of these things.

The 1/3
The 1st line is A Bird In The Hand:
The ability to enjoy the dreams
engendered by accomplishment in
order to avoid the delusion of
unlikely potential. There is no cuter
line than that. One of the things to
understand about the 26 is that the
26 can sell a dream. You‘ve heard
me for years selling the dream of
awakeness. It‘s selling a dream. For
some the dream can be realized, but
it doesn't work if it's not sold that
way. It‘s a dream. This is the magic
of the way in which you touch the
tribe. Otherwise, nothing changes.
If you don't mutate a mother, you
never change the world. It‘s so
simple. You can only do that in the
context of the tribe; so, the bird in
the hand.

The 1/3 learns right away that its ego isn't strong enough to do anything. That‘s
what the 1/3 learns. And when you're dealing with the 26.1 in this rulership, they
really understand the limitations of how far they can go and they learn that very
young. The whole thing about the 26 is it‘s rooted in this manipulation of memory.
How did you do yesterday in the test? Oh, I was great. And then the results come
out and there is always this difference between great (loud voice) and great (small
quiet voice). It‘s always there. It is what it is.
So, you have to see that the dream is actually where they get their power. It's the
dream that has power. You can't sell the tribe without a dream. You can‘t sell them
anything. You can‘t sell them oranges. You can‘t sell them awakeness; you can't
sell them anything unless it's a dream. So, out of the 26th gate comes the great gate
of hustlers. They‘ll sell you anything. And for everything you can sell, there is
somebody who is happy to buy it. A bird in the hand; the 26 knows.
The gift of manipulating memory has consequences. One can assume that one has a
lot of power in being able to do that. But very quickly you can discover that you get
caught out. So the child that says I did terrific and the results aren't terrific
immediately has to deal with the consequences of its exaggeration. The child begins
to learn how to use that power selectively. The ego isn‘t the Sacral. The ego is a
motor that rests always. So the ego at rest, whenever the ego goes into rest, there
is actually a reevaluation that takes place. The ego is very, very stingy with its
energy.
And ego will only use energy of it‘s perceived to be effective. In other words, energy
must be returned with reward. No ego being will use their ego power, unless there is
an assumption of reward. It‘s the major difference between defined egos and
undefined egos in the world. A defined ego only uses energy for the correct reward.
If there weren‘t enough people for me to teach, my ego would not go into the room
anymore. It‘s not worth the trouble. Egos want their rest and they don't want to
waste their energy.
So, the 1/3 learns that there are certain kinds of exaggerations that work and are
effective, and there are other kinds of exaggerations in which they can be punished.
And in the long run—I'm a 26.1 in terms of my Jupiter—in the long run what you get
to learn is that accomplishment in and of itself is the greatest victory. And out of
that you can launch any dream. When I started in Design I wore these very strange
hats that came from northern India, my mystical hats. I wore them until the
scientists proved that neutrinos have mass. And as soon as scientists proved
neutrinos have mass, I took it off. And the moment that I took off that hat I was
able to empower the dream in a way that I'd never done before. The years between
my being given the knowledge and the verification of the neutrino with mass, this
was developing accomplishment. My accomplishment was verification of its truth.
The moment I had that verification of its truth I was able then to launch into the
next level of the vision, or the dream.
So, what you learn as a 26 or what all 26s are here to learn is that you can sell
dreams; it's allowed as long as it's based on something real. The bird in the hand;

no bird in the hand, don't sell any dreams. Get your bird in the hand first.
Accomplishment gives the ego power. It's like a platform for the ego to work from.
One note; I cannot do the 26 without talking about the relationship between humans
and fish and birds and reptiles. And to really understand that the 26th gate is a hot
gate, as the 44 is a cold gate. There is tremendous heat out of the 26 aurically. If
you step into my aura, because my 26 is part of my definition, part of a single
definition, I'm actually warming your aura; however you want to understand that. In
other words, there is almost this setting up the stage for mutation. The other thing
is that viciousness of the 26, because these are T cells and the 26 makes the best
soldier. They don't make the best captain. They make the best soldier, the foot
soldier. The ability to go out there and under orders killing at will.

The 1/4
RAC Rulership 4
Delusion is so easy for the 26. They can sell it. So they can experience it even more
deeply. As a 26.1 when I had my experience with the Voice and when that was over
my first inner reaction was I don‘t want to be a salesman for a voice. I don‘t want to
go around pitching something that a voice gave me. And this can be very
disillusioning. I‘ve got to spend the rest of my life in this kind of a bizarre construct?
So, when neutrinos had mass it gave me strength. It was like I have accomplished
what I set out to do, to go from esoteric to exoteric, which continues. From then I
was able to launch deeper so we finally get to the point of PHS and all of these
things where we can really launch into the scientific basis of the knowledge itself.
But the 1/4 has a different process.
Remember, most people have an undefined ego. And undefined egos are inherently
unhealthy. They just are. There‘s this enormous pressure on the undefined ego,
enormous pressure to accomplish. Think about everything I teach you about the
open ego. It‘s all about the lack of worthiness, it‘s lack of self-respect, it‘s a need to
prove one's value to others, to do things that'll impress others. And this is the
theme of accomplishment. Remember the reason the collective moves here to the
tribe is that the tribe actually gets things concretely done in the world. Things really
get done.
So, when you're looking at the ego pressure this salesmanship is not for nothing. It‘s
the driving force to get things done. And without the dream, without somebody
standing on the coast of England saying, let's all go to the other side because it's
going to be wonderful over there, nobody would go. It‘s not like they all
spontaneously decided to give up their lives in the old country. Somebody pitched
them. You‘ve got to be pitched. So, it‘s one of the things to see is that the tribe
cannot evolve without their 26s. They can‘t.
1/4s can get stuck into being very fixed manipulators. I was going to say liars.

1/4 on this cross it‘s very, very difficult to get a straight answer. And you can see
this Cross of Rulership and it pretty much describes every politician you've ever
heard. You can‘t get a straight answer out of them. Well, what do you think about
this? Well, you know (rambling). No straight answer. So, dysfunction is normal.
Those beings who never give you a straight answer, they‘re part of the way in which
the tribe is manipulated. And it tells you something about the tribe, the tribe doesn't
need to know the truth to evolve. In the same way that all the people in the Roman
Empire didn‘t need to embrace Jesus to become Christians. It‘s just layered over
them.
So, this 1/4 is very powerful in this configuration, the one-trackness of the 4, its
networking capacity, and at the same time the strength of intellectuality in the 1 that
allows it to be able to be really good at manipulating to its fixed position. What that
does is that it convinces the open ego of the tribe that if they follow this line they will
get accomplishment, that they will feel accomplished.

The 2/4
RAC Rulership 4
The 2/4 is The Lessons of History: The energy and depth of reflection to learn
from the past in anticipation of the future. Or, the urge to take action despite the
evidence of history. The greatest bullshit of all is the way in which we manipulate
past history in order to get results in the future. The tribe is constantly being
manipulated by the way in which history is manipulated or the way in which history
is used. You make an excuse out of something in your history in order to try to
change the way in which to operate in the world. But it is about the ego and its
maturation through experience, or the ego not learning from experience.
Part of this has to do with the development within the ego of subtleties. As you can
see with the Sacral, when you're dealing with a motor one of the most difficult things
is that the subtlety of how you use its power, not blasting things out, not screaming
it‘s big when you could sort of just stretch it over time. I‘m a great storyteller, I love
to tell stories. I see how natural it is that over the years stories have taken on a
kind of mythic dressing. They‘re not distorted, they‘re not even exaggerated. They
just have a kind of something added to them. All 26s have this gift of being able to
package. They‘re packaging stuff for you. And when you package things for people
you don't want them to see the rough edges. It‘s like the gift wrap over a present.
Here‘s the present, I‘ll go away now.
2/4s are at the heart of our political system. The 2 Personality is the Democrat and
the 4 is the networker and the 2/4 can be the missionary. When you put the 2/4
into the 26 of the Cross of Rulership you have the definition of what it is to be
political. Everything about the 26 is that it's political in the sense that it sells what is
politically correct. Everything about its approach is political. And along this line you
get a different political sales people. You get the ones that want to deny history.
You get the ones that want to invent history. You get the ones that want to reinvent

history. You get communism and capitalism. You get all of that and it's all rooted
here in the 2/4.
So, it‘s a very interesting configuration. Anybody who has the 26 as a 2/4 has a
natural tendency to take sides. So, this is one of the things to see about the 2/4,
they take sides. They‘re only going to be open at the 2/4 level at that 2 in the
barrier, they're only going to be the open to what is the right side for them. In other
words, this is the kind of thing where the 1st line will sell anything. The 1st line will
sell a perfume that doesn't use. But the 2nd line never could.
In other words, the 2nd line needs to have that kind of connection. It needs to have
its side, it needs to have its preference, and it will do anything it can to distort
history to maintain that preference. It‘s like the agony that creationists go through
in America trying to get rid of Darwinism and evolution and all these things, and they
keep on trying to sell this particular version of history.
The thing that makes it interesting is that this is one of the few examples where
you'll see a 2nd line that is about depth of reflection. We‘re dealing with a natural.
So these are political naturals. When I say political naturals, I don't want you to
automatically think political parties. Families can be very political. You‘re aligned
with the father or you‘re aligned with the mother. In our house we call that being
somebody's lawyer. That‘s what we have in our house. I‘ll say something to one of
the children and somebody will step in and try to defend the child. It‘s called being
their lawyer. So everybody in my house has a lawyer.
It‘s political. And you have to see that this is the nature of the 2/4. Whether it's
going to be called to one side or another and when it's called it's deeply fervent.
These are the kind of people that if you have a 26, if you have the 2/4 configuration
and they‘ve been turned on by Human Design they will tell you that all other systems
are shit. It's not a question that all other systems might have some respectability to
them, all other systems are shit. This is it. Or the other side; this is better and
that‘s garbage. You really have to see they are very political. They take their track
and then they try to influence from that track.

You can see that this is an ego dilemma. The 26th gate is the ultimate ego
expression of the Heart Center. It is much more the ego expression in the 21, which
is the only one that's close to it in true ego power. The 40th gate is a gate of denial,
the 51 has other directions to go in. When you're dealing with the 26 you‘re dealing
with the egoist. And because you're dealing with the egoist, to have this gate in an
open center is a terrible dilemma in life. For example, with the 2/4 you get pulled
towards one political line and it's inconsistent, and then you think that you're not
worthy of even being a backer of whatever that is and then you end up being a super
slave to whatever it is.

For 2/5s the idea that they would motivate themselves to try to sell another being is
like, nah, I don‘t want to do that. The lower trigram of the 26 is not comfortable
with the consequences of rulership. It's not, because it‘s not transpersonal. It‘s only
interested in the rulership. And remember the rulership is more than the 26th gate.
The 26th gate acts as the marketing wing of any rulership. And all the lower trigram
wants to do is get that marketing out. They're not really clear about what the
consequences are. And in fact, don't care.
The classic example, I once sold life insurance. And as a 26 all you care about is
selling it. You don't care whether they live or die. You don't care whether it's
expensive for them or not, all you want to do is get the product out. So, the lower
trigram does not see the consequences of what it sells. It's only interested in its own
ego reward. And the ego does nothing for nothing.
The one thing you can never expect from the ego is altruism. That‘s not its game.
The ego will only do something for reward. Now, the rewards are different
depending on where you are within the ego system, but to really understand that
and to recognize that this is the basis of the tribe, the tribe is not going to change its
allegiance unless it's in its interest to do so. And it's only going to be in its interest
to do so when there are consequences. If you didn‘t convert to Christianity, you
were in trouble.

The 3/5
RAC Rulership 4
The 3 is Influence: The ability once prepared to gather support. You can see slowly
this movement towards the transpersonal, but more importantly, you can see
something. First of all, you have the keynote of the circuit, the support is right
there. The second thing is that this is not the influence of the 4th line; this is the
influence of the 3rd line trial and error. I tried communism, it was garbage. Been
there, done that, don‘t do that.
In other words, this is very, very powerful from the experiential plane and the
capacity to gather support. Here you begin to see some of the underlying potential
of the 3rd line; the Sun exalted here, the authority to focus communal effort. Then
you begin to see the power. If you change the tribe you change the world. I've
never been interested in changing the collective. I know that that's an ultimate goal.
But my goal over the years has been to change the tribe, to change the tribe from
the mother down, to change the tribe step by step because if you don't change the
tribe you change nothing.
So, this is the authority to focus communal effort. The authority is on one side and
the Saturnian leadership is that while gathering support will underestimate potential
challenges. All this is saying is that the 3rd line has this ability to be able to work
from the mundane plane, but they don't understand the consequences. It‘s like
gathering support and then suddenly you're thrust into power and you're not ready.
I think of people like Leck Walesa in Poland. He‘s an electrician, for Christ sake.

He‘s not a politician, he‘s an electrician. All of a sudden he gathers support and he
gets pushed into this rulership position. I don't have anything negative to say about
the man, I just want you to understand that the 3rd line doesn't understand the
consequences. When that support starts gathering, it starts pushing. It‘s interesting,
by the way is the difficulty of this is that the 3 as the egoist, once that energy is
behind it, it‘s under enormous pressure to do something with it. This is a
revolutionary imperative.
The 3/5s in this situation have a hard time gathering support and it's so obvious.
It‘s a typical 3/5 dilemma. I would like to have a kind of a fantasy world in which
the 3/5s are raised differently than anybody else. What you do is you raise them in
a way in which they don't lose their reputation, because this is the thing that kills
them. There‘s nothing that will kill a 5 faster than somebody saying they're not good
at that. Oh, the pain of it, and how horrible it is because there is always this heavy,
heavy projection field that they are going to be able to accomplish something.
Remember, we‘re dealing with rulership. You meet somebody who is a 3/5, who has
a natural, influential power over you, who is a natural ruler that can bring you into
their world, can get your support, you project on them that they‘re worthy of
following, and then you see what happens. They‘re 3/5s, if anything will go wrong it
will and they know it. Not only that, they end up being the most pessimistic leaders.
These are the ones that gather support through darkness rather than light. And this
is one of the main revolutionary paths because only within the tribe given the 49 can
we talk about revolutionary patterns. And then when you're looking at the 26.3 you
can see that they gather support out of negativism. They gather support out of
pessimism. We are never going to get what's right from us from this government.
Never, so let's destroy it—3rd line anarchism. Let‘s tear it down.
The greatest problem for 3rd lines is that they don't know what to replace what they
tear down with. So, you replace one dictatorship with another. Mugabe is my
favorite. He‘s a cartoon anyway. Not for his people, poor things, but nonetheless.
You look at this guy 25 years ago and he was a revolutionary leader. A Black man
able to beat back the White man, take back his land for his people, a great hero, a
revolutionary leader. 26 years later he‘s an old fascist, brutalizing his own people,
starving them. It's really sad.
So, one of the things to see that there is this drive in the 3/5 and it's this drive to
gather support out of pessimism. However, you also have to see that that doesn't
mean that when they gather support they honestly know what to do. They don‘t.
You can always hear the bullshit in the revolutionary. Every revolutionary sprouts
bullshit. They always say the same thing. Okay, we‘ve got these horrible people who
are doing terrible things to us, we‘re going to kill them and replace it with heaven on
earth. That‘s what they all do.
It reminds me of Fidel. As soon as he took power he took 65 or 70,000 people, put
them in a stadium and had them shot. You have to see that these are very, very
dark forces. They‘re T cells. And if the 3/5 is punished, and they get punished a lot,
that is, the projection is on them that they‘re either going to be the ones they can

The 3/6
RAC Rulership 4
The 3/6s make so many political mistakes. I‘m talking about at every level. I'm not
just talking about party politics. This is the kind of child that aligns with the mother
because they think that that's going to work better only to discover that they‘d
better aligned with the father only to discover that they‘d better align with the
grandmother only to discover they‘d better align with the grandfather only to
discover that there must be somebody we can align with. It can be very, very
depressing.
The other thing is they don't seem to be able to hold the support. You can see that
is the dilemma of the 3rd line. Because the 3rd line represents a negative to the not-
self consciousness, it‘s very hard to tell somebody don't do that, it doesn't work.
Isn‘t that amazing? You would really think that you would meet less resistance
when you would say to somebody, don't do that, it doesn't work. I know, uh-huh,
no. If you tell them this works and it's terrific, they‘ll run to it. But if you say to
them that doesn‘t work, stop, they keep on going. It‘s really bizarre.
So, one of the things about the 3rd lines is that it‘s very difficult for them to hold
support. And obviously, with the 3/5 or the 3/6 you have dilemmas in that because
all of this is about rulership, gathering support, being able to be of influence and you
begin to see very early in life you can‘t do it. And then you lie. The 26th gate lies.
This is the great land of the false resume. You‘d better read the details in this one.
Excuse me, how come 17 years are missing here? I don‘t want to talk about that.
Let‘s eliminate that history and put it over there.
Everything about the 6th line process is that we all hope that 3/6s live long enough to
get to the roof. If they live long enough to get to the roof they can see the—it‘s not
so much they see the error of their ways, they get to see that no matter how intense
and uncomfortable moments in life are, you do survive them, if you do survive.
There‘s always this wonderful: Yeah, it was tough.
And you notice something about intensity of experience that the tougher it really
was, the less tough it is years later. Somebody's complaining about something or
whatever and you went through the same thing at one time and it was horrendous
for you and you hear yourself saying to them, ah, it wasn‘t such a big deal. It‘s all
right. When they cut the leg off with pliers it was kind of tough. And you get this

The 4/6
RAC Rulership 4
Where I get nervous with the 26 is when it goes into the upper trigram, because it
gets kind of tricky there. You get to the 4th line and you get to the line of
Censorship: The alteration of memory through elimination. Very Plutonic; you‘ve
got Pluto/Saturn here. Pluto says: The ability through censorship to save the
collectivity from itself. Oh, if you believe that you're a scary person. And yet, that's
one of the main pitches.
You can see this 4th line networking, how it maintains its network through
censorship. You can‘t put the truth out to the whole network, because everything
will collapse. Every 26 sells sunshine, because everybody's life is full of misery, so
sell them sunshine. The promise is always there. Censorship is great, says the
26.4.
It‘s a 4/6 and in dealing with a 4/6 you have to see that these are the kinds of
beings that—there was a whole spat of this in the States not long ago, these people
that suddenly remembered that they were abused when they were children. It‘s like
they're adults and they‘ve gone through this long process and all of a sudden out of
nowhere they realize that they were actually abused when they were young.
Not only that, people who suddenly remember after 30 years they were abducted by
aliens or whatever, but there is this phenomenon. The whole thing about the 4/6
here is that when they go up on the roof they try to eliminate their past. This is
their thing. This is their way of trying to save themselves. They try to eliminate
their past, so they try to bury all those things.
Now that says something very strong about 4th line beings, genetic continuity being
what it is. That so much of the 4th line consciousness is rooted in the fact that many
things that are repressed from the early part of the life, and whether those things
that are repressed are in fact destabilizing factors to the psychology or not, it's going
to vary and it's going to vary given the characteristics, the overall design, and many
things.
It's so important to see that these are beings that when you meet them on the roof
they don't even want to remember that part of their life. And these are the ones
that will go through the deepest shock when they get to the other side. They have
to come off the roof, because the past shows up. No matter how hard you try to
censor things, in this day and age it‘s practically impossible. If you were a Roman
historian at the time of the defeat of Carthage it would be possible to write history
that's a lie, and no one would ever know because a whole culture was destroyed and
everything was destroyed. There are no records, so there's no way of verifying the

Roman description of Carthage, which actually makes them look like killer monkeys
with a problem, which obviously they were not. They had quite a culture.
In this day and age censorship is very difficult. You can have temporary censorship.
But even temporary censorship is undermined by our new technologies. So, this
alteration of memory tends to get personalized rather than externalized. It isn‘t to
say, by the way, that censorship isn't a rule in tribal communication. It is. It‘s not
like I'm going to write an HDVC update and talk about what's upsetting people.
That‘s not my job. I don't do that. I write HDVC updates so that people think that
we‘re all right.
It‘s like this whole business with the Pope or this or that or whatever. Every
organization of any kind on this planet operates through certain levels of censorship.
It‘s doesn't have to be a big evil. But again, it's this way of empowering will. Will is
a big problem on earth. So many beings don't have access to consist willpower. And
the tribe says will can be molded as a whole. And this censorship business is a way
of trying to get the tribe to stay with certain themes, and always with a promise.
Altering memory is also physical. We have practices that exist as forms of rulership
to try to erase people's memories. But I think the thing that really needs to be
understood is that the very brotherhood/sisterhood of the 4th line is rooted in some
kind of censorship. And that you only see it emerge when you see their meanness

4/6s always appear to be friendly, and it doesn't mean that they are. It‘s just a
mechanism, after all. And through the meanness you can see that there are things
that are not brotherly or sisterly, that are censored, that are not allowed to actually
come to the surface.

We come to one of my favorite juxtapositions because I just like the name. It‘s the
Juxtaposition Cross of the Trickster. The only way to appreciate this name is that
the trickster can really fuck you. And then you look at the hidden arm and you see
the 6 and the 36, and you really know it‘s true. Without these tricksters you wouldn't
get people dumb enough to try things that sane people would never try. It‘s true.
Think about the 36th gate. It is the archetype of inexperience with this deep, deep
need to be fulfilled, desire, through experience.

So what you see in this Cross of the Trickster is let‘s see if we can get them to walk
on water or fire or let‘s see if we can get them to try this or try that, let‘s get them
to do the thing we don't want to do. Let‘s see if it's safe. You can always see this in
children. There‘s always the trickster child that says to the other one, I don‘t think a
stone can break that window. Little
fuckers, eh. No I don‘t think a stone
can break that window. And there‘s
this other kind, stupid, right, who
picks up the stone and throws it at
the window. The window breaks and
the trickster is laughing. This is the
trickster; I love it.
And you have to see that so much of
getting conservative tribes to try
something new, you need your
tricksters. This isn‘t rulership. This
is the purest 26 hustle. This is Tom
Sawyer. It‘s a good thing there are
so few of them, because they don't
tell you the truth, because if you tell
them the truth they will never take
that ridiculous experience and try it.
Where they‘re really at their best is
that they have a brand-new product. I remember many years ago there used to be
people who would show up at my teaching events and they would bring new age
crazy stuff. You put an electrode to your nose and it tells you the temperature of
your brain—I don‘t know—whatever the thing happened to be. And they‘re always
trying to find somebody who will try it because if they try it and it works, oh, they
sell it to everybody. This is their thing. But they‘re always looking to break the
surface.
So, here is where the new ideas can be promoted. Here is where the unusual stuff
can be promoted. Here are these oddball things that are looking for support in
others to get them to try doing this crazy thing or that crazy thing because it‘s going
to be good for you. I love to surf the television and every once in while there is this
spa that I see that‘s being advertised someplace in Germany. There are these
women who are covered in mud from head to toe. They‘ve got big flat stones that
are placed all over their body. They got weird people jumping up and down doing
whatever. And it‘s like, this is the tribe. You sell them a dream. If it‘s really crazy,
you just need a trickster. This is the P.T. Barnum. If you need to find a volunteer
they‘ll get you the volunteer, they‘ll get somebody to go for it. You end up with all
these crazy sects and all of these things that can arise out of this.

The 5/1
One of the things I enjoy about being a Rat—I‘m a Chinese Rat—and about being an
ego Manifestor is the recognition that if you put me in a corner I'm going to eat your
face for breakfast. It is in this 5th
line that you really see the beginning
of this part of the 26th gate that is
very, very dangerous, because it's
rooted in confrontation. This is will
power trying to dominate. This is
the transpersonal application, and
you're dealing with heresy in the 5th
line.
This is a great Human Design line.
It‘s Adaptability: the understanding
of mechanics and the application of
energy to achieve maximum
potential. This is the ultimate black
magic line. It isn‘t black magic,
that‘s the 48th gate domain. But it‘s
a black magic line, because what this
speaks of is the ability of the ego not
only to know how to manipulate
somebody, but to be ready to use their power to manipulate them at will. And it's
not about them adapting. It‘s about forcing anyone who they're dealing with to adapt
to them.
The power of memory which maximizes the ego to attract others. This is the Martian
side. The Venusian side, the detriment, is resistance and dissatisfaction when basic
changes to nature are necessary. You cannot change a 5 without a real reaction. It‘s
like when we talk about 3/5s we talk about them running away is that you can‘t
change the 5. You can‘t. It‘s very difficult to condition a 5. It‘s very difficult,
because what are you conditioning? It's all projection.
So here in this line of adaptability on this Cross of Confrontation, this is karmic
confrontations. The 5/1 is smart enough if they have advantages in life, that is,
educational advantages, that given this configuration they will manipulate through
confrontation. You will have to deal with their will. And this is God‘s expression: My
will. Those underneath say: Thy will. And the 26 says: My will. So, it is very, very
limited in its openness. This is a very, very fixed line and you can see that you're
born with this. There is no blue intro. This is right there right at the beginning.
These are very, very powerful, willful beings.

The difficulty is for the 26 that‘s not in a defined center, a hanging dormant 5th line
variation, because this unworthiness and all of this stuff that's part of the open ego,
that when the ego gets defined, what happens to this particular 5th line is that it uses
and tries to use willpower it does not have. And it really suffers the consequences.

The 5/2
LAC Confrontation 2
There is always a risk to market anything to anyone. And when you overwhelm
people with your will there is always a risk of a reaction to that. The 5/2 knows that,
and knows it very well. What is so interesting is that their willfulness is a will to be
left totally out of the whole thing. The 5/2 denigrates the salesman. The 5/2 says,
look at them, look at what they have to do to make a living. Look at that; it‘s ugly.
I will never do that, they say.
People are always saying that the oldest profession was prostitution, but I know that
the oldest profession was being a pimp. That‘s the oldest profession. Somebody
had to sell the goods. One of the things to really understand about the 5 is that this
will can be very, very ugly and very vicious and very nasty. The 5/2 just pulls it all
back. They can't convert their distaste to the ability to smile and sell.
You can't be in the material world without selling yourself. And it doesn't matter who
you are, and it doesn't matter what gates you have, it is one of the basic things
about being in the world. Every single human being over and over again have to
present themselves in one way or another to get a job, to find a lover, to do this, to
do that. The way in which you remember yourself when you first met your love, how
you presented yourself, sold yourself to them. This is all 26 business; all of it.
The disillusionment that comes when a sales job is over and you get down to seeing
what's really there, the 5/2 doesn‘t want to have anything to do that. It‘s like they
learn early in life that it doesn't pay, and they learn to see that the best way to use
their willpower is to enforce their protectiveness, their isolation. They're not
interested in confrontation. And you don't want to push them there. Nobody should
ever push a defined ego anywhere. It‘s like pushing a Solar Plexus; it's stupid.
Those are the only two centers that do that. If you push an emotional person they
can fry you with their intensity. If you push an ego being they will give it to you.
Will is frightening in its strength. They‘ll go straight for your throat, because that‘s
what the ego does. It doesn't mess around. It‘s very nasty.

The 6/2
LAC Confrontation 2
The 26 is a very difficult gate. I'm very aware in my life how much having this gate
in my design has been a great advantage in this phase of my life and an enormous
disadvantage when I was unaware, because it's so unpredictable in the way in which
it's going to operate when you‘re not-self. And yet at the same time you can see the
beauty of the 26, which you can only really see in the 6th line. You can't see it
anywhere else.
And it comes with this power of Authority, the authority that‘s always the potential
of the trusted force, of the leadership, of the beauty that's possible in any 6th line
being as they go through their process. And this is the natural, and that's a very
important intro, and again it's a blue colored line so we can see that it's a long
process—the natural attainment of influence justified by the correctness of actions.
This is the magic formula in this life.
As an ego being for those people in the world who have an open ego, if you really
experience my ego you will see that it's clean, but that has taken a very, very, very
long time. It‘s a long process. The ego is not aware. It is just a vehicle. It is just a
motor, it is just a power. And yet, it‘s so powerful that it takes surrender to release
the being from the hold of ego. When you think about humanity and you think the
majority of humanity have an open ego and you think about the tenets of will, that
every religion is pointing towards our responsibility in willfulness, that it's our will
that has to be done. You see there‘s an enormous dilemma with will and willfulness.
It‘s not understood, and it creates so much sickness, heart problems, stomach
problems, gallbladder problems, immune system weakness, all of that.
So, the 6 says something very beautiful here. It says, the ego is something that's
magnificent and you have to teach the tribe and the tribe only response to will, but it
has to be clean. And it can only be clean if it's correct. And it can only be correct if
it does not operate out of the ego‘s imperative. It needs to operate out of the
authority that is natural within the being, the correctness of their type, their
authority, their strategy. This is the only way to cleanse an ego.
Where it is difficult—remember that the natural ego process is directly through the
Throat, the archetype of the 45/21. So, we know that ego's first desire is to get to
the Throat. Everything you see with ego people is that the biggest struggle is those
ego beings, the defined ego that does not get to the Throat. It is looking for this
expression, and it's looking for the correctness of its manifested action.
The embodiment of reason and purpose; or, authority as a symbol, but it doesn't
really matter; it‘s about reason and purpose. The ego should only be used for what
is correct. It‘s not here to be used frivolously. It's not here to be used as to be able
to display power. I used to enjoy my 26 because it let me fool people. When I was
young that was a game for me, how easy it was to fool people. That‘s not what the

ego is for. It is here to be the embodiment of reason and purpose. It's here to
support the larger evolutionary process by taking the potential of the collective
transcendence and selling it to the tribe. And we see clearly that if we can get the
tribe to embrace collective principles we begin to reduce tension.
I don't think that anyone who was alive in Europe in 1935 could have any in anyway
imagined what Europe is like today. It is absolutely astonishing to look at that, to
see what happens when you collectivize the tribes. When I look at Europe because I
have such a deep historical background, I look at Europe and see nothing but tribal
hatreds that are thousands of years old. Just putting a Frenchman and an
Englishman beside each other at a table is a risk. They‘ve been hating each other
for thousands of years. Then you look at this thing. After all, it was only about 60
years ago the tribes in Europe were butchering each other at a level that‘s
unimaginable. And now you've got Germans cozy with French. I don't get that.
That‘s a miracle. Then what‘s the miracle? It‘s the collectivization of the tribe.
When you look at evolution you can see two patterns. You can see North America
where everybody gets homogenized into a new tribe so you become a German-
American, a French-American, an Italian-American, whatever it is, but American
becomes the new tribe. And we have the same thing in Canada. We call it
multiculturalism. You take in different tribes under the label of being Canadian. And
then you see the other side in Europe. All the tribes agree to stay tribes, but they all
agree to work together for each others' benefit. Wow, somebody did a really good
job of selling a collective principle to the tribes.
Now, what do you see out of that? What you see at of that is the collectivization out
of the tribes could only have taken place after all that bloodshed and violence. Will,
willpower—the moment that fascism could not win the great battle of creating the
super race of eliminating all the lower levels of life, the fear engendered by all of
that, the bloodshed, the horror, out of that came okay, enough, let's listen to these
collective principles. It worked.
The moment that the immune system in a larger sense was weakened was a chance
that they would be receptive to the sale of something different. And who sells it?
And you see the possibility of the humanism that can emerge out of the 26, this
ability to take the tribe out of its lock and open up the possibility of a collective
place. And it's no different.
Not too long ago I was in Toronto in Canada, which is an enormous multi-cultured
city. And yet, it‘s all ghettos. Not in the bad sense of ghetto, but in the enclosed
sense. There‘s the Italian district and the Greek district and the Romanian district
and the Korean District and the Chinese and the Japanese and there's some
Canadians there. There‘s just this umbrella and they all go into their own
neighborhoods, but they all work together in the soup and everybody is happy.
That‘s the only way you get the tribe to be able to accept collective principles. So in
the world, because everything is a binary, we have these two wonderful examples:
The North American experience and the modern European experience. These are the
two sides of this coin. All of this is the potential in this 6th line. And you can see that

it's not easy, that you have to go through a whole lifetime to get there. You have to
go through those three cycles, that this whole business of the 6th line being wise, oh
yes, no question. Great wisdom can be an attribute of the 6, but after time; time
and correctness.
In the end the very trickster has to admit that the only thing worth selling is
correctness, nothing else. Oh, you can gloss it around and you can make it a more
attractive presentation, but in the end it is the quality and value of what you sell that
is so important. And this is what you get to when you get to the 6th line; you get to
this maximization of the power of memory applied to the nurturing of continuity.
Remember the opening—to nurture this continuity is the glory of the 26. But to get
there, it‘s quite a process.

LAC Confrontation 2
When you‘re in the ego and you‘re the 6/3 and you see everything is about
correctness it's so bizarre that you're looking at the 11th gate. It‘s like, what do you
mean, didn‘t I do a good enough job selling people? And the 11th gate says, no I‘ve
got a better idea. And they have problems with each other. It‘s one of the things to
notice about the left angle of any hexagram with the right angle of the next. Notice
that in your dealings with people and you'll see that there's tension there always.
So, this shift is a particularly funny one, because this is going up to the 11 and the
11 can really be scattered, but—I hate to say it—but only the 11th gate can sell light.
The 26 sells form. But the 11th gate sells light. So, the 26 goes, ah shit I sold them
already. And the 11 says, we‘re going to have to keep on reminding them forever
now, and we‘re going to have to turn what they have been driven to by will, we‘re
going to turn it into what makes sense for them and a belief system.
Have you ever noticed that every time that the tribe gets collectivized you have a
new kind of ―ism,‖ which is established, as you will see, by the 11th gate. The tribe
gets affected by collective globalization and immediately you have neo-materialism.
And the neo-materialism is discussed and described through the 11, and then it
becomes a whole system. In other words, there is only this little tribe in here.
You‘ve got all this collective individual stuff here and all of a sudden there‘s this one
little tribal gate stuck in between and it‘s like the 11 says, okay, okay, okay you told
them, good for you, now can we go back to the collective business please, I want to
get out of the tribal thing now, we've got them hooked, it's okay, let‘s keep on
feeding them.
Immediately we‘re back into the collective and we‘re back into the ―we‘re going to
teach them now.‖ The real difference is coming for us is that the Cross of Planning
era is coming to an end, and this way of moving from the 26 to the 11 is changing.
In other words, you collectivize the tribe, you open up the potential for education
and then you bring in the whole educational infrastructure out of the 11. But we‘re

entering into an era where the ability to institutionalize the educational programs are
crumbling. Iraq, just as an example, or any of the old communist countries, the will
is there to bring about a transition so the tribe backs the support, you have people's
revolutions like in the Ukraine or whatever. However, if you don't bring in
institutional infrastructure, education, the courts, all of these things, if you don't
change the infrastructure, you change nothing.
My dealings over the years with friends of Human Design in the Ukraine, it was freed
of communist rule a long time ago in relative terms now. And every time these
people would try to come to a Human Design course, it was like they were trying to
get a furlough from prison. How many times I had to sign documents that said that
if they robbed the bank I had to go to jail, just to be able to let them out. The
society on the surface may have changed in the sense that the people wanted
something different, but the infrastructure isn‘t there.
So what you get the see in this movement from the 26 to the 11 is the 11 pats the
26 on the head. Isn't that nice you were able to bring about this revolution. Well, I
want to tell you something, if we don't change the institutions the person that you
just brought in as the revolutionary leader is going to turn out to be a fascist pig and
you‘re going to end up with all this corruption that never will go away and you‘re
going to have the same damn problems you won‘t even be able to change the
schoolbooks. There are still places in the old Soviet Union where you got Marxist
Leninism that is still being taught in the classroom because they don't have any
other blocks. I don't mean it directly; it‘s just that they‘re in the texts.
So, the 11 says, yeah, good, thank you. Now, let's create some schools. Let's
change the institutions, let's educate the officials, let's educate the bureaucracy, let's
educate the legal infrastructure, let‘s bring about a real transition and of course, this
embeds the collective. When you move from the 26 to the 11 the tribe already is
nervous. They don't know, by the way, that this all has to be done and they don't
necessarily agree with the educational system that will be imposed on them because
they don't understand it. In the whole delightful history of the Russians in 2000
years they've had 20 years of Democratic experience. And then we have this image
that is a huge democratic nation. It‘s not. It's not at all. It‘s a very, very slow
process to change the infrastructure and as we well know, we‘re leaving the Cross of
Planning. It‘s not going to work.

Introduction
Let‘s begin with the wonders of Peace. Isn't it nice that when you look at the chop
of this hexagram that you've got three yang lines and three yin lines. It's always
something that interests me about both the 11 and the 12, and of course in the 12
it‘s simply a reverse process. A harmonic condition in the individual or society that
permits assessment before renewed action. Everything about the 11th gate is that
ideas are for assessment, they‘re not for action. One of the dilemmas of beings who
have the 11th gate is the almost automatic assumption that ideas are literally for
action.
The 11-12 is very significant in our history. That is, as an evolutionary phenomenon
it is through the 11-12 that we have the expansion of the larynx. We have the
opening up of our ability to be able to articulate through the nuances of sound
control modulation. And the very opening of the throat to permit this capacity to be
able to articulate is at the same time an opening to the ability to expand our way of
being able to store and pass on the past. One of the most important things to
understand about ideas is that ideas are in themselves assessments of or
reassessments of past action.

So here we‘re on the Right Angled Cross of Eden. Remember about the nature of
this Cross of Eden, this is about being thrown into the world to do two things. It‘s to
be thrown into the world to reproduce; it‘s thrown into the world to seek knowledge.
And of course, when you're dealing with this 11th gate, the 11th gate is ultimately the
collector of knowledge. It‘s what makes them interesting. After all, they are our
information historians.
The 1st line, Attunement, is all about whether ideas can have value or not. It is the
very foundation of ideas, and it is the very basis upon which the 11th gate has its
true value. Ideas should be of value. Most ideas are frivolous and do not lead to
correct action. Most ideas are frivolous and they drive people to premature action.
This line is one of those classic abstract lines, it relates deeply to the 46, the
serendipity of being in the right place at the right time. And this is about the
nourishment that comes when your ideas are received positively by the other.

Peace
We always think of only the ego as being the place where the open ego displays its
valueless-ness, its sense of worthlessness. But the 11th gate has an incredible fear.
After all, all the gates of the Ajna Center have their fears. It is this fear that you
don't make sense. It‘s this fear that you don‘t make sense and that others are going
to laugh at you. One of things that people get laughed at the most is for stupid
ideas. It‘s amazing how
embarrassing it is to share with
somebody an idea that they think is
absurd and hilarious. I‘ve had that.
I‘ve had people come up to me with
ideas about Human Design that are
absolutely hilarious. What are you
going to do? There are so many bad
ideas out there.
So, the 1/3 learns very quickly in life
that it has to be careful about whom
it shares its ideas with because not
everybody is going to be open to it.
And you will see that the 11th gate
becomes a highly restrictive or even
prejudiced in the way in which it
operates with others. Remember
that it's only in the abstract that you
have prejudice. Bigotry is part of
the abstract process. It‘s right there
in the 13th gate, which is a genetic role gate. It is built into the abstract process to
discriminate. Now, I don't speak of that in terms that discrimination is bad. There is
good discrimination and there's bad discrimination. This is mostly about
discernment.
But one of the things about the 11 is that its greatest dilemma is it doesn't know
who to share its ideas with. The 1/3 learns quickly you share the wrong idea with
the wrong people at the wrong time and you‘re going to be made a fool of. One
thing the 11th gate doesn't like is being made a fool of, any more than the 17th gate,
by the way.
The advantages of having a 1st line Personality is that if you have the privilege of
being raised in a relatively civilized society that you have opportunities for education.
Those opportunities for education will give you the beginnings of this recognition that
not all ideas are for everyone. Remember that this whole channel is about seeking,
not finding and ideas are our way of probing. They‘re a way of probing the past and
speculating upon the nature of the past. But as we well know intellectually that
belief systems and ideas aren't necessarily something that everyone is going to link
into. It‘s the major difference between the logical process and the abstract process.
It‘s very difficult with the 11th gate. It‘s very difficult with any abstract process. The
abstract mind is like the emotional system. It‘s deeply influenced by the emotional
system. The abstract mind operates in waves that the very idea that you think is

bad can feel good one moment and can feel terrible the next. The abstract mind is
always moving. So it‘s very, very difficult when it's on the 3rd line level and there is
all this sense of I‘m not valued because my ideas are not valued. Something to
realize about the people who have the 11th gate is that when they share an idea with
you just to respect the idea is enough to give them a sense of well-being. In other
words, interesting; you don‘t have to like it. But one of those things for them is that
it's devastating for them when their ideas are not valued because they take that in—
not-self—as if they are not valued.

The 1/4
RAC Eden 4
When you‘re dealing with the 1/4 there is a dilemma and the dilemma for the 1/4 is
that it‘s hurt by the fact that there are those who do not grasp the value of their
ideas. 1/3s are interesting. They're not really sensitive to failure. They can be
annoyed with it, frustrated with it, angered by it, whatever it is. But it‘s not like they
have a sensitivity to it. But the 1/4, all 4s because of the fixedness and particularly
the 1/4 when they have a strong foundation and they are ready at the unconscious
level to externalize their idea they are very upset if you don't see the value of it.
Not only that, but they are carrying the traditional ideas that they grew up with. In
other words, this being in the right place at the right time begins with how you're
nurtured. It begins with the intellectual nurturing that they're going to receive in the
home. The moment you're dealing with a 1st line Personality, the children that aren‘t
given the opportunities to study, to learn, to expand their depth are going to be
children that are really going to have problems. And they're not going to see the
value of sharing their ideas.
Now, think about something. Ideas are intended to be shared in order to be
assessed for whether they can lead to action. When you're dealing with the gate of
ideas and you‘re dealing with the pursuit of knowledge you have to see that if you
disenfranchise these children from education you're doing great harm, because it's
the only thing that's really going to help these beings is education, because only
through education are they going to learn to see what is a good idea. They're going
to be able to see what isn't a good idea. They‘re going to be able to understand that
an idea is something that has to be received. It's not just about putting it out.
And of course, when you're dealing with a lower trigram it has problems with this.
The lower trigram does not understand that the idea has to be received on the other
side. It has to be perceived of value by the other; not simply perceived as valued by
the one who is delivering it.

The 2/4
RAC Eden 4
You have to understand that on this cross the 2/4 is in pain early. If you‘re a 2/4
and God says, look, I‘m throwing you out. It‘s like, what do you mean, I live here.
This is my home here. Eden is my home. You just come and visit. I live here. I
don‘t want to move. I‘ve got my stuff here; I‘ve got my favorite trees. What am I
going to do?
It‘s like going into the home of a 2/4 and evicting them. They will stay in that house
until the cranes are smashing down the building around them. I will not leave. You
know these governments that try to build giant highways and expropriate houses
and there's always that one little house that won't move that holds up everything,
it‘s a 2/4. I‘m not leaving here. No way am I leaving here.
So, on this cross a 2/4 is in a lot of pain. They didn‘t want to leave and they‘re born
upset. These are the boredom people. This 2nd line of Rigor is all about boredom.
It says: The recognition that without vigilance and risk, peace can lead to stagnation
and collapse. This is a sense of boredom that can be overcome by imagination, or,
this is about using ideas just to be able to provoke people in order not to be bored.
And it's one of the great defenses of the 2/4. You insist on being here with me,
okay, and then look out, because I am going to carve you to pieces and you‘re going
to run away.
The 2/4 on this cross does not like the idea that it's been thrown out into the world.
It does not like this. And the whole thing for it is that nothing out there. You know
you‘re supposed to go out and pursuit knowledge and the 2 says, I don‘t want to
learn. I don‘t want to study. Why did you send me out here for? I could have
stayed back in Eden, relaxed, have my feet up, everything would be okay; don't
have to learn anything, don't have any problems. So these are deeply under
stimulated people and I they don't know why. It‘s not because they're not
intelligent, and it's not because of any number of things, the 2/4 on this cross seems
to be bored to death. Nothing is stimulating. Nothing is really interesting and it's
very difficult to call them out.
When you get sent out of Eden you‘re not told to go out and just be yourself. You‘re
not told to go out and enjoy your natural gifts. You‘re sent out in pursuit of
something. When we get to the left angle here we get to education, we get to the
whole principle of what ideas are about. So, here you have the 2/4 and here you
have this boredom and it's something to understand about all 2/4s in the genetic
continuity that most of the time when they're mucking around in their environments
they actually lack stimulation. It‘s not so much that they‘re bored, but they lack
stimulation. And ultimately the only reason that they're finally open to somebody
pounding on the door and calling them out is that they need some stimulation. It‘s
the hermit that says after three weeks, geez I‘d better go out just to be with other
human beings, just have a taste of this.

The 2/5
RAC Eden 4
Stagnation and collapse are very powerful words. When you're looking at the 2/5
this is their theme on this cross: stagnation and collapse. They don't see the point of
having left the garden in the first place. Not only that, they are very paranoid about
why they were thrown out. It‘s like, what did I do, what was it all about. And like
the 2/4 there is a kind of refusal to play the game. They don't like it.
So, it‘s very interesting in this 2/4, 2/5 configuration that you have this enormous
resistance to being in the mundane world. So what you end up with is the kind of
idea people through the 2/4, 2/5 who are off somewhere in some other sort of non-
mundane idea plane and they‘re the ones that often provide you with very
stimulating concepts that lead nowhere, but they‘re stimulated.
These are people that cannot bear the mundane, cannot bear the demands of the
mundane. So, one of the things about these people is that they would rather live in
their imagination and guess where they go in their imagination, they go back to
Eden. These are utopian thinkers. These are people that are always looking for ‗we
don't need no education; we need coconuts falling from the trees.‘ This is a very,
very different kind of spirit. They‘re very imaginative.
They're also masters of factionalism. And 2/5s, to get rid of you, will do things that
are terrible. They will put an idea inside of you about somebody else just to get you
off their back, whether it's true or not. Again, none of these things are a fault. It's
also, by the way, stimulating for them to send you on a false goose chase.

The real beauty is when you get to the 3rd line, I love this 3rd line. It‘s the line of
The Realist. This is one of the essential values, one of the genuine attributes of the
3rd line: The acknowledgment that ideas, peace is transitory. Ideas come and go.
Also, a pleasure that ideas have no real application. What's so interesting is that
there is a genuine recognition of whether the idea itself has value or not, but no
capacity still to know who should get what.
It‘s a real dilemma for the lower trigram. In so many gates where the real principle
is collective, if you look at the lower trigram and all the collective gates you‘ve got a
problem. If you look at the lower trigram in the tribal gates you have a problem,
because they don't really understand what happens in relationship to the other. And
of course, there are always consequences. The 11th gate, 3rd line, a realist,
recognizes the value of an idea but doesn't know who will share that recognition. So
often the 3rd line will say something and it ends up being sarcasm. The fact is that

the other doesn‘t get it and takes it the wrong way. This is the great double entendre
line, a double meaning. The 3rd line has this terrible problem in that it doesn't know
how to align itself with other forces.
Ideas don't work any better than making children works when you're doing it alone.
This is one of the essential things to understand about the conceptual mind, whether
that is the logic mind through the 17/62 or the abstract mind through the 11/56,
there is no value in any of this unless it can be shared and it is the very sharing that
substantiates its value, particularly in the abstract. Remember that the abstract is
much more subjective than the logic. The logic has a pretense of objectivity. In
may, in fact, turn out to be subjective. We don't know, you have to investigate, but
its tendency is to be more objective where the tendency in the abstract is to be more
subjective.
Ideas are very personal. And in order for an idea to have collective value it has to
be received. Every person who has the 11th gate can be made incredibly
uncomfortable by anyone rejecting, not understanding, not being able to make sense
of, and not acknowledging the value of an idea. You have these 11s all the time
saying I‘ve got this great idea. And you‘re going, oh yeah, really. Oh, they suffer.
The whole point for them is that if you don't operate correctly you're not going to
know when. Remember we start off with the foundation being serendipity—right
time, right time, otherwise, ideas don't work. As a Manifestor I learned a long time
ago that you have to pit the timing to inform people. This is the other side of not
being a Generator or a Projector or a Reflector. Manifestors have to be very careful
about timing. If the timing isn't right, oh, the consequences are awful. It‘s the same
thing with ideas: timing. And of course, timing isn't something that you can
establish yourself. Timing is just a matter of being in the flow. It's a matter of
operating correctly.
One of the real things about following your strategy is that it aligns you to your
timing. So the realist is a 3/5, ideas come and go. And this is one of the dilemmas.
Here's the opportunity to have a really great mind. At least a great idea mind, a
universalizing mind, a mind that can go through the 3rd line experience of
recognizing what ideas are of value, what ideas are not of value. And as such, this
can be of enormous importance to humanity. But again 3/5s lose their potential
very early in life because of their upbringing. And not all of them are going to get a
chance later in life to learn about themselves in this context and begin to understand
that process. Most 3/5s go through their life living out the conditioning that was
established in their first seven years. A conditioning that says for every mistake you
make you are personally held responsible.
The other 3s in this game, the 3/6s, 6/3s, don't have that in the same way. There is
not this brand that's put on them when they make a mistake. But the 3/5 is branded
for life. So, you have a 3/5 on the Cross of Eden that comes up with some
cockamamie idea that they put out at the wrong time when they‘re six years old—I
think it‘s a great idea to burn down the house and we‘ll collect the insurance, mom.

the being is immediately destroyed. It‘s not the idea that loses value. It‘s the being
that loses its value.
This is what's frightening for 3/5s. If a 1/3 makes a mistake, it‘s like, okay, this
thing didn‘t work. The 3/5 makes exactly the same mistake and it's, it's your fault,
yes, yes, even though it was bad, you should have known better. We expect you
know better—the projection on the 5. So, when an idea comes out of a 3/5s mouth
and the idea is a lousy idea, it‘s not the idea that's condemned. It's them. Then we
lose the potential of those that perhaps can teach us the most from the past, from
the perspective and reflection upon the past.

The 3/6
RAC Eden 4
The 3/6 like all 3/6s if they can get through their early part of their life they have
tremendous potential, but it is the dilemma always of the first 28 years. To be a 3-3
here is not to get the ideas right. But at the same time, if the child is raised to
understand the potency of its 3rd line, that is, the potency of being able to penetrate
experience and learn from one's mistakes, then the 3-3 in this context can learn
more about bad ideas than just about anybody else. When you‘re dealing with the
3/6 they don't carry the same burden as a 3/5. They‘re carrying the burden that a
bad idea brands them for life as a bad person, that a stupid idea brands them for life
as a stupid person. With the 3-3 the real advantage is that they can discern all the
bad ideas, really discern literally all those bad ideas.
It is a deeply, deeply pessimistic perspective. The 3-3 is very different from the 6/3.
Remember that the 6/3 is a 6 on the Personality side, who they think they are will
escape pessimism; not completely, but mostly. They‘ll be able to go to the other
side; they‘ll be able to go to the optimism as who they think they are. But the 3/6
never gets that advantage. They have a pessimistic Personality all their life. So,
they need to very clearly, if they're not trained properly, educated properly, then
they're never really going to be the kind of being—you see somebody who is on this
cross with a 3/6 configuration and you're going to see somebody who will not tell you
their ideas, because they're convinced every idea is a bad idea.
By the time they get up on the roof if they have been able to see that their gift is
that these are great analytical minds, the kind of analytical mind that would be very
impressive to anyone if you could see it at work. This is the kind of mind where you
look at any reference point, any historical point, any kind of thing that's already been
laid out and they will penetrate them immediately to where the problems are, where
the mistakes are. This is a very, very good analytical mind.
If they get up on the roof with this so that there begins to be a balance that comes
into their physical body, the frequency begins to calm down. Then they can begin to
step into the possibilities of really being able to see that there are certain ideas that
are truly of value. But more importantly, what's really of value is to tell people
about the ideas that are not good, that are not healthy. We can dream for that one.

The 4/6
RAC Eden 4
Let me come to the magic of the 4/6 on this cross. This is one of those
extraordinary lines. It‘s the line of The Teacher. The ability to express the
essential nature of peace; that is, the essential nature of ideas. In this we have a
number of variations. That is, we've got the sage that in the extreme can teach
harmony to the tone deaf. We've got the ability to reach out and attract the
alienated. We've got the guru whose most valued wisdom is intentionally limited to
a few. Ideas which can only be grasped by a few.
So when you're looking at the 4/6, and this is the teaching line, again, it says
something about the influence of the 4 and the power of the network, the ability to
be able to externalize. Yet, the externalization of ideas has to be carefully limited.
The first thing you notice is that ideas only become potentially teachable only when
they become upper trigram. The realist doesn't do a good job being a teacher. They
do a good job of learning themselves.
The moment you get into the transpersonal, the moment you get to the upper
trigram, the 4 says, aha, I have to be able to get the idea to that other. So, rather
than being concerned about the nature of the idea they're concerned about the
methodology of transferring the idea to the other person. This is what really makes
them a teacher. And beyond that, in that recognition of the other—after all, it's a
network—to be able to see in that network who can grasp what.
It‘s like every once in a while you have a situation where there's a couple of people
who'd been 10 years in Human Design and a newcomer sits down at the table and
the conversation that everybody was having is pointless for that person. They can‘t
get in. There‘s no way that they can get in because they're not ready for those
concepts packaged in that way.
One of the things that a teacher has to realize, and what we see in our institutions, is
that we teach to the lowest common denominator. In other words, we teach to the
level that the base intelligence grasps, which is why intelligent children or children
that are different are so bored in institutions. And one of the things to see about
teaching is that this is the first thing you learn. It‘s like me; it took me realistically
10 years to lay out a foundation in which I had to wait 10 years before I could teach
things that I wanted to teach 10 years ago. And I had to wait, year by year by year
slowly just releasing the information, because there's no point in putting it out when
it's not time. There's no point trying to teach somebody something they're not ready
for.
This is what the potential of the 4/6 is. In other words, it‘s the ability through
recognition of a network to recognize where on the other is the opportunity—again,
opportunism—the opportunity to take in the value of the idea. This is Einstein‘s line.
And you can see in this the guru, this deeply limited—in Einstein‘s lifetime, how

many people understood him. They say maybe five or six. It‘s like it was only there
a few. No point old Al standing up in front of some second-year physics class in
university trying to teach them the principles of ‗God doesn't throw dice,‘ because it
just won't work. It‘s just blah.
My whole thing about simplification is that I realized long ago that if you can reduce
things to a simple formula you can both reached the idiot and impress the genius.
Again, this is all part of this mechanism. So, the 4/6 has a dilemma. The dilemma
always for the 4/6 is the first 28 years of their life. They need to meet their line of
opportunity in that first cycle in their life. And yet, it‘s confused with so many other
things that are not correct. Again, that 4/3 phase is always being aligned to the
wrong people. If you're an idea person and you're a natural teacher, being aligned
with a bunch of bozos isn't going to increase your capacity to teach or your interest
in it, for that matter. If you're in a highly educated stimulated environment growing
up, then that becomes something quite interesting.
There are these two things in Design. You‘ve got the 48th gate and the 48th gate is
the black magic. It is the desire to manipulate reality. You get to the 11th gate and
it‘s white magic, that white magic is the desire to illuminate reality, literally. In
other words, bring light to the experience of living. What becomes dependent on
that is what happens in this cross. You can‘t illuminate unless you train people to
receive illumination. If you don't teach somebody mathematics from the earliest age
and move them along in a mathematical track and get them into physics, only until
they get to the end of that track will they then begin to have the possibility of
grasping what old Al had to say. And it's a long track to train the mind to be able to
conceptualize in certain ways to grasp that.
So there is a fundamental dilemma in the Cross of Eden that when you get to the
transpersonal they say, hey we‘ve got all these techniques but nobody's ready for
us. What‘s very spooky for the 11 is this recognition that I‘ve got this great idea and
nobody can make sense of it. They don't see it. And seeing it is something they say
all the time. They don‘t see it. They don't get it. They‘re not trained for it.
It'll be interesting to see the Eden 4/6 beings what they can look like when they‘re
off the roof, and to see what kind of transition that will be for them. I think it is
deeply significant. After all, these beings are here to express the essential nature of
ideas, which is to express the essential nature of the past. So, they‘re very
important to us in terms of being able to describe, for example, the tripartite six line
process as an evolutionary process, as a mutative process. They're going to be
great teachers of that.

The 4/1
When I was very young I was doing terrible in school and my parents sent me to
some kind of psychologists testing thing and they discovered that I was a genius, at
least in terms of IQ, so they decided that they were going to do something about
that. They enrolled me to be a member of Mensa, which is one of these genius
clubs, and I was sent off to a Mensa gathering in Boston in Massachusetts. I can't
remember a more horrifying experience. It was horrifying.
I think I was around 14. I was already into being a folk singer and smoking
marijuana and here were all these incredibly straight people who were incredibly
narrow in their perspective. If you
wanted to talk about anal
microbiology they were right there.
But if you wanted to talk about
anything else they were basically
savant gorillas. I couldn't stand it.
It was horrifying. This is the 4/1.
This is the Juxtaposition Cross of
Ideas. And these people are down a
track you don‘t even want to go
near that. They are so spooky. It's
not that they can‘t offer something,
they do. There isn't an idea that
isn't an idea, so it's okay, if you
understand that absurdity, but
nonetheless.
They‘re very, very, very fixed,
deeply mentally fixed. And the
dilemma in this is that they‘re just
stuck with an idea. It can happen
when they‘re very young. It can happen when they go into whatever. But the thing
about these beings is that one idea is going to dominate them all their lives. It's also
going to mean that if you don't hook into that idea you don't even exist.
Remember that this is not the Cross of Eden anymore. We‘re on the juxtaposition
cross which means that we've moved away from the 6-36. Eden people always feel
fucked. It‘s like you get thrown out and there is conflict, all this inexperience that
you have to get experience for, and it‘s a terrible pressure and you go back to your
ideas in the hope that you can find some way to make sense out it so that you can
deal with it so you can teach others how to deal with it. But when you get to the

Juxtaposition Cross of Ideas you've got the beginnings of the Vessel underneath—the

These are beings that their ideas tend to be about universal concepts, the influence
of the 25, and very bizarre things about the body, which comes out of the 46. But
basically they‘re simply locked into a concept. And nothing breaks in that. They‘re
often diagnosed as being obsessive delusional. They‘re the kinds of beings were you
just shake their head because you can't shake them out of the idea. When you don't
notice this is when the idea somehow fits into whatever the mundane world happens
to be, when it appears to have some sense to it. But unfortunately in many cases it

The 5/1
This is the Left Angle Cross of Education and of course this is the second variation.
We saw the first one in Civilization with the 12. This 5th line is very beautiful. It is
The Philanthropist. You can see that it is a basic tenet of heresy that you must in
some way display philanthropy. It‘s my 5th line heresy to give away as much of
Human Design as I can for free. At least as much as what's reasonable. This is this
philanthropy; this is this essence of the 5th line experience.
You can see that the moment you get to the Left Angle of Education you see the true
white path. The true white path is no idea has a right to be secret. No idea can be
exclusively held and only released for reward. In other words, the 11.5 is against
patents, copyrights you name it. It‘s these people who write me letters and say, you
got it from a voice, so why should we pay for it? I say, ok; 18 years of work.
Nonetheless, the 11th gate will say, hey, it‘s all free. Everybody has a right to it.
Now, we need those kinds of beings, because it is the bedrock of education. The
bedrock of education is how does it work; no secrets. Let's get to the bottom of it,
let‘s see how it works, this can be a very, very beautiful process. The motiveless
nurturing of the disenfranchised. That means motiveless nurturing of the ignorant.
It‘s about raising the level of intelligence. Philosophic and humanitarian ideas. It‘s
not so much that they‘re philosophical humanitarian ideas as much as they are
offered in the philosophical and humanitarian context. Ideas are seen to benefit
humanity, and that humanity benefits from ideas.
There is another side of it: The withdrawing from direct contact where giving is a
form of defense. That is, giving away ideas out of a sense of insecurity. Now course,
we know that. We know that for example with Human Design its very newness, and
it‘s not so new anymore, but still, its very newness allows for this kind of ‗here have
a taste, see what it tastes like.‘ And this is a way in which ideas have to be put out

into the world. It‘s why we have a world of samples. You‘re given a sample of this
and a sample of that. This is part of the 11.5 process.
This philanthropy in the hands of the 5/1 can be very, very beautiful. It can if they
have a strong enough depth in that 1st line. But this is also a place where you see
these kinds of people that try to get secrets out of governments from old files, the
people that want everything
revealed. Modern concepts of
business transparency, all of these
things are rooted in this line of the
philanthropist.
So, this giving away is one of the
things that I always recommend to
idea people. Don‘t live by your idea.
Give it away or sell it to somebody
else, because this is what outer
authority truly is: Ideas of great
value as outer authority. And this is
an extraordinary time for people
that have the 11th gate. You‘ve got
Pluto sitting there. You're being
taken into a very, very unusual
depth of ideas, and ideas that are in
many ways the most profound ideas
possible since the beginning of our
process as a nine-centered being.
So this is very deep. And for those people who are 56s and don't have the 11, this is
an extraordinary period, the next three years where there is going to be this very,
very intense mental pressure from Pluto.

But this is the key to understanding that if you start at the beginning with
attunement, 1st line, when you start with the fact that serendipity rules—right place,
right time; whatever—but, that's the right place, right time if you need to have
personally your ideas valued. The 5 doesn't care whether the idea is valued or not.
It simply puts them out. Here, try this; here try that. Interesting, right? Here this
one is for nothing. I will give you some advice; this is the great line of ‗I‘ll give you

Any heretic, by the way, will give you advice, but some of it's scary. The 11.5 is
really nice. These are people that have a certain amount of light in them. And
they're always trying to give you the advice that will make your life better. Truly, it‘s
what‘s interesting about them. Now, obviously when you're dealing with a 5/2 it‘s
coming from this self-motivation business. It‘s very, very difficult and they tend to
use ideas as a way to keep themselves protected.
Remember when you meet a 5/2 on this cross you're going to assume that they're
going to educate you. And if they don't educate you, you are going to be really
pissed with them. If I don‘t blow noise in your ear, you're annoyed with me. I‘m a
Clarion. You expect what somebody‘s cross is, literally. You expect to be educated
by them. If you go up to a 5/2 and say please educate me, they say here, take this
idea and piss off; go away. They‘re not necessarily appreciated as teachers.
What the 5/2 is really wonderful at is this philanthropic signpost. It‘s like these
pictures like from the Caribbean, from Bermuda, where you have these cops dressed
with these tall white hats and these suits and they‘re standing in the middle of a
horrendously busy crossing and they're doing their number, with whistles blowing
and white gloves pointing. This is what the philanthropist is; particularly the 5/2,
because when you're coming to the 5/2 they know you want to be educated and they
say the school is that way. And they‘ll send you to a good school or a good teacher.
You meet a 5/2 who is a musician and you project that they're going to teach you
music and you go up to them and they say there's a great guitar teacher right down
there, over there. They very nicely protect themselves.
Again, we have to see that everything about life is an evolutionary adaptation and
it's clear to me that 2/5s and 5/2s are undergoing an enormous change in their
potential because of the virtual environment. I think particularly in the case of 5/2s.
We don‘t have enough 5/2s to balance the number of 5/1s, in that sense. 5/1s are
very powerful forces, for good or for bad out there. 5/2s are interesting because
they bring with them a naturalness that is in some ways contrived in the 5/1. The
5/1 has to study. It has to learn all these things. For the 5/2 it‘s in them. And
when something is just in you, how it comes out carries a special quality. I think
we're going to see much more 5/2 heresies in the Internet age, in the blogging age,
in the ability for a 5/2 to release an idea on the Internet and not have anything
directly come back at them; just putting it out. I think that we will have a lot more
of them.

Adaptability: The inner balance to accept transition. Again, this speaks so deeply
for the 6th line being. The innate awareness that all forms are transitory. The
realization that ideas lead to change and are changeable. The detriment is just the

peace or war. The realization of what idea is of value in any situation. Adaptation is
everything for the 6th line being.
Anyone who has a 6th line in their profile knows that their life is nothing but a deeply
organize roller coaster. Life‘s a roller coaster. If you‘re a 6th line being you know up
and down, all the stuff that you have to go through. And at the same time you have
to be able to adapt to the mundane plane and its circumstances. That variability of
the 6th line being to adapt gives them from the intellectual perspective an enormous
capacity to see the value of ideas.
We began this process by talking about how in the Quarter of Mutation every single
hexagram has to confront death, has to confront the terminality of what things are.
This is the realization that all forms are transitory. The potential in the 6th being is to
recognize that their form is transitory, what it is to be the 3-3, what it is to be on the
roof, what it is to go through that process of coming off the roof, this is not just
about the transition. It is about the need, the gift to adapt.
More than that, this is the Cross of Education and it means that this business of the
innate awareness that all forms are transitory is something that must be taught.
Humanity must be educated in the recognition that we come and we go. And that
we, ourselves, are simply a concretized concept that comes and goes. And there is
an inner balance that is achieved.
What is inner balance? For me it's quite obvious, you have a dysfunctional
relationship between your Personality and your Design. It's a dysfunctional
relationship that is magnetically held together by the force of the Monopole. Inner
balance is when the passenger accepts the vehicle. Inner balance is when the
Personality can live in peace with the design. And only when one is willing to accept
that transition and that transitoriness is a law—and 11 goes to the 56, and the 56 a
part of the Cross of the Laws; it‘s a law. Some of the most important laws we have
are nurtured in the 11 and passed on to the 56 where they‘re concretized in the
thyroid as a mechanism. Ultimately we have a great law. That great law is all things
come and go. We need to accept that they come and go.
More than that, as we go through this process, despite the fact that we come and go,
we have an obligation to educate our young. We have an obligation to educate the
other. We have an obligation to do so. If there's ever a place where the 6 is
supposed to become a trusted leader it's here. Without education we‘re lost. Now, if
you look at the cycle over the last several thousand years you can see that we‘ve
done a remarkable job. Yes, I have my deep concerns about those that remain
disenfranchised from rightful education, but in fact, we are educating an enormous
number of beings on the planet. There is a level of higher education that has
reached out now to a hundreds of millions of beings.
So, in fact, this movement out of Eden into Education, we've done both jobs really
well. Go forth and multiply; we have. Go forth and learn; we have. We‘ve learned
so much that we've gotten to a point where we understand the game, which is really
an achievement.

So, when I look at the 11th gate, I‘m not an abstract person, I have no abstract
gates in the mind; ideas for me were never pleasant. I never looked upon ideas is
being interesting. I've never been seduced by them. In the early part of my life I
was quite heavy with idea people, because I don't like things that don't have some
solid basis to them. There's too much of a scientist in me. It's through these years
of the knowledge that I've learned to see that this is the experiential component.
It's not enough to have fact. There has to be the correlating experience and the
correlating experience adds corollaries to the fact, adds anomalies to the fact.
It‘s only out of this process of reflection that we have the gift of education in the first
place. And that education is essential. So, I've learned to look at that nice white
light of the 11 and say, good for you. ―I want to help you all with my idea.‖ It
always made me sick. It‘s like; I don‘t want your help. I don‘t need your help.
Maybe they do, go talk to them. I'd rather say the facts are that everybody's fucked
up. This I understand. I immediately tune into this. But this business of: ―I have
this wonderful idea for you.‖ How many times I've heard people say to you, ―I have
this wonderful idea,‖ and all I want to go is ―save it; don‘t give it to me, I don‘t want
to hear it.‖

The 6/3
LAC Education 2
An interesting thing, by the way, about the 6/3 as we finish this cross, normally 6/3s
have a real dilemma, they've got one foot over here and they have one foot over
there and not only do they have one foot over here and one foot over there,
hexagram to hexagram, they often have one foot on the roof while they have the
other foot on the ground, or this way, or sometimes they‘re caught in between and
they begin to hurt between the legs. It‘s very uncomfortable.
The 6/3 here is fascinating. It is the ability to be the adaptable realist. There‘s a
special quality in the 6/3 here that rather than looking at the 10, because when the
11 looks at the 10, the 11 feels very uncomfortable, because the 10 isn‘t interested
in ideas. It‘s interested in behavior, just behavior. And when the 11 with its ideas is
saying ―I have this wonderful idea,‖ the 10 is saying, ―I have to behave this way in
order to survive. Keep your idea.‖ There is a real conflict between the 11 and the
10. And the 6/3 on this cross doesn't like looking at the 10, because the 10 says if
you don't have the right behavior you're going to die. You never get that kind of
threat with an idea. Hey, it was just an idea; relax. But the moment its behavior it
gets real serious, because the behavior of the 10 is all about survival.
So, the 6/3 up here says, ―I‘m going to stay over here at the very top of this
hexagram and just ponder.‖ So, they have difficulty coming off the roof. I‘ve
described 6/3s and 3/6s as ladder people or bouncing balls, whatever you want.
Here‘s a 6/3 that will have a very hard time coming off the roof. Not the 6/2, but
the 6/3 in this case will not like coming off the roof. It‘s much better to stay back
there on the roof and reflect on adaptability and what it takes, and whatever, than to
jump into the maelstrom of behavior. ~

Introduction
The 10th gate is not well understood, I think it‘s just so complex it's hard to
understand it sometimes. It‘s says: The underlying code of behavior which ensures
successful interaction despite circumstances. It‘s not interaction with others; it‘s
interaction with the world despite circumstance. It‘s an underlying code of behavior.
Treading on the tail of the tiger, beware; you step on the tail of the tiger you‘re
going to get into a lot of trouble. This is all about behavioral awareness. And the
potential—after all, the 10 to the 20 is about being awake; the 10 to the 57 is the
perfection of form; the 10 to the 34 is the power to follow one's convictions.
So, the 10th gate is an instrument of behavior that is very, very powerful. The other
thing is that when I focused on the dilemmas in Rave Psychology of individuality and
melancholy that there is a great distaste in the 10th gate for wrong behavior. If
you're somebody who is a 10 it is very, very difficult to deal with any bad behavior.
I know this experience so deeply. I‘m a 10.1 and the 10.1s is the innate sense to
know and accept one’s place. So, I've been able to be a beggar and I've been able
to sit with kings and it doesn't really make any difference, I know my place. It‘s very
easy for my behavior to simply fit in, to know how not to step on the tail of the tiger.
My two oldest children are 10.1s and their behavior is perfect, as children. I‘ve been
able to take then anywhere in any kind of circumstances, particularly with my son
Loki from the time that he was very tiny I was able to put him in all kinds of
situations and his behavior was always just correct. And then I had my little one and
he‘s got an open G and no 10th gate. The son of a bitch doesn't know how to
behave. It drives me crazy. So, there's my two 10.1 children at the restaurant
being very correct, they know exactly how to act according to everything and there's
the little guy jumping up and down on the tables. And it‘s like, no this is not correct.
I went through a phase where I wouldn‘t go out with him. I‘m a 10.1, it's
embarrassing. If somebody else's kid was doing that, I‘d give those parents the
eye—do something with your kid. But it‘s mine. Can I go now? And worse than
that, threats don't help. I‘m going to take you home; I‘m going to lock you in the
car. Then you say, just sit, it‘s coming. The next thing you know he‘s gone. And
you don‘t know where he is. He‘s in the kitchen.
So if you've got the 10 and the other person doesn't have the 10 most of the time
you want to smack them. Learn how to behave. If you‘re going to jump on tables
all your life late somebody‘s going to kill you for you for it. It's just not done.

The 1/3
So, when you're dealing here with the Vessel of Love and you're dealing with the 10,
remember something, you get nothing from these people unless you know how to
behave. Modesty: An innate sense to know and accept one’s place. A valued sense
of purpose, no matter what the position. The ability to know one's place and how to
act despite circumstances. So, when you're dealing with a 1/3 on this cross, and this
is really the very foundation of this, you can see very clearly that they learn so fast
what behavior punishes and what
behavior doesn't. Loki, who is just
hanging around out there, this is his
cross. He‘s a 1/3 on this cross.
They learn very quickly. He learned
as a baby who to deal with the
camarero who was always sticking
his face into his crib. And you can
watch it. I watched it.
It‘s an amazing thing about the
power of the 1/3, what it means to
be a 1/3. It‘s why they have to be
so self-absorbed. They‘re very
quick. They‘re all quick. They‘re
very quick to recover. And if they're
lucky—again, it‘s all about
nurturing—they‘re very quick to pick
up the game, they can pick it up
right away. So, behaviorally
speaking, they‘re very, very good
at—I always wanted to call the first line the chameleon line. The 10.1 is really a
chameleon. They‘ll change their spots for you. They‘ll change their color for you.
They‘re not changing anything, by the way. But they're very good at letting you see
what they think you need to see. These beings are quite tricky.
However, they can be very, very sensitive. I have the 10.1 and it is integration
which means that whenever the Moon goes in the 34, the 57 or the 20 or the 10 I
feel oversensitive. It's one of the things people don't think about in terms of
integration. When you have a gate in integration look at the exalted/detriment and
see very clearly that there are many ways in which that can be set off. Any one of
those other gates can influence it.
So one of the things to see about this ability to be able to know how to fit in and
know how to behave that there's also a real deep sensitivity if that behavior is being

conditioned too powerfully from the outside. In other words, these are beings that
can't stand being disciplined because it means they failed at the right behavior.
Think about that. That‘s the oversensitivity. I pride myself on being correct, and not
just simply in the sense of Design and awareness but in the sense of being a 10
myself. It‘s very important to me that my behavior is correct. I‘m operating out of
my Spleen; I have this nice line of behavior.
And yet, when somebody tries to condition my behavior, which is not as rare as you
would think because I have a family, there are always pressures conditioning that.
The fact is that that's the only moment when somebody makes a comment about my
behavior, it‘s like are you crazy? This is the oversensitivity that‘s there. The 1/3
learns very quickly how to disguise whatever it wants to in order to succeed in being
able to have the right behavior.

The 1/4 has a dilemma. The 1/4 learns a behavioral style from the imprinting and
conditioning of its parents and never gives it up. And of course that's a dilemma.
They don't give it up. What is the right behavior in the jungle is the wrong behavior
at a tea party. And yet, they‘ll take their jungle behavior right into the tea party, or
vice versa.

The 2/4
RAC Vessel of Love 4
When you get to the 2 we get to this concept that we deal with all the time with the
2 where we‘re talking about The Hermit: the successful sidestepping of behavioral
requirements through isolation, independent behavior through isolation. These are
these beings that don't study like the 1s. The 1s study behavior. They watch how
other people act; they learn to see what behavior works and what behavior doesn't
work. They‘re very clever. But the 2/4 doesn't want to do that, it's not natural for
them to do that. They simply want to behave the way they behave and be left
alone, because they don't want to take the heat.
These are children that are very, very difficult to discipline. It's not easy. These are
the kinds of children that would rather say leave me alone, I'll go into my room and
I‘m going to behave the way I like in my room and if you don't see it, it shouldn't
bother you. So much of the 2/4 whole thing is leave me alone because I don't want
your comments. It's not about me alone because I don't want you. It's never that.
No 2/4 is a hermit because they're rejecting people. They are a hermit because
they‘re rejecting the comments. They're rejecting the inference that comes from
them. They‘re rejecting the criticism. They‘re rejecting all of those things that put
pressure on the 2 to learn something.

Think about how difficult it is for a 2nd line Personality that can‘t teach its body
anything to be told that has to learn. It‘s a terrible position. The body, through its
network, is going to be open to such opportunities, but the Personality is like—leave
me alone, let me just have my behavior in isolation. 2/4s want to avoid
conditioning. And that means that all 2nd lines—roles gates are so wonderful because
they open up so many things we need to see. All 2nd lines try to avoid conditioning,
which is why that I've had enormous success in my career working with 2/4s. It's
hard to assess things fairly, I‘m a 5/1 so they‘re a pure harmony to me, so there is a
way in which I reach 2/4s differently than any other profile.
Yet, it's clear to me that there is this recognition in the 2/4 that conditioning is the
enemy. Now, they may see the conditioning in different contexts, but they do
understand its principal. And of course, here when you're dealing with a behavioral
age they don't want their behavior being changed. No 2/4 is going to volunteer to
go into the army, to go to boot camp to be turned into a killer monkey. It‘s a very
uncomfortable thing. Imagine all the 2/4s that were drafted in the Vietnam era in
America. Unless they were drafted into the tank division, I don't imagine they were
very happy. They‘d hide inside a tank, may be maybe they had a shot.
This is what I love about this line, there is a lot of success here, and you have it in
the 4th line as well: The successful sidestepping of behavioral requirements through
isolation. It‘s not something you're born with. It‘s something you grow into.
Successful sidestepping; in other words, they‘re good at it and so they should be.
Sometimes they‘re so good at it that they never get the call. The other thing is, if
you're a 10 and God shows up offering you everything and you don't like her
behavior, you will never make a deal. It‘s like I don‘t want to deal with you because
I don‘t like the way you behave. It‘s the whole thing about 10s. They‘re very
prejudice about behavior.
There were so many people who had such interesting thoughts that I read about
until I finally saw them. When I finally saw them, right away there was this (sound).
I don't like the way they act, I don't like the way they behave. For me the most
difficult thing taking on this role is that I'm very, very picky about behavior.
Sometimes I've had to swallow my Zen sword. I've fallen on my sword; anyway,
successful sidestepping. So our deepest concern for the 2nd line being is they're so
good at sidestepping conditioning we may not be able to reach them.

with their perfect isolated behavior. Now, in the past they suffered greatly for this.

make your way in the world. It‘s a demand. This is the survival mechanism. So,
the 2/5s like the 5/2s this was a dilemma for them. It was a dilemma because they
didn't want anybody to question their behavior. If anyone questioned their behavior
they would immediately go into retreat, be very, very, very, very suspicious about
them, and be very concerned that they're always being watched.
The 2/5 on this cross is very, very paranoid. But again, in this day and age, I tell
you, there is a difference. These are people that are creating virtual behaviors. The
behavior on the web, the behavior on the Internet, the behavior in e-mail, in e-mail
you really see it. There‘s another quality and they can get away with it because they
can stay in their isolation. I think that over the next 20 years or so, what we're
going to see is this new kind of heresy emerging. It's not one that is directly
connected to the relationship in the flesh. It is all just somehow out there and very
different.

The 3rd line is The Martyr. I remember that 3s in the beginning never really liked
this as their role description. You‘re a martyr/heretic—oh shit, really, does that
mean I have do die? Yes, it's true, we all do. The futile rejection of standards based
on a just awareness. It‘s the futile rejection of behavioral standards. Think about the
context of gate: The martyr as an enduring example whose behavior is ultimately
enshrined. I love that. It‘s like if you get nailed up on the cross don‘t worry. We‘ll
make little carvings of you for centuries. It‘s all fine. We‘ll remember you. Thank
you.
There are two things. There is behavior that challenges others and there is behavior
that is intended to attract attention. The 3—if their behavior isn‘t wrong there's
something wrong with them. It‘s a 10.3 for God's sake. It tries to do the right
behavior and it doesn‘t work. That‘s how they learn. Not only how they learn for
themselves, but they learn about the behavior. ―I know what it‘s like to act like
that.‖ Wouldn‘t it be great to turn all these 3/5s into actors or actresses?
For a lot of people the word martyr automatically assumes punishment. And it's
true. The 10 3/5 really get a whacking. But then again, they're supposed to get a
whacking. It is the Vessel of Love, after all. I‘m not just being funny. Well, I am.
Somebody has to show us that behavioral standards change. And remember the
difficulty of the 3, particularly the 3/5, is that it doesn‘t know the impact of its
behavior. It's not its fault. It doesn‘t. It doesn't know what to do. It honestly
doesn't know what the right behavior is. It has to find the right behavior, discover
the right behavior in its journey.
What happens is that it both attracts attention and challenges standards of behavior.
It just does. I love playing that game. Every once in awhile I step out of my 10.1
just to have some fun and play the 10.3 game. You don‘t act like other people expect

you to act in certain situations. And it has impact and effect. It can also piss people
off. This is the negative attraction that can come. Sometimes you want to step on
the tail of the tiger. What will the tiger do? This is a 3/5. And if the tiger bites your
head off, you‘ve learned that lesson. But you're not going to take it from somebody
else saying to you, don't step on the tail of the tiger. You say that to a 3/5 and the
first thing they do is step on the tail of the tiger. What‘s it like? Don‘t drink that
you'll die; okay. This is so typical of them.
So, they're really good at going into situations and testing them, and every once in a
while they discover a better behavioral mode. This is their gift. Every once in a
while they really notice that if we just adjust this because this doesn't work we can
actually do this. And remember where the 10 goes—perfected form. You‘re dealing
with the perfected form mechanism. And even though it's a difficult one, this is the
perfecting of that form. The 3rd line is a futile rejection. Think about that. Futile
rejection means there's no point in rejecting it, but then you have to learn that. You
only learn it‘s futile after you see over and over again it doesn't work.

The 3/6
RAC Vessel of Love 4
Most 3/6s are not going to do well on this cross in this configuration because they
are going to be particularly punished. And if they happen to be Manifestors, the
likelihood of them surviving is another story. This line is the futile rejection of
standards. The 2nd line is the successful and this is the futile. There‘s nothing more
futile than a 3/6 on this cross.
What‘s so interesting about the Vessel of Love is that everybody thinks that the
Vessel of Love is that these are loving people who are putting their love out. And of
course there is some truth in that, but there are people who pull love to them. This
cross is a G Center cross. It‘s a Monopole cross. It‘s not a Personality cross or a
Design Cross; it really is a Monopole cross.
The whole thing about the 3/6 is that in their 3-3 phase they pull all kinds of people
towards them who are going to try to change their behavior. They pull them. And of
course, the 3/5 challenges the behavior. Most people who challenge behavior are
blamed or accused of only doing it to attract attention. Now, we see that it's there.
And so often they're put in those situations where they have no other way to act.
It‘s forced on them. And then they get punished for it. The 3/5 is much less a
martyr than the 3/6. The 3/6 is really a martyr. And I think that the only way that a
3/6 gets to the roof is on its hands and knees, literally crawling up there.

The 4/6
RAC Vessel of Love 4
When you get to the 4 you get to the theme of the acceptance of norms until
successful transformation can be engendered; acceptance of norms. These are the
people who are so good at pretending how to behave. This is a person who is an
absolute screaming anarchist who is working in one of these horrendous factories of
continual boredom, living out the behavioral pattern until they can finally break out
of it usually with a submachine gun when they shoot everybody else in the factory. I
don‘t mean that. I want to be nice to 4s.
This is the line of The Opportunist; this is the line of opportunism. This is
opportunistic behavior; when in Rome do as the Romans do. This is the great line of
the 4 here—when in Rome, do as the Romans do. When you‘re a 4/6, when you‘re a
4/3 you go to Rome and you act like a New Yorker and you really get into trouble.
It‘s a good thing to learn how to fake it. And you can see this is about the outside.
It's not about your natural behavior, the 10.1, the innate sense. This is the 4 that
says, how do I fool them because I have to network them and I need to hold them in
my network, and I'm only going to be able to do that when they‘re aligned to my
behavior and my behavior is aligned to them, so how do I find exactly the right
behavior.
It‘s like what I talk about the opportunist—don‘t leave a job until you have another
job, don‘t leave a lover until you have another lover. That‘s fake behavior. It is. It‘s
the boss comes in and you smile, and underneath is ―you son of a bitch,‖ and you do
all the things you're supposed to do because you need to fit into the behavioral mode
that says you're still participating and you‘re waiting for that magic moment when
somebody is going to give you a better offer and you can go up to the boss and you
can say that is my real behavior, fuck you, and leave.
So, when you're dealing with a 4 you‘re dealing with something else and you‘re
dealing with a dilemma, as always with the 4/6 with a 4/3 phase, it‘s supposed to be
a transcendence to a higher code. The maintaining of behavioral patterns until the
right moment and opportunity for transformation. It doesn't say this is a great line
of fooling people with behavior.
More than that, this is where we teach false behavior. We have to teach false
behavior all the time. For example, if you‘re going to get a job working on a police
force you have to be trained to a certain behavior. When you stop somebody you
can't afford to smile. Smiling is not allowed. You have to be serious. This whole
business about how we have on the transpersonal level these whole behavioral
conditioning programs. You can‘t get a job unless you change your behavior. Just
about any job you can imagine out there, you can't just go in there with your natural
behavior.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Behavior
 15  17
The 4/1
When we moved to the Juxtaposition Cross of Behavior, obviously we're going to
have a change that is going to take place at the unconscious level. Remember that
these shifts from the 4/6 to the 4/1 always represent a certain amount of shock,
because you have the underlying body theme that's changing underneath. We had
the Vessel of Love quality underneath. That is, the 25 and the 46, and we have this
shift to the 17 and the 18. The
moment that you shift into this
binary it is one of the most
challenging of all configurations.
Both the 17th gate and the 18th gate
are inherently challenging gates.
They have a capacity to be able to
see things, see what's wrong, try to
deal with them, insist on changing
them, and insist on correcting them.
They have different motivations. The
18 is trying to correct the
experiment and the 17 is trying to
organize people into accepting the
theory. So, you have a very
different kind of behavioral track
here with the 10.4, that is, as a 4/1.
This opportunist becomes very much
the opportunity to find the right
behavior. What you see about 4/1s
is that they really go in their life purely for behavior as their standard. That is, style
over substance. As long as the behavior is right, as long as they can leave the right
impression, then that's enough for them.
They are deeply critical, though, of others. And the whole thing about the 4 is that
the 4 learns very quickly that it has to adapt to the behavioral majority. The 4/1 will
find its behavioral line in that, but it will be deeply, deeply critical of that majority. It
will be deeply critical of aspects of their behavior.

The Left Angle Cross of Prevention 2  10  18
 15  17
The 5/1
You really get to see the importance of this polarity, the 17/18, when you get to the
Left Angle Cross of Prevention. The only way you can save people is often by
explaining to them the kind of behavior that is self-destructive. That is, the kind of
behavior that can really hurt them.
The other thing is that because we are designed as not-self to be emerged in the
homogenized environment, that this Left Angle Cross of Prevention is the ultimate
heretical position for a 5th line. This is the 5th line of the 10, The Heretic: overt
challenge to norms, and the challenge is rooted in the 17 and the 18 on this cross.
There is an enormous power to
challenge the norms, and it‘s an
ability to succeed in doing so
through understanding and
expression of higher principles. It's
also to see that they may get
punished for all that. Challenging
norms is a dangerous business. It‘s
always dangerous. There is not a
heretic that brings a challenge to
norms that is not threatened in one
way or another eventually.
There is a great comfort in
behavioral norms. You can see how
confusing it can be the first time
you go to a foreign country and you
don't understand the behavior. I
can remember my very first week in
Ibiza and suddenly being very
distracted by what appeared to me
to be voices that were angry, loud, and yelling at each other only to realize it was
normal. It was just a loud place with people who deal with each other that way.
And until you understand the behavioral norms it's often very uncomfortable. You
misread it.
The thing is that we're conditioned into these behavioral norms and in terms of the
individual—after all, the 10th gate is an individual gate—in terms of the individual it‘s
like, it‘s not for me. I see that‘s the norm out there, but that‘s not for me and that‘s
not for you either, it says in its transpersonal capacity. So what we get to see on
this Left Angle Cross of Prevention is the ability to prevent people from being trapped
in the conditioned norm. And to try to help them get out of that, which is what

heresy is all about; heresy is always about breaking the mold. It‘s always about
changing the rules. It's changing the perception. It‘s changing the way you see.
But the criteria here is that you cannot be a heretic unless you're operating out of
higher principles. Without the higher principles you have no protection. In other
words, just to tell somebody that they're behavioral mode doesn't have to copy
everybody else's is not enough unless what you're really telling them is a way in
which they can find a truer quality out of life through a changed behavior.
Both the 5/1 and the 5/2, because of the changing conditions of our times,
particularly about the virtual condition, you're going to find that there are more 5/2
heretics on the web now than there's ever been 5/1 heretics running around
screaming on the planet, live, in color. In other words, there's less risk. Every 5
knows the price they pay if they‘re wrong. Every 5 knows the price they pay if they
don't fulfill somebody else's expectation. How quickly they're ready to cut you down
to size. So, when you're dealing with a heretic you have to see that if you're going
to be able to draw people away from the behavioral norm you‘d better be operating
on very, very fine principles.
Now, most of the cases it's just seduction. And it‘s in the seduction that they end up
being punished. It's very difficult to understand the Left Angle Cross of Prevention
through the 10th gate. In other words, if you're looking at the cross, you can really
see it, because it's not the 10s job to question behavior. It isn't. But the 17/18
questions everything. And so, what you get out of this 5th line heretic is that it never
can accept the norm as being an absolute and correct. And this is an understanding
of all 5th line beings.
A 5th line being will never trust what's the norm, never. It can‘t trust the norm,
which is why they're so suspicious, because they know that when you have a
behavioral norm that all the true behavior is hidden. You never really get to see the
true behavior because everybody is acting the same. It‘s like going into a Japanese
office building. All behavior is identical. It‘s a heresy to behave differently.
Everybody's under pressure. And you see that‘s not just in their society, obviously,
you see this in every society on the planet. So, when the 5 looks at that and looks
at this conditioned norm of behavior, they‘re immediately upset. They‘re 10s after
all, they‘re individuals. It makes them feel really sad that everybody is caught in
that same old same old same old.
There's a sidebar to this, and the sidebar to this is that in my investigations of
homosexuality over many, many years of looking at both male and female
homosexuals, clients of mine, groups that I worked with in the early years when I
was working in Germany, it was very common for them to have the 10.5. It showed
up more often than it should have. And by the way, that was always in combination
with things. The most common configuration was a 10.5 with an open emotional
system. Right away you get to see somebody who in the normal sense of pleasure
and pain, in the normal sense of sexuality, they were either abused or they were
made terribly uncomfortable.

And out of the potential of love of the 10 they develop a heretical approach to love.
And a great many of them that I know had perfected form with the 10.5. And it‘s
interesting for me, I never experimented with bisexuality. I was always very deeply
heterosexual. Yet at the same time, throughout my life I've had gay friends and
throughout my life I have had, particularly when I was younger, I was often
propositioned by gay men. And it never bothered me. I said no, but it never
bothered me, which was always curious for me.
As a matter of fact, I enjoyed it with the same vanity that you enjoy somebody of
the opposite sex saying they're attracted to you. It was very easy for me. Now,
that's very much my 5 tuning into this frequency, this frequency where normal
behavior is conditioned behavior. The modes of normal behavior are conditioned.
And so, in the heretic is also this possibility for living different kinds of love, finding a
different kind of perfected form, a different way of achieving a relationship with
others. That‘s just something interesting to keep in mind.

The 5/2
LAC Prevention 2
The 5/2 heretic on the Cross of Prevention is without given the changes of this age
you would never really see them at work. They would never put themselves in a
position where they would be destroyed. The paranoia over the consequences of
defined normal behavior is something that their unconscious body is not interested
in, even though their Personality is screaming to do it. So, the moment you're
dealing with the 2 underneath, again, this resistance, particularly when you're
dealing with heresy, this is the Buddha that gets beaten up because they refuse to
prevent you from entering into an unproductive behavioral structure. They just
won‘t help you. They won't show you the way. And as I said, I think this age is
really going to benefit the 2/5s and the 5/2s. I think that they're going to find their
voice this way.

The 6/2
LAC Prevention 2
The 6th line of the 10th gate is a line that you could spend a lifetime dealing with.
Particularly in this time when we‘re dealing with 6th line mutation and 6th line
mutation in the profile, what it means to be a 6. The Role Model: The perfect
expression—obviously it‘s a blue line—of norms through action rather than words.
Here you get to see the whole process. The 6th line in the first 28 years lives an
action that is punished. It‘s punished by failure. So it can‘t see itself as an example
of anything other than failure. It goes up onto the roof and through its object vision
it begins to tell people about what behavior will work for them, or not, but it doesn't
live it themselves because they are withdrawn from that world; the hypocrisy. Then
finally, there is the potential of coming back off the roof and somehow being able to
live as a true example.

This expression of norms through action rather than words is the only thing that you
can judge a 6th line being by when they get to their post-Kiron phase. In other
words, when you meet somebody with a 6th line profile who has had their Kiron
return, what they say has very little value in judging them. Don‘t listen to what they
say; see what they do. It is the action. That's why you go from the action of the
first 28 years, which is fraught with failure, to the non-action of the roof, which is
observational and then finally back into the action. And of course going back into
the action is full of risk unless your behavior is absolutely perfect. It doesn't say, the
almost perfect perfection, or the almost perfect expression, it‘s the perfect
expression of your norm in action, no words, words aren‘t necessary.
This is the difference between 5 and the 6. The 5 has to sell you. The 6 only needs
to show you. They‘re very different things. The moment that the 6 is trying to tell
you, you know they're on the roof. And the moment that you see that they are too
old to be on the roof and there's still telling you, you tell them what you think of
them—you‘re full of shit, you're a hypocrite. You‘re telling me all this stuff, but
that‘s not what you're doing. You‘re sitting there with a cigarette in your mouth and
you‘re telling me not to smoke. Are you crazy? Do you think I‘m going to listen to
you?
So this is a very, very important thing to understand about the role model: action,
inaction, action. These are the three phases. They‘re in learning process in the
action to learn how to be the consistent example. The constant example that
refocuses the complacent on the basic integrity of set behavior. To know how to
behave changes people's lives, to be an example of correct behavior saves people‘s
lives. It‘s like you‘re in an elevator with four people. And you're on the 72nd floor
and it gets stuck. This is a great opportunity for a 6 to go, yeah, it will come, it‘s all
right. But if you‘ve got somebody in there going (yelling) Help! Everybody in there
gets that, they all start going crazy. They start banging the wall. Instantly in these
kinds of situations I say calm down, don‘t jump up and down, don‘t bang, it‘s all
right.
The potential wisdom of the 6 and you can see that before the mutative process the
6 ultimately was all about: do as I say, not as I do. And you have to see that in our
genetic history we‘re still suspicious of them. It‘s like, what do you mean, you‘re
telling me what to do, but I don‘t see you doing it. I don‘t see you living it. It‘s like
the Generator rushing up to you and saying I'm going to you what you need, live
your design. Yeah, right, you‘re crazy; you‘re not living yours. So one of the most
important things about this prevention is to see that basically this is all about getting
to the point where you finally can just live who you are.

The 6/3
LAC Prevention 2
I don‘t know what the 6/3 does here, because the 6/3 is looking at the 58th gate.
You‘re looking at the 58th gate and you know right away that you're about to enter
into one of the most collective processes. It‘s a very collective cross that‘s coming.
And then you look at that and you‘re the 10th gate and you come back to this
realization that over and over again you always have live within the collective
environment. And that behavior is ultimately either condoned or repressed by the
collective.
So, the 6/3, when it comes of the roof, has to be an example in the collective world.
That's not necessarily easy, because the collective says all behavior is set. This is
what the collective wants to do, set behavior. It‘s like this, this is behavior, this is an
old formula with the teacher/student, you're sitting there, and you‘re not jumping up
and down and screaming. There is a behavior in all of this.
You can see the different experimentations over the years about teachers and
students and how you interact and what behavior works. We have these norms that
are established. The 6/3 looks at all of that and say, wait a minute, wait a minute,
this is all hypocrisy. You're all doing what somebody else is telling you to do and
none of you are doing what's right for you. This is saving humanity from itself. And
I think that the 6/3s on the Cross of Prevention are the ones that get more martyred
that the 3/5s on the Vessel of Love.
In other words, there is a real punishment for them because they step right into it.
This is the whole thing about the 6/3 role model, they will blunder right into it. And
there they are right in the middle of some collective traditional standardized norm of
behavior and they come in and it's that kind of thing where everybody turns around
and stares at them all at the same time. They‘re not happy in the collective world.
They love being on the roof. They hate coming off.
You see that we have come to a place where—we‘re dealing with death in mutation,
always dealing with death as the end result. Why bother to come off the roof. Think
about it. If you‘re a 6 and you could really control it, you would not come off the
roof. You wouldn't. The most productive time economically for a 6 is when they‘re
on the roof. The most peaceful time in their life is when they‘re on the roof. That
aloofness, the power that comes, the fool on the hill, you can dispense your wisdom,
whether it's hypocritical or not, nobody gives a shit. You get paid for your hypocrisy:
do as I say, not as I do; put the check in the mail. Why would they want to come off
the roof and give up that?
So, what you get in mutation is most of the 6/3s throughout mutation all have this
kind of (sound) do I have to? And of course, it‘s not a choice. They're ripped off the
roof. And for them, it‘s the beginning of death. They see coming off the roof as
going downhill. They typical 6 that has some kind of a practice, and they struggle

and then they finally go up on the roof and slowly but surely their reputation builds,
they get more and more clients, they get this reputation and they write scholarly
books, and whatever. Then all of a sudden they have to come off the roof and
everything notices that all those years they were on the roof they were being
hypocrites. Oh, it's devastating. It's like everything goes into decline. People say,
I'm not going to go to that person anymore, they‘re full of shit. They don‘t live what
they were teaching me, this is terrible.
You have these people that wrote the great vegetarian diet book and then they go
into a steak house and they‘re sitting there eating a steak. They‘re off the roof.
They have a different frequency. You say, do you know what you did to me?
Twenty years of broccoli; you‘re going to die for this, twenty years of broccoli. You
set me up. Look at you, you‘re eating beef.
And they have nothing to save them in that because underneath is this martyr. They
get punished for it. So, 6/3s when there is this time to come off the roof you always
see them hanging by the eaves. They‘ve got their fingers holding on. It‘s like life
is—I don‘t want to go. They can get very depressed. The first time that they get
their hypocritical comeuppance is the first moment that they think, oh, this is awful.
It's better to be dead. You see them trying to crawl back up onto the roof again.

Introduction
This is the gate of aliveness, The Joyous; the Right Angle Cross of Service. If there
was ever a cross that could give you a pain in the neck, this is it. Whenever you see
a cross that has a definition you know that this is a deeply dynamic theme.
Obviously, everyone who has this cross has the definition. And this definition is the
18/58. We know what the 18/58 is. This is the cross of dissatisfaction. We can call
it what we like. We can call it the cross of service, but it is only of service if you're
born with it.
This is one of the most fascinating hexagrams there is not a single line here that you
grow into. You're either born with it or not; no development; it‘s there. You look at
the hexagrams; you‘ll see that it‘s very, very rare to see there's not a single blue
introduction in the who le thing. So, there's something very unique about the 58th
gate. The description of The Joyous is: Stimulation is the key to joy. Basta; nothing
else.
You can see that this is the gate that seeks life. I think the 58th gate is beautiful; it‘s
just unfortunate it‘s married to the 18. It‘s like these couples that you meet where
you meet one and then one day you meet the other one and you go, oh my God, I
like this one over here. How did you two get together? I look at the 58 and say are
you crazy? How could you fall for that 18? It doesn‘t make sense. You‘re full of this
joy and life and wonder and you have the 18 on the other side saying no, no, no, no.
It‘s one of those relationships I simply do not understand.

Look at that 1st line: Love of Life. The 18 is on the other side going, it‘s not
enough. How can I love life when my father is such a jerk? How can I love life when
I still have my mother telling me what to do? The 18 sort of jumps in there and it
puts its thumb on this joyousness. And the 58 doesn't care because it‘s not aware.
It keeps on pumping out the joy like a puppy. For me, the 58th gate is this wonderful
puppy. It‘s full of love and joy and laughter and there is this mean bitch that keeps
on beating it because it‘s shitting on the carpet. And the puppy doesn‘t care that it‘s
shitting on the carpet. It enjoyed the shit. It was wonderful; it felt good. And then
whack, whack and all of a sudden this little puppy goes, what did I do; the 58 puppy.
The Love of Life: The very stimulation of the world is the basis of an aesthetic
appreciation, blah, blah, blah. However, in the blah, blah business this is the
channel. So you can see what happens to the 58. It is a blessing that this thing is

not conscious, not aware, because if it really was, it would be so depressed. And it
isn‘t. It‘s this endless font of this energy, but you can't see this cross without seeing
the 18 with it. You just can't.
So, love of life feeds the zealot. Life would be wonderful if all you idiots would just
straighten up. That's what it becomes. Life would be full of joy it wasn‘t for all you
stupid people. And it‘s true. If you meet one of these that‘s exactly what they‘re
like. Judgment—this is the channel of Judgment. And only the collective has a right
to judge, and it does. No matter how much the individual rails against collective
judgment, it‘s there. The collective has a responsibility. We do not perfect our
patterns without critical attack. We
don't protect our patterns without
challenge. We don't. The very
Oedipus/Electra nature of the 18th
gate has shown us that in most
civilized societies, as we have
progressed, the relationship between
parent and child has changed. And
it's changed through those
challenges, generation after
generation after generation.
But for me, when I look at the 58 by
itself, I look at this gate and I think
wow that is such an amazing energy.
In the same way that the 41,
because they‘re mirrors, the 41 says
there are so many things we can do.
And the 58 says yeah, and we‘ll like
all of it. It‘s wonderful. I always
want the 58 and the 41 to get
together and create a new channel. The channel is every fantasy is joy in reality. It
would be a great channel. But instead, they both go to jerks. The 41 ends up with a
30 that says na na na na na naa. And the 58 goes over to the 18 and the 18 says,
what are you, a stupid puppy? It‘s not so easy.
It‘s like here in Ibiza, the locals. Not so much anymore, but in the past when you go
into a Latin country, these southern countries and rural countries, you get to see the
children are treated in a way that's really remarkable. They are exalted, loved, they
are given as much as the relative economics will allow, but all of that is, by the time
you get to a certain age you're going to have to work hard for the rest of your life.
You're going to have to work so hard. And you see these kids by the time they're 18
or younger in the old days, you suddenly seem them in the family business, they‘re
behind the counter, they‘re making the coffee, they‘re doing the work. They‘re
immediately into the burden and the relationship is different, instantly. You get your
little time for joy. You can be a puppy and we‘ll pat you as a puppy, but just
remember something; the time is coming when being a puppy doesn‘t work
anymore.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 4
A Digital Book for Students
So, when you're dealing with this cross you're dealing with people who love life and
hate people for fucking it up. It really is what it is. They love life, and they see that
life is ruined because people are incompetent or stupid or whatever the case may be.
And they want to fix it. It usually starts with: I could have a wonderful life if it
wasn't for my parents. It always starts with the dysfunctional Penta, it starts with
this, you come into the world and immediately you meet all of these forces that
control you, impact you.
What you get to see out of this Cross of Service is an old joke in that to be of service
for the other is rooted in being of service for oneself first. They want to be able to
love life, but from the collective perspective, you can only love life if everybody loves
life so you can share loving life. And of course, that's not the way of the world. So,
these beings are very judgmental and they try to bring an essential service. That
service is to awaken humanity to the potential of loving life if they get the pattern
right.
And there you get to the part of the collective that makes individual shiver, because
the collective says the love of life works this way. And you're going to do everything
we tell you to do. You‘re going to work the way we tell you to do. You‘re going to
live the way we tell you to do. You‘re going to behave the way we tell you to do.
You‘re going to do all of these things and if you follow the pattern that we give you,
you will end up being satisfied and you will love life. It doesn‘t always work that
way, obviously.

The 1/4
RAC Service 4
When you're dealing with the 1/3 and the 1/4 here you're dealing with real
dilemmas. The 58 that is a 1/3 gets to see that the only joy it's going to get out of
life is correcting other people. Think about that. The smile on a 18/58s face when
they're describing how stupid you are—it doesn't even have to be a smile, because
the smile is always there. They love telling you. They love it. They walk into your
really clean house and they see that one place where there is dust and they just love
to tell you. You want to strangle them because you know that they're enjoying it.
Now, the 1/4 doesn't enjoy it, but sees it as a burden. It's a burden. In other
words, I can't love life because you're the problem and so we‘re going to have to fix

RAC Service 4
Now we come to my favorite line: Perversion. What a great name for a line. It‘s
the kind of thing that makes you feel really good when you see it in your design.
There‘s no polarity, no exaltation: A genius for perversion. It‘s one of the best lines
I wrote. A genius for perverse stimulation that afflicts oneself and others by
promoting degeneracy and reducing joy to indulgence and decadence. The 1st line
has to study and in the study the 1st line realizes that joy is dependent on the quality
of the pattern, the nature of the pattern. If you have a pattern that eliminates
resistance it's easier to find joy in this life. There‘s no question about that.
But again, that's something that is natural to them because they will investigate
naturally. But when you're dealing with a 2nd line here they are born this way. And
for them the point is simply trying to find somebody to share joy with. That's the
perversion. Most people don't get that. It‘s perverse in terms of the way in which
collective judgment is supposed to work. The collective judgmental process is that
you judge the collective, change the collective by challenging them and in that way,
they will ultimately, in the logic sense, through the pattern find the joy.
The 2nd line says, I don‘t want to do all that work. All I want to do is find somebody
that enjoys what I enjoy and will share with me what I enjoy and does not want to
be of service. 2/4s never want to be of service. But every 2/4 wants to be able to
share their process with someone. This is the thing never to forget about them. No
matter how much it appears that on the surface they‘re trying to lock themselves or
cut themselves off, understand that they have a deeper need for the other than any
other profile.
They‘re waiting for the call. It‘s very important for them. Yet, it‘s so specific what
that call can be. And the real perversion is that you're not going to give this
incredible energy, this joyous energy to the collective as a whole. You're going to
keep this joy as energy for what you like and what you can share with those who like
with you.
The 2/4s on this cross or deeply resented. As much as we don't like the 18/58 we‘re
useless without them. After all, life is built on logical patterns. It just is. And
somebody better be watching the store. You really have to see that these patterns
are shifting in time with the evolutionary mutative process. There's always
somebody who has to keep their eye on the ball. We need these beings to be there.
I find that the perversion line is interesting because the 58.2 is the only collective
judgmental aspect that I like, because it is almost individual. It's like: I get a lot of
joy out of sniffing shoes. I‘m not going to teach the collective about this, but I‘m
going to get a lot of shoes and if I ever run into anybody who likes sniffing shoes we
can sniff together and we‘ll really get off on that. Because they realize right away as

a natural not everybody is going to understand this. Not everybody is going to
appreciate this is a pattern. I will just have my personal joy in this.
And the collective resents when the collective acts freaky. It‘s why I like the 2/4.
With the 2/4 you never know what's going to happen to them. That's why
perversion is so important to understand as a theme. It‘s not perverse in the way in
which it's used in the language. It‘s perverse collectively, because it's not there to
serve the larger collective at all. It‘s there to serve itself and share that with
somebody else. That‘s why the collective thinks this is perverse.
It‘s like people who have a lot of money. Logic is always looking for money. It‘s
always endlessly looking for money, money, money, money, money, money because
to get from theory to practice is very expensive. To be able to support research is
very expensive. Then you have this huge font of money. Remember that energy is
just another form. Money is a form of energy.
Think about the 58 as if it were a bank. There is this enormous resource here in this
bank. And the collective expects this money to be spent on good things. It expects
you to invest in theories that are going to benefit and be of service to humanity as a
whole. And that 58.2 says, yes, I do have a lot of money, but I'm putting my money
into shoes. What do you mean you‘re putting your money into shoes? I need your
money to save all these babies that are dying over here in Africa. No, no, no, I‘m
into shoes. Oh, the collective do not like this at all; no good, nada, out.

The 2/5 is allowed to be seriously perverse of this cross. I mean, seriously perverse.
You do not want to see what they do behind closed doors. You don't want to know
what turns these people on at all. You don‘t. Just the idea of it makes you shiver.
You really don‘t. You come to the 2/4, the 2/5 here and it‘s like they don't have any
real service for you unless you're particularly kinky and there may be something.
The other side of that humorous side is that this is a very healthy strain to be
running through the collective process. One of the things to recognize is that every
once in a while these perversities are not perversities at all, that it actually turns out
that that unique thing that was bringing that person pleasure is actually something
that can bring pleasure to the larger collective; not shoe smelling; but it could be
something.

album: electric vitality. This is the 3rd line. This is 3rd line beings. You really see
this. There is this incredible vitality in the 3rd line being. They need it. They need
more vitality than anybody else, because they meet more resistance than anyone
else. The individual whose electric vitality creates its own stimulation and is not
dependent on others; the energy to fuel independent stimulation. In other words, it‘s
the ability to infuse in other the potential for joy. And one of the things that the
collective tries to do is create collective joy experiences.
So, we have amusement parks, and we have the kinds of environments where you
try to bring the whole collectively in to have a pleasant experience. Disneyland is
the ultimate 3rd line service. You bring a little bit of joy into everybody's life. And
you get paid for it, which is a good 3rd line way. The quality of fire is dependent on
its fuel and subject to its influence good or bad. The energy for aliveness that is
dependent on others for stimulation. Now, everything about the 3rd line electricity is
about if you stimulate people they might find joy.
Think about the therapy that‘s in the 18 and you can see shock therapy through the
58. It would be nice always have the time to do zillions of little sidebars for you. I
always loved footnotes. I could put hundreds of footnotes to these things because
they‘re there. The deeper you meditate on any of these things; it's exactly what
really made a difference for me. I went to very long periods of just reading
hexagrams, just going into a hexagram and just wondering what's really there. The
superficial formula leads you in so many directions because it's an overview. We
already know that, the moment you see Color and Tone and Base you see that
everything is just a surface overview and to see the directions it goes in.
But one of the things to understand is that the shocking and stimulating of others is
also a way of trying to bring joy and to stimulate people and give them something
exciting to do is to bring back aliveness into their life. The one thing that I‘ll say
about 18/58s is that they may be critical, but they do at one time or another in any
given day look for a good time. When you know 18/58s you really know that about
them. As critical as they are, they‘re also looking for a good time in life. They need
the stimulation. When it becomes a problem is when the only good time they have
in life is giving somebody else a bad time, which is something they're quite good at
when they‘re not clear.
But it's very important for this cross to recognize that they are of real service when
they themselves are stimulated and feel alive. The 18 is afraid. It‘s a fear gate. It‘s
afraid of authority. It‘s afraid that patterns will close it off from the joy of life and its
opportunity to be satisfied. And everything for the collective logic is that the only
reward in life is to be satisfied. The 18 is afraid it'll never be satisfied because it
sees that it‘s so hard to make anything perfect. So, it needs to find ways to enjoy
itself in life. It needs to find ways beyond its capacity to see the lack of joy in life.
If you‘re going to be a 3/5 on this cross, your sense of aliveness can become deeply,
deeply depressed. The difficulty with the 18/58, like with most things that are
logical, is that timing is everything. I‘ve lived with an 18/58 for 22 years. So I‘ve
heard every kind of criticism that is possible. And there are certain things that I can
be criticized for that if I‘m criticized at the wrong time I don't listen and I can get to

a point of resenting it. It can take joy out of my life. But there's also times where
exactly the same criticism delivered at exactly the right time in the right tone works.
This is the whole thing about correction; the collective, particularly logical collective,
needs to be so aware of timing. And as we know, timing is not a construct that one
can control or set up. That the right timing for a collective being is simply operating
out of their strategy and authority. So, if you‘re a Generator with the 18/58, the only
time you can criticize is in response and then you'll see how powerful it is. And there
is no there is no struggle against that, no fight against that, no resistance. It may
not be light, but it will be taken. But the Generator that lives as a Manifestor, which
is most Generators, who will impose that 18/58 service on you all you want to do is
kill them. It‘s the wrong thing at the wrong time.
So, one of the keys in logic—we‘re dealing with the 5/15, we‘re dealing with being in
the flow, we‘re dealing with the timing, the rhythm to see that without the right
rhythm you lose the joy of life. I think that's one of the deepest things that we can
say about the Cross of Service is that it reminds us about something very profound,
that if we‘re in the right timing, if we‘re in the right rhythm, joy will be there for us
because we're all born with joy for living within us. And all that ever distorts that joy
is patterns that are not for us, rhythms that are not for us, timings that are not for
us, and so we never get to our place of perfection.

The 3/6
RAC Service 4
This line is really something incredible because in the detriment of the 3, electricity,
remember that‘s where we were, it says the quality of fire is dependent on the fuel.
And when you think about 3s, you begin to understand something very profound
about them is that their diet is so important. Something to recognize about this
electricity that one of the main conditioning factors is what are you putting in. It‘s
not just about food, because this is the surface. It's what you're putting it in terms
of the auras that you're taking in. Remember this is fundamentally collective. So
it's not just that it's what you eat in terms of food, it‘s what you eat in terms of
people, what you‘re bringing into your body in that way through your aura openness.
One of the real dilemmas for the 3/6 is that it can easily have its fingers burnt, and it
can end up with a great many problems in terms of their ability to maintain the
energy to love life. You know these people. They start off with this wonderful love
of life and then life punishes them so much that it's not that they hate life, they just
don't have the energy to even try to love life anymore. And that's very different.
There is a despair, a deep despair that's possible here in the 3/6.
Being of service—it is clear to me that part of what is to be of service is to make sure
that the fuel is always correct. If the fuel isn‘t correct, the work never really gets
done properly. It's also about movement in life. The kind of fuel that you need
determines where you go. If you need diesel you have to go to a certain place, if
you need gas you go to a different place. As with vegetarian or carnivore or any of

these many variations; the difference between what aisle you walk down when
you're looking for coffee or you're looking for tea, you‘re going to meet different
people in different auras on the way.
One of the interesting things to think about in terms of that we are always at risk of
being negatively conditioned all the time. And if you want to understand why the
18/58 is always so damn vigilant is because they know this better than anyone else.
The one thing that I've noticed in my own process with this channel is that I have
gone from a kind of dislike and annoyance to a great deal of respect and annoyance.
I can‘t get rid of the annoyance, but the respect is there. And it‘s clear to me why.
It's clear to me that inherent in the 18/58 is the only energy that the collective offers
that is truly beautiful. The 58 energy is so beautiful.
No matter what you look at here, you look at the detriment, it doesn‘t make any
difference, the energy out of the 58 is really so special. It's beautiful. And then you
have to see that at the very source of this long movement in the collective logic, to
get to a pattern that really works is fueled by this deep love of the process itself.
But the process is life. And it's always the 58 saying to the 18, lighten up. It's okay.
Don‘t take it so serious. Yes, we‘ll correct it, we‘ll fix it; relax. And this is the
constant tension.
3/6s always have dilemmas. It's the 3-3 phase. It‘s like the 6/3. But again, for the
2/6 they‘re really all alone in their process. Nothing is like that, because they never
get to escape the Personality pessimism. They don't. And the thing about the 3s
and you see it here in this context, is that in that 3-3 phase, what you‘re most likely
to do is put the wrong things into your body. And whether that is what you eat or
who you live with or who you make love to and on and on, this is going to be the
dilemma. What that does is it takes away your electric vitality.
It‘s this electric vitality that is the core of the collective life process. In the same
way that you don‘t want to kill the 41s fantasy, because it would take away all the
beauty of the life experience you don‘t want to take away this vitality, this electric
vitality of the 58 because it will take—logic is boring. It‘s boring work. Everybody
knows that. If you're into detail you know that the only thing that holds you to the
detail is the love of the subject. And if you didn‘t have a love of the subject you
could never tolerate doing all that detail work. And without this deep electric vitality
there isn't the energy to pursue the detail, the perfection.
It‘s like music for me. As an ego Manifestor when my mother would say to me,
practice the piano, I would just refuse on principle. I realized at a very early age
that I couldn't do with my fingers what I wanted to hear. And I lost the vitality.
Then you get to see something, that when I found something else that I loved—
years later the guitar and I played it every day for over 40 years I got to see the
magic of what that means to play the same song every day.
Some songs I played every day for about 20 years. When you play the same damn
song for 20 years in essence this is a boring ritual. It‘s the same thing. And yet, it
isn‘t. Because there is this vitality, this love of the process, the love of making the
music that you eventually see that this is the thing that powers that boring part, that

I love the relationship between the 1/3 and the 4/6. In the same way that I talk
about the 2/4 because I have a connection through harmony, I‘m a 5/1 that
whenever I look at the 4/6 I see this extraordinary book end to the 1/3. The 1/3,
the only profile that‘s lower trigram, the 4/6 the only profile that's all upper trigram
and then you look at that you think oh, they have a problem. They have a real
problem.
When you look at the 1/3, the only problem that they have is that they've got a deal
with being alone in life. The deepest moment for a 1/3 is the sudden recognition that
they are totally alone. The biggest dilemma for the 4/6 is that they‘ll never be left
alone. And they‘re never left alone. They never left alone and they do not have the
left angle advantage. They don't know why certain forces never leave them alone.
They don't even know why they're there in their network. They don't even know if
they'll ever be an opportunity out of those forces.
Here you have one of these keys because remember genetic continuity is one of the
most important things to grasp in Human Design. It means that wherever you look
you learn something about everything related to it. It‘s the magic. It‘s the magic of
being one synthesized chemistry. And when you're looking at this 4th line and you
see the line of Focusing, when you look at its exaltation it's says: the natural
specialization. We‘ll just stop there. This is really the 4. They are the natural
specialists—in what? The natural specialists in externalizing. And how? They
externalize with their networks. This is their theme.
You can see right away that because they're put into a position where they don't get
to play out the lower trigram self-absorption, learn something from your personal
destiny even though they have personal destiny. They don't see their life in terms of
personal destiny. They see their lives as a transpersonal phenomenon. The natural
specialization that when confronted with a multiplicity of stimulations will have no
inner difficulty in focusing on the appropriate influence. The energy to fuel
recognition of which stimulation is of value.
The other side is impressionability; energy which becomes unstable when over
stimulated. Right away you understand the dilemma of any 4th line being. It‘s why I
talk about this ―don't leave a lover until you have another lover.‖ Well, you don't
have the energy to do both. You don‘t have the energy to leave the lover and then
go looking for one. You don‘t have the energy for it. You‘ve got to wait, you wait;
don‘t leave a lover until you have another lover, because you don't have the energy
to do both.

The Joyous
Where you really see this is not so much in that, because that‘s not the biggest
commonality for them. The biggest commonality is don‘t leave a job until you have
another job. And here is where you see real dysfunction on the mundane plane
because they will leave the job, and then they don't understand how they can‘t get
another one, or they don't understand how they can‘t get another one that was as
least as good as the last one. It‘s a very, very specialized energy.
The other thing is that you have to understand something about their network. The
reason that you have to wait is that a new network has opened up before you can
shut down an old one, otherwise, you don‘t have the energy. So, if you leave your
job and you don't have another job and you finally manage, if you can, to get
another job, you have this enormous effort to create a new network. It just doesn't
work as well.
So, everything about the 4 is the focusing. Now of course, the end result of this is it
comes back always to the simple in Design, you follow your authority, you follow
your strategy, whatever that happens to be, because it's the only way in which
you're going to develop this natural specialization that will avoid being over
stimulated, and will not have this ability to be able to focus. Remember, this is, after
all, the 58/18. It‘s the whole channel. This is the fueling force of this. But it says
something about the completion of the right angle process. The completion of the
right angle process is this electric vitality, this love of life, this perverseness. It‘s
very important, this perverseness.
Remember that there is no real development in the collective if all the energy is put
to the same task. If everybody who was interested in finding a cure for cancer was
working in the same factory we wouldn't get a cure. You have to have those little
perverse corners where somebody says I‘ve just discovered that melted
snowflakes—whatever the case may be. The 4/3s have the tendency to invest in the
wrong networks when they're young. And then they abandon those networks at
their roof phase and then they struggled deeply to establish a new network. It‘s a
constant dilemma for them.

Of course, the thing about 4/1s is that normally they have such a narrow tunnel.
But the 4/1 here is over stimulated. It‘s just over stimulated, and I assume that it
has to do with a much deeper problem. This is a transition profile. It‘s going to
have the Design 1st Color, which means that they‘re going to be open to a lot of
different maladies. And many of the problems that they will confront are problems
that are going to tap into their vitality control mechanism.
Remember, the 4 is very good at controlling energy. They have to be. Most of us
never have to maintain the networks that a 4 maintains. I couldn‘t imagine how to
do that. It‘s why I have a lot of 4s in my life who maintain networks relative to me.
As a 1 I understand it. I respect the process. But I also recognize that they have a
tremendous gift of being able to
parcel out their energy.
Why do you think that they‘re not
available to you as anything other
than a brother or a sister? They‘ve
parceled out so much energy in
maintaining their network that
they can‘t give you everything of
themselves. They can‘t. It‘s not
their fault. It‘s not like they
wouldn‘t like to get rid of that
brother/sister barrier and focus all
their energy into being your lover,
your friend, whatever the case
may be. They‘re not built that
way. If they did that they would
lose everything.
You see this, not-self, watch the
4s, they‘re hanging out with the
crowd—high school, teenagers—they‘ve got their crowd, they‘ve got their network
and all of a sudden they fall in love and they abandon their network. The
consequences of that are terrible for them. And the network they left behind really
resents it. They don‘t invite you to anything, they don‘t want you to participate in
anything, you‘ve left them, and you‘ve abandoned them.
Some of them you wouldn‘t even consider friends that you would have cared about,
but 4s never recognize, because they‘re not left angle, how deep their network goes
and how many people at the secondary tertiary levels are impacted by that network
and need that network to be in place.
Obviously, that when we‘re dealing with vitality you also have to see that the
underlying thematic has moved away from the 17 and the 18 so you don‘t have this
definition and it has moved into what is part of ultimately will be the Cross of
Tension. That is, the 21 and the 48. And you can see that this is a very powerful
controlling mechanism. The 21 tries to control everything because that‘s its job.
Most people resent that about 21s. But after all, they were put on Earth to be God‘s

servants. They‘re here to control everything including whether you breathe or not.
That‘s their job.
So, the moment that you get this underlying 21 here you have this energy being
applied all over the place and this vitally turns out to be people who just collapse.
Again, this is one of the things to see about the whole thing about the 4 process is
that you have to be very, very careful with the 4 process. You have to see that the
network is everything and you have to use the energy very carefully and you have to
really know how to invest your energy properly. And when you‘re going to change
anything wait, let change come.

with demands in one way or another. If they would ask me what kind of conditions I
would accept to go to heaven, I would insist that there are no 21s there. My idea of
heaven is no 21s. My idea of hell is everybody's got the 21. Anyway, so Defense:
The natural and practical instinct to protect oneself regardless of temptations. The
fuel for self-defense regardless of simulations. This has the potential of turning this
very, very vital energy into
something that is very angry and
able to give deep punishment. The
48th gate is the gate of black magic.
It‘s a gate of darkness. It's the
well. You look into a well and you
see nothing. This is the well. It‘s a

know what's bubbling underneath.
The 21st gate is a gate of deep
control. And on this cross it is
hidden underneath this Sun in The

what I say and shut up. It‘s like; I thought you were the joy of life. Yeah, it would
be if you did what I told you to do and everything would be fine. And if you don't
do—threats.
Everything about the 5th line of the 58 is threats. I‘ve a 5th line Personality. Oh, do I

you never respond you're never going to find love. Whoa, heavy threat. And it
works. It‘s the nice thing about it. And this is called defense. It‘s all a lie.
This is defending yourself against the stupidity of others that won't listen to reason.
I‘m telling you, if you want to enjoy life it‘s so simple. Do what I tell you to do and
then everything is going to be terrific. And you‘ll leave me alone at the same time.

after all. And this is not your typical collective. The thing I respect about the
collective is that it doesn't tell you what to do until it's explained and gone through
things and you understand. It corrects your mistake and explains why it's a mistake.
It's sharing. It may be annoying, but they go to an effort to fill you in. And the 5th
line is not interested in all that work. It takes up so much energy.
The defense here is that they‘re trying to protect their energy. If you've got the
energy for the love of life, the last thing on earth you want to do is waste it on a lot
of dreary, dull, sad, messy people. For the 5th line it‘s not possible. And with this
21-48 underneath, can they ever put the buzz in you and not only that, it‘s left
angle. They know you. But the 5/2, what to do with 5/2s; these are the kind of

There is a caution for the 6th line: getting Carried Away. It‘s one of the things about
the 6. I always have this image of these people where you have these very funny
old movies of people who try to invent ways to fly. You always see them on these
buildings where they've got fake wings on and they‘re on little bicycles or things, and

they launch off and sink like a stone. The tendency of the 6 is the assumption that
on the roof, that the roof is leading them to heaven. It‘s like their goal at the end of
the roof stage is that suddenly an elevator appears and they have to go up, not
down, getting further aloof. I know how to get beyond objectivity. I‘ll get beyond
everything up here in the sky overlooking things. Everything 6th line being wants to
be God and they have a great deal of difficulty admitting it. But they do tend to get
carried away.
This is about integrity. The instinct to draw back when its independent integrity is
threaten. Now, what is the integrity here? The integrity is the resource of the fuel in
this pressure center; the fuel for life, the fuel of vitality. Now, the whole thing about
them is that they don't want to give anybody that. Basically they don‘t want to give
it to anybody. They go through the 3-3 stage, they see that getting carried away,
because they do when they're young, getting carried away costs them so much. And
they don't want to come off the roof.
Now remember for a 6 not coming off the roof is death. They don‘t want to die. I
hope you got that. For the 6s when they reach their Kiron a lot of them have
problems, particularly in the early years right after the Kiron, because they see that
it's all going to deteriorate now. They have to go back into the world; they have to
go back into the form principle. And the form principle is decaying. While they're on
the roof they have this illusion that they're above everything. And they do. And they
can get carried away with this ―I am above everything,‖ only to discover that the
forces are going to drag them down to the earth.
It reminds me of one of the strangest dreams ever had—and I don‘t remember
them—it was a dream that I had when I was young in my 20s. I had wings and I
was flying. I was flying about some beach somewhere, and all of a sudden I realized
that there was a drag on me. And I was working harder and harder to fly. Then I
looked down and there was a rope around my feet and it was going down to the
beach and there were all these little ant-like—they were humans but from that
height were all these people pulling me back down to the earth. It was a very
frightening dream to wake up from. I did not like that. And this is a 58.6 dream.
They don‘t want to be pulled down to the earth.
Underneath the role model potential of any 6 is the fear of what it means to take on
the responsibility of being a role model. Most 6s would rather be hypocrites. It‘s
safer. To be a living example of anything is an enormous challenge. And the 58.6
knows what that costs in energy, the vitality to live your uniqueness, the
requirements are enormous. It's so easy for them to lose their identity. This is the
whole thing about the 58.6. In the first 28 years of their life they can so easily lose
their identity and not have that vitality for their own unique process.

RAC Demands 2
It‘s particularly true for the 6/3. Again, in always having to do with the 3/6 or the
6/3 it‘s a mountain to get over this the first 28 years, to deal with Saturn. Saturn's
heavy. For the 3/6 and the 6/3 this is an enormous task just to get there. And so
many of them, given that they're here to be vital, that it‘s their vitality that is tapped
into when they're young, the basic energy that they need for their growth and
maturation and all these other things are lost when they're young.
I have this interesting feeling about this gate. It‘s a Capricorn gate, and it is a gate
of the most essential vital fuel—the fire. And I always think of the 58th gate as a
volcano, because that's really what it is for me, it's a volcano. It's a volcano that can
comfortably release its steam without creating any problems. Or it's constantly
spewing lava and killing people and destroying land and whatever. It‘s this very,
very powerful force. It's a mechanism for the release of the deepest energy in a
human being. There is no deeper force in a human than what's coming out of the
58th gate.

Introduction
The 38, the gate of the fighter, Opposition: The ability to preserve individual
integrity through opposition to detrimental forces. So you know right away what a
38 will fight for, it will fight for its way, it won‘t fight for anything else. It‘s not going
to fight for you. It‘s not going to fight for its country. It‘s not going to fight for its
species. It fights for itself and only for itself. And it fights for its own unique
integrity.
What's the integrity of the 38? What is that really all about? In the 1st line, all 1st
lines teach us the essential truth; the line of Qualification. What is it fighting for?
It‘s fighting for the attunement that guarantees proper action. It‘s the only thing
individuality ever seeks. After all, the collective will manipulate behavior where
individuality can‘t. Behavior is built into the individual process, this demand for
uniqueness.
The other thing is that the 38th gate is one of deafest of all gates. Most people fight
with 38s to get their attention, not that they‘re fighting about something. It‘s just
―hey I‘m here‖ trying to knock on their heads. Psychic is a funny word and you
certainly don't see this in lines. And here you have it in the 38th gate. At the very
basis of the fight you have: A psychic attunement that guarantees proper action. A
psychic attunement? What the hell is that?
And here you begin to see that the 28/38 has a magical power. Nothing else can
make integration human. Somebody like me who‘s integration, the moment the 28s
or 38s or 28/38s are in my life they bring out my humanity. Integration always
looks forward and for itself. And the moment a 28 or 38 is present, integration is
forced to turn around and say ―you okay?‖ It‘s just forced to; psychic attunement.
It is all about something basic that the 38 understands that integration has. It‘s not
afraid of tomorrow. And if it's not afraid of tomorrow, how does it do that? It does
that by finding its archetype of perfected form in the now. And the 38 wants in. ―I
want some of that, too.‖ And it has the power to do it, which is why it has this
amazing base. It knows what integration to hook into, and the advantage is that it
doesn't lose its unique identity because it is linking into something that's even more
selfish and unique than it is and pulling it around.

The 1/3
This tension, we‘re on the Cross of Tension, I love this cross. I love it because this is
the only cross that‘s really of service. We‘ve already seen what the Cross of Service
is about. This is really a cross of service. It pumps up so many things because that
is what it‘s intended to do. The 21 says to the 45, you do your job. The 48 says to
the 16, you do your job. The 38 says to the 28, you do your job. And that‘s the big
one here, find my purpose, find my
purpose because we‘re dying, you
idiot. Really, the 28 knows that. The
28 is the gate of the fear of death.
It‘s the deepest fear of death gate we
have. And the 38 says, stop worrying
about dying, let's have something
worthwhile to live for. And the 28
says, I can throw it this way, we can
try this. And it‘s only when they align
to integration they say, hey they
seem to know what it's about
because they‘re not afraid. Why
aren‘t they afraid?
So, when you're dealing with a 38.1
this is all about deep, deep inside the
38, all it wants to be able to do is find
right action. In the Martian
detriment, this tendency to oppose as
a general rule, you can tell me to do
hundred things and I might listen to one. This is the nature of individuality. The 38
will oppose as a general rule. It will. The whole thing about it is that it's only
interested in one thing: Where‘s the right action. And it is the source of the power of
intuition. So there is something in the 38 always knows, no that‘s not the way, no
that‘s not the way, no that‘s not the way. The Cross of Tension is dependent on
what they bring tension to to resolve their lives. That 38 waits for the 28 to get the
movie right; bless the 28.

channel is a channel, but the 38 will stick with things, they‘ll stick with their
resistance to things. They don‘t like to listen.
It was my old joke about a 38. You‘re standing on a street corner, a 38 steps into
the street and you see a car is coming and it‘s going to hit them, and you pull them
away and they turn around and they say, don‘t you ever do that again, who the hell
are you. I just saved your life. Don‘t do that again. Whoa, they are not here to
take just anything from anyone. They aren‘t. They‘re waiting for something special.
They‘re waiting to see if there's a way to get the purpose.
The 28/38s are very fortunate when they have the definition, regardless of how
other people feel about that; and them, because they have to go through this
struggle aspect in life which on the mundane plane seems to be quite annoying. But
the fact is, at least when they have the whole thing there is—any 28/38 that you
ever meet you will see that they have worked all their life on right action. You listen
to their life story and you will see all their life they have struggled with trying to find
right action. It is their deepest theme. But when you're 38 alone and you're waiting
for 28s to empower you, that's quite a journey because it's a risk, they‘re a risk. On
the other side you get everything from not being able to take a risk to taking the
dumbest risks.

The 2/4
RAC Tension 4
Politeness: Opposition that does not transgress normal codes of behavior. The
value of discretion, or the energy for over politeness. What is that old expression—
discretion is the better part of valor. Basically the 38.2 when they're at their most
polite is informing you of how useless you are to them. Understand that. This is not
niceness, this is not humanistic, it's not any of those things. The 38s attract
violence. And I don't just mean physical violence, but verbal violence. They do. It
is clear when you feel their aura that you know that they are fighters. It doesn't
have this name for nothing.
So you must be very suspicious about a 2/4 on this cross, or any 2/4. Think about
the 2nd line theme and recognize that built into the 2nd line theme is politeness.
Now, politeness is a strategy. It's a strategy for protecting your integrity. It‘s a
strategy for being able to preserve your energy for the right action. So when you
have somebody who has this line and they are being polite, what's really going on
inside of them is ―I‘d like to take this son of a bitch by the throat and hang them.‖
But what they‘re really saying is, ―could you please pay your bill.‖ They don‘t want
to waste their energy on what happens if they let go of what they really have inside.
It‘s not worth the fight. It's not.
As a matter of fact, the interesting thing about the 38.2 is that it will completely lose
this the moment that right action is there. In other words, if right action truly
demands that they shed their politeness they actually will, but they have to be in the
right action. The deepest concern of the root gates pointed at the Spleen is not
misusing the energy, not wasting the energy. That's why when you see people that

have all three channels defined, and it‘s surprising how many times you get to see
that, is that these beings need to exercise, because they repress so much energy
waiting for the right action that they end up with enormous problems, usually water
retention, and need to have the exercise to get this energy out.
In other words, when you're looking at the 58 or you're looking at the 38 or you're
looking at the 54 understand something, this is energy being restrained waiting for
the right thing. And this 2/4 is a classic example, because when the fighter is polite
you really know that they're just trying to be left alone. They don‘t want to engage
in the struggle. 2/4s don‘t like the struggle. We know that, they don't want to learn.
It‘s a bitch when they're called out. They have to be responsible for all that; the
whole movie.
I had that for many years, particularly with 28/38s and you get the not-self 28/38
and if they‘re 2nd line and you ask them about the struggle in their life they basically
tell you that it really hasn't been a struggle. The wasting of energy is what is so
depressing for the 28/38. When you see these beings they waste so much energy in
their struggle. ―Where are the keys? Where the hell did I put the keys?‖ And then
they get upset that they can't remember the keys. Well, maybe they've got
Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's is coming and then they go looking for the keys and they
can‘t find the keys and they get really angry or frustrated or bitter or disappointed
and on and on. In the meantime, that whole business of trying to find the damn
keys has taken up an enormous amount of energy.
Anytime you end up wasting energy, if you're coming out of these root gates then
the consequences is that you don't get to the right action. You don‘t. It always
amazes me that struggle people don't have their mundane things organized in such a
way that they remember where everything is. If you know that you always misplace
the keys and you go through the horrible struggle of dealing with that, why don't you
just invent a place in your house were you always put the keys. It's so fucking
simple. It is. And then you always know where they are. And they don‘t do that.
It‘s really incredible because the not-self of that is that at least it seems that they're
trying to find their purpose in a very perverse way. And remember, 2nd lines carry
perversion as an underlying theme.

2/5s are very polite. They‘re incredibly polite. And their politeness is so vicious that
you don't want to deal with them; it‘s vicious. They make people want to fight with
them out of being so polite. It's so difficult to deal with these people because not
only are they so polite but there is this smile on their face. It doesn‘t even have to
be visible. It‘s this smile that you know that this politeness means nothing. It‘s
infuriating to the other person. And for the 2/5 it‘s this great protection, enormous
protection. They‘re suspicious of why you're there anyway. They don't want to waste
their energy of you. They sure as hell don‘t want to engage in a fight with you. And
they're really, really, really good at being so polite. And people get so angry with
them.

The typical 2/5 reaction to all of that is that you go deep into your retreat; your
passenger retreats deeply and your body just becomes paranoid. You always get
what you don't have; you always meet what you‘re pointed at. The 38 is always
going to meet the 28, it's always going to be there. The 28/38 is always going to
meet integration; it‘s built in. After all, it's good for them and good for integration,
it's part of the process. So, one of the things about the nature of this whole
politeness business is that the more polite they are, the worse it gets for them.
It‘s the confusion of the not-self that purpose is the same as right action. And it isn‘t.
In other words, the behavior code, that if you can find the right behavior, this is right
action so to be polite, for example, becomes the right action, but it's not. It‘s not a
right action at all. It‘s just a way of being deaf. It‘s one of the many ways that the
38 is deaf.

The 3/5
RAC Tension 4
My favorite is the 3. This is one of those individual lines in a deeply individual gate
that is odd. Alliance: The ability to sustain through integration with similar forces,
thus ensuring the vitality to persevere. The energy to integrate with others in times
of struggle, or selfish alliance that saps the energy of one’s partners in order to
ensure personal vitality. The energy to selfishly use others in times of struggle. It is
rare that you find in individuality a line that is so deeply concerned at a lower trigram
level about dealing with and working with the other. And it's the similar force that‘s
a real key here.
You have to understand something about the 38 and ultimately the 28/38 process.
Remember something that when you're talking about the Cross of Tension, you
cannot talk about it unless you talk about the four gates that the tension is being
brought to, because that's their fulfillment in life, their proper fulfillment in life.
What you‘re dealing with here is the need and the recognition that the 38 needs the
28 to begin the process of discovering right action and once the 28/38 is at work to
find the integration to form the relationship that works one for the other.
After all, when the 28/38 turns the head of integration, it does take their energy for
their own benefit. It does. These things do not have to be grasped in the context of
positive and negative. It‘s very unhealthy, as a matter of fact, to see them that way.
It‘s not about that. The negative here, the detriment, the selfish alliance, any 28/38
hooking up with integration is a selfish alliance. But then again, they‘re both selfish
anyway. And the fact that you turn integration‘s head that it gives you that line to
the Throat doesn‘t mean that it loses its selfishness. It's being pressured. The
tension is being pressured to do that. And yes, the 28/38 takes its advantage, but
that‘s the deal.
By the way, it doesn‘t hurt integration. For integration to know something about
humanness is an advantage. The other thing is that it brings a heightened intuition
to the whole process. So this alliance in the 3 also says a great deal about the way

Opposition
3s meet life. They will take advantage of the other. Again, that's not a negative.
It‘s how you learn. It‘s how experience is discovered. It‘s how you move through the
plane. Not only that, when you discover what's wrong you can take advantage of
that knowledge and gain materially from the other who doesn't know and save them
from their struggle.
By the way, this is one of those Sun/Earth lines—Sun exalted, Earth in detriment.
It‘s always interesting because you know it really fixes the cross. This particular
variation as a 3/5 you‘re going to have a fixed exaltation of the Sun so this whole
energy to integrate with others is going to be the dynamic force of the line of this
cross. 3/5s get burnt in their connection to the other. This is really dangerous for
an individual, and remember something about all of this process, individuality is
melancholic. You‘ve got a difficult chemistry that's at work here. Struggle that
doesn't lead to right action, that doesn't lead to the elimination of the fear of
tomorrow, becomes deeply depressive.
With the 3/5 because of the projection on the 5, they learn very early in life that
alliances are dangerous. They are. I'm a real deep integration person and one of
the great teachings of my role as a messenger in Design was to give up on judging
my allies. This was an enormous step for me to stop seeing alliances in the context
of good and bad, but simply seeing them as alliances; nothing else. That's quite a
step for the 3/5 to make. They learn very early in life that their alliances are
negative processes. They do; they make mistakes and the projection field that
comes back on them is you‘re a struggler and you cause problems for me and I don‘t
want to work with you ever again and you really messed up my time and they really
get a lot of abuse.
Every 3/5 we lose is the potential of somebody that can change the world. And I‘ve
said this over and over and over again. I am so astonished by their potential and so
amazed by how of all the profiles they‘re the most disadvantaged. I don't know
more disadvantaged profile on the mundane plane of ignorance. So much potential
is lost. It‘s very difficult. And here you can see that the alliances that could be
universalized, alliances that will allow for the ability to overcome the detriments that
are there in life to find a way in which one illuminates the fears of life, to find the
form, the perfection. It‘s great stuff. We don't get it from them.
What we get is their pain. All 3s live with pain. It doesn't matter whether they're
awake or not, you cannot be a 3 and be without pain in your life. You can‘t. There
is always this sadness that life is full of things that are so displeasing, whether
they‘re personal or not you get to see them. You see the difficulty of the mundane
plane, you see where other people see hope, you see hopelessness. And it's always
there. It doesn't mean that you're lost in that, we know that, but that's your starting
point. And 3/5s on this kind of configuration where they cannot empower the other
to take them to that place, oh is that ever depressing. This is Don Quixote, you end
up fighting windmills. You end up fighting things that don't matter that you fight
them, you fight ghosts of the past and all kinds of stuff.

The 3/6
RAC Tension 4
If the alliances that they form when they're young don't kill them, these are tough
beings. But the 6th line being has an advantage that other beings that don't have
the 6th line can't ever have. There is a natural progression in life that is self evident.
That is, there is this tripartite process in life that carries with it an inherent transition
in behavioral patterns. You're very different when you're in the world in your first
Saturn cycle and you're on the roof in the interregnum before Kiron. And one of the
things about that is that it gives you a kind of transition in action that seems like this
may be finally your purpose unfolding. Anyone who escapes the first Saturn cycle as
a 6, the very escape seems to be a reward. Just the (releasing air sound), and for
the first 10 years that (releasing air sound) means everything. It‘s like that‘s the
reward, that's what it was all about. I got out of the shit, it‘s okay. But it‘s not the
reward. It‘s just the beginning of a process.
So, the 3/6 will always have that opportunity sometime in its process, if it gets in
any healthy way through that first part, the very going up on the roof even if it's
temporary—3/6s will bounce back and forth—even if it‘s temporary will give them
the sense of okay, I'm going to be better now. It's going to be better. It can‘t get
worse. That is the mantra of the 3/6 on this cross. It can't get worse. When they
get to be 30 it's like (releasing air sound), it can‘t get worse. It can only get better.
But they don't say, by the way, it can only get better, it‘s inferred. It can‘t get
worse. And then they're open to that possibility, they always are.
After all, the 38 on the Cross of Tension waits for that very, very special mutative
experience. The being satisfied, being without struggle, being transformed, these
are the themes of the Root to the Spleen they‘re all very mystical, by the way. They
carry with them their own quality of transcendence. And every 38 is waiting for that
potential transcendence and the transcendence for them is at least there‘s something
to struggle for. At least there's something to work at that will give me what I need—
freedom from the fear of tomorrow. You cannot imagine how deep that is in their
psyche.

be based on trust. Thank you. The energy to recognize who can be of value in
times of struggle. Here is where you see their networking, who can help me get to
my purpose. Who can help me get to the opportunity? It‘s the same thing. This is
the 4 and they are detectives.
It‘s not like you can just be part of their network. It seems like that, but not
everybody gets into their network. After all, they're not for strangers. They build
their very, very select network. There is an aggressiveness, this is the Martian
detriment. This is a very interesting one because it‘s a Pluto/Mars, Pluto exalted and
Mars in detriment. The aggressiveness in opposition that prejudices investigation
and limits trustworthiness. The power of adrenaline to provoke aggressiveness.
Strugglers have a tendency of making mistakes and not in the 3rd line sense. If they
were 3rd line it would be okay, because that‘s their nature. But the dilemma for the
4/6 because they live out that 3 theme is that when they make that mistake, when
their analysis says this force is the force that is going to help me and it doesn‘t work,
aggressiveness is what comes out. And for me, the 4/6, this cross, the end of this
Cross of Tension, this is the ultimate blaming line. Oh, blame, blame, blame, blame,
blame, blame, blame, always blame. They know; so they think. They know who's to
blame. The reason they‘re still afraid of tomorrow is because you couldn't do your
shit, you couldn‘t do your thing. You couldn't get me to this place; you couldn't get
me to that place.
This is not a natural thing for individuality. I hope you sense that. It‘s very
unnatural. But the 38 has a difficult situation. It has to maintain its unique integrity
and you can see the pressure is there. But at the same time, it can't do it alone.
And it's not enough to get to the 28. That‘s only the beginning. They have to be
able to provoke the 28 to find some 57. It‘s really quite a thing. So it's like the 38
has this very confused—it‘s why there's a lot of funny energy in them because it's a
confused thing. ―I'm an individual, I'm a freak, don't tell me anything, I don't want
to hear anything, but help me.‖ That just doesn‘t seem to make sense.
So, when you‘re dealing with a 38.4, particularly a 4/6, it‘s like, ―okay I‘m going to
try this and when it doesn‘t work I hate you, you‘re stupid, I want to kill you. It‘s
your fault.‖ Of course, they‘re really angry with themselves. ―I wasted my energy, I
trusted these people, this was a terrible thing, and they never should have been in
my network.‖ But instead, they put it out. And they put it out very powerfully
because it's a very powerful adrenal gate and they put that energy out. Whenever
we think about the 4/6s we always assume that networking is something that's
natural and always works. Well, these are beings that can really destroy their own
networks. They get so angry.

The 4/1
The power of adrenaline; when you get to the juxtaposition cross and you leave
behind the 48-21, you end up with the 51 and the 57. So, you end up with the gate
of shock, but you end up the miracle gate that the 38 is actually looking for. The
57th gate is the potential awareness to deal with the fear in the now. And the only
thing missing is that 28.
So when you get to this
Juxtaposition Cross of Opposition
there is this tendency in the 4/1 to
always try to skip the 28. Now,
think about if you have this as a
definition. If you're a 28/38 and
you‘re on the Juxtaposition Cross of
Opposition, your 38 doesn‘t like
your 28. And of course, the 57 is
going to be there. What happens is
that there is an internal struggle
whether or not to accept the
intuition. It‘s a totally different ball
of wax, but that goes into individual
analysis, so we'll leave that for a
moment.
But, nonetheless just keep in mind
what's underneath here—the 51
and the 57. This is a very shocking force. And because this 38 can be aggressive,
whoa; and they can be aggressive in very subtle ways, because the 57, The Gentle,
is the very gentle breeze that sneaks in behind your neck and gives you pneumonia.
You have to be very, very careful with the 57. There‘s nothing sneakier in the way in
which power can be used. That's why you have that special arrangement that the 57
has with the 34. This is the only splenic gate that can really handle power.

The 5/1
This is one of my favorite bizarre delicious crosses and we get to the Left Angle Cross
of Individualism, this is the ultimate freak cross: The ability to preserve individual
integrity. Well, when you're dealing with the Left Angle Cross of Individualism they
have their own maya. They have their own maya, you don't belong to it; you really
don‘t. Nobody belongs to it. As a matter of fact, they are so individual that they
assume that everyone should be like them. They are impossible. This is the line of
Alienation. It‘s like me, a freak, you
come into the world and you sit in
front of all these straight people and
you say, look, give it up, be freaky,
give it up. It‘s really good to be
freaky. And they say, well, I‘m
straight. And you say, I know, be
freaky. And they say, yeah, I‘m
straight and I can‘t help it. And they
say that‘s a real problem you have
there.
The Left Angle Cross of Individualism
is so funny because they‘re
wandering around in the world and
they wonder what happened
evolution because the world doesn‘t
operate the way they should and it's
very frightening because these beings
don't just come with a cross, they
come with a design. So, whatever
their design is, that‘s supposed to be the pattern of the world. And everybody is
supposed to be like this, and then they wonder why they‘re alienated. Nobody is like
them; nobody in their right mind would want to be like them.
That stage in opposition when one is totally isolated. What underlies the heretic is
that the heretic is always totally alone. You are isolated as a heretic. You have to
be isolated as a heretic; otherwise, you bring nothing different. The thing about
these beings is that many of them will incarnate and not have enough individuality in
their characteristics, and they end up being very disturbed people because their
cross is so freaky. This is a very old line. If you go from the 39 in Cancer to the 38
in Capricorn, you're actually following the trajectory of our solar system in space
towards the center of our galaxy. Cancer represents the past. Capricorn represents
the future. The pure line of individuality, like the line that runs through the center of
the bodygraph, runs from Cancer to Capricorn.

So here we're looking at a kind of central individual theme that holds to the center
that is going along for the ride into the future. But alienation is their theme and
from the outside it‘s one thing, from the inside it can be very, very uncomfortable.
On one side is ambition and the concentration to endure. That is, the energy to
stubbornly fight alone. Now isn‘t this cute? You go from the right angle, individual
gate, the right angle says, oh I need others, I need others. You get to the left angle
that is transpersonal and it says I don‘t want anybody, I don‘t want anybody.
You can understand how confused this gate is. It's important to recognize that. This
is an enormous adrenal energy and it doesn't know what to do. It doesn't know
what it's about. It doesn't know whether it should reach out to others. It doesn't
know whether it should just try to go it alone. It doesn't know what to do. It's not
aware.
The Plutonian side is not nice: Alienation experienced as painful confinement that by
its very nature blinds one to the possibility that there those at some point who may
come to one's aid. What a criteria—the possibility that there are those at some point
who may come. It‘s like, dream on baby, you‘re going to be alienated forever.
You‘re alone. You‘re fucked up, you‘re alone, stay there. Nobody over here notices.
What to do.
Imagine that you‘re a 5/1 on this cross and this is what you're putting out and are
you suspicious of people. Everybody is weird. It‘s like they‘re all crazy, everybody.
The straightest, cleanest—they‘re really weird, they‘re all weird. They‘re all weird
because they‘re not like me. Why aren‘t you like me? If you were like me
everything would be perfect. And the fact that you‘re not like me means that you
have a problem, you're sick and stay away. So they don't make a lot of friends. It‘s
just not the way that it works.

They really isolate themselves. These are children you can‘t get out of the womb, let
alone out of their room. I‘m not joking. These are the kind of children where you're
inducing birth after the 12th month. ―Come out now.‖ ―No, no, no I don‘t want to

I don‘t even know how you would possible nurture—I‘ve never met one of these, so I

But the fact that they‘re all different from you is a totally different perspective.
There is this great fear that no only can you not fit in there, nor do you want to, but

LAC Individualism 2
I love the 6 of this. It‘s all been a Misunderstanding. I love that. I really do. It
has nothing to do with individuality. No individual would ever say that. It‘s all been
a misunderstanding; opposition without basis. Eventual—I like that—eventual
crystallization which clears up misunderstandings. Now, if you‘re on the Left Angle
Cross of Individualism, basically the only way that crystallization takes place is that
the world behaves like you.
Don‘t ever think that this misunderstanding is your misunderstanding if you're
carrying the 38.6. It‘s their misunderstanding. It has nothing to do with you. You
can‘t tell these people that they didn't get it. They‘ll kill you. You can‘t do that with
them. They see that it's all about misunderstanding and it's all about you
misunderstood them. ―You don't understand my example. You haven't followed my
example and therefore you just misunderstood. Everything should be like me, not
like you.‖ It‘s spooky.
The other thing is to understand that this is a quality that's in every 6th line being.
After all, this is the deepest strain of individuality. And in every 6th line being is this:
―My example, you're going to question my example? I am the example. You
misunderstood.‖ And it‘s always the other, always. The 38th gate has so many
mixed up themes. It has all these mixed up themes because the 38th gate never
really—because it's not awareness—never gets to understand that it has to have
others to find its purpose. It can‘t get there by itself no matter how much pressure it
can put anywhere.
By the way, when you leave tension all of that disappears. You're just dealing with
freakiness, the 38, the 39, the 57, the 51, four individual gates, shocking,
obstructive, talk about the button pusher of butter pushers. And the thing is they
push everything‘s button and then they‘re surprised at the impact that other people
say you're crazy. And they say, ―Oh, it‘s all a misunderstanding.‖ And the other
person says, ―Yes, that's right.‖ And they say, ―But it‘s your misunderstanding. You
don‘t get it; everybody is supposed to be like me.‖

The 6/3 is going to look here at the 54 and when it looks at the 54, remember that it
looks from this position of individualism to the biggest potential kiss ass gate in the
tribe. It‘s like it‘s standing over there on its 38, 6/3, there‘s only me, there‘s only
me, and the next thing is you better kiss ass or nothing happens. Oh my God. And
the last thing that a 6/3 wants to do is kiss ass. You mean I have to go down there?
I have to start from the bottom?
When these beings come into the world, these individualisms, they assume that
everything is given. They‘re correct, they‘re perfect. Other people have problems,
but they're okay. They assume entitlement that nobody in their right mind could
ever assume. And they're always surprised when everything isn‘t perfect for them.
For everybody else they understand because everybody else is inferior. And then the
6/3 looks over to the 54 and goes, oh.
Remember, when you get to the end of any of these hexagrams in this quarter that
coming off the roof is death. It‘s like, oh God; you mean I have to live in that world?
Yes, you have to live in that world. They don‘t want to go. And you see that each
and every one of the gates out of the Root pointed to the Spleen, when you get to
the 6/3s they don‘t want to come off the roof. They don't.
It also means that throughout the 6th line profile experience there is in all 6th line
beings this fear. It‘s a mutation; after all, it‘s new. So, there is this transition that is
taking place. It is frightening because they don't know what to expect. There are
risks which are physical, which they're going to recognize at some deep level within
themselves. And so here you see this real resistance. To go down there means I'm
in the last third of my life. It means that if I don't get it now, I'm never going to get
it and Jesus Christ, look at the way I have to get it. What a journey.

Introduction
The 54th gate has a mixed allegiance. On one side it says the only thing that makes
being in form worthwhile is collecting material. Let's get rich. It's better to be rich.
This is one philosophy. The other side of it is heaven, of all things, heaven. The 54
says, no matter how bad it is here, when it's over I'm going to be rewarded in
heaven; funny thing.
The Marrying Maiden; obviously, the I‘Ching was deeply sexist, it was written out
of a patriarchal perspective. And the Marrying Maiden in a society where women
were not honored, the Marrying Maiden was actually a pejorative. It‘s not all nice
and rosy, the sweet virgin. This is the Marrying Maiden. This is the conniving, find
your way, get the right connection, and move up the ladder. And everything about
the 54 is this moving up the ladder.

Let's take a look at the Right Angle
Cross of Penetration; ouch. It is a
cross that has the extraordinary
power to pierce you. That is, in the
same way that we see the 59.6 has
the ability to be able to penetrate
an aura that what you're looking at
on the Cross of Penetration is the
ability to be able to reach the
passenger. Think about a limo and
think about the kind of limbo in
which you've got some kind of
barrier between the driver and the
passenger. They usually have an
intercom system so that you can
get through to the driver. And
instead of the Cross of Penetration
banging on the glass—stalk, stalk—
it actually yells at the driver.
What‘s interesting about Pene–
tration is that these people have a very deep impact on the personalities that they
meet. And you're dealing with a very powerful configuration. Penetration is all these

The Marrying Maiden
50s—51, 57, 53, 54—you‘re dealing with this ability to shock, the intuitive capacity
to penetrate. After all the 57 is the capacity of intuition to go through anything. So
these are beings that have a feel for breaking through to your personality, which
doesn't necessarily mean that they go any further. They don't.
It's like talking about being a seeker. Being a seeker never means being a finder. It
just means being a seeker. And being a penetrator doesn't mean that once you've
penetrated you have something to do. As a matter of fact, the thing about
penetrators is that the moment they penetrate they‘re lost. ―What am I doing here?‖
After all, these are helpless beings like everyone else. And in ignorance they do not
know or recognize their very gift. So, they penetrate the surface, which is what
they're good at, and then they don't want to do. So they back away.
The Marrying Maiden is deeply, deeply, deeply tribal. It's about as tribal is you get
because it's in the belly of instinct and smell. It is really tribal. And everything about
the 54th gate is that this is the font of what the tribe needs. Look needs. Look at its
mirror. The mirror is the 19th gate in the 19th gate is all about need. But it's
personal need, the need for resources that you can get through the support from the
other. But the 54 is something else. The tribe needs the 54s, the tribe needs those
that are going to be ambitious, that are going to be driven, and that are going to
move the material wheel.
The 1st line, 1/3 Influence: The ability to achieve influence through secret
relationships anywhere from the private adviser to the Satanist. That‘s the 1st line.
Now, if you don‘t think that these are conniving people you‘ve missed the point.
They really are. This 54, particularly the 1/3 here, this is where you begin to get the
dark side of the 1/3. Most 1/3s, when they go through an experience and it doesn't
work out their pessimism is increased. If they're lucky, if they're really lucky, they
might discover something of value.
These 1/3s are always looking for the weakness in the other. They‘re always looking
for who above them they can take advantage of. And they're not looking at their
own mistakes, they're always watching for someone else's. It makes 54s as a 1/3
very different. They learn from seeing other people make mistakes and then instead
of correcting them what they discover they use as power to climb up the ladder. It
doesn't make it sound very nice, but then again, the tribe isn't nice.
When you're dealing with this side of the tribe you're dealing with capitalism. You're
dealing with dog-eat-dog, you‘re dealing with step on the hand that helped you, and
you‘re dealing with all this climb up the ladder. The tribe breeds this. The tribe
doesn't work on authority based on voting. You look at all the great tribal leaders
and you'll see that they rose from poverty—the little Joe Stalin in the middle of
nowhere, the little Fidel in the middle of nowhere, the Mao out there in the middle of
nowhere—and climbing that ladder gives you enormous power. You learn how to
use, gain and manipulate influence.
Now of course, when you look at the detriment here you're actually looking at what
we would consider to be a positive. In other words, in that sense misguided that you
don‘t use this power and that you need formal recognition of your value in order to

way up the ladder. The exalted says any means, baby. It doesn't matter what it is.
You make a deal with the devil to be the king of the world, you go ahead. Any
means; if the devil shows up.
I talked to you that the 54s go to heaven. When you‘re in the 1st line you have
Satan, when you get to the 4th line you may even sit on the right hand of God. It‘s
deeply, deeply mystical in here. It's a very, very strange hexagram. And you can
see that there are these to divergent paths. There is triumph on the mundane plane
in the form is material, but there‘s a greater triumph, I hope, in the same way that
the 58 dreams of perfection that may never be reached, that the 38 struggles for
purpose that may never be found, that the 54 labors in the minds of materialism and
may never find the dream of a higher reward.

The 1/4
RAC Penetration 4
The 1/3 in its ambition is clever; the 1/4 is stuck, because what happens to the 1/4
here is they‘re only really going to go in one way or the other. And it's going to be
dependent on the way in which they are raised and in what kind of an environment
they are raised. If you're raised in an entrepreneurial household where the father
brags about being able to pull off a deal and pull the wool over somebody's eyes, you
know which way the 1/4 is going to go. If you grow up in the house of a wage slave
who dreams of the day that they're recognized by the foreman so that they can get a
bit of an increase and then they get it and you see how excited and wonderful they
feel that they have this little recognition then you know which way the 1/4 is going
to go.
In other words, it's not so much that it has the capacity within it like anyone, other
than if it's fixed, to live out either side of this variation, but the tendency in the 1/4
is to accept the conditioning because for the 1/4 the important thing is build a
network to get noticed so that you can go to that rung.

problems with water retention. In Rave biology, the stream of the 54 to the 26 is
about water, it‘s about liquids. And one of the things about the 54 is that it holds
back a lot of its potential, and it does waiting for the right call. The 54th gate is the
ultimate gate for a 2nd line to be in. Whether you‘re the 2/4, the 2/5, the 5/2 or the

looking for someone to call it. The difference is it concretely tries to attract that
attention. ‗Look at me how good a worker I am, give me a raise.‘
So here when you're looking at the 2nd line, the 2nd line is different. It says ‗I‘m
waiting for the right call.‘ It also means that they can be perceived as being
incredibly disloyal. This is the detriment. The 2/4 is wait for the call all as an
opportunist, which means you wait for the call while you're it is something that you
don't want to be in anymore because you're looking to move on. And disloyalty is a
funny thing. Think about the person working on the shop room floor with all their
buddies. They‘ve worked together for five or six years and you've got one of them
who is very ambitious who is always try to go up the ladder and suddenly he gets
promoted to being the foreman for his buddies. They think he‘s disloyal. The
relationship between him and them is going to deteriorate rapidly. He is going to
have to find his buddies amongst his own peers. And this is one of the prices that is
paid for ambition.
When you go up the ladder you're always leaving people behind. We all know in our
societies the level of jealousy that exists when somebody on your plane suddenly
spikes up above you. Jealousy in the tribe is one of the most natural things. The
other thing is that when you get promoted and they don't, they lose a sense of
worth—―why him, why you?‖ So, the 2nd line is tricky here, and it tells you
something about the psychology of the 2/4. Not only is it not really open easily to
the call, but the consequences of the call. The consequences of being called to that
promotion are much more than the 2 thinks about, it's absorbed in its own thing. It
just wants to be able to move up the ladder. It doesn't realize it's about to lose its
friends. And the consequences of what that means to a 4 when your network breaks
down.
Most people when they see the 2nd line and they see the detriment that says lack of
loyalty they truly misunderstand that. It is a perception on the 54. The 54 is always
being looked at, because that's what this gate pulls. If you've got a 54 and you've
got a job and you're not good at it, the boss knows. You can't hide it. 54s are the
source of people who will rise up. And it is almost expected that you're going to be
able to rise up when somebody feels that energy, but if they see that you cannot do
the job, you will really suffer from that. There‘s nothing worse than a Marrying
Maiden who can‘t find a husband.

Discretion: The wisdom once a relationship is formally recognized—you‘ve been
promoting now to foreman—to restrain the temptation to take advantage of past
informal interaction. That means that you know that the buddies that you work with
sneak off time, they punch in each others' cards. You have to see the risk of what
ambition brings within the tribe and the kindness/meanness that is part of the 4.

promotion.‘ And then they go home and their husband or wife screams at them
forever. ―It was another five hundred dollars a month; what do you mean you can‘t
do?‖ ―No, I can‘t do it because they‘re all going to hate me.‖
The 2/5 recognizes. And the 2/5 uses that recognition as a rationalization to stay
withdrawn. What happens is that that inner ambition—this is an adrenaline motor.
It's a killer if you don't use it. It really is. Adrenaline is not to be played with. It
needs to be moved correctly. As I've been mentioning in relationship to 2/5s and
5/2s is this transition that is taking place in our technologies. It makes it a lot easier
for hermits to be able to have their externalized and universalized field available to
them without the consequences. To be an outsourced employee who gets promoted
to some higher position in a virtual environment doesn't bring the same
consequences as being promoted off the factory floor to being a foreman. It just
doesn't. So, one of the things in terms of the financial stability and the financial
well-being is that the 2/5s and 5/2s are going to do much better in this era than they
did in the last, as an example.

ability to be stymied—stymied simply means that you‘re stuck. So there you are,
you want to be the foreman and you just don‘t get the recognition. When stymied in
formal relationships to use secret or purely informal channels when it is the only
resort. The drive when blocked to use secret means to fuel ambition. Now, that can
get really nasty, including greenmail, blackmail.
It's astonishing what a 54 will do to get up the ladder. So if they see that their way
is being blocked, they see that there's somebody else that is getting the eye of the
manager, they'll find a way to put out disinformation, go into the to the manager and
say ―Joe really isn‘t doing his thing, he just didn‘t punch in his card, Harry had to do
if for him‖ and this is the exaltation. Isn't that sweet?
Any 3 has more experience than anybody else. They‘re experiential and they learn
how to use disinformation and not when they‘re on the job. They learn it in school.
―Harry spit at me.‖ Harry did nothing; Harry is fucked. For the rest of the class the
teacher is eyeing Harry. It starts in the crib. You should see what they do with their
teddy bears—never mind.
The other side of this is sex. People always ask me where prostitution is. I don‘t
know why that‘s interesting to people, but nonetheless, it‘s the 54.3 in detriment.
This is the person that either asks for or offers their body in exchange for a
promotion. ―I want to be a starlet.‖ ―Yes, dear go sit on my sofa,‖ whatever the case
may be. The insistence that formal channels no matter how frustrating can be
overcome by the power of attraction. The energy of ambition when blocked will fuel
the power of attraction to overcome the obstacle.

The Marrying Maiden
What you‘re dealing with is that attraction can operate at many levels. Often it is
another form of flirtation, but flirtation that carries with it a sexual innuendo. The 54
and the 19 often have confusing goals. This is the secretary in the 54 who marries
the boss and goes from being the secretary to the partner in the business. You have
to see that there is sex mixed up in the 54 that doesn't belong there, but this power
of attraction says, ―Hey, I'm going to make sure they notice me.‖
When you're dealing with a 3/5 you have to see that because they are always at risk
at losing their reputation, they know how to try anyway to destroy the reputation of
others. It‘s not the nicest trait of the 3/5 and it‘s rooted here. You can understand
that. That is, I know that from my 5 perspective that sometimes it's tempting to
carve somebody to pieces. The 3/5 has this capacity simply out of pain. The
moment they fail at something they get blamed personally. Their reputation is at
risk. And it's very difficult for them in the workplace because it's so easy for them to
take the heat. So, here within this context, there is a defense mechanism for the
3/5; nice defense mechanism.
It‘s amazing how many people have sex in the office. I‘ve seen recent statistics on
this. It‘s absolutely incredible. One out of every three working people claims to
have had sex in their office. This is all this side of the track. And it's all mixed up
with ambition and recognition that has nothing to do with sexuality. Of course, it
leads to enormous problems. It‘s the warning my father gave me when I was
young: Don‘t shit on your own doorstep. This is really what you have in this kind of
a context.

The 3/6 is always dealing with dilemmas. You‘re dealing with an early phase in
which vindictiveness tends to be what their pessimism comes out as. Understand
that if you‘re a 3/6 on this cross and all you want to do is rise up, every time you
step on the ladder the rung breaks. There may be somebody up there with their
hand waiting for you and you still don‘t get there because every step you take the
rung breaks. And there is this anger, if I can describe it that way, this deep tribal
annoyance. It stinks for these people. It really does.
It's going to be very, very difficult if you come in on this cross is a 3/6 to be able to
find something in this life that you can do in the context of a larger grouping. You
may succeed as a loner. You may succeed independently on the material plane. But
the tendency in the 3/6 here is to look to the 4. It's almost as if by the time they
get on the roof they realize that the only thing worth doing is praying. If you want
to see the true source of prayer, the true source of prayer comes out of the 3/6, and
you can understand why. It doesn't make sense. They‘re given a really hard time
and it doesn't make sense. And they see that others who are less talented, less
capable, less gifted rise up before them. And that they go easily up the ladder and

survive the first phase you can find them, they‘re in churches and synagogues and
mosques. They‘re bowing down to God and they‘re praying for another kind of
reward, because they realized this one is not going to work.
The other thing is that the 3/6 is a kind of covert interaction with God. It‘s like, hey,
I need money, like God gives a shit, please Lord could you help me win the lottery.
Nobody else recognizes me; maybe you recognize me. Please. I think that
everybody that has a 3 in their design somewhere inside of them is a prayer. It‘s

Then you get to the 4th line. It was one of the most interesting experiences for me.
I had a friend who actually ended up living here on the island. He owed a very
famous esoteric bookstore in Amsterdam. I was a guest of his because he was a
friend of a friend of mine here on the island. I had just written or had written in me
or however you want to describe that the original Rave I‘Ching. He introduced me to
a group of Dutch I‘Ching specialists. The group as a whole there was about 150
years of experience working with the traditional Chinese I‘Ching. I had four or five
evenings with them. It was really a delight. They were fascinated. It was very
difficult for them to take it incredibly seriously. I was quite a freak and this was
before anything had been published, but they were taken by the positioning of the
hexagrams in the body and all this kind of stuff.
They did an analysis of my lines because the miracle of the Rave I‘Ching is that I had
no reference. I just wrote it. So, they were very interested in parallels. If you do
that yourself it's an interesting meditation, by the way. I've done it. I did it years
later. You can see the correlation between every line in the Rave I‘Ching with the
original I‘Ching except the 54.4. And that was a clear, direct instruction of the Voice.
It came long before I ever even wrote the book because he told me about this gate,
this line and what it meant in much different terms.
So anyway we come to the 4th line of Enlightenment/Endarkenment which means
absolutely nothing. This line means absolutely nothing. Even when you read it you
realize it means absolutely nothing, because it tells you absolutely nothing. What it
tells us you is that there is no more perfect place to be called by anything than here.
That's what it says. And it means that that call could be mundane, it could be so
mundane it‘s spooky, and it can be so exalted that it will fry your brain. In other
words, there is this vast spectrum of being recognized.
The advantage is that the 4s have the network. What they don't understand is that
if you could see a 4 and their network, there's also another way to see that. They‘re
not creating the network. The fractal lines are already there. They‘ve always been
there. They just happen to run along certain fractal lines. It‘s not like they're
creating them. The lines of geometry are already there. And those lines of

geometry have places in which they are open to anything—God or the devil, it
doesn‘t make a difference, demons and angels. But the whole point is that this line is
the deepest resolution that you get to when you come from the opposition in
civilization and you come over here. It‘s like the 4th line says my network tells me
that there is a stairway to Heaven. Don't worry, we will take you up.
You could see the beauty of that when John Paul died and they read his will and he
had nothing. Yet, everybody is convinced that right now he's sitting beside God.
Well, not everyone, but Catholics anyway. The very first thing that was said with his
last breath was that he's now sitting with his father. This is a 54.4 piece of work.
Only the 54.4 has the nerve to be able to say, maybe what I need to do is build a
temple for God to recognize me. Only the 54.4 has the chutzpah to mix money and
God. And either it‘s no money and only God—the joke of John Paul is that yes, yes,
yes he had nothing, but let me sell the artwork that was in his room. He lived like a
prince; a prince of princes. After all, he‘s the head of a country, servants and pope
mobiles and private doctors. Yeah, he left nothing, give me a fucking break. He
never had to have anything. Yes, we all should be so poor. We should all have that
kind of job. Only the 54.4 will get into this business.
And of course, you can see why they‘re a 4/6. They see that you can go from
pessimism to optimism. This is a wonderful leap of faith. And they really find God
on the roof. They find religion on the roof. You have all these people that have
found God in their midlife crisis. These are roof people going, ―I don‘t want to go
down, can I go up? Down there I do very poorly. Maybe up there everything is
going to be fine.‖ You know the meek shall inherit the earth; yeah.

The 4/1
When you get to the juxtaposition, to the 4/1, you have the Juxtaposition Cross of
Ambition. We have moved away from the 51-57 so that we are in the 42-32. The
moment that you see the 32 you know that we have a cross that has the channel of
Transformation defined. It‘s very powerful. This is a very, very powerful left angle
figuration because of the built-in definition that is there. And whenever we see that
remember that the interpretation of the gate has to give consideration to the
quantum. In other words, we can‘t think about this juxtaposition cross as the Sun in
54 even though that's what it is. It is a definition.
Everything about transformation is so deeply material. This is one of the most
material of all channels. The 32nd gate has a deep, deep fear, this fear of failure and
a fear of failure that can only be ameliorated by having the potential within the tribe
to maintain the material momentum in the material direction. My thing about 32s is

that they‘re ready to commit suicide when they find out the pair of shoes they
bought on sale they could've bought cheaper. In the worst they'll go and kill the
person that told him it was the best price they could have.
So, when you're dealing with this particular configuration, you're dealing with an
obsessiveness on the material plane. And you're dealing with a force that is rigidly
afraid of failure. Transformation is their theme. It's the only theme. The difficulty
for them is the 54.4 gives them no guidance. You notice that about this line. This
line doesn't give you a kind of blueprint of what's going to happen or what you
should do, nothing. It‘s like well, you never know, it could be this plan, it could be
that plan, it could be any plan. You don‘t know what it is. It could be this, it could be
that. Don‘t know how it‘s going to happen, don‘t know why.
So, you can see that this is what we call blind ambition. And these are beings that
no matter how successful they become, they‘re never successful enough. It‘s like
anything else with crosses you have
to see whatever the individual
configuration is going to be in terms
of the characteristics or whatever,
but in most cases this is something
that is not easily received. They are
so ambitious.
Again, the advantage is that they
have a fixed line in life and it's
possible for them depending on
their nurturing, depending on the
environment they grew up in, how
successful they'll be able to be. As
tribal beings their greatest success
comes in family businesses. This is
where that blind ambition is
something that is tolerated because
it's your own child or mother or
father or brother or sister or
whatever. In other words, you put
up with it simply because it‘s blood. And most businesses on earth are family
business. Most of the economy of the world is run by Ma and Pa operations at every
level, particularly in the Third World.
Whenever you bring the 42 into the game you have to see something. This gate
locks you into things for a very long time. It just does. If you don‘t have the 53, if
you don't have access to the conditioning of the 53, it's very, very difficult to get out
of things. You get stuck in them. I used to tell women who would come and see me
who would have the 42nd gate and I would say them—they would tell me that they‘ve
been married 20 years and I‘d say the last 15 years you wanted out but couldn‘t get
out. And they know that. You can‘t get out. The 42 says ‗till death do us part.‘ And
it says ‗till death do us part,‘ whether it's a business or it's something you enter into.

By the way, it doesn‘t have to be a lifetime. If it's something that has a short cycle,
you're supposed to do something for a week, and then you do it for that week. It‘s
very, very difficult to break that because that 42 is what hold you to that. So, when
you bring the 42 into this configuration, into this cross, you have to see that with
that ambition they get locked into that thing that they want to rise up to, and don‘t
let go.

The 5/1
When you get to the left angle cross you have the Left Angle Cross of Cycles. It‘s
cycles. And of course, it‘s getting its name from the 53 at the other end. And we
have this double definition that is here. Not only do we have the 32/54, but we have
the 53 and the 42. The 5th line is Magnanimity, largess. These beings can
transform entire community‘s lives, but their own is a real problem. My favorite is
Richard Nixon, the much scandaled
former president of the United
States. This was his double
definition on his cross. You can see
that this enormous power to take
people through a very ambitious
cycle, huge ambitious cycle. But
his own process and how messy it
was, and then you get to see that
54s connive. They go in and rob
psychiatrists‘ offices and they bug
the opposition to find out how to
beat them in the election. This is
all 54 shit.
So, one of the things about these
beings on the Left Angle Cross of
Cycles is that they give you a cycle.
They start you on a path of
transformation. They‘re format
beings; very, very powerful beings.
And they‘re the ones that will set you on this track. So, the interesting thing about
the Marrying Maiden is that when you're dealing with the penetration this is the real
‗I‘m looking to rise up.‘ And when you get to the left angle, the left angle is saying ‗I
am going to help you rise up.‘ Now, it doesn‘t say what they want in return. It's
very different. This is not in any way my ambition. It's about ―I am only ambitious
so that I can raise you all up. I don't really want to be president, but I know that I
can help you. And if I‘m your president then your lives will be better. So I'm willing

to sacrifice myself with great magnanimity and be available to you to help you rise
up. And by the way, I‘m going to steal and cheat. I‘m going to enrich myself at
your expense, nonetheless.‖
The natural authority and actualizing spirit that in a position of power can have
genuine and fruitful relationships with the less advantaged as long as they are in
service and make no demands. Isn‘t that great? You have to have a black sense of
humor to appreciate that. I‘m a 5, I think that‘s hilarious. There‘s no detriment. The
energy for actualizing that despite this power fuels fruitful relationships with others.
So, this is the underlying power of the true heretic. The true heretic says ―I have the
energy to change your life, whether you like it or not.‖
We tend to assume at this point that people want to abandon their not-self. They
don‘t. They have no idea what it means. They have no idea what could possibly
replace it. And that's something that's quite frightening. One of the things about
tribal ambition is that tribal ambition is driven by these kinds of forces. These left
angle crosses of cycles, this enormous power to get the other going tribally. And it's
not like they do it for nothing. They don't do it for nothing. And they have very
simple rules: I will help you rise up; do what I say.
Now, this is the classic of how tribal materialism began in the 12th or 13th century
when we have the beginnings of what would become guilds, craftsmen. And you
would have a guild master. Let's say that he made furniture and the guild master
would take in local children. Now, those local children are empowered by this
master. The master will take these children through a cycle of transformation that
will turn them into craftspeople. They will have to do everything the master
demands, including cooking and cleaning and working 12 hours a day and on and on
and on and on and on. But at the end when they are able to present their
masterpiece, when they‘re finally free of the hand of the master, there is great joy in
these beings that they rose up and they forget that the master was cruel or nasty or
hard.
This is this quality; this is the beginning of this process. And you can see that the
tribe has to take responsibility for training its own. And it's here in this 5th line.
Obviously, the 5/1 is very powerful in this configuration. If they have enough basic
understanding at the 1st line level, then given this definition, where you immediately
can bring people into a transforming cycle where you could immediately condition
them to see themselves as being able to transform, you get a lot of things. This is
great for recruiting soldiers. It's great for recruiting priests. It‘s great for recruiting
recruiters. You name it. Fruitful relationships with the less advantaged, this is a
wonderful line; natural authority and actualizing spirit.

rather than pulling them to you in the sense that you want them to stand on their
own two feet, you want them to get things going, you want them to go through a
specific process. You want to initiate in them a cycle. Remember that when you're
talking about the abstract format, you're talking about the experiential cycle. It‘s
about life. It's about living it. It‘s about living through the transformation. It‘s about
growth in transformation.
The 5/2 has a potential to be called and as I mentioned, if you have a 2nd line with
the 54 automatically you're going to get more calls than if you have a 2nd line
someplace else. It is a place to get called. The only thing that comes close is the
19.2 and it‘s not quite as powerful. But the 54s with a 2 is something where you
know there's going to be a powerful call. That call can be strong enough for the 5 to
define its motivation. So it is possible here that the 5/2 can be physically involved,
directly involved if they're properly motivated. Again, it's out of this position that 5s
love to be on the second floor. The most difficult thing for me to deal with in my life
was getting off my high hat, this 5 position of looking down at the world and saying,
they're all lesser beings. It's natural to the not-self 5.
So, for the 5/2 this magnanimity to the less advantaged is kind of a fulfillment of its
own imagined ego trip. ―I am better than them. I was always suspicious of the fact
that they're useless and I'm not. And by empowering them and giving them
something worthy to do, not only am I going to get a reward for that, because there
is a reward for that, this is the 54th gate, it is material, you are going to get your
reward. But one of the by-products of that reward is that they will leave me alone
because I can really give them something to do out there.‖
The secret for 5/2s is to never allow anyone to know you for too long at a personal
level. We know that the 2s don't like people coming into their space and mucking
around, particularly the 2/4. But it's one of the things with the 2 with a 5 is that the
5 has its greatest impact on strangers. Familiarity breeds contempt. This is the
great rule. And it is very, very important for them to see that as somebody that is
capable of reaching out to the stranger, empowering the stranger, that that's really
their role.
One of the most interesting things about the 5 not just on this cross, but in the
Marrying Maiden, is that it is a bridge outwards into the collective world. It's like a
tribal business that grows big enough to become a world business. And there are
many you can track now over the last 40 or 50 years that went from being little
village operations. I think of the big bankruptcy that just happened—Parmalat from
northern Italy. Here was this small village dairy farm 75 years ago. It turned into a
multi-billion-dollar worldwide organization. This is a 54.5 realm.
In other words, the ability to be able to bring to the tribe the capacity to be able to
actualize at a much higher level, at a much broader level than just within the tribal
context. It‘s one of the things that made in many cases tribal peace possible
because the 5th and 6th lines represent trade; in other words, to be able to trade with
the other tribe over there. And when you're trading with the other tribe, if you
become dependent on the goods that you both receive from each other it‘s hard to
go to war. It's one of the most difficult things. You see this in our modern

globalization. It would be very, very tricky. Everything is so interconnected. The
cost of conflict now is enormous because of the ripple effect that it has in this
integrated world of globalized economy.
As I've been mentioning in relationship to 2/5s and 5/2s is this transition that is
taking place in our technologies. It makes it a lot easier for hermits to be able to
have their externalized and universalized field available to them without the
consequences to being an outsourced employee who gets promoted to some higher
position. A virtual environment doesn't bring the same consequences as being
promoted off the factory floor to being the foreman. It just doesn't. So, one of the
things in terms of the financial stability and the financial well-being is that the 2/5s

example.

Selectivity: The ingrained responsibility—a Saturnian line—in terms of maintaining
security and personal identity that will naturally restrict its relationships to ones that
are mutually beneficial. The detriment is: A generally benefic and expansive nature
that it assumes that it can instill what is otherwise missing in its partners. It‘s called
a waste of energy in maintaining relationships which hinder ambition. It's all about
what is beneficial. I'm a 5. I will teach anything. That‘s been my experience. I will
teach idiots and I will teach geniuses, because 5s are stupid that way. 6s don‘t do
that. At least they‘re not supposed to do that. In other words, the nature of the 6 is
that the 6 is only here when it's beneficial and mutually beneficial.
The role model, the example, the trusted leader, they will only be that for you if it is
beneficial to them. Otherwise, what's the point? When you see the 6 in the 59.6
you get the whole story. You‘re always looking for that incredible soul mate at any
level. You want the person at the counter at the supermarket to be your
supermarket-counter-person soul mate. You want them all to be your soul mates.
It‘s perfect for you; perfect beings to give and take with. You step into their aura
and there is no pollution, there‘s no disease, there‘s no problem, it's clean. You get
to pull in and pull out. If they ask you for something they‘re not taking anything from
you, on and on.
6s have their thing. After all, they have better vision than any of the rest of us.
They see differently. First they see inside the forest so that they meet all the trees
and the rot and the garbage and all this stuff. And then they climb up on the hill and
then they watch the top of the forest. They see a world that the others don't see.
And in seeing that world that the others don't see they begin to recognize that most
of interaction with the other is a waste of energy.

nonsense, just filling up the air, that what you get to notice about these
conversations is that there's always a place in those conversations where you get
into something or the other gets into something that takes away energy into a whole
direction that isn‘t worthwhile.
The 6 clearly recognizes this. The 6/2 on this cross is Selectivity. It says ‗I am not a
role model for everyone. You cannot just tap into me. I‘m only going to be an
ambition role model for those that I can work with where it is mutually beneficial.‘
And what's so interesting is the 5 says ‗I am here to help the less advantaged‘ and
the 6 says ‗I only want to help those who can be my equal.‘ And here you see the
whole transition in the way in which humanity is destined to be educated.
This 5, as an example, at the end of its time and the emergence of the 6 coming is
where this whole business of teaching the other is a mutually beneficial process. In
other words, the 6 is only going to teach those that can teach it. Otherwise, what's
the point? So, there is a great lesson to be seen here about the nature of the 6 and
particularly what their time off the roof means. Their time off the roof is about
selectivity, and it's probably one of the most important keynotes we can have for 6s
when they‘re off the roof.

The 6/3 with the 54 is very excited. It says ‗what have I seen in my life? I‘ve seen
that you can find purpose in life by being rich. Life‘s a bitch, it‘s better to be rich.‘
That‘s one philosophy. The other philosophy is that you can be holy, you can be a
devotee, you can be a spiritual being, and you can be somebody who dedicates their
life to a higher value, a higher purpose, a higher importance. The 6/3 looks at all of
that and looks across and it sees the 61.1. And it says ‗can we hold on for a
moment? Maybe there's some truth out there and then we can really see what it's
all about.‘
It‘s the dream of the 6/3 that they‘re not stuck with this or that, because they‘re not
good at either. They‘re not good at the material; they're not good at the spiritual.
They‘re too damn pessimistic. That not-self pessimism is so deep; I‘m never going
to be rich, so I‘m always going to have to deal with the trial and error difficulties of
what this life represents. I'm never going to really reach God because I see that it

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 4
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
The polarity to the 61 is the 62 and it‘s the 62nd Gate in Civilization that actually
creates the framework of the maya that we live in—the giving of names. When you
get to the 61 and remember that in Mutation we‘re supposed come up with some
raison d'être, some reason that makes sense out of the life process. The 61 says
very clearly, it‘s just maya. As a matter of fact, within the context of maya are we
actually even alive that we have to be concerned about death? There are wonderful
thinkers in the maya that say this is just somebody's dream. Who‘s to say it‘s not? It
gets really spooky when you get into maya concepts, because with the maya concept
you can write any kind of story you like, you can create any kind of explanation, any
kind of trut h to satisfy any kind of need.
Understand that the 61.1‘s goal is a universal truth. In other words, that the
resolution to the question of how do we live a life based on fact is that we get to a
universal truth. I have met people in my life who have said to me, I've waited all my
life to know this, I can die now. It wasn't that I waited all my life for this that I can
live correctly; no, it‘s I‘ve waited all my life, I can die now. For some people just the
knowledge, the recognition and acknowledgment of a universal principle—after all,
Human Design is an absolute, but an absolute of the maya. And you get to see that
the goal of humanity is to find a universal truth that represents the maya and in that
sense, that is this way of being able to accept life and death.
My understanding of mechanics has really changed my whole perception of death;
totally. This is not the great bogeyman. And for most people death is frightening,
not because it's the end, nobody in the end minds the end. It's about what life is
like while you‘re getting there. And it helps to know the truth.

The 1/3
The basis of the 61, the 1/3, the Occult Knowledge, here we go with psychic
again: A natural psychic awareness that empowers principles of universalization.
The pressure to know the mysteries through esoterics. I have my Design Sun in
61.1, and it's so obvious to me that it simply does that and you don't know how it
does it. I have no idea what psychic means in that sense, but I do recognize that it
is a pressure system. And as a pressure system there is this incredible pressure to
get to the inner truth. When you look at the chop it‘s wonderful because the truth is
in the form. You have the yin line stuck in the middle between the yang sandwich.
And you know that true truth is in there, it‘s in the form principle.

1/3s on this cross can be quite disturbed. They have a natural inclination to want to
know the truth, and as 1/3s will end up wandering down many, many paths. And of
course, truth is elusive, universal truths are even more elusive. Obviously, all 1/3s
have a deep potential intellectually. They all do. They‘re thinkers and this is a
thinker‘s gate. So here you get a tremendous amount of absorbed thought. I have a
wonderful painting in my bathroom. It‘s a museum and in the museum is a man
sitting on a toilet and it is called The Stinker and it's it is a wonderful painting with a
great deal of humor. There's a lot of stinky stuff in this kind of thinking. You can
really feel it on the Venusian side because this is the side that gets so damn obscure.
You later see it leads, the 61 can
lead to obscuration, the obscure:
Where a reliance on secret
knowledge increasingly demands
ascetic withdrawal and leads
eventually to obscurity. Where the
pressure to know the mysteries can
be so strong that one can be
eventually incapable of handling
exoteric realities. And don‘t we all
know these people, the fuzzy
bunnies that can barely land; the
people that spend their whole life
waiting for the UFO to come.
You have a lot of weirdoes out there
who simply are so lost in the maya.
I talk about how much I love the
maya, but that‘s only because I
understand it. The maya is not
something lovable if you don't
understand it. It is deeply, deeply confusing and it has tentacles like nothing you can
imagine that are stuck right in you. And if you can‘t pierce that maya, if you‘re lost
on some obscure track, wow, it‘s very hard to come down to earth. That Head
Center—it‘s my joke about thinking about the Personality Crystal, always look at the
bodygraph and always remember the Head Center is outside the body, at least part
of it. That Personality Crystal is up there and the 61 is up there, and it‘s a pulse. It
doesn‘t mean it's always there. They can get really nuts.
Whenever you see a line that has Neptune exalted, you hold up a cross—Neptune
exalted, back off, I don‘t want to go crazy. We have a whole generation of children
that were born about 10 years ago with Neptune in 61.1. I love these babies, they
keep the light cooking, but it's also Neptune fuzzy-wuzzy business. It also says
something very funny. If you see Neptune and you see this psychic awareness that
empowers universalization, Neptune has a 165 year cycle. I don't know if you can
ever penetrate a Neptunian activation. It's like you really have to be blessed by the
gods for the veil to be dropped for you to see that, or the veil to be shattered. It
was one of my first reactions when I came to Ibiza, I first deconstructed and lived up
in a tree, I use to look out over the sea and I used to talk to Neptune. This is
Neptune‘s bathtub.

1/4s on the Cross of Maya are the kind of people that can make others insane.
They‘re nuts, but it‘s not the point. They will make others insane because they are
so fixed on some occult thing, so fixed. These are the kind of people that get
obsessed with the Da Vinci Code and spend their whole lives following the track.

The 2/4
RAC Maya 4
Here you can see in the continuity of things what is so impressive about the 2. This
is Natural Brilliance. They are deeply gifted. All 2s have a special gift, they all do,
but it has to be called out of them. And of course, it‘s not just being called out, it's
the consequences, the circumstances, all those things, but the natural brilliance is
there. If you're dealing with a 2/4 and you‘re dealing with this theme of brilliance,
it's brilliance within the construct of the maya. Remember, everything about this is
about penetrating through the maya, figure it out.
The Moon exalted and so gifted by this position a far-reaching, a nourishing
influence, free of guile and powerfully attractive. A gift for inspiration that is
attractive and beneficial. Now of course, the only negative of this line is line is that if
natural brilliance is discovered to young it ends up distorting that person's capacity.
That in early recognition of its influence becomes ego obsessed with maximizing its
effects. A delusion that any inspiration deserves recognition; any inspiration.
I‘ll never forget one of my very first lectures in Berlin, I had a guy come up after the
lecture and he brought me a photograph, a blowup of a photograph of a Mariner 4
image of the surface of Mars, and he put it down in front of me and he said, ―Do you
see the picture of Jesus?‖ Do you see the parking lot at the hotel? No, no I couldn‘t.
I find this line more interesting as a genetic continuity theme for what the 2 is and
why it's so important to bring them out of their shell, that there is this special gift
and these special gifts needs to be brought out.
In this context, by the way, this is a 2/4 that really can be beneficial, but remember
it's beneficial only in the sense of the pressure that it can apply to others mentally.
It's up here. There‘s no guarantee there is a 24 or anything else that's going to pull
that down. It‘s just something that will pop in and out. It‘s not like before when we
were dealing with a fixed definition. I know that myself. My 61 just hangs there in
an open Head Center and most of the time the only way I get it is through 63s. It
goes sideways through a logic system. I don‘t like 24s. I don‘t like the frequency.
It‘s not that I don‘t like 24s; I just don‘t like the frequency. It‘s like having your
head between two cymbals. If you‘re a 61 and you‘re a 43/23 on the other side,
that‘s what it feels like. It feels like (sound).

The beauty of the 61.2 is that as a 2/4 it can network its brilliance out, which means
they will have those it can respond to that. And they can be very powerful, very
influential forces. The dilemma for them is that we don't own our inspiration. What
comes through and appears to be a great idea for many, the next thing that comes
through can be absolutely ridiculous. And this of course is one of the things about
the obscura that‘s built into the 61. So, one moment you have this incredible idea—
there are scientists out there who are famous for something really realistic who have
idiot theories that they been trying to—―don‘t pay any attention to that, I was young
and I really thought that you‖—there are many like that. It‘s like Einstein.
You can see very clearly that 1904, 1905, something happened to this guy. I think it
was the 56th gate because he was a powerful 11. Something happened to him, a
tremendous amount of inspiration, very, very unique. It was gone the rest of his
life. This is one of those things. So here when you‘re dealing with this natural
brilliance it is very important to see something. It's not always brilliant, but it can
be. And when it is brilliant, it's a mutation after all, it has the capacity to mutate
others and to impact others. But it can also be seen as you‘re nuts. And 61s get
that a lot. This is a crazy gate. You know they're crazy when they want to know
something that you know is out of common sense nobody will ever know. And you
can tell they‘re crazy.
I saw that myself very early in life. There are some things you cannot know; let go,
because if you don't let go you‘re going to go nuts. I‘m very, very accepting of the
Ring Past Not. This is the beauty of knowing that the 61 leads to the 60. I look over
there and I see yes, there are limitations, okay, I‘m lucky, I have it at the bottom
and the top so I have this sense of if I can‘t know it, I can‘t know. I‘m not going to
go crazy. What happens here is that these people can go crazy. ―I want to know it.
I need to know how that works.‖ Now of course, sometimes if the mutation is there,
that‘s a wonder. Everybody goes, yeah, wow, right and life changes in some way for
others. But most of the time doesn't have that value.

Again, this age is a benefit for them. And by the way, because I keep on repeating
this I‘m trying to put this into so that when you meet 2/5s and 5/2s that you
remember it immediately, recommendations for them about their material work, for
them to get in those positions because you can do it now. About 25 to 30% of
American businesses now allow employees to work exclusively at home through
networks. So it's a real change in the way in which these kind of beings who need
their solitude, and that goes by the way for any other 2, but particularly for them,
because they are so concerned about the interrelationship with the other that this
age is a great time for them to be able to get their power out, but to get their power
out from their secure environment.

This is the opportunity for them to have a venue for their inspiration, have a venue
for their particular brilliance and to be able to either in the 2/4 sense externalize it or
in the 2/5 sense put it out there as a universal principle and throw it on the web. It's
amazing how many people are just putting their inspiration on the web. And they're
doing it. Again, these again for these beings this is something wonderful. It‘s a way
in which they can stay in their position where they can be protected; they can wait
for the right opportunity from a distance. This is something very beneficial for them,
particularly for the 2/5.

The 3/5
RAC Maya 4
Every time you get to a 3rd line you always get to reality. Remember we saw that 3rd
line realism. You get to reality. The 3rd line doesn't do well with nonsense, it
doesn't. Life is full of too many problems to get sidetracked by nonsense because
they want answers to basic questions that arise out of the dilemma of living that life
of a 3rd line being. Interdependence is this line: It is exceedingly difficult for truth
to stand alone. What‘s so interesting is that it‘s the only one that has a blue
introduction. All the others are natural mental states. And this isn‘t. To learn that
it's difficult for truth to stand alone.
It was one of my favorite things in the early years. I would say truth crawls and
rumors fly. Human Design, man, it's an incredible truth. I've been here 18 1/2
years on this road. I know what it takes. One of the things that realism brings is
that truth cannot stand alone. No mutation can stand alone and be given its place.
It must move and it must move through others.
The ability to establish relationships for the actualization of truths. A lot of you
wonder why I keep on talking about the potential of the 3/5 to be a great scientist,
to be a great explorer. That potential is always there in them. That is, you can see
that they will be at their best when they can establish relationships for the
actualization of truths and through their nurturing and protective power to ensure a
stable environment in which they can continue to grow. The pressure to know to
enhanced through collaboration. When you get to the mental level of the 3, the
mental level of the 3 is hey, we need help here to figure things out, and the only way
we're going to do—that what you see out of the 61.3 is the beginning of organized
science think tanks and all of these collaborative truth seeking adventures.
The detriment is: Impatience with others and the forsaking of relationships. So
many people who have the 61 abandon people who can‘t keep up. Teaching has
been a wonderful thing for me. It‘s taught me tolerance, it‘s given me grace. I used
to get infuriated with people who couldn't keep up. It‘s so typical of the 61. It is
this: we've got to work on knowing this and you're holding everything up. I don't
want to go through all that again; can't you just keep up so that we can know this
and collaborate on this? And the other person is saying I can't elaborate unless I
catch up. And the 61 says that you're the wrong person for me. I‘ll collaborate with
somebody that can keep up.

Remember we've seen here in mutation how the 3/5 can turn the normal process
around. In other words, rather than being they're the ones who suffer from their
reputation, they will affect the reputation of the other. In other words, here the 3/5
says you're not smart enough to work with me. You can't keep up with me. How
does an individual collaborate? It‘s such a bizarre thing. All they can do is
empowered with inspiration. Their social skills are a minimal.
So if they can empower the right kind of mental quality or response or however you
want to look at it, they find something they can be allied with. You see this in
physics labs where you have a lot of people that basically don't like each other. But
they love the fact that without each other they could never get to where they are.
It‘s like when you see these beings that put these little machines on Mars, the vast
teams of people. And in those vast teams of people there are people that hate each
other and people who want to stick each other in the back and people who want to
move up in the hierarchy, there are people who don't think that the other is smart
enough, there is all of this stuff, and yet it's only the collaboration that makes the
whole process possible. In this sense, the individual recognizes that mutation needs
collaborators, that is, it needs victims to be empowered with the mutation to drive
the process forward.

I think that these are the kinds of beings that surrender very early to the maya and
see clearly that a great truth, that truth in of itself is subjective and that without
some kind of breakthrough at another plane of consciousness that there is no way of
penetrating to an absolute. There is a resignation here. And the collaboration is a
way of releasing pressure rather than a hope for the future. They‘re often people
that get stuck in working on very old things, when in fact they're supposed to be a
new mutative force.
What‘s interesting about these beings is that I'm certain that when they get off the
roof, if they get that far, that that's probably when they're going to be their most
inspiring and inspired. In other words, I think that these are the late bloomers, the
ones that find their inspiration much, much later in life, disillusioned most of their life
in not so much that they haven't been able to collaborate and not because they
haven't been able to work on things that are interesting, is that their inherent
pessimism keeps on telling them that this is not what it‘s about. And only the fact
that the 3rd line is material keeps them integrated long enough in the process that if
they get to far end their very intelligence can flower.
The age of a Mozart is over. I think that we're looking at a change in the sense that
what we would call the child prodigy is going to be the post-Kiron prodigy. In other
words, I think it is a whole thing that is being reversed. Because of the Saturn cycle
early genius was a definite requirement and most of the early genius—when people

important because you weren‘t going to have a lifetime to flesh it out. Now, we have
this enormous input, a huge level of input. And it's clear to me that the Kironian
phase is an opportunity for a very different kind of inspiration. The inspiration that
comes out of examples rather than the inspiration comes out of the conditioned
process, the inspiration that is about mutually beneficial mutation, which is very
different than trying to figure out how to mutate everybody. That‘s typical of the 6

Every 4th line you read adds to the richness of this aspect. Here‘s Research and
when we see the trickle-down to the 4th Color and what we know about transference,
it‘s through transference that research is possible. It is the 4 that is able to dabble
in all these things and look at all these things; otherwise, they couldn't build their
networks. So this research is something that is very, very powerful and it is one of
the things that the 4/6 does best. Researching the maya is a vast occupation. What
I like very much is that in having the matrix of Design the maya is simplified. In
other words, you can see all of the basic constructs that are there.
This is a capacity for concentration to explore the depths of inner truth and maximize
the application for fundamental principles; to maximize them and to know
fundamental principles. It's also about being careful about collaboration, because it
may ruin the inspiration or the mutation. 4s are very good at influencing and they‘re
terrible when taking advice. They‘re not good at taking advice. They‘re here to be
influences. They don't like being told. They don't like being advised. Remember,
they‘re not 1s. Their theme is not learning; their theme is transmission. It‘s getting
it out; it‘s getting it into the network.
The moment that an opportunity comes to a 4 and they have to turn to somebody in
their network to ask advice that opportunity is not for them. And this is one of the
things about the 4. They‘re in charge of the research. As long as they're in charge
of the network and they can put out their influence then it's correct. But the
moment that they're asking somebody else what kind of influence to put out, when
to put out the influence, who to put the influence out to, they‘ve lost their power.
The whole problem with collaboration starts in the 4/3 phase. You end up in
relationships which you have people telling you what to do. And the moment you
get into the inner truth business there are always mentors.
If you‘re attracted to the maya, if you‘re attracted to the intelligence of the maya,
then you‘re going to end up with masters and teachers and mentors and whatever.
This is one of the things for the 4 that at some point they have to release themselves
from that to establish their network and operate according to their rules. Now, that
is something that comes when they go up on the roof. That's why for the roof phase
is so important to 6s because this is where they actually can find their security, their
financial stability, their well-being stability in life.

We‘re going to move into the 3 and we're going to move into the 50. Remember
that the 3 and the 50 are one of the arms of the Cross of the Laws. It is always a
good thing to keep in mind where polarities belong in various configurations because
it gives you a real insight. In other words, this is the kind of thinking that in many
ways is trying to work at what the underlying codes or laws happen to be. And we
know that this is a research line, so
what we‘re dealing with here is with
research, but we're dealing with the
dilemma and the dilemma is the 3rd
gate. These beings are highly
intelligent.
The 50th gate is the source of human
intelligence, the source of our
judgmental, instinctive, intuitive
intelligence. So these are beings
that can be very, very bright, and yet
at the same time there is a deep
confusion within them and the
confusion comes from the 3rd gate.
So, they tend to get stuck in thinking
that has no application. And what I
mean has no application there is no
drive to inspire the other. In other
words, this is a very singular line.
They‘re going down a very narrow
track and along this track the real thing for them is simply the pursuit of knowledge,
nothing else. They‘re thinkers. It's not very productive. I mean, they don't tend to
be very productive. They don't put enough energy into their networking, they get
really stuck in thinking and they run into this dilemma of the confusion ruling their

And this becomes evident when you move to the Left Angle Cross of Obscuration.
It‘s this 3-50 underneath that brings all of this discomfort, misunderstanding,
confusion to the 61-62 polarity, which in fact is very straightforward. What are the
inner truths of the facts? What are the inner truths through the details? When you
bring the 3 and the 50 underneath it‘s that the laws are all confusing. How do I
penetrate these confusing laws?
How do we find the absolute laws?
Well, we know that there have been
thinkers thinking about that forever
and the fact of the matter is that
they've haven't done a hell of a good
job. It is not an easy thing to think
out what the underlying code is.
It‘s my experience with Design. I'm
often accused of having an enormous
ego, which I do indeed have;
otherwise I couldn‘t do this job. As
smart as I am, I never could have
even come close to figuring this out,
let alone wanting to. And it‘s one of
the things that you recognize with
the whole business here of the 61 is
that the absolute is not something
that you can attain just by thinking,
you can‘t. What you end up in is all
kinds of obscure paths, because it's so obvious when you look at the history of
humanity that the greatest inspirations humanity have received have been mystical.
The breakthroughs have all been mystical; these flashes of voices, dreams. Things
happened in Einstein‘s dreams. There is this magic that brings these very unique
themes into the world.
But just thinking? It has, as the eventual 6/3 of this gate recognizes, its limitations.
It also says something interesting. We may never know God because God may not
exist. And we don't know it. There is a limit to what we can literally know; there is
a limit. So far, no further. I was not capable of knowing what I have displayed over
the last 18 years. I‘m not capable of this. If I had not been through my process and
manipulated in my process, I can't imagine it being possible that I know so much.
Where does it come from? This is part of what the 61 has to meet in the 60. It‘s
like, so this isn‘t going to be the answer to solve the death question. No matter how

The Left Angle Cross of Obscuration, the 5th line, the 5/1 Influence: The enlightened
Father/Mother figure whose recognized wisdom and powerful assertion can mold a
generation by its influence. The pressure to know that may result in influence and
wisdom. It may result. But remember, this is the Cross of Obscuration. Think
about what this actually says—molding a generation by its influence. It is the
molding that is the point. And one of the things that you see is that obscure thought
is more likely to mold a generation than the truth. And it's everywhere you look.
It‘s every kind of this path, that path. It‘s all there, it‘s all over. And it is these
obscure and obscure only in the sense that it never allows you to really get to the
truth. It takes you to a relative truth, a subjective truth. And yet, it‘s powerful
enough to mold a generation.
When I did the very first readings, my very first readings, I heard some scuttlebutt,
the kind of stuff you hear other people say. This was told to me, one person has
said to another person, I really don't know whether it's accurate or it's just Ra‘s
power. Is it Ra‘s power to get me to believe this? You all know I‘m—this is why it
was so important to me in the early years to teach other people so it could be
transferred so people could see it‘s not just because I can overwhelm you with my
aura and pull you in.
This is the thing about the obscure is that the obscure carries this kind of power. In
other words, let's say Human Design was nonsense, I would still have students. I
know that. There isn't anything you can‘t sell; there isn't anything you can‘t teach

would have made my billions first. It‘s so easy to do. And then you think these
beings are enlightened. It says ―enlightened.‖ Ah yes, I followed this obscure path
and now I have my obscure truth. And shit, I don‘t fit in society anymore. What
happened to my life, I‘m over here. And of course, it takes people away. Beware of

A tendency in power to want to enforce compliance to ensure lasting influence. The
pressure in knowing to resent challenges and demand acceptance. As good a
description as the Catholic Church is obscura or the mullah is obscura or any radical
fundamentalism booboo from any religion. And you can see how obscurism so
powerful. And remember it's not that the knowledge that they present is obscure, it
isn‘t, they flesh it out, every sect, every religion. They all have their way of
presenting you with their truth. It obscures THE truth and then it says something
about this death process.
When you leave the maya behind at the 4/6 and you go up here into the left angle,
there is this: there is no absolute truth; let's take one anyway. At least one; you‘ve
got to have truth to take to the grave. If you‘re a 61 you‘ve got to have some truth
to take to the grave. It doesn't matter whether it's the universal truth, any truth will
do. And then you have all these people that out of the deep fear that their life is
coming to an end they look for these very obscure or they bring it to others and

The 5/2
LAC Obscuration 2
The 5/2 in what we have seen up here in Mutation is that the 5/2 has certain
advantages. One of the advantages that it has is that to be an isolated
father/mother figure is the way it's done. If you see somebody who is an obscure
teacher, take any swami, master, teacher, guru, what you'll see is somebody in
isolation. It‘s the only way it works. If you see your master 24 hours a day, you're
going to question who they are, because to be awake 24 hours a day means you
really have to be awake. And if you're presenting a truth in the world and you
cannot present it 24 hours a day, you cannot fool people. You can‘t. So, they go
into isolation. They have their little cadre around them that protects them. And
they go into isolation in order to have this influence and the 5 loves to look down.
So you have the 5/2 father/mother figure looking down and patting the heads of the
children. You do what you're told. You follow this and you have the truth. To listen
to people who are into Scientology talk about this thing it's like wow, this is a great
5/2 joke in all this. Old L. Ron, I liked it when he was writing science fiction. He was
a good science fiction writer, sort of. As far as I know, he and Elvis run a gas station
in southern Arizona. Bless their hearts.
So the 5/2 has the capacity to be able to influence on this cross. But to be able to
influence in the way in which it‘s best, a heretical perversion, that 2nd line perversity
quality, to be able to take people down a very strange track and at the same time be
able to give them the sense that this is the track of truth. The Atlantians; have you
ever met an Atlantian? Oh, shit, talk about obscure. And these people, their whole
thing is that this is where the truth is. There is no other truth. And whether it‘s the
Atlantians or the Pleiadians—it goes on and on and on and on.
The sad thing is that when you come from a position of synthesis you can see that
everything is truth. I‘ve got nothing against Atlantians and Pleiadians, as long as
they're within the context of the way in which everything can be understood. But
the moment it's just that way, the moment that it's just this way, right away you‘ve
got a problem because what you're seeing is that you're having people who are
aligned to a truth in order to avoid the ultimate truth; the pointlessness of their lives.
You can also see something else about the 5 that is deeply limiting. It‘s a parental
figure. The heretic is a parental figure. I'm so aware of that in the role that you
play. It is this authority role. I‘m a 5/1; you work out of your authority. The very
power to be a heretic is rooted in the depth of your authority and you can see the
limitation of the 5. It‘s always ―I'm telling you and you‘d better get it or you don't
get it all.‖

It is something that even though it is coming to an end it‘s still all around wherever
you look. And not just the way I describe it mystically or spiritually. Think about
diets, just diets, how many people are being taken down obscure paths that lack
truth. There‘s a relative truth. You can take any scientific experiment and pull it
towards what you want. You can show that if you only take this kind of food that it
will do XXX. But the moment you put it into the experiential field—there are people
who do these things until they die.
I was reading about this woman who was a marathon runner and the doctors now
are telling people that do athletics not to drink so much. For years, all you heard
was drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. Now they're telling them not to drink so much.
And they have these power drinks now. So there is a woman marathon runner who
doesn't understand that she's over hydrated because she drinks, drinks, drinks, she
thinks she's dehydrated instead, she take a power drink and drops dead in the
middle of the track. You have all these people that will tell you these kinds of things
and they have followers; weird kinds of therapies and all kinds of stuff. It's all out of
this and it's the old way.
The only way is your own authority. This is that way of influence where there is the

The 6/2
LAC Obscuration 2
When we get to the 6 we get to Appeal. It‘s Plutonic in the exaltation: The
profound attunement to the collectivity in the 61st gate, a freak gate, an individual
gate. It‘s what I love about the Head Center gates; they actually don't belong to any
circuit. It's always silly for me to think of it that way because I know it‘s not like
that. It‘s like the 63 and the 64 could be reversed if you read the lines. The 63
seems so abstract and the 64 seems so logical. And it's the same thing about the
61; it is a very, very funny thing. The collective that can lure the public to a truth.
Inspiration that can bring clarity to the collective. You've got emotional terminology
in it. The other side is the shop-worn clichés, the delusion that inspiration can bring
clarity to the collective. This is the great dilemma of the individual in an individual
mutation.
In other words, how do you bring attunement, how do you bring the truth from the
uniqueness of the individual to the collective and you see that the 6th line knows how
to do that, because it doesn't matter to a 6th line being who‘s off the roof what is
around them, whether it's individuals, tribe, collective it makes no difference. It
makes no difference what their design is. It doesn‘t make any difference. If you‘re a
6th line being and you‘re off the roof awake as yourself you‘re not going to be an
enlightened father figure. It doesn‘t work that way. You‘re going to be an example
and the example is the only way that the individual can impact the collective deeply.

And remember the theme of the 6. It‘s not what you say, it's your actions. The
actions of the 6 reveal their level of awareness always, always. It‘s why 6s who
don‘t have the 10th gate suffer a lot because it takes them many, many years to
learn the right behavior in order to be able to perfect what it is to be an example.
Here‘s one of those cases in the 6/2 where the 3-2 phase is really in many ways an
advantage. That is, learning through trial and error what it is to deal with the
collective. The advantage of individuality mentally is that it's surrounded by the
collective and it does have this relationship to collective processes. So the 3/2 will
learn a lot about the collective. It may be disillusioned, which of course is always the
possibility here, the disillusion that you cannot impact them. But of course that's
natural to the Saturnian cycle. It's natural to even the roof cycle.
But the moment they come off the roof if they can come off the roof as themselves
correct, then of course they don't have to have the tools that the 5 needed—the
hustle, the seduction, all that stuff. All they need is to be an example and the
collective will get the message. So this appeal is something very important to
understand about the 6th line being. They have a natural appeal, as an example, and
they also have a natural appeal as not-self. The world is filled with horrendous
examples and they're invariably 6th line beings, because they are the ones that the
example is expected. In the same way that we have a projection on the 5 that they
are going to be the best, we have a projection on the 6 that they are going to be
correct.
When the 6 isn‘t correct, it‘s a shock wave. It really is. You see that in the 28.6 that
to not be correct is so painful that you'd rather die. You‘d just rather die. It is the
ultimate horror for the 6. The other side of that is the 6th line of the 20 that says
here is the ultimate line of wisdom. But wisdom how? It‘s as an example, only as
an example. So, whenever we're dealing with these 6 themes you can see this
incredible pressure to go through the process and survive the early part of the
process so they can get to that point and also the limitation because that‘s what
we‘re pointed at.

The 6/3 sees so clearly that limitation. It stands there like a giant brick wall that
says when you get past this door what does it matter? There is nothing more
nihilistic than the 61 that is a 6/3 and nihilism is part of the 6/3 psyche. ―What‘s the
point; even if I have a good idea, so what? What‘s it worth. Would I buy me a seat
in heaven? Will it give me immortality? Will it bring me good sex?‖ And the 6/3
says, ―Look at this, there‘s this wall over here. I‘m not going to get past this dam
wall. This is it, this is the end.‖ It ends here. You‘ll see.

literally. So here when you get to the 61 and you get to the 6/3 there is this (sound
of letting breath out) ―Okay, I've gone as far as I can go. That's it. I give up.‖
By the way, that's not necessarily a negative. It is this gateway to mystical wonder.
In other words, if you get to the end of the point where genetic inner truth will not
lead to the answer that makes the difference there must be something else. The one
thing that the 61 will go through in its life and will understand as part of its process
is that this is not meaningless, but it only feels that way because we don't get it.
And the 61 understands that. There are things that you can't get.
At the furthest extreme of the 6/3 is this sense of just because I can't get it doesn't
mean there isn't something to get. Just because I don't know doesn't mean that the
knowing can‘t be there. And it‘s true. I have seen this, I know. I know so clear that
the intelligence that I experienced that no human being in any way can be compared
to that intelligence. It‘s so far beyond our concept of intelligence that the idea that
somehow that we can know these grand answers is such a delusion. And the beauty
of the 6/3 and its nihilism is that that nihilism isn't a pointless nihilism. It‘s kind of
like: this as far as I can go. I accept. I accept that this is as far as we can go. These
are the beings that when somebody says ―I‘ve got it, I‘ve got the answer,‖ they look
at them and say, ―Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard that before. And I guarantee you that
when you tell me I'll point out to you that that's not the answer.‖
It's one of my things with 6/3s is that every time that I touch a 63 I really have a
victory for the forces. It‘s like oh, see I was right. If you wait long enough there is
something.

A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
The Cross of the Laws; this is the final law, and it is the law of Limitation. The
acceptance of limitation is the first step in transcendence. It tells you the whole
story. I don't think it's possible to imagine that incarnation is real or any kind of
concept of afterlife is real, unless you're surrendered. It‘s only in surrender that you
realize that the forces are at work, because everything happens, and it happens with
the precision that is magical, and it's only in surrender that you recognize that there
is no limitation. There are artificial limitations, but there is no true limitation and
there's certainly no limitation for the Personality. There‘s no such thing.
The thing that I realized the most is that my body is a limitation. It‘s nothing but
limitations. But my Personality is eternal. It‘s been in existence for billions and
billions and billions and billions of years. It's an amazing thing. Yeah, the body has
its limitations. And the moment that you get to a place where you allow life to dictate
the rewards you see right away that there is much more than the maya‘s construct,
that there's much more than just this decaying form principle. I'm not interested in
the afterlife constructs because I know it's a joke. It doesn't matter to me.
It's obvious to me that there are cycles of incarnation. It is obvious to me that
experiencing consciousness is something that we are deeply, deeply familiar with.
But how it works, what it's like—it‘s like when I taught death and dying. It‘s
interesting to know the Bardo stages. I'm sure I‘ll recognize mine when I have it, but
when the Bardo stage ends and the curtain closes, what does it matter that you're
going to come back again. You don‘t remember. You‘re not allowed to; otherwise,
this whole business wouldn‘t work. We‘re in a rapid age of development of form and
the only way you can do that is you keep on keeping on.

The right Angle Cross of the Laws, the 1/3, Acceptance: The ability to maintain
inner harmony when confronted by external limitations. You want to deal with
death, well, maintain your inner harmony. Inner harmony is a formula for the
relationship between the Personality and the Design. Whenever you see inner
harmony, inner peace, what you're looking at is the resolution of the conflict
between the essential binaries. This is the essential binary—the relationship
between your Personality and your Design is what harmony is all about. And you

only find that harmony when the Personality let's go of trying to dictate what the
Design should do in terms of the life and the way in which the life comes out.
Harmonic energy that can deal with external limitations. Remember we‘re dealing
with a Root gate; we‘re dealing with a format energy of the individual process. And
the 60th gate is born to accept limitations. And laws ultimately are the imposition of
limitations, both natural law and the constructed of humans. Natural law dictates
the parameters of life. There's nothing you can do about it. We make it very, very
good. We have more people who
reach the age of 100 now than ever
before in our history. It's clear that
we‘ve been able to accomplish many
things in terms of longevity, but the
fact is that even the best possible
conditions are still not going to
extend the life much more than let's
say 110 or 120 and I don‘t want to
be there. I‘ve already seen what it
looks for 90 year olds and even that‘s
questionable for me. It‘s a
limitation. We‘re all designed to go
through this process.
The acceptance of that limitation is a
path to transcendence. It‘s not like
you can teach yourself that. Like all
mutations it‘s either there or not.
Most people don't know how they
would deal with death until death
shows up. And of course, then you find out that you haven't been surrendered and
it's hard to let go. It's hard to let go. Everything about this life is knowing how to
let go, let go being in control, let go of thinking that you're in charge, let go of your
vanity, let go of assuming that you can dictate what life is going to be. And the
moment that you let go of that you surrender, limitation doesn't really exist. I don't
feel limited. For me it seems like the sky is the limit. But I‘m as limited as hell. It
doesn't mean anything to me. When you‘re surrendered there is no limitation. It‘s
just a construct that you‘re working out of, that‘s all; nothing more, nothing less.
It‘s not like you go to a barrier and say, oh I want to go beyond that. You don‘t even
notice there‘s a barrier. It‘s not important. People only bang up against limitation
because they don't have within themselves what is correct. So they bang against
the wall thinking there's something better on the other side—the grass is greener,
and blah, blah, blah.
The detriment is: Restless energy when confronted with external limitations. That‘s
me. That‘s my detriment. I have the 60.1 with Mercury. And it‘s interesting, it‘s
one of my best teachers, it‘s still one of my best teachers. If I get agitated, which is
very, very rare, actually I‘m very calm. If I can't sit still I know that there's
something deep inside that I'm not dealing with. I know right away. I haven‘t had

that in years. But Mercury was a great signpost for me. I've taught that in the old
days reminding people that the detriments you have are the best allies you have,
because detriments tend to be very, very clear things. And to be able to live your
detriment and recognize it is a great understanding of you becoming you. It‘s a
gateway to you becoming you.
As a Manifestor I grew up believing that there was absolutely nothing I couldn‘t
knock down. I was even a fighter for 12 years of my life. I used to knock people off
their feet. It seemed to me that there wasn't anything you couldn‘t knock down.
And it's so funny to turn that all around—the way that actually got turned around
was just the way the microcosm and the macrocosm worked. I ended up without for
the first time in my life without a home. I ended up with no walls. I was sitting in a
tree. There were no walls. It was a real interesting transition for me to go from this
world of all these barricades and all these walls and all these things and of course
now there's no door I need to kick down.
The 1/3 learns deeply in its process, obviously it goes through this trial and error,
1/3s don‘t like limitations, because they are easily upset by the fact that life is
difficult, things don't work out. And they don't like thinking that the thing that didn't
work out will never work out. The worst problem for the 1/3 is repetition. You keep
on making the same mistake in an attempt to try to eliminate the limitation that
somehow this is a false limitation. Most 1/3s think, because of conditioning, that it‘s
because that they're not good enough or fast enough or smart enough or whatever it
is and then they become obsessed with trying to go through that same thing over
and over again banging against limitation until their pessimism overwhelms them.
And rather than being the normal 1/3 that intelligently their Personality is a 1, they
grasp things at the intellectual level that the mind gets focused only on how we get
through this damn limitation. They spend their whole life there, just locked in
banging their head against the wall. Inner harmony is the key to limitation. So
every single human being is stuck with limitations that they cannot transcend
because they don't operate correctly and they're not surrendered within their vehicle.
And so limitation is really the close of the wheel.
The 41 is another story. The 41 is the gateway to beyond. And the 19 is the
instrument of God. But here at the 60, at the mundane plane, this is the end of the
line. You get to here; you get to the end of the story. More than that, when you look
at the 60th gate if you look at the place where the gate is in the Sacral, if you go to
the opposite end of the Sacral, in other words the bottom, where there are no gates,
there is a gate. It‘s the gate that the Design crystal with the Magnetic Monopole
passes through when you die.
When you die, the Design Crystal comes down through the center, it's all through
individuality, it‘s the final mutation, it comes down through the center, the Design
Crystal has a mold that the Magnetic Monopole fits into and they become one. This
is their great moment. They return to each other, as they were when your life
began. And then they go down through the 2/14 and they go through the 3/60 and
they go out through this gate that is only there at death and they go out through the

bottom. That‘s my joke about opening up the asshole at the end. This is limitation.
This is the bodygraph‘s waste duct.
So, when you‘re dealing with the 60th gate you also have to deal with something
funny, limitation? Isn‘t it joking with us? We actually escape through the limitation
and beyond. It‘s through the 60th gate in reverse that we leave the body, that we
leave the vehicle. Personality crystal, by the way, just goes out.

The 1/4
RAC Laws 4
Every time I deal with 1/4s or 4/1s you immediately have to look very carefully at
their lives when they were young, the first seven years particularly. There is very
deep conditioning; less so the 1/4 than the 4/1 but still in both cases. The only
difference is that with 1 Personality there is this tendency to investigate and to
investigate is the primary ―this is who I am.‖ And it is secondary to put out the
material.
But remember that 1/4s by their very nature are an expression of limitation. They‘re
very fixed. The 4/1 being the most fixed of that variety. So, it‘s something to see
that when you're dealing with the 1/4 here it‘s all limitation. They themselves
depending on if they have a family that is very, very locked into external limitation,
their whole life is dealing with external limitation. Their whole life is those people
that want take them away from their line.
When 1/4s are restless they are the kind of beings that they accelerate and they're
gone. They burn out their network. That's always the quality of the 4, this theme of
burning things out. And it's one of the things to understand why 4s when they
develop a network they also have to know how to keep the network trimmed. It's
like pruning a tree in order to get better results.

The 2/4
RAC Laws 4
I particularly like the 2nd line because it's such an interesting expression here. This
is the line of Decisiveness. It says: The understanding of the nature of limitation,
to accept its restraints when necessary, and thus be able to take advantage of
opportunities when they arise. The energy that can adapt to restraint. That line tells
you why beings that have the 2 have a right to be part-time hermits, it really tells
you, this ability to be able to accept the limitation, to live within the limitation. The
2/4 that never gets a chance to show its natural brilliance and its talent is still very
happy accepting being within the limitation of its environment puttering around and
doing its thing. But it's also the fact that opportunities will arise. This 2nd line is a
natural 2/4 configuration. Opportunity is already built into it.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 4

Now, the other side of this is spooky. This is: An adaptation to restraint becomes
habitual and maintains the nature the limitation even when it no longer exists. This
is somebody, for example, that goes into retreat and never comes out. They just get
stuck there. And this happens a lot to 2/4s and you can see the tendency. They can
get stuck in a mutation; they can get stuck in the limitation. When you adapt to
limitation, we saw that in totalitarian societies where you learn to adapt to the way
in which the totalitarian society operates. And after awhile you've adapted so long
that you are the society. You become a mirror of it. You get stuck in the adaptation.
So, this is one of the risks for the 2/4. Remember they‘re missionaries. When
they're called, they can be called to an addiction or a mutation. Within the limitation
it makes it very dangerous for others. It also can make it very good for others but
still to see that in its proper context. In other words, in dealing with limitation, they
will not necessarily try to transcend it. They will just acquiesce. The whole theme of
appeasement is in the 2nd line. This is the democrat that says ‗let them vote, let
them do it, whatever they decide, I don't care. Let it go.‘
So, you end up accepting the limitation that you can't influence who's going to lead
you and you end up allowing other people to make that decision and you follow the
results. It‘s this whole thing about how did all those ordinary people in Nazi
Germany do all those terrible things. And it's not because they were German. It's
about what happens when you accept limitation. You adapt to a limitation. And then
you become it. Of course, that is the inherent risk here and it's very heavy. It‘s
decisive. It can make an enormous difference.
It‘s why it‘s very difficult to change many societies. People have adapted so much to
the way in which the limitations work that they don't know how to get beyond it. It‘s
like watching Europeans who don't have an Anglo-Saxon history trying to figure out
how to be entrepreneurial after centuries of adapting to a specific kind of limitation.
And then all of a sudden this other kind of way opens up and they're not equipped.
They don‘t know how to deal with it. It's very hard to change them.
Think about all the countries on this planet that had been ruled by kleptomaniac
mass murderers. And you think about the citizens. People are people. We don't
want to be hurt. We want our children healthy. We want to be able to give them
whatever we can. And you think of whole societies that are ruled by mad people.
And you think well, why don‘t you do something about it. How do you permit that?
Well, they have accepted the limitation. They have adapted to the limitation.
What are all these Iraqi bureaucrats going to do who don't understand how to really
be a bureaucrat who only understands corruption? Corruption has been the way for
decades. It's a culture in and of itself. It has rules. How do you replace that?
These are laws and it says something horrifying about laws. It says if you keep a
law running long enough eventually everybody becomes the embodiment of that law,
regardless of what the law is.

it happen that all kinds of ordinary people—I remember seeing this incredible film
interview with Pol Pot, one of the great mass murderers of all time. Ah it‘s simple,
bubbly little Buddha like creature and you think, where did he get this? And the
moment it was the law you had those that are immediately there saying we‘ll adapt
to this law. We will pass that motto along. You‘re no value to us and you're not
worth keeping. Wow, ordinary people who killed thousands of people.
So when you look at this, why do you think it's so important to call 2/4s? You don't
want them to be sitting back in their houses saying, well, I adapted to this and this is
what we do and I‘m not going to do anything about it, I don‘t know how to change it.
I‘m not going to put myself in danger.

The 2/5
RAC Laws 4
Remember that we're talking about an adaptation to limitation that becomes the
thing itself. One of the things about the 2/5 in this particular variation of the laws is
that they are really happy accepting the limitation. After all, that‘s what they want.
They would really like to be left alone. They would like to be beyond suspicion.
They don't want to pressure of expectation on them. They realize that there is no
real way anyway, it's all blocked, it's all limited. So, they indulge themselves in
exalting their limitation. I can't do anything out there, but I'm totally free in here.
These are beings that with their very democratic 2nd line Personality will allow
anything to go on the outside as long as they can remain a heretic on the inside.
And this is the archetypal 2/5, it really is. You can see this in every 2/5. I‘ll go
along sort of on the outside, but I'm going to be a heretic on the inside. The risk is
they get caught. That's the risk for any 2/5 with their private heresies. Private
heresies get a much more visceral reaction than public heresies. And we know that
public heretics can be stoned and burned at the stake. Private heretics suffer a very,
very heavy blow to their reputation.
So, these end up being very secretive people living within the confines of the
limitation. The very fact that they can adapt to the restrained, the very fact that
they can adapt to the limitation gives them the excuse as a 2/5 to simply stay there.
So life is tough and life is hard and it's crazy out there in the world, but at home I
feel really good, everything is all right. This is what existence is. The 60th gate
brings us to this place where there is no promise of anything. When you get to the
41 and the 19 you begin to see that it's only at the very, very end of the cycle that
there is this potential glimpse that there is something beyond the limitation. You can
see the head that's going to bite the tail, so to speak.

The 3/5
RAC Laws 4
Conservatism: Enlightened self-interest that naturally handles restrictions and
limitations ensuring identity and security; or it ignores limitations and pays the price.
Here are the two sides of this coin. You get to see something interesting about the
3, because we think of the 3 as this pessimistic, trial and error, lots of mistakes,
feeling lousy about themselves, but they tend to be very, very conservative forces
only in the sense that when they do find something solid, then they will hang onto it.
And for a 3 there is nothing more solid than death. It‘s a limitation they cannot let
go of. This is their realism. Their realism is death is not the point, it's obvious.
Every 3 knows this. You know it as a kid because the car can kill you. And if
anybody's going to get hit by the car it‘s the 3. Things bump into 3s.
So, this enlightened self-interest is: I'll accept the limitation that I‘m going to die.
That's okay, but I'm going to take care of myself the best I can. That's all. Don‘t
give me this shit that it's about death. To me death isn‘t life. Life is life. That‘s the
realism of the 3. It says life is just life. Let me take care of myself within the
limitation, within the limitation of the form, within the limitation that it comes to an
end, within the limitation of decay of the vehicle, it doesn‘t matter what the hell it is,
I‘m just going to look after myself.
When you look at a 1/3 and we talk about this ultimate form of self-absorption, you
can see how deep that really is. There's an inherent self-interest in it. No 3rd line
being discovers for the other. The by-product is that what they discover can be
marketed to the other to bring a reward for all the hard work, but the discovery
satisfies them that finally something of value comes out of their process, that comes
out of their trial and error process. If you ignore limitations you pay a terrible price.
And of course, this is the other dilemma of the 3.
The other side of the 3, the not-self 3 ignores the limitation and dies doing it. You
cannot ignore limitations. You can transcend them, but you cannot ignore them.
They are there. You cannot ignore the decay of the vehicle. It's there. Death is
inevitable for everything all the time forever every moment, it's all decay. And what
price do you pay when you know the limitation? It‘s the price of self-interest. You
don't end up looking after yourself. People who have the 3rd line, this is one of their
great risks in life is that they don't look after themselves, because they have what
seems to be this incredible ability to get up after every time they're knocked down
doesn't mean it doesn't take something out of them. It does. It really does.
You give me a 3/5 on this cross and I'll show you somebody who figures it out very
quick, quick, quick, quick. And you will meet self-interest at its most heightened, no
desire to universalize, to put things out. Only a deep, deep need to be gratified in
their process. The whole theme of instant gratification is really a 3rd line theme.
This is the dream of every 3. Here‘s something to do. Now, what they want is
gratification. I do it and then I get what I expect. And they do it and they don't get

what they expect and they get very pessimistic. What they‘re looking for is to be
gratified.
So, the 3/5 learns very quickly is there is no risk to them as long as they follow a
self-gratifying conservative line. So you stay within the system, you don‘t buck the
system. You play the game, you don‘t buck the game. You stay within the whole
thing. And of course, what you get out of that is the cynicism that is underneath
every 5.

The 3/6
RAC Laws 4
It‘s a joke to think that any 3/6 can be conservative, because they are driven by the
circumstances of their very design to step where others haven‘t stepped in order to
see what happens. They‘re driven on this plane. And remember this about
maintaining your identity and your security. Laws; here in the 3rd line you have a
law that says, the only thing you have to deal with in order to transcend limitation is
to look after yourself materially. In other words, if you can find a way to look after
yourself materially, you've dealt with the most difficult thing in the physical body.
And it's true. This is one of the laws. It‘s a law that says you can't afford to think
about enlightened because you‘ve got to eat tomorrow morning. So why bother?
You don‘t have the time to figure out the secrets of the universe, because you've got
to eat tomorrow morning. So let go of that shit. Look after yourself. It‘s one of the
basic laws that limitation brings us. It says, look after yourself. If you look at
yourself you won‘t worry about this or that. You won‘t; you‘ll be busy.
Look at all this quarter and think about how much pressure it's under. Wherever you
look it's pressure. And what's the pressure for? It‘s to keep you occupied so you
don't think about death. If you‘re living in a decaying form, the most natural thing is
to ponder your demise every other breath—prana in, prana out. And the forces are
very cute. They pump you up, they get you rolling, and by the time you've figured
out that you spent your whole life just surviving you‘re dead, you don‘t have to
worry about it. The law—bio-forms are ruled through activity.
The 3/3, that is, the 3/6 phase in the first part of its life is going to be so insecure.
And it‘s going to be so materially uncomfortable. It‘s going to feel like all those
external forces are weighing down upon it, that limitation seems to be everywhere.
Don't look for a humanitarian on this line. They learn very, very quickly it‘s an ugly
planet with lots of problems. These are the children that if they're lucky enough to
have open Ajnas and open Heads, they never want to leave school. They‘re 40 years
old and they‘re taking their ninth degree. They never want to go into the world.
They just don‘t want to go there. What a terrible place. We've all seen that, those
of us who have been in universities, we know these people, they could never go out
of the world, don‘t want to have anything to do with it.

The 4/6
RAC Laws 4
To be an authority you have to accept. That‘s the limitation. Without acceptance
there is no authority. To be truly brilliant you have to be decisive. This is the frame,
the limitation. If you are truly going to be a martyr you have to be full of self-
interest. Otherwise, you can never, never stand the slings and arrows. And if you're
going to be influential you have to be resourceful. Building a network, being
resourceful in how you not only build the network but hold onto the network, how
you invest in the network without burning out, another 4th line theme, all of these
things. How you manage to operate with a one-track perspective and still manage
the network it out to many. All of this is part of the magic of the 4.
In the 4/6 we have the reasoned and intelligent maximization of potential within
limitations. It is an interesting line because it is a powerful dichotomy. The other
side is: A tendency in times of limitation to seek the inner meaning of the restriction
rather than using its gifts to find a harmonic application within the limitation. The
former leads to withdrawal; the latter leads to transcendence. Finding a harmonic
application always results in transcendence. You don‘t see that elsewhere. The
energy to know rather than accept limitation at the expense of possible mutation
leading to depression.
So, here you have the 4 with its Resourcefulness. If it doesn‘t use its resources to
develop its network, then it's going to run into deep dilemmas. And the deepest of
those dilemmas is depression, because it's not enough to have the network, you
have to be able to invest in the network. The most difficult things for 4s to
understand is the level of energetic investment required in maintaining a network for
opportunity. This is like advertising. You advertised to 100,000 people and you
hope that 10,000 are going to read the ad. If those 10,000 read the ad, you hope
that there is a thousand that‘s going to buy the product and then you're happy. But
you have to invest in 100,000. When you're looking at any 4th line you have to
recognize that they are investing in minimal potential return. They have to invest in
a large network in order to get opportunities in only certain places. And yet, they
can't know where it's coming from. So they have to be able to maintain the
network, which means they have to be able to invest their energy and their theme is
harmony.
You know a 4 is in trouble when they don't know how to maintain harmony in their
relationship with somebody else, because after all this is brotherhood/sisterhood. It
is this ability to be able to take things to a neutral level. When you have to invest to
maintain a network that you develop when you‘re a 4/3 is not what you're going to
need to invest in a network that's correct for you when you're on the roof. You‘re
going to make mistakes. Now, think about what that actually means. Every one you
add to a network requires a return. In other words, you've got to put the investment
in that relationship, and you've got to maintain it in order to derive any benefit
anywhere.

Limitation
Now, if you have the wrong network that you've invested in, the energy you're using
is incorrect. A certain group is going to require a certain kind of energy of yours.
Let‘s just make it simple. You start off as a 4/3 and you end up investing in a group
that's a high activity group. They love to go running, they love to do sports, they
love to do whatever. In order to maintain that network you‘re going to have to
participate in that activity. Now, that may have been simply a 4/3 mistake. It may
end up that you're much better off networking with couch potatoes, which is a totally
different group of people who sit in front of the TV and chew potato chips and talk
about other people running around and doing athletic things. That‘s a totally
different energy investment, totally different.
So, one of the dilemmas for the 4 is always who are your friends when you're young.
I can't understate how significant, how important that is if you see in this context of
the investment in the network. And then you see what kind of energy is being drawn
out of them. It's like the 4s that grew up in the drug culture. They end up in a
network where they‘re dealing with people who are in drugs. They end up having to
invest in that whole process. It may not have been for them. This 4/3 dilemma is
something that is very, very significant. And of course, they end up being the ones
that end up suffering the most because they're holding that all together, and the
energy that you invest with the wrong people doesn't bring you opportunities that
are good for you. And the very opportunities that they bring deepen your
involvement in the network that's not your network and very hard to change that.
I'm convinced that of all the profiles that go up on the roof that the most brutal is for
the 4/6. It's brutal, because it usually means a shifting of the network. And it's very
difficult with the 4. The 4 doesn‘t like the idea, even when it realizes that it was the
wrong network it's not like it likes pulling away from it. There‘s still this, well may be
maybe there's still something of value there. But as long as it's part of your network
it‘s taking your energy. When you come off the roof as a 4/6, it‘s the maximization
of potential when you think about all the things that a 4 is capable of. To experience
a 4/6 on this cross, it‘s the Cross of the Laws after all, it's very powerful.
I think it‘s really cute, my little son is the Cross of the Laws and his best friend is the
Cross of Defiance. What a great combination to watch in action. One says ―no,‖ and
the other one says, ―no.‖ It‘s fantastic. This is the law. In the end when you look at
what the law is because after all the law is right angle. Have you ever noticed that?
Nobody ever mentions that. The law is right angle; it has nothing to do with left
angle. Left angles always have trouble with the law. I don‘t necessarily mean they
have trouble with the law; laws are kind of bizarre things to the left angle. They see
limitation in a different way. But the right angle needs its laws.
So the 4/6 being the transpersonal conclusion from the 1/3 harmonic that the 4/6
says, look, here is the law. The law is that we can maximize our potential as long as
you follow my influence. And the network goes ―okay.‖ They‘re very powerful.
These law beings—and if you have one that's actually correct, if you have one that's
actually operating as an example they have an enormous influence and they can
transcend the limitation that way. Resourcefulness; but then we‘re dependent on
them to do it for us. That is, we‘re dependent on 4s to use their resources and their

resourcefulness in a correct manner. And that means that if you look out of the
world of 4s you have all these beings they would have to let go of their networks
that are incorrect and they do not want to. They only will, as we well know, when
another one shows up. Don't leave a network until you have another network.

The Juxtaposition Cross of Limitation
 56  27
The 4/1
The Juxtaposition Cross of Limitation, now we‘re really getting into trouble because
underneath you have the 27 and the 28. The 28th gate has never and will never care
about law. Law is just something that gets in the way. Purpose is not ruled by laws.
So we have a very important shift here. We‘re moving away from this 50th gate with
its intelligence, we‘re moving away from the 3 that says we need laws because
confusion is everywhere. And now
we have this nurturing, risk-taking
quality that‘s underneath.
Possible mutation; and this is where
you see it. In the detriment of the
4th line there is this possible
mutation. You can't afford to give
up the possibility of mutation. The
one thing that the 28 says is:
limitation? Life is not a limitation. I
can die and get out of it. The 28.6 is
a suicide line. There is no limitation
that says I can get out of it. Life is
going to end, it‘s not a limitation.
As a matter of fact, they like to play
with close death experiences. Let's
test the borders of limitation. And
this is what you get on this cross.
They use their resourcefulness to
see if they can get past limitation, not transcend it, but get through it somehow.
And there is this assumption that they will fulfill their purpose this way and there is a
good feeling about it because it's a 27 experience. It‘s like it‘s really nursing for me
to drive a car at 190 miles an hour on a narrow mountain road and survive. You just
don‘t want to be on that road when they come by.
What‘s so interesting is that despite the fact that they resentment the implication
that there‘s a limitation; they‘re ruled by its presence. The very limitation nurtures
their risk taking. Awhile back we had the 27-28 Nodes. And when I was doing the

Daily Views on the radio show, I was talking about it was such a wonderful time to
introduce people to Human Design. The 27th gate is looking for intelligence. The 59
is looking for fertility and the 27 is looking for something smart. You don't just want
to be able to reproduce; you want to reproduce a child that is intelligent. 27s are
always looking for brains, it‘s looking for intelligence. And the 28 is looking for
purpose. So, that combination of the 27-28 is looking for intelligent purpose or
looking for the intelligence to find the purpose or looking for purpose that leads to
intelligence, whatever, let me get there.
So underneath this you have this whole thing about banging against limitation. And
yet at the same time, not care. That‘s what‘s nice. It's like, yeah this not the laws.
The law says you may never break the law, and you get to this cross and they throw
the tablets on the ground and everybody gets upset. One of the most natural things
for the 4/1 to say is why shouldn't I covet my neighbor‘s ass? Why not? What‘s
wrong with that? You have a problem with me? This is the difference between the
law and limitation, the laws says ―thou shalt not.‖ And the 4/1 says, ―why not?‖ The
law is gone. Why are you controlling me, why can't I covet? Give me a good
reason.

audience. And you think he's not a magician, you just don‘t go poof; what‘s the
trick? How the hell did he distract us so that he could make a full grown—it‘s not like
the elephant can be in on the joke. It‘s an elephant. He‘s got to get it off stage and
everybody's watching. How do you do that? Isn‘t distraction incredible?
It‘s magic. Oh I love it. So, you can really see that if you‘re distracted what do you
care about limitations? You can be fooled into thinking there are no limitations. It‘s
wonderful. I‘m a 5th line being, this is how you become a leader. Leadership: The
awareness that the destruction of old limitations simply creates new ones; this
results in behavioral patterns and demonstrate this understanding through actions
and enhances leadership potential; the energy to handle a lifelong process of dealing
with limitations. It's Neptunian. It‘s all mirrors. How do you think that heretics get
away with it? It‘s a mirror game. This is from a 5, it‘s all projection. You don‘t see
anything. Let me distract you with my aura. You don‘t know who I am. It‘s all
mirrors.
Oh, distraction is wonderful. It says, don‘t worry about the limitation, it‘s okay, it's
not there. Look, try to see it and you hold up a mirror and they can‘t see it. This is
distraction. This is how you lead sheep. It‘s a 5th line theme. We 5th line beings are
here to rule the sheep. Tell the sheep what to do. Bah, bah, bah. And how do you
fool the sheep? You put up a mirror so they don‘t see the wolf, they just see another
sheep. Distraction is a delight. It‘s so Machiavellian. It‘s wonderful, because human
beings need to be distracted. Otherwise, you cannot lead them. They‘re stuck in
their little frame of limitation and you got to distract them just to get them out of
that. It‘s like cows in the field, they‘re all down there in the grass and you go (clap)
and they all lift their heads—what‘s going on? God‘s here.
The detriment is: The natural desire for expansion when limitations are essential and
creates confusion from the top. Everyone has to be led to their death, which is
basically what this is all about. You lead the sheep to their death and basically what
you do is that you distract them until the very last moment. They do that with cows
when they go into a slaughterhouse in the West where it‘s controlled. They‘ve
designed ramps, because what they noticed was that if you line the cattle up and
point them towards the slaughter that the auras, the fact that they can see and feel
all the way down the line that the cows begin to get very upset and have to be
controlled so they built spiral ramps. Imagine; humans are clever folks. And they
built these spiral ramps and the cows have no idea what‘s happening until they get in
the door and then it's over. Distraction is a wonderful thing.
Think about the child that has to have an injection. ―Look over here,‖ ―what did you
do to me?‖ ―We distracted you.‖ This is the only way we can lead you because
basically we know that you're stupid and small and we need to guide you. And we
know that we can never show you the truth. We distract you. That‘s enough. So
what do human beings do more than anything else? They seek distraction. What
does the average person do in the Western world at the end of the workday? You
come home and you turn on the TV. You turn on the television; anything to distract
you, anything to get your mind off of the limitations and the whatever of your life.
And leadership is about distraction, 5th line leadership.

The 5/2
LAC Distraction 2
5/2s are not natural leaders obviously. It's very difficult for them. It‘s very difficult
to accept that no matter what happens whether they're a good leader or a bad
leader they're going to suffer projected abuse. The thing about the 5/2 is that it
never sees its own 2. It can't, after all. So, it never sees this natural resistance
that‘s in it. It doesn't see that others see something in it that they cannot imagine in
their 5 projection system. Though the 2 and the 5 are an unobvious harmony to
each other, the way in which projection works is obviously very different. The 5
Personality is conscious of projection, but it's conscious of the projection on the
Personality, it is not aware of the projection on the body. That is, the 2 that‘s there.
And it's often very, very confusing for them.
The heretic is here to destroy old forms. And here we have an archetype in this 5th
line of destroying old forms. But the destroying of old forms is really a mirror game.
The limitation is always there. You change the perception of the limitation. Think
about what Human Design does for you, it‘s the same thing. You have the same
limitations you always had, but you have a different way of looking at them. That‘s
a new form. You rearrange the way in which you deal with and look at the maya.
This is one of the things to understand about the potential here is that the only way
in which you can really attract at the 5th line, the only way you‘re going to be able to
bring leadership is that you have to get a way in which you can distract people out of
their old limitations. My Package Tour to Eden song—put away all your old
disbelieving, just get rid of all of that. But the moment you get rid of the old the
new carries all of that anyway, it‘s just a different frame. For me, stupid before and
stupid after is the mantra. This limitation, the last limitation, the next limitation, it‘s
all limitation.
But then to shake people up, to get them to move forward to expand, expansion is
part of these theme; expansiveness, the energy for expansiveness. After all, the
60th gate fuels mutation, the format energy for the individual mutative process. So it
is about bringing mutation in. It is about limitations changing over time. What we
couldn't do mentally 20,000 years ago we can do today, we have a different
limitation today than we had then, but it‘s still limitation, it‘s still within the
construct. But there is evolution.
Mutation within any of these, because we‘re dealing with a life force, is the one thing
that the 60 understands. You cannot eliminate limitation, but what you can do is
mutate a new one. And in the deepest expression of what the 5/2 will tell you, it will

We get to the 6 and we get to Rigidity. This is when absolute rigidity is essential,
but with innovative applications to lessen its severity. A fixed energy that is unusual
in its capacity for restraint. These people can be so dogmatic and so restrained that
they end up being permanently and chronically depressed. When you look at all the
lines for the 6, this is perhaps the most difficult of all the lines of the 6, all 64 of
them. This is very difficult.
You‘re at the end of the cycle. You get to the 6th line, and it says, it‘s nice of you to
mutate in this life, but you're still going to die. Nice of you to be available for
evolutionary potential, but you're still going to die. And there's no reward for you
being mutative, you‘re still going to die. Not only that, but your example won‘t last
beyond your death. The 5 lives with the illusion that they'll be remembered by
sheep generation after generation. The 6 realizes that as an example and only as an
example when they're dead they're forgotten.
I was thinking about a lot of things in that context. It‘s this uncompromising. You
see this in the built-in mutative potential of the 6. It does have to go through these
three cycles, nobody else goes through that, so there are enormous demands on the
physical body. We already know that because we talk about it being physically
fragile. And they are very restrained. That is, the 6 as an example will know and
will clearly recognize all the limitations. They‘re going to be wise, after all.
So they're going to be enormously restrained, which means they aren't necessarily
ever going to find their soul mate. It means they have to accept that perfection is
something that will not exist. To accept that in the realm of what is to be human
that trust is something that's deeply limited. And also to understand that being an
example is not in and of itself something that deserves an external reward. The 6
has to come to grips with being different than the 5.
When you see 5s and 6s as left angles, when you see them the 5 is always
determined to make their mark in history—the general, the saint, the savior—you
remember them all. But when you look at role model, yes some role models, every
once in a while somebody says gee there should be more Gandhi‘s. But we have a
tendency to remember the 5s as these father figures, these leaders, these forces
that change our lives. And the 6 has to see that they're ―more advanced‖ than the 5,
and yet, they don't get what appears to be the best reward. The 5 gets the glory.
Even when they‘re burned at the stake they get more glory—Joan of Arc, the Joan of
Arc syndrome, burn at the stake, they remember you forever.

Limitation
So, the heretic gets this glory. That‘s their trip. I will go down in the fires because
they remember me forever, I'm very aware that I‘ll still be around long after I'm
dead. I'm a heretic, I understand this principle. But it‘s not the same reward for the
6. The 6 says, so what this 5 guy introduced it, I actually have lived it and nobody
will remember me. And they‘re pissed. It‘s like; hey I‘m getting a rotten deal here.
Where‘s my immortality?
Then we get to the crux. The 5 has figured out how to beat death. You beat death
by becoming immortal in other ways. It‘s how you transcend the limitations.
Someone will read something of mine or hear my voice long after I'm gone. Not that
it's going to make at any difference to me. Now, it's interesting. But the 6 is so
different. They‘re the next step. They‘re the ones who say, I don‘t need to be
remembered, what a stupid thing that is. I‘m not going to enjoy it. I‘m not going to
get anything out of it. What is this? What do I care whether they know who I am
when I‘m dead. When I‘m dead, I‘m dead.
The real limitation is the rigidity of all this. This is the way, man. I live my life, I live
in correctly, I live it as best I can, I live it as an example and I die and nobody ever
knows about me. That‘s our future in the idealized sense, each being living within
the limitations of their uniqueness. When absolute rigidity is essential but with
innovative—you know, to be an example can be fun and you can be an unusual
example and you can have a good time living your example, but you know that
there's no reward because the door is shutting.
If we didn't have 6s we wouldn‘t really get to the point of recognizing that
incarnations are intended to be open-and-closed-door experiences. That's all. And
that for the 6 coming back is more important than being remembered. The 5
basically lacks that religiosity, that spirituality. The 5 says I may not be coming
back, I don‘t know about all that crap. What I do know is that they‘re going to
remember me. The 6 is only interested in one thing, if I‘m going to come back, it‘s
all okay. I‘ll come back, I‘ll have another life. I‘ll have another go. This is the
game. I don‘t have to make any great marks in the sand.
But you see the 6 is deeply conditioned in this era by the 5. It has been for a long
time, this basic need to leave a mark as an example. Most people think that when I
talk about the 6 coming off the roof to set an example that they in fact become
teachers, that they become 5s or 4s, they don‘t. They just live their life, whatever
that life happens to be. And there isn't anything about ‗you follow me and you be on
my side and you tell your grandchildren that I was great.‘ It‘s not their movie.

what they're here for. They‘re the ones that are always guiding us to the next place.
They‘re always taking us to the next hexagram.
When you think about the relationship between the 4/6 the 4/1, which is where we
put all our attention, we rarely talk about the relationship between the 6/3 and the
1/3, which is just as profound a leap. Remember when we‘re talking about the
transition from the 4/1 to the 4/1 we‘re talking about the unconscious shifting.
When we‘re talking about the transition from the 6/3 to the 1/3 we‘re talking about
the Personality shifting. These are two very, very distinct bridges, and they‘re the
essential binary in what becomes the wheel of life. It‘s not enough that you go from
right angle to left angle, but you‘ve got to go back to right angle and there is no
juxtaposition. There is just this 6/3 stepping into the 1/3. And the 6/3 up here, it
looks over there and it says, I don‘t believe it, it starts again. It actually starts
again. I don't believe it, it actually starts again.
Then you have 6/3s who say can I die now, I want to try this out. Oh, I want to
start again, this life is worth shit, the next one is going to be better. It‘s amazing
this movement between the 6/3 here and the 1/3. It‘s like this believable—I hope
you have that feeling—mutation. It is endlessly hopeless. The whole quarter is so
hopeless. The only solution is be busy with something, anything, to the point of
obscuration, distraction, you name it, any piece of shit that is going to keep you
away from thinking about how terribly terminal all is this and pointless. Then you
get the 6/3 in the 60, limitation after all. And at the very edge of limitation there is
these view that says the next thing is a start codon. What do you mean the next
thing is a start codon? Isn‘t this end?
I love concepts where the beginning is at the end. The 60 looks over there and says
is it possible, is it really possible that it starts again. And you see that not only do
you have the fantasy, but the fantasy is followed by need for it to start again, a deep
need for it to start again. And all of our spirituality and religion and religiosity about
heaven, hell, after life‘s karma, you name it, all that stuff is packed into that view of
the 6/3 looking over and they become the example of all 6/3s, become the example
of ‗I don't really care about this time, there's going to be a next one.‘ Now, it‘s not
like they express it that way. But like the 6 it can be suicidal, that it can let go to a
point—you know the great 6th line of the 33 in retreat, this absolute incredible ability
to just let go, and to let go because you know it's not over, it's just an illusion. The
limitation is an illusion because you can see there's another start, you can actually
see it. It‘s quite a thing.

INCARNATION CROSSES BY PROFILE: Quarter 4
A Digital Book for Students
Introduction
It‘s one of those treats for me to be able to always see the humor of anything. My
preference, my taste is for the funny rather than the sad. It‘s just a more
entertaining aspect of the binary. And when you think about mutation and you think
about it being the final quarter and you think about it being the end, it‘s the
embodiment of our deepest fears of death, before you get to the end you have this
strange 41st gate which starts everything, which means that before you even get to
the end there is already another start in place.
The Root gates that point at the emotional system are very unusual. The three of
them—the 41, 39 and 19—carry with them qualities that impact deeply on what we
call our spiritual or mystical life. What's interesting for me about the life process is
that the 41st gate is the initiator of the human experiential way and it means quite
literally that life and death are simply a continuum. That is, that is as far as what it
is to incarnate into the human experience. When I did global cycles and I talked
about the transformation to the next stage in terms of the end of humanity, the end
of life on this planet we‘re looking at something that doesn't incarnate at all.
This idea of we‘ve been incarnating forever, well, actually it‘s not true. We've been
incarnating throughout this round. It‘s not like we were incarnating before this
round. We were bundled. So, the incarnating business is strictly human. That is,
human in the sense that it's all part of what science would call the evolution out of a
hominid; in other words, the erect variation on the primate line. So in fact, when
you think about it, this is a very, very unusual time in the whole history of the
crystals of consciousness. That is, it is very much something new, this incarnative
process and it is directly tied to what it is to be human.
But more than that, it doesn‘t matter whether you‘ve got the 41 in your design or
not. It is in the world and if you don't have it, you have receptors to it. And literally
what that means is that built into us is a recognition that death is not an end. Now,
it doesn't provide an answer. The 19 tries to do that. But built into us—and of
course, when you think about the way in which the 41st gate works, every single
concept we have ever had about before life and after life is all thanks to the 41st gate
and its fantasy, because it does not know and it cannot know. That stream will
never be aware, that stream from the 41 to the 35. That‘s not its job. The job is the
movement of the energy, the process of being human.
It‘s like the fates; I love the fates, the 30th gate. But I also see that this is a human
construct. In other words, it‘s part of the human experiential process. It‘s part of
the incarnative experiment. This is an incarnative experiment. You‘re never going
to do it again. It‘s sort of like a test, sort of. I hate saying things like that because
then it's always about who's marking it. And there's nobody marking it. And who
gave it, nobody gave it, it's just something that happened along the way. And this

thing that happened along the way tests the capacity of consciousness to operate in
forms.
Basically what we're checking out are all the forms. When I do my weird stuff about
Erons nobody ever says to me how come the mammals get to go too? In the trinary
crystal consciousness of the Eron according to the Voice you have crystals that were
once in mammalian form. It‘s the form that is being experimented with. The
consciousness is just kind of like watching the experiment and seeing how one can
adapt consciousness to certain limitations of form. After all, if you‘re going to end up
in a form in which you can never get out of it and you cannot incarnate into another
one you‘d better have the right one.
The thing that spooks me about the difference between being a human and being an
Eron is that if you've got a lousy vehicle this time you may get a better one next
time. If you‘re an Eron and you get a lemon you have a lemon for several billion
years. That‘s a long time to nurse a lemon. I don‘t want to deal with that. I'm very
human. You‘ve got see that built into us the 41 says, whatever you think, whatever
you're afraid of, there is inside of you here in this place a part of you that dreams
that this is not the end, because it‘s a part of you that knows there is no end, not as
long as we are in these forms. As long as these forms exist we're caught in a spiral
of going back and forward in and out in this experimentation of how to best match
consciousness with form.
Personality Crystals don‘t evolve. Design Crystals deteriorate over time. That actual
deterioration is what leads to differentiations in vehicles. It‘s all a long road of
experimentation to get to the right form. And in fact, my assumption is that it's not
even experimentation, but it's simply a process. In other words, it is a process by
which we can get to the evolved state of a single form that is functional.

The 41.1 is Reasonableness. We‘re on the Right Angle Cross of the Unexpected.
At the end of the story, before the story ends, to have a gate that starts everything
is truly an aspect of the unexpected. Reasonableness is: The imagination to make
the best out of very little. Coolness, where the energy to release feelings is
selective. It‘s also about being a hothead, the urge to release your feelings. This is
after all, a stream of desire; this is a pressure of desire.
What I like is this recognition that this is not the end. It either brings out the
coolness or the hotness, and it really does. There are people that suffer so terribly
when they die. Not so much in the pain that may be associated with whatever that
causes their death, but it is the psychic burning. It is the root of heaven and hell. In

the 41 the recognition that there is another beginning means that there is an
interregnum, there is a place to go. Here is the source of séances and talking to
Aunt Louise after she's gone and trying to make contact with the potential of
afterlife. Here lie fears of the devil and the underworld and all of these things.
But what's strange about the 41 is
the desire to experience it. Nothing
is stronger within us than this desire
to experience it. We would all like to
consciously experience the
consequences of death; all of us.
There isn‘t a single human being
they wouldn‘t mind dying if they
could still keep their mind.
A 1/3 on this cross, taking
responsibility, being able to delegate
responsibility is something very, very
difficult to do. It's hard for 1/3s to
stay cool. And this is an adrenal
gate that is pointing at the emotional
system. The 1/3 is going to go
through its experience of trying to
find a truth beyond this life. That's
the 1 Personality, driving it. But the
3 is going to meet the fact that you
don't get there, that there is somehow something that blocks us from being able to
figure it out. It‘s very hard for 1/3s to be able to get over anything without using
hot desire. It‘s very difficult for them to be cool.
It‘s about imagination. The glory of the 41 is that you can dream what you may
never do. And here lies the roots of faith. One of the things to see about the 1/3
and the 1/4 on this cross is that they are the ones that can dispense the fantasy of
faith, the desire for faith.
It's not the same as what is in the 19 because the 19 actually dares to say that God
is present and will hurt you if you don't obey, which is quite a different story. But
the 41 deep inside recognizes that it's not coming to an end. At least, not
everything is coming to an end. And here this fantasy and it's the delegation of
responsibility. Remember it‘s collective, it has to be shared. Who do you think they
delegate that responsibility to? They give it to a priest. They give it to an imam,
they give it to a rabbi; they give it to whatever. They give it to the other and they
delegate to them the responsibility of instilling in them faith. Let me tell you the
story. If you're a good boy you‘re going to go to heaven. If you live a right life,
you'll have a better karma for the next life, and so forth and so on depending on the
culture.
It‘s giving it over to the gods. You tell us, to their representatives, you tell us. And
tell us from your experience. This is an experiential stream. So the 41 has this

imagination and because it has this imagination and it has this deep inner knowing
that this is not the end they tend to listen to a lot of really silly things and get taken
down a lot of very, very strange tracks. And it is here in the 41 that you see the
diversity of faiths. Tribal religions are very specific. But a tribal religion, the
moment that it opens up into the collective, suddenly breaks up into many, many
lines. This is the 41.
Can you imagine that today there are at least officially over 2000 different variations
of Christianity that are practiced in the world. This is the experiential way. So what
you get out of this is the fantasy that spreads across this whole realm of I have the
desire to complete my experience through death. What is on the other side? How
do I come back? Why do I come back? When you I come back? Who was I? Who
will I be? And on and on and the fantasy that goes with it—I've met a lot of
Napoleons and Cleopatras in my time in the New Age, they're out there.
Making the very best out of very little; this is a very deep message: the very best
out of very little. You get very little in this life, we all know that. The moment you
get to a certain point in your life and you look back you realize it goes so fast. It‘s
such a short little spit in the water. It‘s very little. And in that very little, the 1st line
of the 41 says you cannot have every experience, you can‘t. Delegate responsibility
to others to tell you about things; so you read the books, and you take in
information about other experiences, because you, yourself how little you truly can
accomplish in the world. How little time you have, how little time you have to
wonder.
The 1st line mystically is a line of wonder; how little time to wonder. So you delegate
responsibility and you share that with others and they come back and say to you this
is the way. If you‘re a good Christian you‘re going to sit with God in heaven. If
you‘re bad you‘re going to go to hell. This is in the way; and all the fantasies in
between.
Probably the greatest single piece of writing that I ever read was in was James Joyce
and it was A Portrait of an Artist, and there's this incredible scene, he‘s in a Jesuit
school and there's this teacher describing the pain of hell. And you had to have a
fucking good imagination to describe the hell that he described and how long it
would take, all the birds picking up every grain of sand and you‘d still be there
burning in the fires, and it goes on and on and on, this incredible imagination. And
they are all the children hearing that and going oh, I don‘t want to go to hell.
And all of that rooted at the 41s in every single one of us. The adrenaline system is
not responsible for releasing feelings. The Solar Plexus system is. One of things to
see is that when fantasy becomes obsession when the channel is present this is
where the real test lies. That‘s a separate analysis. That's something to look at in
the 30th gate itself, but to really understand that. The urge to release the feelings in
the 41 is not awareness it is not emotional, it‘s adrenal, it‘s a pressure. And it‘s the
pressure that embodies whatever the fantasy is, but it‘s only when it hits the
emotional system that it can actually take on an aura, that it can actually become a
living force.

RAC Unexpected 4
We know that 1/4s are subject to the conditioning of their families. They‘re subject
to the conditioning of the parents. Making the very best out of very little may not be
something that they learn when they‘re young. And the encouragement of
imagination—a good dream, a good imagination is better than most experiences,
because after all, you always fantasize on your own terms. So many things if you
actually did them would be horrors, absolute incredible horrors.
So, a fantasy is a very healing thing when dealing with desire. The difficulty for
most beings is that desire, because it is so powerful, that the very desire itself
through the fantasy can become obsessive so that one is caught in needing to fulfill
the process, this urge to release feelings, the difference between the cool and the
hot here.

The 2/4
RAC Unexpected 4
Caution—and again, looking at continuity you know the 1st lines, the investigator,
it‘s good to be reasonable. The 2nd line, we know our hermit, it‘s good to be
cautious. Caution: Humanism tempered by pragmatism. I think this is probably one
of the real mantras for any 2/4, how important it is for them—we‘ve gone through a
lot of discussions about the 4 and about the investment in networking and how
important caution is that one cannot afford all the time to be humanistic, that
pragmatism is something that is essential in terms of operating any kind of network.
In dealing with the 2, the exaltation is very conservative. It's about energy for one's
own feelings, but not for others. Basically what that means is that you've got the
energy for your own fantasy. If you really scratch the surface of most human beings
just staying for the moment with the spiritual side because I‘m getting away from all
the mundane related to this, if you say to most human beings do you really think
there's a heaven will say no. Well, I don't know about most, but certainly a lot of
them. It‘s not like it's something you really know. But if you add to that but do you
think there's something after, yeah. And each of them have their own kind of not
knowing about that, a feeling, whatever it may be, and however that's reinforced by
various things they see experientially.
Every time you see a collective news report of somebody who has come back from
being dead on an operating table and they talk about going down the tunnel and
they see the lights and Uncle Louie and whatever, everybody who hears that
resonates. It‘s like this having in the collective this sharing: you have to let me
know. Remember the voice of the 35 that says, I had a lousy experience because of
you. So, one of the things about spirituality as it moves through here is that if God

doesn't help me then I‘m going to blame you, the priest. And at the very worst I'm
going to blame God. It‘s going to get really serious.
So, energy for one's own feelings, not for others. Now, on a mundane plane what
this means is that you've got an experience that you want to have, not an
experience in the collective sense you want to share with others. And of course, this
is not the basis of the 2/4—leave me alone I‘ve got my own little experience here. I
don‘t need to share this experience with you. If I do, the whole process is going to
change.
But what's also interesting is that the 2/4 and the 2nd line likes to get attention.
Nothing gets more attention than a barrier. Barriers get attention. Often people
look at the 2 and say it‘s shy, yeah, yeah. But you only notice that they‘re shy
because you notice them. It's an attraction mechanism. It‘s there to get your
attention. So basically what you have is that you have the dilemma of the 2/4. The
dilemma is, I would like to have my own thing and be left alone, but in this life
people keep on seeing that I should be doing this with them.
And the other side of this is I‘m in here doing this all alone and nobody notices me.
So, I‘m going to have to be noticed. Any time a 2 consciously tries to be noticed
they're really in trouble, because it‘s not going to work for them. So, everything
about this stream, because it is ruled by desire, means that there truly is no real
clarity here. It is so difficult to get clarity. And every single one of these kinds of
dualities that we're going to meet in the lines of the 41 in terms of how they operate
through the profile you get this fuzziness because of the desire. The desire as an
energy is blinding. As a matter of fact, the adrenal desire is often more blinding than
the emotional desire, because it tends to be much more focused.

universalization without the same risks as in the past.
The 2/5, 5/2 in village life is a being that suffers terribly. Everybody's talking about
them one way or another whether good or bad. And it's not like it has to be bad, but
it's always the other projecting on them, always the other thinking they see
something in them, always the other commenting one way or another. So, you end
up with 2/5s or 5/2s that do not motivate themselves because they do not see the
value of it in that they pay such a price for going out of their little hermitage and
getting into the world.

because it's not going to bring them the same kind of auric distress of being
projected on negatively. Virtual is virtual. And this can be of enormous benefit to
them.
The 2/5 wanting to live out that experience on their own can still live it on their own
and cooperate with others and still be totally alone. It‘s like these kids that are
playing a virtual game by themselves, but they're playing it online and other kids are
playing by themselves playing online. Now it is a cooperation of sorts because all of
them participating create a world of activity, but they don't pay the same price.
They die all the time in these games and it doesn't cost anything because they don't
really die. It‘s just part of the game. So, for a 2/5, it‘s the ability to be able to live
out their own fantasy.
The thing that still makes the greatest profit on the Internet is pornography. You
can live out your secret fantasy. And you can live it without the opprobrium that
comes with you going down into that district of that city or village where everybody
knows that you‘re going to get into something a little whatever. There you are in the
safety of your environment. And remember that everything about the 41st gate is
the beginning of experiences and built into the 41st gate is the technological age. It‘s
there. And the advantages of it are there.

The 3rd line is Efficiency and again, in genetic continuity it‘s a lovely way to add
some clarity to looking at the 3 and seeing the efficient nature of the 3. It says that
in times of decrease selfishness is justified, which resonates with the 55.6, which is
the great mutative gate of our time, which is also about selfishness. And you will
notice something very strange about the 41st gate, it is a collective gate. It is the
beginning of the human experiential way. In that sense, it is also the very source of
the collective abstract process. And yet, you can see that in each of the lines of the
lower trigram we have seen lines that don't want to share. Desire is funny. I don‘t
want to share this with you. It‘s my cookie. You can‘t have a bite of my cookie.
In times of decrease selfishness is justified. Now, decrease is another word for
limitation, and nobody knows limitation better than the 41. The 41 knows that no
matter what the fantasy is the fantasy in and of itself is the by-product of the fact
that you can't do it in life. It's already a deep limitation. By the way, if it wasn't for
our imagination there would be so many things we would never do. It‘s the other
thing about the experiential process. This very imagination to imagine all of these
different processes and ways and whatever expands the whole experiential process
of humanity.
The 3rd line is about material ambition and the discipline to go it alone. It‘s so
interesting about the 3, and I talk about the 3 and materialism and it‘s the material
plane and people say where does that come from, you can go right here to this line,
this is the very beginning. And the desire to go it alone, not the desire to share; it

doesn‘t want to share anything, it gets forced to. It gets forced to by the fates, but
that‘s another story. From the 41 side that is not a 30. And on this cross there is no
such connection. It‘s like, hey, what a limitation all this is.
So it‘s material ambition and the energy that fuels the feeling for personal ambition.
When you see this in its mundane application, what you see is the ability to advance
doing your own trip, but still having to do so by being forced to share with others
along the way. I'm a 41.3. I know it so well. I have the detriment, the Moon in
detriment: Instinctive assistance, admirable but in this position misguided, where
two will use up resources twice as fast as one. The energy that fuels the feeling to
share. Here you begin to see it.
My eldest son has his Moon here. He was born with his hand in my pocket. From
birth it was right there in my pocket holding on to my wallet. It's been that way ever
since. He is right there, right on my Moon and here is my 41.3 saying, hey I‘m in
this for myself. I don‘t want to share. I just want to do this thing. And he‘s got his
hand in my pocket. Oh, no, no you give to me. It‘s sweet the way things work.
What‘s interesting about that is that when he was born is when I published the very
first book in Human Design. So, him having his hand in my pocket really made me
work hard.
3/5s have a deep material ambition. They simply do. And of course, reputation is
one of the bedrocks of material success. It‘s astonishing to me how much your
reputation is at risk the moment you run a business. The moment you‘re the head of
anything, the risk you run to your reputation, because there's always going to be—
this is life, all you have to do is look at the 31st gate and understand this 4th line.
This is a life in which no matter what you do if it's good, there are going to be those
people that acknowledgment that it‘s good and there are going to be those people
that think it's bad, regardless. It is the nature of being.
So, for the 3/5 reputation is what gets in the way of their material success. People
expect things from them, whether it's correct or not, project on them that they can
do this or that, and when they make a mistake, natural for them, that projection is
shattered, their reputation is diminished, and therefore they don't have the same
kind of cooperation, they don't have the same kind of loyalty from those that they‘re
working with. It‘s one of the things you recognize as a 5 is that you try to
understand the projection. It‘s very difficult when it's unconscious.
So, the 3/5 here in the mundane plane through the not-self you get two kinds of
beings. You get those that are locked into a material track in which they burn away
all their allies, just burn them away, or you get those on the material track who
simply give it all up and usually for God. I‘m going to take a vow of poverty and
chastity; I‘m going to give it all up.

The 3/6
RAC Unexpected 4
The 3/6 on this Cross of the Unexpected can be very spooky. It's always bizarre for
3/3s always. And as I said, the thing to recognize about a 3/6 is that you really
have to respect their process, because even when they get a chance to go up on the
roof they still have the same pessimistic Personality. It‘s not easy for them.
Selfishness is something that is of value to them.
Remember the vulnerability of the 6th line to begin with, and the vulnerability of the
3/6. We already know that if we're dealing with a transition profile that we've got a
6th Color Personality and a 1st Color Design, there are problems that are inherent in
the vehicle. And it means that their well-being is something that is fragile, or the
maintenance of it is a fragile business and how disruptive it can be in the early part
of their life.
These are often very obsessive people, very obsessive with the material. In other
words, these are the kind of kids when they are old enough, whether that is seven or
eight years old, they‘re already obsessed with making money themselves, getting
enough money, getting enough material to protect them. There is a tendency that
we have to throw money at things to make things better. The 3/6 in their 3/3
process recognizes that there is so much that needs to be made better. And that is
really an ordeal to make it better, and how much that would cost.
So, they‘re very material in their nature. The real dilemma is in the detriment in the
sharing aspect of this line. They can really be used. As 3/3s in the 3/3 phase they
can really be used, they can really get into the wrong thing. And remember we're
dealing with desire. It‘s desire, after all, and it's adrenalized desire. It isn't even
qualified by the emotional system. There is no wave to measure it.
When you‘re looking at the Root, understand something about what it does to the
emotional system. It's always trying to fix the wave. It‘s trying to stop the wave.
That's the whole point. When you‘re looking at the 41, it‘s trying to stop the wave of
the 30 so it will hook into one desire. It understands that if the wave is moving it's
going to change its perspective, it‘s not necessarily going to be open to being
desirable of that particular adrenaline pressure. So it tries to fix the wave, the 39
tries to fix the 55 into saying ―I know‖ instead of ―I don‘t know.‖ The 19 tries to fix
the 49, and fix it into saying ―okay, let‘s make a deal. I give, you obey.‖ Fix it, no
longer looking for other potentials, the tribal bond. So what you're looking at in the
Root is this fixing power.
So the 41 is trying to fix this desire. They can be obsessed with the fact that they
have to share with that person—only if I'm in business with that person am I going
to be successful. And they drive that person crazy. They can be totally obsessive.
The other thing is they can have no sense of material whatsoever. These are the
kinds of people that don't understand that if you keep on using your credit card and

you don't make enough money that at some point you're going to owe a lot of
money. And then you're really going to be under pressure. People are going to call
you up all the time.
This is just the materialism of all gone awry. It becomes locked in the fantasy.
There are people who will spend money on the fantasy that something is going to
happen. I can't afford this, but something's going to happen. Remember that on
the other side of the 41 are the fates and they say, you expected what? Are you
crazy? That‘s really what you thought? You thought you were going to go ahead
and borrow all that money and like that (snap of fingers) it was going to be delivered
to your door? You‘re an idiot. Now, let‘s see how you get through this. And then
you spend 10 years of your life trying to pay it off.
It isn‘t to say that you can‘t get away with it. It‘s so funny about life. Life is a
spectrum. There are people who actually do that and get away with it; who knows.

The 4/6
RAC Unexpected 4
Correction: The successful adaptation to limitation. This is one of my favorite lines.
This is survival of the fittest and eventual flourishing. You notice how friendly and
sharing this transpersonal 4 is. Do you know how bizarre the 41 is? The detriment
is that you have to share. Desire doesn't like mind sharing. It‘s one of the problems
of the desire path. It‘s why when you hook up with a 35/36 that you don't get it if
you're not the 35/36, because in the end you can see that desire is simply something
for the person. The fact that at somebody else has to share it doesn‘t mean it‘s
voluntary, correct or desired. You cannot experience what it feels like to make love
to someone unless there's someone to make love to. And it‘s your desire to
experience it. And the other is just; well, necessary, just necessary.
Survival of the fittest; the energy for adaptation and a deep feeling for survival. The
other side is simply holding onto feelings, spending too much time trying to maintain
relationships. Again you see, here‘s the 4th line, brotherhood/sisterhood,
transpersonal 4/6, it doesn't want to share. And the detriment is it‘s a real problem
because you put too much energy into relationships. It tells you something about
doing the analysis of anyone who is a 4, to see that if they have a lot of abstract
activity in their design or strong abstract definition in their design that it's going to
be a real battle for them to share, and to share not in the sense that they won't deal
with others, but to consciously recognize the other in the sharing. It‘s very difficult
for them. Desire is a blinding force.
I also have to be clear to say that Darwinism is the externalization of truth. Survival
of the fittest is what it‘s all about. It just is. Evolution is based on this. There is no
other way to look at it. I am not a creationist. I don't think that God created the
world 5026 years ago. Evolution is cruel, mutation is dangerous. It‘s just the way
life works. And it is correction, after all. Survival of the fittest is a correction

mechanism. We don't want six fingered children. We eliminate things. Nature
eliminates things. In the wild if you have a disabled infant, you abandon it. You‘re
not going to bother with it. If you bother with that and you‘ll have genetic material
that will continue that problem.
After all, we all know that fascist philosophies of all kinds, not just fascist, but
utopian philosophies have been very much aware of purity of blood lines. It tells you
what their network is all about. This is how they survive. And the quality of the
network, they have to be very careful about what they invest because if they‘re
dealing with the abstracted they‘re dealing with the desire mechanism. The other
thing is of course our typical problem with the 4/6 and its 4/3 phase and this is
where you get in with the wrong crowd and you don't survive. You get beaten down.
Threes are forever getting beaten down.
One of the most vulnerable beings to a 3rd line negative experience is the 4/3
because their Personality is saying, hey look I'm here to be influential for you and
I‘m here to network and here comes opportunism and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
and all of a sudden they get beaten down for it. So we know something that's buried
underneath the 4 is that brotherhood/sisterhood is actually a limitation mechanism
so that they don't waste too much energy in depth. The most dangerous thing for a
4/6 is to put too much energy into any place in its network. The moment that
something out balances the network there is going to be difficulties.
The 4/6 coming off the roof has an opportunity to show us the beauty of adaptation
to mutation. After all, this is what this line is about. And the whole thing about the
human experiential way is that if you can actually get to the 35th gate and
experience progress from the point of reflection after the experience then you know
that you've operated correctly. It doesn't look like it when you're going through. It
never can. It‘s too chaotic. It is a desire mechanism, highly adrenalized, deeply
emotional. And yet, progress is what's at the end of the road and progress is a stop
codon.
As a matter of fact, the 35th hexagram is very strange. It is a codon unto itself.
There is no other matching chemistry to the 35. You‘ve got this very strange
combination between the 41, which is a start codon and this very, very unique 35
that‘s at the other end of the whole system. It‘s a very special process. And when
you get to that other end is when the gift of the collective comes through, this
reflective process, this remembering, revelation, this mind that will take past
experience and break it down into ideas and concepts that can be stimulating that
can open up the possibilities of making sense out of experience.
We need those examples. In other words, we need those examples that can operate
from 41 to the 35 and operate as role models. So that we can see what it looks like
at the other end. So they can tell others what it looks like because remember
everything in this stream is waiting for somebody to tell you. Think about that. If a
41—I think more and more 41s do less and less and less today. I had the wonder as
a 41 to be to be born in an era where television had just emerged, at the end of the
40s. And I grew up in a world where I could see other parts of the world without
travel. I could see so many things in the world that never had been possible before.

where you‘d get some pictures about news of the world, but not the kind of thing
that was in your house, in your room. The whole thing about the 41 is that the 41
can be satisfied with just the fantasy, and there's an enormous realm of fantasy
available. I don‘t have to climb the Himalayas, I don‘t. I don‘t have to climb
Everest. There must be 75 books now written by people who have climbed Everest.
There is so much material on how to climb Everest. The last people went up with

get inside your virtual machine. If they could make love that way, eat that way,
particularly if they were Projectors, they would never ever come out in the world
again. You would never see them. It‘s the perfect fantasy realm.
Not only that, if you give them a virtual environment where they can indulge their
fantasy, you‘d never see them, ever, ever. They would get colder and colder and
colder, eventually they would sit in ice cold bathtubs, like H.P. Lovecraft, and instead
of writing weird stories they‘d be playing on the Internet with masks and stuff.

Authorization: The external recognition of one's potential despite limitations. This
is the fuel for properly channeled feelings, despite limitations. It also could bring out
negative feelings, because of limitation and everything is a limitation. And the
limitation is that you are desire and you have no outlet. You have desire and have
no outlet and that is always, always the limitation. What's important is that—oh, I
hate saying this—5s are natural channelers. And all I mean by that is that they are
the ones who have the ability to present a heretical desire. They're the ones that
have the potential to present a heretical desire. And by presenting it, influences
others.
After all, it is the heretics that give us a new experience and give us a new collective
experience by challenging whatever the old order happens to be. And this is the
external recognition. If you want to understand why 5s are projected upon, here
you see it. It‘s built into the beginning of every genetic sentence. At the very
beginning of every genetic sentence in the very capitalization of the first letter of the
first word of that sentence is by the
way, project on the 5. It‘s there.
By the way, project on the 5.
Whatever it is, by the way, project
on the 5. So, the 5 gets this
authorization which means it‘s the
5 that says you I'm jumping over
this castle and it‘s the other one
who says if you can, I can. Then
we see the survival of the fittest.
But that‘s another story.
If you are governed by your desires
and you are a 5/1 and you don't
know any better, life is going to
beat you up. You don't want to be
a heretic here. To be this kind of
an alpha is really risky, risky
business, risky business. I'm so
glad I‘m a Clarion. Because here
you're on the experiential path and
you're going to take the heat if anything, anything goes wrong. And you don't really
know what's going on because your fantasy is not the same as what happens by the
time the fates get through with you. You don't know. And yet, it‘s the 5 that pull
everyone along. And it‘s not like they‘re pulling them along knowing what‘s going to
happen. That‘s the whole thing.
It‘s like me; I didn‘t know what was going to happen. How the hell was I suppose to
know what was going to happen? That 18 years later I'll still be doing this. I had no
idea. This is the whole thing about the external recognition power. It was the
external recognition. Whatever my desire in my 41 to be efficient in the way in
which I live out my fantasy without the external recognition in the 5 theme, nobody
would have paid any attention. I always tell 5s that yes you get projected on but

The 5/2 again in this era can take advantage of being able to get external
recognition without the threat to their reputation and without allowing people into
their lives. I love the fact that I can run a business as a network and I don't have to
have the people I work with, all of them anyway, in my aura. I work with people
I‘ve never physically met. It's just done through Design and the Internet. And for a
5 you‘re really protected. Particularly a 5/2, 5/2s are very vulnerable. You don‘t
want somebody coming inside. It scares you. It‘s bad enough you‘re suspicious at
the Personality level, but the fact that they're seeing something that you don't even
see in yourself makes you even more suspicious of them.
When you do that virtually and you get recognition, because that's what it is, you get
external recognition—by the way, I don't know what you were trying to say in that
blog of yours, but I saw something really brilliant in what you were saying.
Somebody reads the 5 whatever, the seduction, and inside they see the 2 magic,
because there is always 2 magic. This is a way that they can go through that
process without being physically uncomfortable. Paranoia is a very uncomfortable
thing. All 5s have to deal with paranoia in their lives.

The 6/2
LAC Alpha 2
When we go to the 6th line we come to a fundamental dilemma that all 6th line beings
have to deal with. Everything that we have learned about the tripartite process, that
is, the 6th line being going through the three different stages in their life. What we
talk about is this movement from the subjective stage, that is, the first Saturn cycle,
the objective stage, which is going up on the roof and then this synthesis or this
quantum of coming off the roof as an example, as a role model, as somebody who is
operating correctly according to their own authority.
Now, the 6th line here is the line of Contagion. And that should ring a bell because
we have crosses of contagion. It is: The law that the maximization of potential not
only ends decrease, but inevitably such transcendence benefits others. Now, think
about the nature of this line. You have two sides to this. You have one side that
says as an example I'm going to be able to provide benefits for others. Here in the
line it is the father whose success will benefit the children. Now, that doesn't
necessarily mean the biological father. In other words, a father/mother figure who
by their very example can provide for the other and for the benefit of the other.
That is, the fuel for recognition through feelings.

But the other side of this is keeping the transcendence, that is, keeping your
example to yourself and not sharing it with others. Now, remember the dilemma
that we‘ve seen through the 41st gate. It is this dilemma that despite the fact that
it's the beginning of the deepest collective process it does not want to share. It just
wants its experience. And what's so interesting about the 6th line is that it is
assumed, now of course, it‘s a blue line, so it's assumed in the long run, that 6th line
beings are going to get to this place of transcendence where they are going to be the
role model, and that they are here through their experience to benefit others, or with
their fantasy to benefit others. The guy that says to the teenager, ―plastics,‖
pointing the way, ―go do that boy, there‘s the way for you, technology, invent a
virtual game.‖
The line is: The law that the maximization of potential not only ends decrease—
limitation—but inevitably such transcendence benefits others. And this is the
enormous pressure on the 6th line being to be an example for the benefit of others,
not for yourself. They don't like that. They don't mind being an example but they‘re
an example because it's their way to survive. It is correct for them. If you come off
the roof and you're not correct life is going take care of you. It‘s going to take you
straight to death, and you can come back again.
You can also see that part of the fantasy of the 41 is that in knowing that there is a
continuation in the life process there are also ways to rationalize it. My immortality
is in the genes that are in my children, and that those genes will eventually travel
down a long line of descendents and so forth and so on. And this is inherent in this
6th line as well. But I'm more interested in the underlying dilemma. The dilemma
that all 6th line beings have to deal with if they are going to be role models, leaders,
to be trusted, are they willing to be an example for others? This is the big question
for them.
The negative of this is somebody who is repressed. I think that whenever you look
at a 6th line being, you will see that their 3rd line process when they're young results
in them having to repress many, many things in order for them to even make it to
the roof. And that the very roof process is a process of—isn‘t distance amazing.
When I think back to my experience with the Voice which was so physically intense,
the pain, the fear, the adrenaline rush, all of those things, they‘re gone. It‘s like it
wasn‘t that tough because it‘s gone.
One of the things about the 6/2 process is that so much of the 3/2 is so painful in
terms of their feelings—after all, we‘re dealing with feelings here—that they don't
want to pass the example on. Now, that can be seen as a positive. And again, I
want you to see that exaltations, detriments are just another nuance on the same
thing. And most human beings, even when you have it fixed, you still get to
experience the other side of whatever line is there. It‘s there, the receptors are
there. Every 6th line being has to deal with this dilemma.
The 3rd line person has a responsibility to tell other people when something doesn't
work. It‘s their responsibility. And here you can see that the 3/2 experience is the
foundation of not living what doesn't work. So many people live things that don't

work. They live all kinds of things that don't work for them, whether they are diets
or spiritual paths or careers they've taken. There are all kinds of things that people
live that do not work for them and they repress their feelings about it and they don‘t
let others know that they are uncomfortable, cannot be this way in the experience.
This is supposed to be the maximization of the potential of form. And when you get
to the end of the 6th line process in the 41, which initiates everything—whatever you
think of as human is here. One day some brilliant whatever is going to sit down and
describe the whole history of humanity through these 6th lines. And I know that it
can be done. It's all here, everything about us is here.
So, when you get to the end it‘s telling you something. It's reading the tea leaves of
the future, if you will. It says something so profound about the 6th line being. It is
here to maximize the potential of form; not the 5, not the 4, not the 3, not the 2, not
the 1, but the 6. It‘s the end of the line. We see that the form is mutating, we see
that there is a transformation in the form taking place specieally. You have to see
that the 6th line mutation is all about that maximization of the potential of form.
So there is a burden on the 6 to be correct in a way in which no one else has to be
correct and this is the Cross of the Alpha. Now the Alpha, the 6 on this cross is here
to demonstrate clearly the advantages of correctness for the benefit of others. And
if we do not have the examples, the experiential way does not give us the progress
we need.

The 6/3
LAC Alpha 2
The 19; the Cross of the Four Ways is something very mysterious. It‘s the bookend
of the Sphinx. The 19th gate is filled with so many primitive things, primitive things,
very old things, deep, deep alignments with the mammalian spirit, deeply violent and
physical. And there is this place in this 6/3 in its fantasy where it looks out and it
wonders about this and that and then it sees something quite horrifying. It sees that
the cycle begins each time in a deeply primitive process. It's not like you get to that
6/3 and you say I'm going to benefit others. Well yes, but the baby that is being
born has to start at the very beginning all over again, and that they cannot be born
correct.
Remember, at the deepest possible level, the not-self is normal, unfortunately. This
is the dynamic of the evolutionary pattern. No not-self, no mutation to rave. And
it‘s only now that the window is open that we can break this cycle. But when the 6/3
looks out and looks over and says, no really? And the magic is that it‘s changing. It‘s
changing because the 55 and the 49 are the same codon, histidine. And that the 49
is in secondary mutation to the 55. And there is a breaking up this connection
between the 49 and the 19. And when we break that connection what the 41, 6/3 is
looking at is something it‘s never seen before.

The thing that fascinated me about the 41 is that it wants to be an individual. It
doesn‘t want to be collective. It‘s wants to be an individual. The fates will change
that. But it wants to be an individual. And what the individual wants to experience
the most is mutation. So, when you get to this alpha cross to the 6/3, what you get
is to a place of deep, deep, deep depression. I hope for them that once we get past
2027 the ones that come in on this cross who carried this configuration won't have
that response when they stare over at that 19 because that 19 will operate very
differently.
But incarnation has laws. Those laws are very strict. There is no knowing. There is
no true remembering. It does not exist. There is only another beginning, another
beginning out of the mammal, another beginning out of the mammalian body, out of
the mammalian womb, what we are. Not this transcendence to a higher form, a
higher life.
We know it‘s built into the 6. We know that mutation is bringing that, but not
specifically for this being who is in alpha on this cross with a 6/3 and they go
through that 3/3 process and they see that form cannot be maximized to its full
potential. Over and over and over again they see that. And they see very clearly
that life comes to an end and that there‘ll be another time, but so what.
The 6/3s are the beings that have the most difficult bridge to make. They have to
bridge with the 1/3. The difference between a 6 Personality and a 1 Personality is an
ocean of difference. It‘s easy to go from the 4/6 to the 4/1. It‘s the same
Personalities. It‘s very easy for them to think about themselves in the same way.
But the 6/3 to the 1/3, the only thing they have in common is pessimism. It‘s all
they have in common. The 6/3 looks over there and goes, ah, shit, no, no, again. I
have to start again? I don‘t want to start again. And I don‘t want to be an example
for starting again.
So here you have these forces that stand up as examples and they say I don‘t
believe in afterlife. I don‘t believe in any reward. I‘m left angle, I do not believe in
karma. And on and on and on—I don‘t believe in any of that shit. Look over there
at that 1/3 over there; you look at that 19, 1/3, that‘s really scary. If you're an
alpha and you're looking at the 19th gate it‘s like, oh shit, no. I have such empathy
for them. They‘re always staring at that 1/3 over the horizon and it's like (sigh)
okay.
What is interesting for them is that they often very powerfully release their
repressed feelings when they come off the roof. I‘ve described many ways that 6s
come off the roof—scratching, clinging, the 6s that hold on, the ones that jump off
and jump back up; all of these variations that are there. This 6/3, when it‘s looking
at going down into that pit, not only doesn't it want to come off the roof, but it
actually would like to go in the other direction.

And what it does is that it puts out this enormous frequency of despair. We have so
many despair examples walking around in the world. These beings are an incredible
force. They have been drenched in pessimism at a very, very early age. How can
one be an alpha with such pessimism, unless one is a negative alpha? It's a
negative alpha. There are positive alphas and negative alphas.
Look at the gate. Look at the 31 leadership for good or bad. And again this dilemma
of the 6—is it worthwhile to be an example for others? The 6/2 says maybe. The
6/3 says, I don‘t know. I don‘t see it. And at the mystical level, the 6/2 says if I'm
perfect in my form perhaps there is a reward. And the 6/3 says if I'm perfect in my
form the best I'll get is death.

Introduction
The gate of wanting, Approach: That all things are interrelated is apparent and
manifested through the action of approach. That all things are interrelated—now, let
me ask you a very simple non-rocket scientist question. If this gate is about
everything is interrelated and this gate is about to mutate, one of the things that
we‘re going to see is that not all things are interrelated. It's one of the deepest
changes that comes with the emergence of the rave. In other words, we will not be
able to interrelate with them. But not only with them, but our ability to interrelate
with mammals is going to change.
Something very funny in the news the other day was a very strange piece from the
State of Wisconsin in the United States. It was legislation in the local legislature to
create a law that would allow for the killing of feral cats. Now a feral cat is a house
cat that's wild or a house cat that doesn‘t have a collar. And they obviously have a
problem with, as most places do—we have an enormous problem here in Ibiza with
feral cats. One of the byproducts of 2027 will be a very different relationship
between humans and what we call pets.
The 19 is a funny gate. The 19 has to do with so many things. But at its deepest
level, the 19th gate is really about our relationship with mammals. Our ability to
cultivate meat as a diet has given us enormous potential as a species. We have a
very special relationship with mammals. And the 19/49 is a cross-specieal
connection. The breaking of the 19/49, not only what I discussed with rave children
that they will not be able to tolerate meat products, but also to be able to see that
the relationship between humans and mammals is going to change. We‘re not going
to be able to relate to them in the same way.
I want to tell you something else. I don't discuss it very much because I've seen
that the moment you bring up this subject people go crazy. But there is something
called the DreamRave. One of the things about the DreamRave is that there are
special gates. These gates are cross-specieal gates. When a human being is
horizontal they take on what appears to be the matrix of a mammal. And the 19th
gate is a portal to what is known as the Demon Realm.
The thing that is so interesting is that not only will we no longer be able to relate to
animals, but our dream life and the dream life of humanity as a whole is going to be
altered radically when that mutation sets in because there is no longer going to be
what most people call the astral. Most people when they're dealing with the dream
analysis of what are aggressive, dangerous dark dreams, not nightmares but the
kind of thing where you're dealing with a lot of heavy forces, many people refer to
this field, this astral. It's clear to me that that's going to dissolve in the same way
that—I do write good science fiction movies. Imagine what that's like when the bell
rings in 2027 and your favorite dog Fido eats you for breakfast. Anyway, that‘s quite
a thought. I‘m going to make sure I don't have dogs when I‘m that old.

The 1/3
The Right Angle Cross of the Four Ways—the line is: Interdependence: the
successful approach that does not lose its individual character in acceptance. That
is, the pressure of wanting without losing one's identity. This is the basis of need.
It's also about not losing one's identity when being accepted by others. And of
course, this is deeply tribal so you‘re looking for support.
The detriment is: The tendency once an approach is accepted to get stuck in
continued reflection at the expense of continued development. This is about the fear
of rejection. So everything about
the 1st line of the 19 is that I need
what you have and I'm afraid you‘ll
reject me. What is going to happen
when there's no 49 to answer that?
It is something to really ponder.
There will be no 49 ultimately to
answer that call. That channel is
snapping.
Perhaps the greatest dilemma for
the 1/3 is that in having a trial and
error life they‘re at risk in losing
their identity and this is what this
line speaks to. And it says that the
identity of a 1/3 is something that
can be preserved through proper
support. But who is going to
support that identity? And
remember that it's very hard to
think about the 19 without thinking
about the basic courtship demands that are rooted in the tribe. This is resource
hunting. And whether it is resource hunting for a partner, for a friend, for a lover, or
whatever the case may be, the 19th gate is always in need of those resources.
Remember those resources are going to disappear. The 1/3 is going to run into the
dilemma that the trial and error is going to bring it pain. Things don't work out and
they lose faith in interdependence. This is very risky. There‘s nothing worse than a
19 that is afraid of rejection. When you meet a 19 that‘s afraid of rejection these are
people that are so sticky it's frightening. They‘re the kind of people that get invited
to somebody's house for dinner and you find them later in the kitchen washing their

dishes. They'll do everything to be accepted. And of course, obviously that could
become a dilemma.
When you‘re dealing with the 19 you also have to see that the 19 is the root of all
our religions, not our mysticism, not our spirituality, but our religions, and this need
for support, this need to be supported in one's belief process. The tribe prays
together. It doesn't like individual relationships with God. It wants everybody to be
together so that it can be controlled. It is a form of glue, after all.

The 1/4
RAC Four Ways 4
If you‘re a 1/4 and you‘ve got a mother who is very needy and clingy, you end up
being somebody who spends their life thinking that‘s the way you get acceptance, to
be clingy and needy. And of course, this can be very, very painful. The 49th gate is
the gate of rejection. There‘s always this potential of being rejected by the 49,
always. And you have to see what kind of pressure that is for the 19.
The other thing is that all our religions are based on being rejected by God. If any
one of these cardinals in the conclave today—right now, or later this afternoon
they‘re beginning the process to choose the pope. If any one of these cardinals
divulges anything about what takes place in the Sistine Chapel they are
automatically excommunicated. That‘s a heavy trip. Acceptance—to be accepted
means that if you want to get the resources you have to be able to submit to tribal
authority. And tribal authority always ends up being a 21 controlling you. It just
does; tribal authority.
Our religious systems are going to break down. They‘re going to break down
because the gate breaks down, not because their inherent underlying themes of
Godhead are going to be disproved, it's just the structure is going to break down. It‘s
like the temples crumbling. It was always my fantasy to smash temples. I would
only save the really pretty ones. Some of them are really pretty. And then I don't
have to do that, because the internal temple is being smashed all on its own by the
evolutionary process.

When you see the 2nd line here and you see that it is about Service you also
understand something about this whole business of shyness. It‘s here to be called
and called to service. The missionary 2/4s get called out to be of service. The
dedication of personal resources—and in a sense in the 2 you can see this is finally
them dedicating their talent as a result of external contact. And here you have an
archetypal 2nd line description. Personal resources dedicated as a result of external
contact—you don't give until you‘re called. You don't serve until you‘re called.

Approach
And then what do we hear in every tribal organization? You are called to service.
You‘re called to serve in the church, you‘re called to serve in the army, you‘re called
to serve in politics, everybody says it's a call to service. The 2nd line Democrat, the
2nd line theme of being called, and in the context of the 2/4 it‘s a true archetype of
being called to offer influence through your network, to be of service to those in your
network.
This is the Tupperware line. Tupperware is household goods. And in America the
only people that could sell them were just housewives that would have an
independent entrepreneurial license and they would go around to their neighbors and
they would have so-called parties, Tupperware parties, where they would invite all
these bored housewives over and they would chitchat and then they would display all
these wonderful pieces of plastic. You know, to be of service to your network. This
is the 2/4.
It doesn‘t matter what you‘re called to. The 19 says there's so many things to be
called to, so many things to be called service to. You call for service for plumbing,
for electricity, carpentry, you name it, you call for service from the butcher, it‘s all
call for serve. Then you wonder why the tribe is responsible for our service society,
and it is. They expect service. And by the way, a 19 expects to be served. As needy
as they are, it‘s not like they want to grovel, they expect to be served. The 19 virgin
expects to get a big rock from the 49, a nice two carat, a nice cut, glimmering and
shining. It's not like it's just ―I need. I need‖ you want some servicing as well.
Dedication and service to the highest values or protracted indecision, but given the
nature of this position eventual compliance. The need to be wanted that will
eventually turn its energy to service. You want, you have to give. You want God to
look after you, serve God. You want your prayers to be answered, dedicate one day
a month to the church. Give us a tithe; give us your day of labor, whatever it may
be. And of course, this is not just in that context. You have to see that it runs
through every level of tribal life. You have no idea how devastating the curtain
drawing on this era is going to be when we enter into the next in terms of the way in
which we look for our resources.
I used to say to 19s to make sure you always have a full refrigerator. But if there's
no receptor to the 49, how do you fill up the refrigerator? There is no God to help
you, there is no mammal that is going to volunteer to be slaughtered, and that‘s a
different movie.

you can do very differently. Just think about it in very, very simple terms. There

are more people looking for partners on the Internet than in bars and cafés. That's
never been—this is very strange.
Do you know how many millions and millions of people are looking for their partners
on the web? This is a classic 2/5 world where you can make yourself available
virtually, where you can get your virtual resources. There are people that meet each
other on the web who never will meet each other physically. They just like that kind
of relationship. They have somebody to relate to. They get from it a resource that
they need, whatever that resource happens to be. It‘s like people in chat rooms.
It's very important for 2/5s and 5/2s to understand that technology is an ally for
them, that they can benefit from the technological world, that they can find a way to
be hermits in a way in which they are not uncomfortable with being able to make a
contribution in one way or another.
All 2s, whether 2/4s or 2/5s, are profoundly called to service in their life. All of
them; they just don't necessarily hear the call. We know that. The 2/4, the 2/5 is
deeply resistant to the other. They‘re designed to be resistant. We've seen that.
It‘s part of their cleverness, after all. And yet at the same time to recognize the
demands on their resources when they do accept the call; it‘s the thing they get.
The 2/5 says, if I answer this call I have to give so much of myself and if it doesn‘t
work what a price I will pay. This is why the 2 is there. Otherwise, the 2 would be
promiscuous. It would be all over the place. It can‘t because it doesn‘t have the
juice. It doesn‘t have the power for that. It only has the power for the right calls;
nothing more, nothing less.

The 3/5
RAC Four Ways 4
The 3rd line is Dedication and it's all about vigilance. This is a stream of sensitivity
and these are potentially the most oversensitive of beings. Sensitivity and ease
fueled by acceptance. In other words, your sensitivity only grows and your ease
only becomes evident when you are accepted by others. And for a 3 that goes
through trial and error how difficult it is as a 3/5 on this cross, how difficult this is to
finally get to a place of sensitivity and ease.
What tends to happen is that the very wanting leads to oversensitivity to rejection
and not just rejection. It's the kind of thing where you want to be with people and
they let you be there because they assume that you‘re going to hang around
anyway. Not because they really want to be there. And you're immediately
oversensitive to the fact that they don‘t want you there, even though you're there.
It‘s difficult, but you need the resources.
You can't imagine how demanding the 19 is. It‘s so demanding. It wants so much.
And it's one of the very few adrenal gates that knows something clearly. It gets
nothing without the other side. The 45 gets its fantasy. The 39 gets the advantage

of seeing others provoked. But the 19 cries alone, rejected, not having what it
needs, what it wants, what it sees as being absolutely essential.
Understand that desire is something that you already know you don't necessarily get
the results of it. It‘s like passion. You know that you're not necessarily going to
have too many great passions in your life. But need never goes away. Its basic
needs, its primary needs, its primal needs, the need for security, the need for
authority, the need for God, the need for food, need, need, need. And you always
need as long as you're in a body. As long as you‘re in one of these things it‘s all
need.
So, one of the things here with the 3/5 is that there is a projection from the
beginning that the 3/5 gets from the other and the other says, aha, these ones,
we‘re going to accept them right away, because they're just what we need. And the
3/5 immediately screws it all up. And that rejection creates oversensitivity. It‘s very
difficult. 3/5s are by nature touchy. You know this expression ―touchy‖? You don‘t
want to say the wrong thing to them because they immediately project on it in their
paranoia through their life experience that you're saying something bad about them.
You‘re talking about a totally different thing. They may not even be talking about a
person; they're already getting oversensitive. Are they talking about me? Do I have
to leave town again? Is the jig up? Is it all lost?
And they‘re dedicated to it, dedicated to be accepted so they can be at ease. Then
you get to see something about the 3, how satisfying it is to be accepted by others
and how easy it is for them to do that. All the 3/5 has to do is say, look, I just found
out that this doesn't work. And immediately the other side says you‘re of value.
This is the whole thing for the 3 to understand, the only way that they can gain
acceptance from others is guiding them on the plane of experience and in most cases
what you get in this line is that you pay for the privilege.

The thing that gives the 3 power is that it can confront any obstacle and survive on

for others, to take the blow for others—think about a 3. There they are with a life of
hard knocks. And the only people that will accept them are those people that want
them to continue taking hard knocks for them. It's like what for.
The 3/6 in this variation will actually buy friends. And I don't mean that in the most
corrupt sense, I just mean that in the sense of the kid who will always buy a piece of
bubble gum for their friend as a way of keeping that person their friend, as a way of
maintaining the acceptance, material bribery. And of course, for the 3/6 who goes
through the 3/3 stage in which it seems like there is no way to be accepted for who
you are that there may be a way to be accepted if you can pay for it and people do
all the time. You have to pay to be in one of these organized churches, social clubs,

It‘s all part of the 3s connection to the material plane. But the 3/3 is deeply, deeply,
oversensitive. And that becomes a theme that you can take to any 3/6, 6/3

In other words, they take in frequencies that can be very unhealthy for them in the

The 4/6
RAC Four Ways 4
You can see clearly that when 4s aren‘t Team Players then they‘re really in trouble.
It‘s: Individual approach which attracts and accepts cooperation. It's about a driving
force that can benefit the whole group. And it‘s about exalting in the company of
others, being exalted in the company of others. Now, we have a vast difference
between the 3 and the 4. There‘s the 3 in the narrow tunnel banging into stuff and
all this demand that they support and cooperate when all they can see is the damn
thing in front of them and they're more concerned about dealing with that than
anything else. They don't realize that being all upset because the fridge is empty is
taking away from the time they could be spending with others who would fill up their
fridge. They don‘t get that. They‘re just trying to fill it up on their own.
The 4‘s only job is look across the way. It looks over there and says, aha, I see.
They‘re clever folks. But a 4 is useless without a network. One of the things I most
enjoy about sports is I love seeing the standings, the order of performance, how well
teams are doing relative to each other and all the statistics that are in that. You can
always tell the worst team. They‘re at the bottom of the table. And you can always
tell the best team, they‘re right at the top. And when you're thinking about 4s, this
is the only way you can measure them—how big is their network and what is the
quality of the size of that network. And you can measure it.
There are many, many 4s that have a very, very narrow network. It was a direct
result of their 4/3 experience. They got into the wrong thing; they did not get to
network properly. They didn't get to learn how to use their energy efficiently
because remember networking for a 4 is the balancing of its energy as it moves
through the network. And that what they invest in that is the network they must
maintain and yet they must maintain things that are not productive for them. There
are only some things in the network that are going to be rewarding.
This line is saying we know you build networks, but you have to build a network in
which you are exalted. That's the goal of every 4, to have the network that exalts
their potential to be of influence. If you're a very smart kid and you're hanging out
with very dumb kids, it may be that you‘re learning how to be a physical the way
they are, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you've learned how to network
properly. You haven't. And you're not using the right energy to maintain the
network. This is one of the most important things for 4s.

It's also a sensitivity energized by the limitation of others. Then you can see the
deep meanness that can arise in any 4—here I thought you were going to be part of
my exalted network and you turned out to be a waste of my energy. I invested in
you for years and I got nothing from you. Nobody keeps score better than a 4. That
rhymes, it's perfect, it's a mantra for the future: Nobody keeps score better than a 4.
And it‘s true. They keep score. They know their networks; all 4s know their
networks. And they know who has delivered and who hasn't. That‘s them.
The whole thing is that when you see it here you begin to understand this is about
the potential exaltation of this process, but you have to go through the 4/3 and it‘s
tribal. It‘s so tight and sticky. It‘s all this, you‘ve got to support them. If you get in
the wrong crowd and you network that crowd and you're the natural team leader you
become that. And within the tribe, they don't let you out. They don‘t let you step
away from that. You can‘t step away from that. There are laws in the tribe; in for a

juxtaposition that has a very straight
line of influence to be totally
dependent on cooperation, to be
totally needy of cooperation. In most
cases these are children that are
simply raised without advantage.
And obviously in our world, even
though 4/1s might represent about 3
1/2 percent of humanity, that‘s still a
lot of children and still a lot of people
and it's still a lot of people who given
the lack of advantages are not going
to find a cooperation necessary to
get what they need.

This is a poacher profile. Poacher is somebody that goes into a game farm and kills
an animal that's protected, or goes and kills animals that you're not supposed to kill
because they don't get the cooperation. If I don't get the cooperation and I can‘t fill
up my refrigerator what do you expect me to do? Starve? I‘m in need. And the
need is more important than anything else. It‘s a deep, deep driving force, not to be
trifled with, I should add.

The 5/1 & 5/2
I like the close here, this refinement. It‘s like well, okay, here we are, we come
around, we‘re back on the wheel, we enter into this world of neediness, we have to
deal with a life that is a life of neediness and the only thing that we can really do
ultimately is to continue refining the process. And you see that with even in the
tribe, which is the most conservative
of the circuitry, that there is this
ultimate recognition that the tribe
must go through refinement, and you
see that. When you look at the Gauls
today they‘ve refined, to a point.
When you look at the Catalans
they‘ve refined to a point. In other
words, when you look at tribes you
will see over time that despite the
power of their tribal support
mechanisms there is a refinement
that takes place.
What is refinement? Look at the 1-2;
that‘s the answer. Refinement is the
alignment of the tribe to the
universal mutative direction of
evolution. It's this alignment. And
when the 49 goes away the 19 will
have to use this track. It‘s not going
to be able to go to the emotional system anymore. It's only going to be able to get
into the Sacral. And the way in which we're going to operate in terms of our needs
is going to be dependent on response and response only. That‘s going to be very
different.
In the adrenal configuration need is constant and pressurized. But in the Sacral
configuration or through the Sacral filter it will be determined by response. If we

don't respond to the need, the need will no longer exist. The 19 is going to change
in that sense. What does the Left Angle Cross of Refinement require? It requires
Sacrifice: The need to limit personal potential in order to achieve a larger goal. This
line pisses me off, being a 5 myself. I could've spent my life on a rock 'n roll stage
and look at what I do. It‘s really sick. What a day job. I could be snorting cocaine
and having a good time, and here I am sacrificing my personal potential for the
greater good. [Laughter]
The self-restraint fundamental to such a nature; energy to keep one's sensitivities
restrained. I‘m a 49. I look over there: A tendency in sacrifice to condescend. I
know this really well. Yes, yes you‘re a Generator, oh good, why don‘t you respond;
wait until I ask you. I think 5s invented pontification. They‘re the only saints and
saviors. Well, my children—sacrifice.
You can see how pissed they are. It‘s like, all right, we‘ve got to do it. What that
really is is that in this configuration this is the tribe accepting the fact that mutation
can no longer be avoided. It‘s like the Japanese when the first American battleship
showed up in 1870. It was like, I think swords are out. I think we‘d better do
something or we‘re really in trouble. It's really nice to play with the swords, but
bullets are bullets. The tribe eventually gets these messages. This is the ‗all right, all
right, I understand, I have to dedicate myself to trying to bring the tribe into the
mutative force.‘
Sacrifice also fuels a lack of sensitivity. It speaks perfectly of Jesus. Boy, I‘ll really
piss people off. I don‘t mean that. Think about that as a line; it‘s very funny:
sacrifice can fuel a lack of sensitivity. So, you‘re there on the cross, you‘ve sacrificed
yourself and yet you have no sensitivity whatsoever, none. I‘m not doing this for
you, you idiot. I had no choice and it hurts. What did he say: My God, my God, why
have thou forsaken me. What the hell is this all about? No, I‘m doing it for you.
Come on up here and try. You do it for me. It‘s so funny, it‘s like the people—bless
their hearts—that end up in places where they‘re tortured. They go through all of
this and there is some stupid talking head on some program somewhere talking
about their sacrifice so that we can—prisoners of conscience.
Anyway, so we know that one of the things about the nature of the heretic is here in
this way. And what it really says is that the heretic sacrifices their personal process
for a larger goal. And obviously that is a risky piece of business at any level and it
doesn't have to be the dramatic savior level. Every 5 deals with this dilemma;
because there is a projection field on the 5, the 5 is automatically called to sacrifice.
When I see somebody coming towards me it‘s not like I need to fill my space with
them. Being a 5 it‘s like, well, what do they want, because you know that the
moment that they‘re in whatever it is you‘re going to sacrifice something of yourself
for a larger goal, whatever that is, whether that's just giving them directions,
answering a question, whatever the case may be, every 5 is deeply aware of that.
You‘re dealing with a pressure gate. The one thing that you want is that you want to
be able to use your energy efficiently. So this business of limiting personal potential
is often limiting certain kinds of energy in order to be able to provide other kinds of

energy for other processes. The 5s have a problem from the moment that they‘re
born that the projection on them leads to dismay. All 5s wonder about whether or
not they can be a success in life. They really do. It seems like that they themselves
get carried away with their own projection, the projection that they cannot live up to
the projection, that they cannot do those things that they even imagine that they
can do.
So, it's not easy for them to get to a point in their life where they're willing to say, all
right, I will give up my life to you. I know this formula. It's an enormous demand to
step away from what is your own purpose to serve the purpose of others and it's a
helpless, obviously. Fives are not humanitarians. This is not their nature. The only
thing that even comes close to being a humanitarian is a 4 and even that smells
funny. A 5 lives in the world that it has. It can only fulfill what is ever there in the
configuration or the framework of that genetic imprint. And the 5 does not by its
nature come into the world saying I have something to offer, which is their job, to
call. But you'll notice about 5s is that they rarely get to the place where they will
call, because very early in their life they lose it. They lose the power that comes
with being projected on.
I love the projection field. It's taken me a long time to get here. I love the
projection field. It‘s hilarious. It‘s wonderful. If you're correct within the context of
the projection then you're safe. I have long left behind my concerns about my
reputation. I have a wonderful reputation and I have a terrible reputation. It all
depends where you go. And it's always going to be like that. It doesn't make any
difference.
And I'm somebody who knows deeply that my contribution to humanity is not
because I'm a nice guy, it‘s because I've had no choice. There is no choice in any of
this. And this whole business of sacrifice to a larger goal is surrender to a sacrifice
you don't make, but is imposed on you. And this is the point. Only in surrender can
you understand that. The moment you're not surrendered, the moment that you
have the vanity that things are up to you and you think you are making a sacrifice,
oh shit, I don't want to be the beneficiary of that sacrifice. They didn‘t do anything
for me; they did it all for themselves as I do it for myself because that‘s life. The
rest of it is just coating and it‘s just the program. That‘s the 5.
Think about what happens to them. If they don‘t understand that they‘re helpless,
then they identify with their sacrifice. And in identifying with their sacrifice these are
very, very nasty forces, to themselves, to others. And they‘re the guilt machines—
5th line guilt machines. If I thought that I was making a sacrifice for you my
demands on you would be totally different—get on your fucking knees. You know
what I mean. If I thought I was making a sacrifice to bring the best knowledge the
world has ever had—after all for me, this is the best knowledge the world has ever
received—if I thought that this was my business, and it's my sacrifice to make this
happen, ha, ha.
This is the thing about surrender. My encounter with the Voice was so smashing to
this 5 of mine, because I‘m a 49, I understand the principles of sacrifice and
sacrificing. I know what it takes to put somebody on the altar. I do. So, you have

to see something here in this line, is that this becomes a world in which those who
sacrifice and in their vanity assume that it is their conscious sacrifice, the price they
make, everybody else pays and this is the 19. It says, pay me a lot. Bring me 40
oxen. Bring me 100 virgins. Bring me my God damn Rolls-Royces. I drive an old

The 6/2
LAC Refinement 2
The 6th line is one of my favorite 6th lines, the Recluse. This is the archetype of the
roof stage. You can see by the way—it's a wonderful thing to look for yourself. If
you look at the 64 gates and you look at all the 6th lines you‘ll be able to divide them
up into three kinds of keynotes—Saturn keynotes, roof keynotes, transcendent
keynotes. They‘re really there. It's built into it. This is very much an archetype of
the roof. And you can see that there's no place to go, in that sense. In 19 does not
want to meet the mutation that's coming. It loses its source of security and well-
being.
The avoidance of contact in general, but not exclusively. The roof phase; it‘s the
roof phase, the fool on the hill, the sage that if you find they will talk to you. The
energy which generally fuels avoidance, or the sulking child. Oversensitivity to
rejection that fuels avoidance. The whole mechanism of going up in the roof is here.
This is and was, this is the Cross of the Four Ways, and the Cross of the Four Ways
before mutation was the end. The end was, you got up on the roof, you displayed
your wisdom, and you got colder and colder until you died. You never came off the
roof.
The 19.6 doesn‘t know that you have to come off the roof. And the 19.6 does not
want to come off the roof. It‘s the last thing on earth that they want to do. This is
where the deepest dilemma is here in this line. If they don't come off the roof, they
will not mutate, and if they do not mutate, the gods will destroy them. This is just
the way that it is and they don't care.
What weights the 19.6 is the 13.1, Empathy and The Fellowship of Man. There you
are this 19.6 up on the hill; it‘s so beautiful up there. You look out over the world.
That village is so far away that it‘s not even alive anymore; it‘s just sort of a blob on
the landscape. You're a god, free, perfect, you have exactly what you need—
distance. And the more distant you are the more there will be those that will come
and serve you—the sadu on the hill with the peasant coming up and placing it at his
feet. It‘s wonderful.
And then, you look over the edge and you see what you have to do. The future is
that you have to go down into the world into the experience of the world at the
deepest level. You have to be empathic; you have to be open to everything. This is
the great line of ―I don‘t want. I don‘t want to be in the world.‖ This has been the
disease of the 6s; don‘t want to be in the world, don‘t want to go back there, been
there, done that, it‘s terrible. Ask any 6/2, 6/3 they‘ll tell you it‘s terrible. The world

is a shitty place, ugly, ugly, ugly, why should I go back after I‘ve been up in the
clouds all the time. I don‘t want to go back. I don‘t want to go down there. Very
nice, fellowship of man, give them a Nobel Prize and leave me alone. Good for
them; leave me alone. It‘s nice up here.
Sixes are like that. After all, it‘s part of my message to illuminate this process. And
as I watch those beings as they go off on the roof and as I watch those beings
coming off, I see the resistance. It‘s built into every 6/2 and 6/3, this is the way. The
way says, really, it‘s nice up here, it‘s safe, I don‘t have to deal with the neighbors,
it‘s quiet, it‘s peaceful, it‘s wonderful and I am the perfect example of me, after all,
here alone on this hill without any concerns. It‘s really magical.
But they‘re not allowed. And when the 3/2 on this cross goes out of that Saturn
phase they want up that hill so fast you cannot imagine. No parachutes, no ladders,
these are the kind of people when they have a tree house and they pull the ladder up
when they go they up. I don‘t want to go down. Or they cut the cord; that‘s even
better, and they let the ladder fall down—I‘m not coming back. I‘m staying up here.

The 6/3
LAC Refinement 2
The very last breath in the 6/3 what you see is how hard it is for us to let go of life.
It‘s so hard for us to let go of life. That‘s what it says. It‘s hard for us. And it‘s not
so much that we don't want to die. It‘s just that we want more life. And whether
that more life is the promise of this or that or the other doesn‘t make much
difference. There is just the deep need for more living, more life and not life that‘s
ugly, not life that‘s down there in the world; more life up here on the hill, where
everything is sweet and wonderful.
You meet a lot of 6/3s in institutions, mental institutions, and hospitals. There is this
horrendous pessimism about what it takes to deal with humans. The joke of the left
angle is that the left is not humanitarian. More likely you‘ll find humanitarianism in
the right angle than the left angle. The left angle, unfortunately, remembers
through the karma that it‘s always been shitty and it‘s always been the same.
After all, this is a tribal gate locked into the tribal laws, locked into the tribal
program, locked into having to support, locked into never being able to fulfill your
own unique purpose. This knowledge represents an enormous mutation, a mutation
in the way in which we understand the nature being, the way we live our lives, but
also to see its limitation. This is written for this era. There is a real change coming
and the most important thing is the recognition that it's been at work for a long
time; hundreds of years now, this nine-centered experience and the demands on the
6 that it leave the roof.
I‘m the 49, I know, I look across at that 19, I look across at that 6/3 and I say you‘d
better come off the roof because if you don't come off the roof you're just going to
die up there. You don‘t get it; you‘re going to die up there. And it‘s not as bad as

you think. Come on, you've changed. Come on back down into the world and see
what it‘s like to be here is an example. It‘s not easy. All 6s know that by the time
they get to their Kiron that death is truly imminent. They know that. They know that
because they are the mutation, and they know that at any moment if they're not
correct the hand of the gods comes down there and yanks them out. They know all
that. Why make the sacrifice? Why take the journey? Why be the example? Why
come off the hill? Why bother?
Every 6/3 has to look at the 1/3. You have to see that. Every 6/3 sees that
everything starts again always. It's only the greater spiral if you can imagine that it
is really the way to understand anything. From the 6/3s perspective, what's the
point. It‘s always the same. What‘s the point? You‘ve got to start all over again.
I‘ve got to go off the roof and I have to go back into the world. I don't remember
how to date. I don't remember how to go out and have social interaction. I don't
remember how to do those things because they didn‘t work for me. I don't
remember what it was like to be responsible. I don't remember any of these things;
I‘ve been up on the roof. Now you want me to go back down and be all that—I don‘t
want to do that.
So, when we get to the end of our story in Mutation we get to the precipice, the last
gate, the last cross. And that last gate, what it shows you is that at the very end of
the process is the end of humanity, the way in which we're going to have that
transformation to the rave and that this is the end of the human specieal line, that
19th gate at the end, this is what ends the line. It‘s why it‘s there. It‘s the fourth
way, there is no fifth way. It's the end of the line.
And at the end of the line transcendence is expected, and 6s carry that is as well.
The burden that is expected of them, they have to come off the roof. Now that we
all know we can embarrass them. Come on down, it‘s okay. We can give them
ladders, parachutes, build elevators, take him by the hand, kick them off, push them
off, drag them off, but there is this deep, deep resistance. And it's only in the next
years, not many, the next five to ten years when they start dying like flies that other
6s will begin to pay attention, because it‘s going to be a warning, and it‘s going to be
a very deep, deep warning that all things that are interrelated is going to come to an
end, and that's the end of the story.
