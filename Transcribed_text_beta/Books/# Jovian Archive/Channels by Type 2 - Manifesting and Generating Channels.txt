4 Channels By Type
International Human Design School Manuals and Texts
This book is a transcript of The Channels Course by Ra Uru Hu that was held in Taos, New
Mexico in 1999. The Manifestor & Generator Channels Course was held on April 8-13, 1999,
and the Projector Channels Course was held April 15-18, 1999.
Including over 40 hours of lectures on all the channels in a Human Design chart, Ra also gives an
in-depth view of how each channel adds to the overall nature of the circuit of which it is part. He
discusses at length what quality each channel demonstrates about the entire circuit.
NNNNooootttteeee: Numeric separators – Channels are indicated with a hyphen, like 20-34. A gate and its
line are indicated with a period, like 34.2. Profiles are indicated with a slash, like 5/1.
Color coding: Blue indicates either a Manifesting channel or an individual circuit. Green
indicates a Collective circuit. Red indicates a Generated channel. And burgundy indicates a
Tribal circuit.

Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 11
The Manifesting Channels
We are going to look today at Manifesting channels and you can see that it is
particularly amusing in that it is only one day. There are not a lot of
Manifesting channels, there are four. And
we have already seen one of them because
we looked at the 35-36, the Channel of
Transitoriness, the design of jack of all
trades and we saw this manifesting process
out of the Solar Plex.
What we have left are the three remaining
Manifesting channels. The 12-22, the
Channel of Openness, which is an
individual process and it is manifesting
that is emotional. This is emotional
manifestation. And then we have the 45-
21, which is a Manifesting channel out of the Heart Center, out of the Ego.
This is Ego manifesting. And then we have what we are going to begin with,
the 20-34. The 20-34 is a part of integration and it is so important to see how
our evolutionary process works.
The 20-34: Integration
What am I? A Manifestor or a Generator?
I have had many people come up to me, particularly while I was on tour
recently, and they would have a
defined Throat connected to the
Solar Plex or whatever, but it
would also be connected to the
Sacral, or the Sacral would be
defined. And they would come
to me and say, “Am I a
Manifestor or am I a
Generator?” That was their
immediate,—that was their
confusion. “What am I? Am I this or am I that?”
12 Channels By Type
Remember that integration is the backbone of the
BodyGraph. It is out of integration that everything
else, in a sense, hangs. It is our basic, primal
mechanism at the beginning. It is the archetype.
And out of that archetype comes the two potentials
of manifestation. Integration carries within it the
potential to be Generator, the potential to be
Manifestor and the potential to be Manifesting
Generator.
The Manifesting Generator is this hybrid. It is still a
Manifestor. The 20-34 is the design of a Manifestor. This is
the design to do. There is no question about that. It follows
the law of what a Manifestor is; that is, the Throat Center is
connected to one of the body’s four motors. However,
given the unique nature and power of the Sacral system,
once the Sacral is connected and defined, it automatically
demands response; automatically, no matter what the Type
or configuration. So that the moment that you have the
Throat Center connected to the Sacral Center, what you
have is a Manifesting Generator. That is really what it is. In other words, the
moment it responds, acting as a Generator, it can instantly manifest.
The Frustration of the Generator: No Way to the Gearbox
Now don’t think that is the same as being a Generator because it is not. They
are substantially different. Think about the nature of what generation is.
Generation is the theme of frustration, and the theme of frustration is rooted in
the fact that the Sacral Center is a motor, the prime motor of the vehicle, but it
is not the gearbox. The gearbox is in the Throat. This is where
metamorphosis takes place, so that when you’re dealing with the Sacral Center,
you are dealing with frustration, because since there is no way to get to the gear
box and change the gears, frustration is natural. And that frustration is given a
name and the name is stuck.
Generators get stuck. And what they got stuck at is staying at the same level,
vibrating at that level, and they are going to vibrate at that level until
metamorphosis takes place and then they make the jump. Now remember
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 13
something about the nature of the Generator. They are the most powerful and
most useful types on the planet once they have entered into something
correctly according to their Type.
The Generator’s Hierarchical Movement Takes Time
So the moment the Generator naturally responds to correct behavior, “Would
you like to go out? Would you like to do this job?” “Uh huh.” That is the
moment that the Generator can enter into its hierarchical movement. You see,
the Generator starts at one level and they will stay at that level and not quit
because they have entered into it correctly, otherwise they always quit because
they are frustrated and feel stuck. And then they go to the next level.
So when you go up to a Generator and you say, “Would you like to do this?”
and they go “uh huh,” the thing to recognize is that it is going to take them
time to get to a level of proficiency. It is going to take them time to move
through the process, and you’re going to have to be patient with them.
Because they will get stuck at certain levels and you have to wait for them to go
through that process.
I give the illustration of the virtual reality game where you can’t get to the next
level. You’re going to go through the whole thing and then you can have your
jump. Now think about how different that is if you’re dealing with the
Manifesting Generator.
The Manifesting Generator’s Movement is Fast after Yes
You go up to a Manifesting Generator and say, “Would you like to do this?”
And, by the way, they do not have to go “uh huh.” That Sacral is connected to
the Throat. They can say “yes.” At the moment they say ‘yes’ they can act,
instantly and instantly manifest. 0 to 50 in four seconds. Zap! That’s the
difference. So don’t assume for a moment that if you’re a Manifestor who has
a defined Sacral—so that you are a Manifesting Generator—don’t assume for a
moment that it is the same as being a Generator; it is not. It is very different.
The other thing is that the Manifesting Generator is what integration is. The
Manifesting Generator has the easiest task of all. We have learned that for
every single Type there are rules of behavior that allow them to remain pure
within their mechanics. The Manifesting Generator is not a Manifestor either,
14 Channels By Type
in the sense that the Manifestor has a specific strategy. The Manifestor’s
strategy is to eliminate resistance by informing before it acts. This is the only
protection a Manifestor has against resistance and punishment, so before you’re
going to punch somebody in the face, you tell them. No resistance. Pardon
my humor.
Manifesting Generator’s Strategy is Easier than the
Manifestor
So the manifesting strategy is one thing, but when you come to the Manifesting
Generator, it does not have to go and inform anyone of anything, which is
really easy if you’re a Manifestor because Manifestors don’t want to ask
anybody for help, don’t really want to tell anybody beforehand because they are
always afraid that they are going to meet resistance. And so, they end up doing
it because damn the consequences. And boy oh boy, do they ever get the
resistance. The Manifesting Generator just has to wait to respond and then
they can manifest instantaneously.
This is survival and life at its most basic: responding to the environment and
instantaneously manifesting as a response to that environment. And out of that
root within us, which is integration—Manifesting Generator that is the design
of integration—out of that comes the two energy variations: the Manifestor
and the Generator. Just as the male came out of the female.
This is part of the way things evolve. So in the beginning, out of this
combination grew these two energy fields. It also says something to you about
people who are Manifesting Generators and where their mystical connection is
to many things. I am not going to get into all of that but it is an interesting
thing to think about because they go very far back in terms of the very
beginnings of our human experience.
It doesn’t matter whether you are a Manifesting Generator or a Manifestor, you
can’t escape anger. There is nothing you can do about that; these are angry
people. And this is the only Sacral Manifestor.
The Cyclical Channels
Think about the 20-34. All of you have been doing designs and readings. Tell
me how often you see the 20-34. Tell me how often you see the 43-23. Tell
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 15
me how often you see the 40-37. You see them all the time because these are
oppositions in the wheel. You see them all the time. Anybody who has their
Sun in any of those gates, they’re going to have the Earth in the opposite, or
the Nodes, or on occasion it is structured
to the planets, but the fact of the matter
is that those three channels are
universally present, every generation,
every year, cyclical, on time.
The Two Seasons of
Reproduction
One of the things to recognize about the
nature of human reproduction is that it
had two seasons: the 20-34 season and
the 40-37 season. These are the seasons
of reproduction and you can see that it is a given that these three channels must
be part of the human experience and design. They are essential ingredients that
always have to be in abundance, more than other configurations, all the time on
the planet. It tells you a lot about that. That is, that the 34-20, 43-23 forms the
single definition, individual freak being busy. It is fun to think that the gods
want busy freaks running around, isn’t it?
That it is absolutely essential for the earth that busy freaks are running around.
I think that is very cute. And if you look at those three channels in a graph,
just as a design, what you have is a split definition, emotional Manifestor. A
busy freak running around every once in a while trying to connect to
community, because you see this is evolution. This is the traveling sales man.
The busy freak running around drops off its genes in the 40-37. Well, that is
what they want from us. Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy. The 20-34 is the busiest
thing you have ever seen. It’s why we call it charisma. I think that’s hilarious.
I am Busy Now
Everybody has been propagandized from the moment they came into the
world to be Manifestors. Everybody. “Do this. Do that. Get that done.
Everybody climb that ladder.” And then you get a 20-34 and they come regular.
Every Gemini season, here comes one. Every Sagittarian season here comes
one. And they come by the thousands and the thousands and the thousands.
16 Channels By Type
That 20-34, what is it? It does not say, “I know what I’m busy about.” There’s
no 57. It does not say, “I’m doing anything for myself.” That’s the 10. It does
not say any of that. It says, “I am busy now.” And we call that charisma. You
see, we love seeing busy, busy, busy. That’s what we’re set up for. Keep on,
keeping on, keep on being busy: That is our nature.
There is something very funny about the 20-34. In my work in Europe, like I
do in a lot of places, I have contacts with all kinds of New Agers and esoteric
types. And I’ve met two or three professional channelers in my work there.
And the two that I remember were both women, and the 20-34 was entirely
unconscious in their design and they were being busy. And they didn’t know
where their voice came from because it came mysteriously out of this tunnel
and they seem to give it some kind of identification. That is, this being busy is
quite a thing. It carries with it in an incredible empowerment to act.
There is nothing like the 34th gate. After all, it is the only motor gate that
actually operates three different channels. It empowers three different
processes. This is the power of the great. This is the true gate of power. Of
course, power is very impressive when it’s manifesting.
A Basic Dilemma: The 20-34 Needs Guidance to Succeed
There’s a basic dilemma here, and the basic dilemma is that the 20-34 is a
channel which is inherently individual, deeply individual. In being deeply
individual, the one thing that it does not want in its life is influence. After all,
the only gates of deafness are in the individual circuits. Just as the gates of
attentiveness and a fine musical ear are also there in individuality, but deafness
is really there. If you are dealing with 38s, 43s and 39s, you’re dealing with deaf
people. They don’t want to hear what you have to say. They’re designed not
to be influenced because they are individual, and the moment they succumb to
the influence, that’s the moment they lose their difference and their difference
is everything.
Yet hear what this channel says, this Channel of Charisma, a design where
thoughts must become deeds. Now that’s about awareness. In other words,
that awareness must guide the action, but without the 57 being there saying, “I
know what I’m busy about…” that action is not clear and it’s not guided by
awareness. So when you see the 20-34 being busy, it is impressive at the
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 17
physical level. We are intended to go forth and multiply and be the builders.
That’s what we do, that’s the program.
And we love these Manifestors, but the 20-34 can only succeed in this life
through guidance. It is one of the magical things about so-called charismatic
people, that there’s always somebody behind the curtain pulling the strings.
Because without the guidance, that being busy—because it does not know what
it’s doing and it is does not know why it’s doing it, in terms of for itself—is
chaos for them unless they are guided.
Individuals don’t want to be controlled or influenced. They don’t. And yet the
strategy of the Manifesting Generator is that it has to wait to manifest. It has
to wait to be asked to manifest. It has to wait to respond through
manifestation. In other words, it’s meant to be guided. It is one of the things
that the design of ‘to wait,’ this mode, that people have difficulty with in that
they assume that somebody who has to open up or initiate, has control over
them. It’s not true.
When you put your aura inside of them, mechanically they have no choice but
to do that. It’s not like they have control over you. It’s like dealing with the
undefined Self. Now, you deal with the undefined Self and, of course, if they
are in the wrong place, they are with the wrong people, so the moment they get
in to the right place, they hold on for dear life, to whoever brought them there.
I mean, for dear life.
One of the most interesting things about the Manifesting Generator is that they
can’t afford to get caught in that trap. They can’t afford to see that without
that person taking them to the restaurant, that their life can never be complete
and that they become dependent on them. And then they have to do what that
other person tells them to do. It’s abhorrent to individuals.
20-34 Children: Guidance without Control
So one of the things to recognize about the child—and we have a lot of
children who come into the world as 20-34s—is that they need to be guided
without being controlled. That’s the most important thing: guidance without
control; guidance without any attempt to influence them absolutely. You do
the best you can to guide them into what you think is correct, but they are
freaks; they are individuals. How they are going to take that, how they are
18 Channels By Type
going to manifest that is ultimately up to them, but you can guide them. You
can offer them advice. You can open up the potential for response for them.
Frustration is Stronger Than the Anger
The Manifestor has the theme of anger and the Generator has the theme of
frustration. The Manifesting Generator is an angry, frustrated being. If you
add into that matrix the defined Solar Plex Center, you’ve really got a movie
there. You have got this angry, frustrated, emotional being, where rage is
something that is never far from the surface. Now, the thing is that the
frustration is stronger than the anger in the Manifesting Generator because they
have to wait to manifest. Waiting always brings the frustration but it does not
eliminate the anger. It does not eliminate the anger because when they’re
young, and because their parents don’t know and they don’t know, they
manifest all the time and get punished the way Manifestors do. After all, they
are technically Manifestors.
So they’ll go outside without asking permission; they’ll do things without letting
anybody know beforehand; they will get punished. So they will have that anger
about the resistance that they meet. When they understand the nature of their
Type, then they’ll have to deal with frustration. Remember something about
the nature of your Type is that you don’t get rid of these themes.
You Don’t Get Rid of Type Themes
As a pure Manifestor, I am never going to get rid of the theme of anger.
Never. Never. It’s never going to go away from me. It’s always going to be
there. It lurks within the nature of the mechanics of what I am. My awareness
eliminates the resistance and therefore does not feed the anger but it’s not like
the anger is gone. It is not gone. We live our Types to the end. Stupid before
enlightenment, stupid after. You’ve still got this body. You’ve still got the ride.
You still have your Type. You still live in your genetics. Don’t think that
you’re going to get rid of these things. You don’t. You don’t.
But then, anger doesn’t rule my life. And if you are a Generator living out your
Type, frustration doesn’t rule yours. And if you are a Projector living out your
Type, bitterness does not rule yours. But you can’t get rid of it being there as a
potential. If you are a Reflector, disappointment does not have to rule your
life.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 19
The Manifesting Generator is the Beginning of Our Energy
Process
So the Manifesting Generator is the beginning of our energy process. Now, it
is interesting to see that the beginning of what it is to be human and the basic
drives of what it is to be human is all about the energy Type. In other words,
survival rooted in that and out of that can come a lot of chaos, because there is
not, at this stage in integration, the capacity of Projectors to be able to order
and to be able to guide the energy Types. There isn’t the Reflector here that is
the witness and the wisest witness that we have on this planet of what life is.
What we have here is just the basic drive for survival, to stay alive.
You can see in integration, as we saw with the 10-57, this creative aspect of
integration, that the 10-57 is all about creating environments that will permit
survival and is all about developing style. And you can see that all of that is
about us being the builders. Out of that 20-34, we started to build things, cities
and monuments and all kinds of stuff. Being busy building our own
environment, like any creature in that sense, creating our environment, working
at creating this environment and working at staying alive in all of that.
Integration is just about being busy; being busy getting things done.
Giving Reasons for Melancholy Turns it Into Depression
The 20-34 suffers from individual melancholy. And that melancholy, because
that melancholy is something that can run very deep, this dichotomy between
being happy and being sad is a major theme of busyness. Sometimes the 20-34
is exhilarated in being busy, and sometimes the saddest thing about life is that
they can only be busy, and they don’t know why they’re being busy and they
can get deeply, deeply, deeply depressed in that. That can be eliminated by
understanding that the chemistry of melancholy is not something that deserves
a reason; that it’s pointless to give a reason to melancholy. Not only is it
pointless but it’s damaging. The melancholic state of sadness is an
environment to be creative. It’s what it is there for and if you turn that sadness
into a reason, if you say it’s because of him or her or it or whatever the case
may be, you turn it into depression, you lose its creative value and you suffer.
I know so many 20-34s who suffer deeply, I mean deeply in their melancholy.
Because in their melancholy, in the creative warmth of that melancholy is the
recognition that what they are doing is useless; absolutely useless. They are just
marking time; useless. It doesn’t mean anything and they can’t stop doing it.
20 Channels By Type
It’s compulsive. So anyone who carries the 20-34 has to come to grips with the
fact that they themselves can never know what to be busy about. They can’t.
As Manifesting Generators, they have wait for their opportunity to respond to
be able to manifest and to be able to manifest in a healthy way, to know what
to do. Obviously, that’s going to be different if you have somebody who has
the 57 as part of the integration connection. Please understand that. I’m only
speaking here of the 20-34, but because of the nature of integration, you can’t
forget the other aspects. And it is important to recognize that the 20-34 is
always going to be deeply attractive and deeply in need of the 10 and the 57 in
their process.
Integration is Always attracted to the Open Gate
Remember that integration with its four gates still operates out of the same
principle as any single channel. In other words, if you have a gate activation in
one end of that channel, you’re always going to be attracted, always going to
need and always will meet in your life the other end. It isn’t about the whole
thing that you’re looking for that. It’s that you’re going to meet it, and it always
has a special attraction to you because it is the other side of a possibility. In
integration, it always works that way.
So for example, if you only have the 57th gate, you’re going to be deeply
attracted to the other three gates: the 34, the 10 and the 20. And not only are
you going to be attracted to it, that’s what you’re going to meet. Remember
what we discussed about the nature of the aura: let your aura do your talking.
Let your aura do the talking. Let your aura go inside and get its natural
mechanical connection to the other and then you’ll see that Type comes out
naturally.
The 20-34 without the 57: Slaves
Voices. See this deep need for guidance in the 20-34. So when you’re looking
at the 20-34 and you see that it doesn’t have the 57, you know that it doesn’t
know what to be busy about. You know that.
I love to tease 20-34s when they have a reading with me. And I look at them
and say, “Busy, busy, busy” and they grin sheepishly. Because that’s what they
are, busy, busy, busy. And then I say “You don’t know what for and you don’t
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 21
know… it’s never for you.” They can end up being real slaves. It is never for
them.
The 20-34-57: I Know What I’m Busy About
Now, the moment that the 57 is present, then you have a different
configuration and integration that says to you “I know what I’m busy about.”
In other words, I know what I’m doing.
The 20-57-34: The Most Difficult to Guide
Now the people who have the 20-57-34 are the most difficult to guide.
Because you go up to them and then you say “You know this would be a great
thing for you.” And they will say to you, “I know what I’m doing. I know
what I’m doing. I know what I’m doing.”
Now, if they don’t have the 10, while they’re doing that mantra, “I know what
I’m doing.” You can say, “But you’re not doing that for yourself are you?”
Because they’re not. Not only are they not doing it for themselves, they don’t
know how to behave.
One of the most difficult things in integration is not having the 10. You don’t
know how to behave and the potential to love yourself is inconsistent. That’s
why they make great slaves. Busy, busy, busy, busy. Don’t know how, don’t
know why.
The 20-10-34: Selfishly Busy
In the same way, you can have somebody that has the 20, 10 and the 34 and
they don’t have the 57. These are people who are selfishly busy but they don’t
know what for. They don’t really know what they’re doing. They’re just totally
absorbed in their own busyness.
It is so important to understand that the manifesting energy that is possible out
of the 20-34 because it’s such a common element in the nature of the design of
humanity. It’s one of the keys in the genetic continuity in humanity. That to
have clear action out of the 20-34 is essential. It’s essential. The theme is
busyness; it is the theme. It’s what it’s all about.
22 Channels By Type
But think about the nature of the Manifestor. The Manifestor says, “I’m going
to do what I do.” That’s how they get punished. And after getting punished,
after meeting the resistance, then they don’t do what is correct. That busyness
is an essential ingredient for us; after all, it can be charismatic when it’s guided
by awareness.
Guidance is Built Into the Format of the Individual Process
If you look at the 3-60 and you look at the third hexagram, you will find there
is this need for guidance. It’s actually built into the format of the individual
process—to both be guided and to guide. This is the geometry of moving
from warrior to teacher; to be trained, to be guided and then ultimately to guide
others. But without that guidance, and without that guidance very early in life,
the 20-34 ends up being a very, very angry and frustrated and confused energy
Type. It’s much simpler to be a pure Manifestor or a pure Generator. It’s
much simpler. And of course, they’re here to be productive. These are the
kinds of mutative forces in life that are totally uncaring.
Individuals ‘Care’ Differently
It’s one of those things always to keep in mind about the 20-34: the 20-34 does
not care about the other at all. That’s not their fault, and nobody who carries
the 20-34 carries only that. You have all kinds of other activations. But if you
look at the way that caring operates out of the Splenic system, in terms of the
individual, we know that individual caring is not something that is automatic
and it’s not something that you can expect from an individual. You can’t. That
isn’t to say that individuals cannot care; they can in their own different way and
they can care very deeply. But when they care, that’s another story.
I have told the story often. You have two individuals and they are standing at
the street corner and one of them steps into the street to cross and the other
one sees a car coming. And they reach out and they grab their individual friend
and pull them back. That friend turns around, looks at them and says to the
other, “What the hell are you doing? Don’t you think that I can cross the
road?” They are not impressed by being cared for. It’s a kind of attempt to
control and influence them.
Now, you see, if you’re a real individual and you understand that, you’ll let that
friend go across the street and get hit by the car. And when they are lying on
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 23
the ground and they are in trouble, you can then go and care for them and they
will deeply appreciate it. Your caring will be quality caring.
Give the 20-34 Child a lot of Rope
Now think about what that means if you have a 20-34 child. Every time you
say to that child, “Be careful crossing the street,” they hate you. They hate you.
“Don’t tell me that, I know.” And they get hit by a car. It doesn’t matter.
This is the trials and tribulations of raising an individual. You have to give
them enough rope to hang themselves; you have to. But again, the
responsibility is guidance. It’s guidance. You can never really know if they’re
not going to end up at the end of that rope. You can’t know that, but you can’t
try to prevent it. You can’t try to control them, because they will just simply
reject that.
The 20-34 Irony: Does not Attract Caring Yet Needs
Guidance
So one of the things to recognize about the charismatic being is that they do
not attract caring and yet they have to be guided. It’s the irony of all of that.
And they’re moody on top of all that.
The Voice of the 20: I Am
The voice of the 20 is a voice of the purest expression of the individual in the
now. It is absolutely existential. It is the “I am” and it is the only “I am” that
we have in the Throat. It is fundamentally selfish and has to be recognized as
such. One of the real handicaps that is imposed upon 20-34s is that they are
forced into social and peer group pressures that distort who they are and put
them to work as slaves of the other. Remember that the 20-34, by that design
alone, does not know what to do with its energy, does not know how to use its
power to fulfill itself, and because it is a freak and an outsider, may be deeply
uncomfortable with its own nature.
When you see two of the four Manifesting channels are individual, you have to
recognize that we have a hell of a lot of neurotic manifesting going on out
there, because individual children have to be nurtured differently. Just as
collective children have to be nurtured differently or tribal children. Just as
24 Channels By Type
there is a mechanic for us entering into things, there is a mechanic for the
development of these Types, these qualities.
Encourage Individuals to be Different, not Best
The whole difficulty with the individual is that they have to be encouraged to
be different rather than best. It’s extremely difficult considering that we put
individual children into collective institutions, and by putting them into
collective institutions they have to live by the collective order which is not
always comfortable for individuals. If you think the tribe has a problem with
the collective, the individual has a problem with the collective.
The individual is frightened of the collective. “All freaks to the gas chambers.”
The moment that cry comes out, individuals get real nervous about the
collective. “All retarded boys are to be castrated.” It’s okay if you are in the
collective and you say, “Well, it’s going to benefit our gene pool.” It’s another
thing if you are one of those boys or their parent or their sibling or their loved
one.
Individuals get real frightened when it comes to the collective because the
collective is impersonal. It’s impersonal, and this 20-34 is a freak, an outsider,
not looking for caring, not looking for guidance, not wanting to be influenced,
and getting deeply depressed because of their melancholy and because of their
lack of understanding. These are very depressed people, generally.
For all that wonderful power, because they don’t wait to manifest, because they
don’t pay attention to their Type, they have so much resistance in their life.
And at the same time, dealing with all of that resistance, the moment they go
into their melancholy, these are people who are always telling you that the
whole world is against them. “Everybody is against us.”
The 34th Gate: It is Empowerment and Basically Asexual
The 34th gate—it’s asexual. It is not to say that it can’t be sexual, but the only
way that it can be sexual is when you get hit by the car. It’s like the caring. It’s
not sexual by nature. It can be sexual in certain situations but it is basically
asexual. It is a fundamental power mechanism. It is truly the gate of
empowerment and it’s one of the most powerful life forces that we have in
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 25
the BodyGraph. That capacity within the 34 to release its power; there is no
qualifying condition in the lines of the 34.
When it gets to the Throat, you have to recognize what a Sacral Center does.
Other than the Solar Plex system, there is nothing more powerful. Nothing.
And even the Solar Plex system has to take authority, in terms of responding,
from the Sacral. So even if you’re a Generator with a defined emotional
system, we know that the authority is in the emotions, but the authority does
not even come into question until you’ve waited to respond.
The Solar Plex Waits for the Sacral
In other words, even the Solar Plex has to wait in the waiting room for the
Sacral Center to do its work. The Sacral Center is incredible. It is the
dominant prime motor within us, and the Sacral Center does something very
specific. You’ll notice that integration has no Ego. That’s something
important to see because this is all about being busy and busy, busy, busy.
The Ego Itself Gets Rewarded for Busyness
Now, only the Ego has the capacity to get properly rewarded for busyness
because that its job. The Ego says “I work X, I get X, I get my vacation, I get
this, I get that, the pay has got to be fair, blah, blah, blah.” No Ego is ever
going to work around the clock. They’re not. “I’m sorry, you sew him up. I’m
going to bed. I’m not going to work around the clock. I’ve done my hour, I’m
finished. Sorry, that’s it. Sorry.” That’s the Ego, and of course that’s healthy;
that’s your heart. And it’s your stomach and it says, “I’ve got to stop now and
eat. I have to stop now and rest.” This is the beauty of the Ego.
The Ego Connected to the Sacral Overworks
But the moment that the Sacral Center is connected to the Ego, the Ego does
not know how to do that anymore—the power of the Sacral. The moment that
the Ego is connected to the Sacral, the Sacral says to the Ego, “Work. You’ll
eat later, work. You’ll rest later, work. Never lets go. Work.”
I had this in my life. I had this incredible experience with my undefined Sacral,
with Pluto both in the 14th gate and in the 34th gate which took seven years. My
poor Ego was overwhelmed by this Sacral being defined. “Work.” I don’t
26 Channels By Type
want to “Work.” I don’t want to “Work.” So, I worked like a dog and my Ego
never had a chance. I tell you it’s one of the best days of my life when Pluto
left the Sacral connecting to me, I was like, “Whew. Okay. Thank you very
much. I can go back to saying ‘I need to eat now; I’m tired now, give me a
break.’” So think about the incredible power that is there in the 20-34. These
people are drop dead busy. It’s not just about being active. They are just on
the way, on the go, ba-da-bump, never stop.
A friend of mine in Ibiza was a 20-34. It never failed that anytime I showed up
at her house, she was sweeping. I mean, honestly it never failed. I knew her
for 15 years. She was always sweeping dust somewhere. Those tiles in her
house, man, they shine. 20-34, drop dead busy. 10 o’clock at night, wah-wah-
wah. Get up in the morning, wah-wah-wah. Incredible. And I loved the joke
because everybody calls that charismatic. I just love that joke.
These compulsive beings, they are just out there sweeping through life and
everybody says “Wow! Look at that.” And your mother and father say to you
“Why don’t you be like that?” Because that’s what they say to you. “You
should be like that. Look at how hard they’re working.” And 20-34 kids, think
of what they bring to a family. Think about what a 20-34 child brings into a
family the moment they come into the world. Busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.
Suddenly the breadwinner has got a second job. Busy, busy, busy. Everybody
gets going. They’re supposed to be out here in the world.
We have got so many 20-34s. The only blessing that we have is that there are
two other gates in integration and they come along quite often. Because the
20-34 by itself is really just this blind force that needs to be harnessed, but
needs to be harnessed with kid gloves, delicate touch. Guided without any
sense of being controlled. Guided without any sense of being directly,
intentionally influenced. Allowed to mature as an individual spirit. A creative
spirit in its activity because out of its melancholic individual process, its activity
can become deeply, deeply creative. But that takes nurturing.
The Advantage of Meeting Exhaustion
When you meet an adult who is a 20-34, you are meeting exhaustion. Not such
an easy task, but you’re meeting exhaustion. The only advantage you have with
them is their very exhaustion, to be able to say to them, “Look, this is what it
has cost you. This being busy and not knowing what to be busy about. And
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 27
not knowing how to be busy for yourself. That sweeping of the floor was not
for the self. That’s just the vibration having to come out, to know how to be
busy for what is truly for you. Now that’s about living out your Type.”
The Healthy 20-34
For the 20-34, it is absolutely essential for them to recognize that the only way
they are going to be able to function in a healthy way in this life, the only way
that they’re going to have activity that is fulfilling for them and gives them a
sense of purpose—which all individuals are looking for—is by waiting to be
asked to manifest. It’s very simple and it’s only simple if you teach them when
they’re young. It’s not simple when they’re adults because they are
Manifestors; they are Manifestors. So by telling them that they have to wait
and they have to wait to be asked, once they have gone through a whole
lifetime of manifesting—and they can because they are and everybody loves
Manifestors—it’s hard for them to give that up.
Verbal Gunslingers
No matter how intelligent the adult I meet who has a split definition and their
Ajna is connected to the Throat, it’s practically impossible for these people ever
to live out their Type, because they shoot off their mouth all the time. They
jump into being verbal gunslingers and verbal Manifestors and they lose their
self.
The 20-34s Aura Talks Mechanically
It is very, very important for the 20-34 to recognize that it is charismatic. Let
the aura talk. Let that wonderful capacity to empower activity talk. Every 20-
34, when they put their aura inside of you, it says “I am power.” That’s what it
says. “I am power.” Now when you put that “I am power” into somebody
else mechanically, you will get the mechanical action that you need.
You will get the other saying, “Would you like to?” or “Can you or could I or
could we?” Or whatever the case may be. In other words, the aura itself, in its
mechanical operation is going to bring out the necessary behavior. That’s the
whole beauty of aura. Recognize that you’re putting your aura in the other and
your aura will speak for you. It will say “I am power.”
28 Channels By Type
And then that 20-34 is going to get the correct behavior, it’s going to get
somebody that’s going to elicit the response that will allow it to manifest with
clarity, where awareness must become deeds, but first the awareness. And for
the 20-34 its only way to be clear is to wait for somebody to come up to it and
say, “You are power. I want your power. Can I use it for this, that or the other
thing?” Whatever the case may be. And then of course, they are very
impressive. After all, there’s nothing quite like them. 20-34 is really a unique
mechanism.
Potential Manifesting Generator Configurations
Here we have a classic example of as complex a Manifesting Generator as you
want to get, and because one of the most common things that you’ll see with
the combination of the Sacral Center connected to the Throat is that you’re
going to see generally complex definition in somebody’s design. In other
words, it’s rare that you see a 20-34 that’s just a 20-34. It’s actually quite rare.
The reality is that you tend to have very complex designs and this is about as
complex as you want to get. Again, by saying complex, that isn’t to say it’s
more difficult, or this or that, or any
of the other things, but you really
have a lot of factors that are at work
here.
The first thing that’s clear is when
you are looking at this design, the
first thing that you see is that this is
a Manifestor. There’s no question
that this is a Manifestor. You have
the Throat connected to a motor.
That’s the 20-34. So you have
somebody who technically is a
Manifestor. Remember, that is the technical aspect, the Throat being
connected to a motor. At the same time, we know that this 20-34 is the core of
what we call the Manifesting Generator. In other words, that it’s necessary in
the context of this person’s design to understand that their Type, that they are a
Manifestor but they are a Manifesting Generator. That means that according to
their Type, they have to wait to be asked to use their power.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 29
And unlike a Generator, they do not have to respond in sound. “Um huh…
Uh huh…” Because the Sacral Center is connected to the Throat, they can
respond in words. Now, by the way, you are going to find Manifesting
Generators who don’t have the Sacral connected to the Throat. In other
words, they can have a split in which the Sacral Center is defined. Let’s say the
Sacral is connected over here to the Splenic system and the Throat is connected
down to the emotional system. You’ve still got a Manifesting Generator but
that Manifesting Generator then has to rely on its Sacral voice and it will have
it. And these people have a confusion.
It is like people who are pure Generators and they have the Ajna connected to
the Throat, or the Self connected to the Throat. There is confusion in that
they are conditioned to speak at the highest level. In other words,
communicate through the Throat. They are conditioned to be Throat
Manifestors. And it is often difficult for them to pay attention to their Sacral
voice.
I have had a lot of fun with Generator clients with defined Throats. I will be
sitting with them telling them about their Sacral sound and they will be going
“uh huh” and I’ll point to them and say, “See, that sound.” They look at me
and they look at me and they don’t even know that they have made the sound.
I say to them, “You’ll hear yourself on the tape. You’ll hear the sound. That’s
your generator.” In this particular case, it is not about the Generator going “uh
huh… uh hmm” because it is automatically connected to the Throat and
because the Throat only wants to be able to speak, it can answer immediately.
“You want to go dancing?” “Yes.” Whoosh.
You ask a Manifesting Generator if they want to go dancing and you go
twirling out of the house, “I’m busy dancing…”. They’re wonderful that way.
You listen to response out of them, and they can really dance.
Okay, so what we have in this situation is a split definition. We’ve got a split
definition ‘to do.’ We have a Type that’s a Generating Manifestor, and then we
have an emotional Ego attached to that, off on the side, split off. The moment
you see a defined Solar Plex Center, that’s the moment you know what the
authority is in the design, and the authority in this design is going to be the
wave.

The Unconscious Ego-Solar Plex Channel
Now, every once in a while, people ask me about the difference between
conscious and unconscious. So, let’s look at a difference here. If you look very
carefully at that emotional Ego, you’ll see that what connects it is a tunnel. It’s
like that human being has no idea
whatsoever that they have an
emotion or an Ego. It’s in a tunnel.
Oh, they know it comes out, but
they don’t know it’s there when it
doesn’t come out. They don’t
experience it in their life unless it
pops out through the other.
Now what do we do when we talk
to somebody who’s emotional, we
say to them, “Look, the real thing
for you is that you’ve got this wave,
and the wave goes from hope to pain, and you’ve got to wait till you go
through your wave in order to be clear.” This person doesn’t recognize their
wave. The personality consciously participates. My mantra for that is, “sitting
on the side of a hill, there is a road in front of you, you see cars in the road, you
see the direction they’re going in, you see the colors of the cars, you see the
people in the cars. That’s conscious participation. The unconscious is a
tunnel; there is none of that. You don’t know where anything is, what anything
is until it pops out.”
So you can’t say to this person, “Pay attention to your wave” because there is
no wave to pay attention to as far as they’re concerned, and yet they have this
nagging problem in their life. All splits have this. There is this sense that there
is something that is not complete. Now the first thing to recognize about this
unconscious emotional Ego is that the only thing you can tell them, because
the emotions are always the authority, is “Look, you have to sleep on things.
That’s how you can compensate. You don’t have to worry about not being in
touch with your wave. What’s important for you is that you give your
emotional system time, because time is everything for the emotional system.”
Think about how the emotional system skewers the way in which all of the
Types work, because what the emotional system does is that it always insists
mechanically that you play ‘hard to get’ in your Type. Because the emotions are
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 31
saying, “You can never accept or embrace anything in the moment because
there is no truth in that moment.” So wherever you see a defined emotional
system, you see an authority that says, “Don’t jump.” This is classic. Look at
the power in this being, and look at his undefined splenic system. He wants to
jump so badly. Oh, he aches to
jump. He longs for it, just to fly in
the moment, no resistance. 20-34s
often think they can fly, the great
cosmic levitators. It’s my own joke.
So with emotional authority like this
demanding that you play hard to
get, how does the mechanical
situation work for this manifesting
emotional Generator? Because
that’s what we have, a manifesting
emotional Generator? So
somebody comes up to his being and says, “I would like you to paint a mural.”
And even though everything inside of them wants to leap in that moment and
embrace the now—after all, here is the 20 without the 57, calling it to the
spontaneous existential response, and because this person is a Manifestor, this
person jumps.
Now, of course, if there was no emotional system connected, that would be
perfect, correct behavior, “Would you like to do this?” “Yes. Where is the
wall?” Instantly, but you see they can’t say yes. They can say, “Yes, maybe” or
“Yes, but…” but they can’t say, “Yes.” They have to say, “I’ve got to think
about it. I don’t want to jump now. I want to be clear. You’re going to have
to ask me again.” See, this is the most difficult thing to understand in working
with clients and working with their design. The moment you’re dealing with
those who are emotional, you’re asking of them a patience that most of us
attribute to Job and St. Augustine.
The reality is that this is an enormous task, this task of, particularly when you’re
dealing with an archetypal force like this, a manifesting force like this, with an
undefined splenic system, so it’s torture not to jump. Nothing feels better than
that jump in the moment, no matter how devastating its results. And yet, out
of awareness for this Type to recognize that its glory, and I mean glory, lies in
being able to say, “Yes, but I want to think about it. I want to sleep on it.” .
32 Channels By Type
This is the magic of the emotional system. If you allow the emotional system
to guide you, if you give it the time necessary, it’ll give you the clarity to be able
to stay with what you do. The moment that the emotional system is focused
on a task, that it is ready to do, it
becomes an incredibly powerful
motor instead of a disturbance. It’s
a very, very powerful force. The
thing about how difficult that is for
somebody who comes to you who
has this kind of design.
Here, they have the 8-1 and the 20-
34, they’re very individual. They
need to make a contribution. They
desperately need to express
themselves. They suffer from
melancholy. You meet them when they’re down, you meet them when they’re
unhappy, you say to them, “Would you like to do this?” they jump. Not only
that, that’s the good scenario. The bad scenario is that they don’t know
anything about it entirely, and they just do their manifesting trip. They don’t
inform anyone; they just go banging through things, “I’m going to make my
contribution to you whether you like it or not.”
And of course, they end up being deeply angry, angry at the world. He was
very angry at the world, angry at life. And of course, they end up being—
because it’s a 20-34, because it does not call for caring—that there is no
nurturing force for it other than the correct activity. After all, this is
somebody’s design to make a contribution from their activity. That’s what
they’re here to do. And yet, the only way they’re going to be able to do that
successfully is if they wait out the wave of their emotional authority, so that
they can finally commit themselves to being busy to something that truly makes
a contribution.
And you can see that he does know what to be busy about, and you can see
he’s not busy for himself. He does not have the 10; he does not have the 57.
He’s a compulsive busy person that’s always saying, “I know, I know I’m busy,
and I know by being busy, I’m making a contribution. So I have to keep busy
to make my contribution,” and that’s the mantra. This is a child that really got
punished. I’m sure if you go back into the background of this creature’s life,
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 33
you’ll see that he was heavily punished playing the Manifestor, driven by the
power of the Sacral.
And you see here is somebody that
even though they have a defined
Ego, that that Ego doesn’t give
them their rest, it doesn’t. It’s
overwritten by the Sacral. And one
of those things to understand is
that the moment that this person
would give true authority to their
emotional system, their Ego would
have a chance to be able to say,
“No, we’re not going to be busy
with that because that’s a killer.”
But unless that emotional authority
is there first, then the Sacral Center just ends up in this incredible busyness.
And remember, the great quitters of the world are Generators. And they’re
always going to quit when they haven’t entered into whatever it is correctly,
according to their Type. A Manifestor that quits creates a shockwave, just as
they create a shockwave the moment that you ask them because they will
literally dance you out the door, all that energy waiting to be busy for the right
thing, to feel good within oneself.
There’s something else to keep in mind about circuitry and design. You can
see here that this split is a circuit split as well. In other words, individuality that
is the face that you meet, because that’s the manifesting face of this design and
then the tribal nature underneath. That emotional system doesn’t particularly
like the freak in what it does nor does it necessarily understand it and vice
versa. And of course, the moment that you bring those two forces together is
the moment that you really have mutation.
Splits: Go to a Public Place Where You can be Private
One of the oldest formulas that I’ve used in analysis for splits from the
beginning, is ‘go to a public place where you can be private.’ There is nothing
more important for a split definition than the public place where they can be
private. All the splits in this room have that advantage, and the advantage is
34 Channels By Type
that you get your splits hooked up mechanically without there being a direct
purpose or motive in it, or necessary control in it by the other.
You understand what that means? Somebody like this who is a split definition,
it is essential for them in their life that the authority and their nature come
together, so that this identity and the power of this identity to take action in the
world has a proper relationship to its emotional Ego. They’re going to look for
someone who is going to hook that up.
Splits are Stuck with the Bridge
I showed you earlier the chart of Frida Kahlo; she hooks that split up. But
think about what that means in relationships. Remember, genetically, we’re
always turned on by what we’re not. We’re always looking for the gate that we
don’t have. We’re always looking for the circuit aspect we don’t have. We’re
always looking for the center that we don’t have. We’re always interested in
those things. And then you meet a variation on that theme—because there’s
six billion variations—you take them into your environment, or you into theirs,
and then you’re stuck with that bridge or those bridges.
Communication Only Comes through the Bridge
Now think about what that means for the split. It means that the only way in
which you’re going to be able to communicate with the other is through the
bridges that are established in that union. So, for example, if the bridge is
individual, then the conversation is always going to be from a deeply personal
perspective: I, I, I, I on either side, and neither side particularly listening to each
other. It may be tribal, and the conversation then is always material and
possessive.
In other words, the split definition in its relationship is always being
conditioned to process the relationship between its aspects in a certain way by
its partner. So on one hand, yes, that’s very tasty. It’s very nice. It can be
incredibly healthy. On the other hand, it’s very manipulative. So what I tell
splits in their relationships is that when they’re having a problem with their
lover, go to a public place where they can be private. Go sit in a restaurant;
because you see, once the dilemma is there in the relationship, because it’s
operating through controlled conditioned bridges, there’s no way around all
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 35
that. There is no way for the split to have other ways to express themselves
through those three different or two or four different aspects.
You go into the restaurant, and you get the public aura. You get the
mechanical aura of the uninvolved, unconcerned other, and yet, you take
advantage of that aura. That aura hooks up your split. And the moment that it
hooks up your split, you’re not conditioned by your lover, your friend or your
partner’s structure. You can find other ways to express yourself in order to
deal with whatever the situation happens to be.
So think about the attractiveness of this. For him, in his design, he needs
somebody in his life that’s going to bring that split together. Yet, at the same
time, he can never rely on that split, that bridge and give it authority; he can’t.
The only true capacity in this person to know for sure about anything is that
they have to honor what is there in their emotional system; they have to honor
the wave. And as long as they honor the wave, as long as they’re waiting to
respond as a Manifestor, then they’re not going to have resistance in their life,
and they’re going to be both healthy, healthy—it’s very important—and
successful in being themselves.
Emotional Sickness
One of the things that happens to a Type like this is that because the split does
not manifest or generate—it’s a projected aspect after all—it ends up getting
damaged. You see, if you are an
emotional person and you ignore
your emotional authority, you’re
going to suffer emotional sickness.
That means you’re going to have
problems with the kidneys and the
pancreas, and you’re going to have
problems with the prostate. You’re
going to have problems with water
retention, bloated bodies, inflated
veins, kidney stones, all of that
stuff.

You pay a terrible price when you ignore the way a machine is supposed to run.
We all know that from the technologies that we have. If you don’t operate
them properly, they just don’t work. It’s a great metaphor for all of us. So in
somebody like this, you know what’s going to happen to them. They’re going
to have heart disease, stomach problems, kidney problems. They’re going to be
sick, they’re going to be sick because they’re not going to be paying attention to
the authority of their emotions. They’re going to be paying attention to this
Splenic Center that’s open, that’s sucking in the whole world and desperately
wants to feel good and desperately wants to be able to act in the now.
The Holy Ground or the Burning Place
Any center you have that is undefined has an enormous impact on you,
enormous impact. And of course, in the genetic continuity of the way we’re
designed, we’re all designed to deal with a basic dilemma, each of us within our
design. That dilemma, that test, that trial, if you will, is whether we can live out
our Type or not. That’s the holy ground, and it’s also the burning place. So in
the genetic continuity of this design, you have somebody who’s ready to give,
automatically, authority to what they’re not, first, mental authority.
All The Crystals Of Consciousness…
In the mystical cosmology of Human Design, all the crystals of consciousness,
all the crystals of consciousness, represent the Ajna of the whole. We are the
developing and programming consciousness of what is unborn. It’s very
important for us to recognize that Human Design, which is extremely mental,
is about that. It’s about understanding the whole business of how the Maia
operates, which gives us a mind that is an incredible theme for us. It is the
most powerful process that we have in our human lives, dominated by the
mind and dominated by the way in which we see through our eyes.
‘No Choice’ Pisses People Off
Everybody assumes coming into the world that this mind of theirs is
everything. It does, after all, give the world its illusionary form. It is where we
spend all of our time, up there in the mind. And our conditioning as
Manifestors is to assume that we, through our minds, are directing our power.
The whole business of no choice. Jesus, that pisses people off. It’s so funny to
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 37
me; it’s really so funny to me. You see, we know that it’s true, and we’ve
already proven it scientifically. This is what Einstein was about.
We have proven that we have an inflationary universe. We have proven that
everything has been moving out from the same point, that everything has
literally been moving in a straight line. Oh, yes, there is a curvature in space,
but that comes from vast amounts of distance and gravity. But the reality is
that the human lifetime is faster than any bullet you can imagine, and it is a
straight line moving in space. It is a law of science; it is deeply recognized and
proven.
That means when you look backwards, you see only a straight line because
that’s all there is. You look forward, and in the delusion of your vanity, you
assume that you’re choosing that direction. Stand in front of a bullet train and
change it, “No, no, no, I’m going to push you over here.” Yeah, just try to get
off one of those things. You see, delusion is built into us because the way in
which our neocortex works is that it actually gets the instructions after they’ve
been initiated in the deep gray areas of the brain.
We’re not in charge of what we say. We’re not in charge of what we do. We’re
not in charge of any of those things. We’re just hurtling through space. And
yet, we have this incredible vanity that we have some kind of choice about
something, “Oh, I did that.” I love people when they tell me that. “I’m
working on myself,” they say. It’s incredible to me; it’s like people saying, “I
chose to come here.” You’ve got a problem.
It’s not about that. It is our deep
insecurity, our deep fear that says to
us, “We’d better claim something
because if we don’t claim something,
then what are we going to do?”
We’re helpless, flying. You see, the
whole business about being able to
accept your Type is to be able to
accept the mechanical truths. It’s not
about all this mind stuff. This human
being, in their design, is so lost in the
mind.
38 Channels By Type
Even though they never say what they want to say, even though it never comes
out the way they want it to come out, even though they suffer endlessly from
not being able to express their mental field, they still think that their mind is
running their life. Even when their mind can’t do what they want it to do, even
though their life can’t be what they expect it to be, even though they can’t learn
what they think they should be able to learn, they still think that their mind
runs their life.
The Ajna Center, the Head Center, there is no inner authority. That is a rule.
And if you look at it, you can see it. The mind isn’t connected to a motor; it’s
not designed to do. It’s only designed to be recognized. It’s only designed to
make outer contributions. My mind to you, not my mind to me. My mind is
not my authority, cannot be my authority, never will be my authority, but it can
be an authority on the outside, all of our minds. That’s what it’s about, defined
or undefined.
When you look at somebody’s design like this, and they’ve got an undefined
Splenic system that says, “I want to feel good, and I want to act in the now.”
And they have a mind that is open like that, full of dreams of what it should do,
could do, might do, and the mind says, “Let’s do that,” and that Manifestor
jumps and gets hammered, punished, resistance everywhere. And because they
ignore their emotional system, they explode when it doesn’t work, and they
make themselves emotionally sick because they don’t give the emotional system
its rightful authority. And it will punish you if you don’t give it its authority.
Essential to Know what the Authority is Not
You see, when you bring somebody to their Type, it’s essential that you let
them know what is not their authority. It’s essential; it’s obvious here. The
authority is not to act in the now. “Don’t act in the now. Don’t trust your
mind to tell you what is right.”
Undefined Ajna, or Ajna-Head Defined with an Open Throat
Whenever I deal with somebody that has an undefined Ajna Center or
somebody who has the Ajna defined to the Head with an open Throat, I’m
always talking to them about not writing the script. You see, that’s what they
try to do because, of course, they never get things to come out of their mouth
naturally the way the mind would like it to. They can never express themselves
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 39
precisely the way they want to, and they never control the timing of when that
expression can possibly take place. You know how frustrating that is.
We saw that in Dustin Hoffman’s chart where what you get out of that with
that open Throat and that structure is somebody that wants to read a script.
Then they can feel secure in the words that come out.
For these people, it’s important to see that the mind doesn’t stop working. It’s
not like you can say to somebody, “Excuse me, your mind is not your inner
authority. We’re now going to turn it off.” It doesn’t work that way. And the
mind is never going to give up trying to be an authority in your life, never. It
just stops being persistent. That’s my experience.
My experience is my mind tells me what to do, and my body doesn’t move. My
mind stops, goes onto something else. It takes a shot. It’s always going to take
a shot. It’s always going to try to be in control because that’s the nature of the
depth of how important mind field is for us. It’s where we make up the Maia.
It’s where we give names to it. It’s the place of our greatest illusions.
The Healthiest People are…
See, bringing somebody to their Type, the essential ingredient for them is not
simply that you say to them, “Look, this is your Type, and this is the way you
have to deal with the world.” The other part of that is, “You can’t be your
Type, and you can’t live out that Type if you’re giving authority to what you’re
not. And you’ve been giving authority to these things that are not you.” And
remember that for the benefit of your clients, what it really has to do with is
that by living out your Type, you’re healthy. That’s very important to this kind
of a design with an undefined immune system.
The Undefined Center’s Potential is Profound
One of these things to be clear is that the moment that one is not conditioned
ignorantly in an undefined center, that’s the moment that that undefined center
has the capacity to become more powerful than the defined center. We often
forget that. The healthiest people on earth are people who have undefined
immune systems and look after themselves. These are the healthiest people on
earth.
40 Channels By Type
They are the only ones that really know what’s good for them and what isn’t
good for them. They’re the only ones that have the sensitivity that is necessary
to diet, and have therapy and all of these things. It is, after all, their gift. The
fact is that we have a lot of very, very unhealthy undefined splenic people, but
that’s because of the way the not-self operates. It’s not because of the nature
of the Spleen, that way.
You see, the potential in any undefined center is profound. Because it’s not
fixed,—remember, when you’re looking at definition, so often people forget
this, definition is a very narrow thing. It’s a very, very, very narrow thing. It’s
one line going to another line. And in fact, it’s even narrower than that, but I
don’t want to go into all the layers underneath. It’s so fixed, it’s incredible, and
so unbelievably limited. Like asking an emotional person to describe emotions,
it’s hilarious. They’re going to describe their gate, their channel, whatever, but
they’re not describing emotions. They’re describing their emotional nature.
These open centers have an incredible capacity. So when you’re dealing with
the immune system, and you’re dealing with our fundamental awareness, it’s the
only awareness that we have that we can truly rely on; it’s the only one. The
minds a fuck; it’s what it does, screws us around all the time, endlessly trying to
be the little corporal that becomes dictator, always trying to run the whole
show and doesn’t know what the hell to do in life. It has no connection to our
well-being whatsoever. It’s driven by anxiety.
The Undefined Splenic System
The Splenic system is there to keep us alive; it’s there to keep us alive. So when
you have an undefined immune system, the first thing for that undefined
immune system to recognize is that that is a genetic continuity that’s saying to
it, “Never jump.” That’s all it is saying, “Never jump, that is fundamentally
unhealthy.” And it means never jump in many ways. I’ve told this before
about children with undefined Splenic systems, the child with the undefined
Spleen that gets ill, once they’re better, that’s not the moment for them to jump
back into their process. That’s the moment to still wait a little longer to make
sure they’re really recovered because then that immune system is healthy.
And you see the undefined immune system recognizes the enemy. If you’ve
got a defined immune system, it only recognizes one aspect of the enemy
because the immune system is only interested in enemies, “Who do I kill?” I
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 41
love all these pacifists and their trip. Our whole health system is about murder.
It’s hilarious. We’ve got this immune system that’s on a rampage all the time,
killing every moment, and that people don’t tune into that; they don’t.
The open immune system has an incredible alert system; it’s alert. That’s what
it’s there for. It’s there to recognize all the potential infections, all the potential
viruses, all the potential enemies, not just one theme of it but all of it. That is
its inherent wisdom, and the wisdom is lost the moment it denies its
mechanics. The wisdom is lost the moment it’s existential.
So here’s our 20-34, I’m busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, and I’m
individual busy, and I’m connected to the 20th gate which is the only existential
gate. The gods are cruel. They really set you up. And only when you play the
game do you get to win. But you’ve got to play the game; you’ve got to play
the Type. That 20-34 is desperate to act in the now, and it is fundamentally
unhealthy for it and unwise for it. So this human being with that gift, that gift
of being able to truly make a contribution through their activity, they can have
a healthy and productive life if they give authority to their emotions. And
because they can’t have real access to their emotions, they have to see that it’s a
matter of time for them.
And in that time between somebody coming to them and saying, “Do you want
to paint the wall?” to the time that they say yes or no, they go to a public place
where they could be private so they could bring together those aspects of their
nature and move through their wave and be clear. The net result of that is by
not acting spontaneously, they’re wise and healthy. By waiting out their wave,
they have emotional integrity in their clarity. And finally, by allowing their
manifesting gift to emerge without resistance, they are deeply impressive,
charismatic creatures. Everybody admires them. Everybody thinks they’re
wonderful. Everybody thinks their kids should be just like them.
Instant Gratification
That’s the magic that’s possible, and it simply means following clearly the
mechanical steps of that combination. You have all the information. That’s
your years of training. Now, the key for you is to see that if you work from the
level of Type, and you see that what you offer to your clients is a gateway to
their experiment: Instant gratification, instant gratification. That’s what it’s
42 Channels By Type
about. That’s what the general public needs. They need to have something
that they can grasp and work with right there and then.
And all you have to do is guide them away from those areas that have distorted
that capacity, where they have fallen into the conditioned pattern. And when I
see this chart in front of me, I know how messed up that life is. That’s a
messed up life, full of pain, punishment, frustration, rage. And of course,
obviously, it does not need to be that way, not their fault, not their time, not
their good fortune, not their good fortune like yourselves to understand how
the mechanism works.
The 12-22: Emotional Manifestation
We go from the integration and its primary manifesting theme, which is the
combination of Throat and
Sacral, the Manifesting
Generator theme, and we
come to a pure manifesting
theme, but a pure manifesting
theme in the sense that there
is no Sacral involved. But
what we’re dealing with is an
emotional Manifesting
channel, the 12-22. This is an emotional Manifesting channel.
The Theme of Anger and the Strategy of Informing
So let’s be clear about this just as we’ve seen in the 35-36 that emotional
manifestation is the most dangerous, poisoning and chaotic potential of the
unaware emotional system. It can simply blast off and it does. And it doesn’t
blast off only into space, it blasts off into everybody else that’s around it. And
of course, we know that the nature of the Manifestor, the theme of Manifestor
is the theme of anger.
The moment you connect the manifesting theme directly to the Solar Plex
system, you have the theme of anger as rage or the potential of anger as rage.
And we know that when we’re dealing with a pure Manifestor that they have a
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 43
basic strategy, and that strategy is very important for them. That is, they must
inform before they act.
So you have a job. You are a Manifestor, you want to quit. You can quit at any
moment. You are a Manifestor. You can go out and
slam the door, but you’re only going to meet resistance
and problems.
The reality is that you need to inform before you act. So
the Manifestor tells somebody that they’re working with,
“I’m thinking of going; I may even go today.” And that
person says, “Go for it.” And off the Manifestor goes,
and there is no resistance. However, the 12-22, the
Channel of Openness, this is conditioned by emotional
authority; this is a channel rooted in emotional
authority. And the emotional authority says, “It is not possible to be
spontaneous.” This is not the Spleen. It is not possible, this is genetic
continuity, it’s not possible to be spontaneous. You have to wait out the wave.
Which means that in order for the emotional Manifestor to successfully live out
their Type, they have to be able to go through the wave before they inform. So
you’re in your job, and you are an emotional Manifestor, and you hate your job.
Don’t inform anybody of that because, of course, you’re only in a place in your
wave. You may discover a day or two later when your wave changes and you
move upwards, that you really do love your job. And if you blurted it out
emotionally in the down end of your wave, and you said, “You know, I hate
this place, and I want to leave,” chances are you’re going to get fired; chances
are dreams come true.
The Emotional System is Sickest when Spontaneous
However, you’ll discover that days later that job feels okay for you when you’re
up in your wave, and that there was no need to inform anyone, and there’s no
need to lose your job because of it. It is only the spontaneous that is
destructive to the emotional being. What makes the emotional system the
sickest is when it’s rooted in the need, the desire, the passion to be
spontaneous.

The strategies for living out your Type is essential information for those people
who meet their design. And when you’re dealing with a defined emotional
system, and you’re dealing with such a powerful energy, you have to recognize
how difficult it is for emotional people to be able to restrain themselves long
enough to be able to be clear.
It Takes Time to Learn Restraint out of Awareness
And when we speak of the emotional system being conditioned by a timeframe,
waiting out the wave, you can see that that also becomes, in the macrocosm of
a human life, that it takes time for the emotional being, years and years and
years for the emotional being, to be able to finally be restrained out of
awareness. It’s not about trying to control your emotions.
You see, if you teach children who are emotional about living out the wave,
they don’t ever have to go through that. But the moment that you have those
who do not understand the wave, they’ve gone through most of their life
jumping at places in the wave, being spontaneous, paying the emotional price
for it, inflicting the emotional pain on both themselves and others that
participate in that, and with the results of the unhealthiness in all of that.
So it takes until they get into their 30s and mostly into their 40s before
emotional people actually have the capacity to say, “I don’t have to do that
because I’ve been there. I have done that. I know how bad that is. That’s not
for me. I don’t have to jump.” Now, that is the ability to be clear out of
awareness, and it takes time.
So one of the things to recognize about meeting emotional Manifesting
channels, when you meet the 12-22, when you meet the 35-36, you have to be
so clear with those that you’re meeting because you’re meeting people who are
living the not self, who desperately want to be spontaneous, who are always
exploding on their wave, to be able to help them with the simple, simple guide
of sleeping on things.
Three Times
It is the first step for any emotional person. It is the first step towards
awareness. It’s the first step towards clarity. It’s this sleeping on things. Now
obviously, in most cases, it’s okay, but it’s never enough. For an emotional
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 45
person to know somebody else, they have to be in their aura three times on
three different occasions. That’s the first thing, because out of that
triangulation comes the ability to make some kind of clear emotional decision.
Remember that the defined emotional center always has authority to make
decisions, always. It’s the only authority for those decisions.
Sleep on it for Most Things
And so that waiting, the first step is to sleep on it, but out of that comes a
natural growth. And what it means basically for the emotional person at the
practical level is that most things in their life they only need to sleep on. This
stuff that isn’t major but still the kind of things that come into your life every
single day. And those are the kind of things that you can say, “I’ll talk to you
about it tomorrow,” and you can do it without sounding standoffish. “You
know, I’m really busy now. Give me a chance. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.” Just
so you can do that on the basic things.
Larger Things Take Longer
The larger things—career and love, because that’s what really matters, on the
larger things—that’s when it’s necessary to take the time that the emotional
system needs to find clarity, and it’s not enough then just to sleep on it. An
opportunity may be so exciting that it’s hard for you to let go of the high end
of your wave. You have to be able to give major things time, and the minimum
timeframe for that is that if it’s about a person, it’s simply about three different
occasions. If it’s about a career, take a week. Give yourself an opportunity to
move through your wave.
Master Form to Master Material
Now look, the moment that you master form, you master material. That’s a
very important thing to recognize. You see, life is full of struggling. We
struggle in our careers, and we struggle in love. It is because we do not honor
and we are not aware of the form. Now the first thing about the material
plane: recognize the value to any emotional person to wait. The value given to
an emotional person in waiting is that they truly have an opportunity to
establish whether it’s correct for them and what the terms should be.

Getting Your Terms without Resistance: Live Your Type
Living out your Type is about getting your terms and getting your terms
without resistance. Now, it doesn’t mean you’re always going to get what you
want. I won’t sing the song for you. What it really is about is that if you’re
clear, and you wait, you will get the terms that are correct for you. And it
means that sometimes you’re not going to get the deal because somebody
doesn’t want to accept your terms. That always will happen.
But think about the material life of, let’s say, a Generator. The Generator who
is emotional is asked, “Would you like to do this job? I would love to have you
do this work.” And after all, remember, Generators are the great workers. So
the Generator goes, “Umm, but I have to think about this. I’d like you to give
me some time. I’m not really certain now. Maybe we can get together next
week.”
How the Generator Aura Talks
Now remember that the Generator has been asked. Let your aura do the
talking. The Generator walks into the office for the interview. They do not
open up their mouth first. They walk into the interview, and they let their aura
do the talking, “Here’s my power. I am a Generator. I can do anything if it’s
for me to do, and I will do anything possible if I am properly asked. And I will
be the best employee you have ever had if you pay attention to my mechanics.”
And your aura does that talking as a Generator.
And the person at the other end recognizes that power without that ever being
a conscious process. It’s just there, and they have a mechanical reaction to it.
They start the conversation. And then they get to the point that they say to
you, “Would you like to do this job?” And in that moment is the moment that
the Generator goes, “Hmm, I’m not certain. Seems interesting, feels good right
now, but I don’t really know. I want to make sure that this would be the right
thing for me. Why don’t we get together in a week?”
You know how much power that Generator garners in that week? It is
incredible. The person at the other end had the aura taken away from them.
They lost their wonderful mule slave. They didn’t get them. And they didn’t
get them, and they figure, “Now I really have to have them.” And they’re ready
to accept your terms. So the Generator comes back a week later, and the
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 47
interviewer says, “Well, what do you think? Have you made up your mind?”
And again, it does not start the conversation; it just comes in.
And it says, “Um huh, but I would like this and this and this, and I’d like to do
it this way, and I’d like to get paid on Wednesdays, and I want the parking lot
space over there beside the tree.” They’ll get at least half of that because they
are wanted, and they’re living out their Type, and they’re going to get the
material reward that is correct for them. Now it doesn’t mean that if you live
out your Type, you’re going to be a millionaire. It’s not about that.
Live Your Type, Then Your Life is Perfectly Financed
But if you live out your Type, you’re going to have the material abundance that
you need, because remember, the moment you stop being in control of your
life, your life is perfectly financed. This is what people don’t get. You live out
your own life, and God’s banker looks after you. The check is in the mail.
The 12-22 – Openness, A Social Being, Caution
The 12-22 is the Channel of Openness; it’s a design of a social being. It’s the
only social capacity inherent in individuality, and individuality makes up three
different circuits. So this is the only social potential in individuality. The
nature of the 12th gate, something that we’ve looked at over the years, the very
unusualness of it, because it is the 12th gate where the mutation took place in
our larynx that allowed us to be able to develop the communicative skills that
we have. And as such, this 12th gate, which is the gate of caution, which is one
of the three gates of aloneness, is also the gate of articulation.
Driven Emotionally to be In Love with Anything
One of the most important things about the 12-22 is that the 12-22 is driven
emotionally to be in love. I think it’s very important to understand about it, it’s
driven emotionally to be in love with anything and everything. And if it cannot
be emotionally in love with anything or everything, life is a horror.
So there is this impression that one gets from a 12-22 that they are in love with
you. And I don’t mean that in the physical, sexual sense; I don’t mean that in
the language of desire at all. It is this feeling that they really like you. If you
ever meet a 12-22, they are the most likable people. They’re very mysterious
48 Channels By Type
creatures because you see on the surface, they appear to be either tribal or
collective. You can’t really tell the difference. A 12-22 can seem very
collective, this kind of natural sharing socialness to it. It can also feel very, very
tribal. That love of the 12-22 can feel very supportive. They don’t give a shit
about you.
The Outsider who is Camouflaged
All they want is that they can recite you a poem, sing you a song, tell you a
story, get your attention because that’s what they’re about. You see the 12-22
is the mutative venue of the individual. That’s the place where the freak
stranger, outsider is camouflaged. That’s where they have a glow around them.
And if you look at these people—I know so many of them—they are the
greatest mysteries because they look like everyone.
Do you know what I mean? They’re not your typical individual. They don’t
have this freaky flavor to them; they don’t. They’re not the ones that you really
notice right away. They have this camouflage. And so you look at them, and
you think that they have a humdrum, boring, dead-ass life only to discover
when you meet them that they’ve done the most incredible things and know
the most incredible things.
There is a guy I know in Germany who is a 12-22. And so help me, God, you
look at him, and he looks like the person in the Charles Atlas commercials, the
skinny, little, runty kind of creature that everybody is ready to kick sand in their
face. He looks like somebody that would back away from an ant. He looks
like somebody who is just lost, totally, kind of just another grinder in the mill.
The guy was a jetfighter pilot for 25 years, and then he becomes a homeopath.
And if you look at this guy, you would not see any of that. You wouldn’t
notice it. You would never have the impression that there was all of this stuff
that was part of this human being’s reality.
They’re tricky, these 12-22s. They are the only freaks that can hide in a crowd,
and the crowd likes them. That’s their gift. At the same time, they can be the
nastiest, meanest, cruelest creatures you’ll meet. They love nothing better than
to turn away in that friendly aura and say, “That jerk.”
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 49
The Plateau-Spike Wave
Because they also have within them, out of this gate of aloneness, this backing
away from it and a genuine distaste for social intercourse. This Channel of
Openness is also a channel of being closed. It is a design of a social and a
design of an antisocial being, and that operates in the wave. And remember
that it operates in the wave of the individual process, and the wave of the
individual process is that the individual emotional wave is a plateau.
Now that plateau can be adjusted in the course of a lifetime, but there is a
plateau to the individual wave. And then what happens is there’s spiking;
generally, the spike is down into melancholy and always potentially the spike
upwards into bliss. Usually, what happens is that the spike upwards is back to
the plateau. Very important to see how that emotional wave works in the
individual because they can be very misleading. A 12-22. You can be with
them at a social evening, and it appears like they are only there for you, and you
are listening to them because that’s their gift. They get you to listen to them
out of that friendliness.
Schizophrenia in the 39 to 12 Stream
If there is a shift in their wave, they can spike in the moment. What we call
‘schizophrenia’ is something that exists exclusively in this stream from the 39 to
the 12. Turn on a dime. Go from the even plateau flying downwards, and
suddenly, that person who is in your friendly emotional aura can absolutely get
blown away. You’re rhapsodizing somebody, and then you just turn your
shoulder on them and get out of that aura and drop them like a stone,—the
capacity that’s there in the 12-22.
The Biology of the 12-22: The Outside that is Inside
The biology of this channel is significant. Channels have a biology, not
knowledge that’s, well, opened up. And the biology of the 12-22 is the biology
of those things within us that are outside that are inside. Now let me explain
that to you. If you open up your mouth, and you go down your esophagus,
and you go down through the stomach and into the intestines, all of that is
outside that’s been folded inside. When you pour liquid into your mouth, it
hasn’t entered into your body even though it’s in your body, because that’s
actually an outside, the esophagus that’s been folded around.

Eating Disorders: Regulated by Mood
So the 12-22 is about the way in which we deal with food. That’s why the 39-
55, its adrenalized emotional route, is where we find eating disorders, bulimia,
anorexia, because this has to do with eating, itself, and it has to do with the
recognition that eating is regulated by mood.
The Mutation in the 12th Gate Carried only by Females
In the 12-22, what you have is the direct result of the mutation in the 12th gate.
All primates can both breathe and drink at the same time. The human
mutation of the dropping of the larynx stops that process. That mutation is
carried by all females; it is not carried by males. It is a female genetic mutation,
and it is passed onto their offspring, and it clicks into gear in the first year of
life. So one of the things to recognize is that’s why children don’t speak until
they’re around 1 year old. As long as there is this potential to breathe and
drink at the same time, they cannot speak; they can make sounds. So what
happens to them—and anyone who has a baby notices this—is that by drinking
and breathing at the same time, they don’t digest well, and they spit a lot of it
up.
12-22s Do Not Know How to Breathe Correctly
So the 12-22 has a lot to do with how we digest food. One of the most
common complaints of 12-22s is gas. In other words, this is not being able to
hold your breath properly while you eat and taking in too much air. 12-22s
take in too much air. It is absolutely clear that people in this emotional stream
do not know how to breathe.
Breathing Correctly Eliminates Gas and Regulates Mood
Now, everybody thinks that because we breathe, we know how to breathe, and
it is not true. And it is not for everybody in this lifetime to breathe correctly.
It’s often the result of a gift, people who sing, for example. But the reality is
that learning how to breathe for somebody who is emotional through this
stream is absolutely essential. First of all, being able to breathe properly, you
get rid of the gas, and that’s the first thing. The second thing to recognize
about that is that the breathing properly will regulate the mood. It takes the
edge off the moods. .
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 51
Never Ever Force a 12-22 Child to Eat
And of course, the most important thing for the individual, and the most
important thing for the 12-22 individual child, is that they are never ever, ever,
ever forced to eat, ever. Now with the institutions that we have which are at
the family level tribal, where everybody is expected to be at the table at the
same time and share in the communal feast, the 19-49 tribal ritual of food, this
is exceedingly difficult for the individual.
Stuttering, Bad Breath, Digestion Problems
They are forced to eat when they’re not in the mood, and they end up with a
disturbed breath system, often leading to bad breath. They end up with
problems in being able to speak. And instead of the
12th gate being the gate of articulation, it is the gate of
stuttering. It is the gate of language handicaps. It is the
gate of speaking handicaps.
Take a look at the 12.4, and you see the real dichotomy
of the potential here. The exalted is the prophet that
can arouse the stagnant, and the detriment is the voice
in the wilderness. I meet a lot of 12.4s with the
detriment who have always had language problems,
many of them mute, unable to speak, and most of them
with stuttering problems. This is in the breath. That’s why when stutterers
sing, they don’t stutter because they’re breathing properly when they sing.
Singing or Breath Therapy is Very Helpful
So one of the things always to see very clearly in 12-22s is that you need to
guide them. Remember, you’re dealing with the individual. You cannot
control them. You cannot directly influence them. But you need to guide
them towards breathing properly. And what I do generally is that I encourage
them to sing. That’s all. That’s very, very helpful. And in cases where I see
that there is really a difficulty, I encourage them to go see a good breath
therapist.
And by the way, whenever you recommend to anybody such a thing, I’m not
talking about the breath therapists that do rebirthing and these kinds of
techniques. I’m talking about somebody who can teach you how to sing, who
52 Channels By Type
really understands breath in that way, purely mechanical, no spiritual shit
attached, so that you really have an opportunity to learn how to breathe, and
you don’t have to get all the propaganda that goes with it.
The other thing is that any 12-22 must use their voice because that is their gift;
it is a gift of being able to express oneself and get the opportunity to be able to
bring mutation to others because they have this wonderful, friendly aura in
which they don’t feel threatening. The pure individual is always threatening.
You can sense their difference. The 12-22s sneak up on you.
Our Stream of Romance
I talked about how important love is to the 12-22. Now, that’s true right down
from the 39, 55, this stream. It is in the sexual language our stream of
romance. And in it being a stream of romance, romance is built on building
passion, building a fire. And everything about building a fire is that you’re
dealing with genetic continuity here. This is an emotional Manifesting channel
that can never be spontaneous, never. It’s clear.
Individuality Needs to be Passionate about Things or
Suffer
So it means that inherent in the individual need for romance and passion is the
authority of the emotional center that says, “Before you can consummate, you
have to go through your wave.” This is so important in understanding
individuality, that individuality needs to be passionate about things. If they
can’t be passionate about something, it’s of no value to them.
You show me a 28-38 that cannot find something that they are passionate
about, and they suffer unbelievably in this life. They see, life as being
absolutely meaningless and purposeless. The individual must have something
that it loves, must have something that it has a passion for, but does not have
to have it. You see, that’s what it’s all about. The greatest love. Anybody who
has faith knows that the greatest love is for something that you can never meet.
Religions have been built on that, this great love of the invisible godhead.
See, this is a romantic notion. And the love grows because you actually don’t
get to meet a god or a goddess. And if you did, you wouldn’t love them so
much, the whole tradition of unrequited love as poetry throughout the middle
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 53
ages and later. Falling in love with somebody you can never have and writing
reams of poetry, the best poetry, wonderful poetry, deep, deep, deep, deep in
that need, the passion of that, and the passion grows as a fire.
Being in Love with it, not Having It
We all know that if you take the unrequited poet, and you put it together with
the duchess of boo-boo baba that it would last 10 minutes, over. So it’s not
just about the individual having to have the thing; it’s about being able to be in
love with it. They need that because as an emotional process, they can never
jump into consummation; they must wait out the wave.
When I taught the course on sexuality, I reminded you that the 12-22 that falls
in love with somebody, that listens to them, talks to them, shares everything,
tells every life story, tells all the things about the future, talks about everything
until finally, they have to go to bed. Boy, if that lovemaking doesn’t work first
time, right away, it’s over. It’s incredible to watch what happens to individuals
when the fire goes out, because it’s instantaneous. It’s like someone turned off
the gas; it’s instantaneous. That doesn’t even leave burning coals; nothing, just
whoosh.
And then of course, if you don’t understand how that works, and if you don’t
understand how the emotional system works, the 12-22 is a channel of
emotionalized melancholy. It’s more complex, like the 39-55, than any other
emotional channel because it carries with it the individual melancholy. And of
course, they ride together and embrace each other. The emotional system
firing up the melancholy, giving the sadness its heaviness and this dropping-off
feeling.
The Most Acoustically Sensitive People On Earth
So they have to wait, and then they have to be lucky. Now everything about
being emotional and about being emotionally individual is that these are the
most acoustically sensitive people on earth. You see, the 12-22 needs to speak
the words of love. And it’s not simply that the words of love are poetic and
soothing, and that they have to be both spoken and heard, because it is an
essential aspect of their nature. But tone, there’s many ways to say, “I love
you,” and it’s all in the tone. And nobody is more sensitive to that than the 12-
22. .
54 Channels By Type
You can tell when your lover says, “I love you,” and they hang up the phone
that there’s something wrong in the tone because the tone is everything. And if
you use the wrong tone with a 12-22, they are never ever, ever going to forgive
you, ever. They will carry that with them to their grave. Nothing is more
damaging to them than cacophony.
I Know I Can Try if I’m in the Mood
The language part, this is a voice that says, “I know I can try if I’m in the
mood.” That’s the voice of the 12; that’s the voice of this emotional
Manifestor. And here, it’s so clear: “I know I can try; I know I can try to be
social. I know I can try to deliver the mutation but only if I’m in the mood,
only.”
Reasons for Mood Loses Creativity
So the 12-22 child cannot be forced to eat when it’s not in the mood, and it has
to be encouraged to eat when it is in the mood, and it has to recognize that it
cannot be social if it’s not in the mood. It has to be antisocial which is a
natural part of its life to remove its friendliness from access of others, pull it
out of their aura, get away from them. And of course, most of all, they have to
come to grips with the fact that they cannot give reasons, and they cannot give
reasons to their emotional state. The moment they do that, they lose their
creativity, and we’re highly dependent on that creativity.
Hidden, Antisocial, Secretive Freaks
You have different ways of expressing your relationship to the other through
the streams of the Solar Plex system, the desire and its impersonal experience,
the need for bonding that’s in the tribe. But the individual is yearning for
something to love, anything to love. As an emotional Manifestor, they can’t
just take love, and that’s what they try to do. Remember that if you’re dealing
with an emotional Manifestor, you’re dealing with a truly uncontrollable force,
deeply punished children for all their friendliness. Their parents obviously see
the other side, the antisocial behavior, the refusal to integrate.
Nobody is more stubbornly individual than the 12-22 because they can hide it,
much more obvious in any other aspect of individuality. They hide it; that’s
part of their gift. But it’s also frightening to their parents. It looks like, for
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 55
their parents, that they’ve got “a normal child” that’s like all the other kids and
seems to be a sort of friendly sort, only to discover that they’re really antisocial
freaks who are going to get into all kinds of stuff that’s hidden.
There’s nothing more secretive than a 12-22. You don’t even know they’re a
freak. You don’t know all the things that they’ve done. Classic for a 12-22 to
know a language other than its own and then go to a place where it can hear
that language and never let on that it knows, just so it can listen in.
I had a 12-22 friend who worked in Japan, and he was a 6 foot 4 inches man,
and he’d love to sit on the subway with Japanese women going to work and
listen to their conversations about him, assuming that he could never
understand a word that they were saying. He said it was the most entertaining
part of his life, typical 12-22. And of course, while they’re talking about him
being big and ugly and hairy, and he understands everything they’re saying, he’s
smiling because he’s a 12-22. Ain’t love grand.
So 12-22s have this aspect to them. They keep things well hidden. And of
course, that’s the whole thing about getting everything out of a 12-22 before
you have anything to do with them. The typical situation for the 12-22 is to
talk first. It’s all about talking, and these are the kind of people that will tell
you they love you the moment they meet you. They will talk romance
instantaneously because it is literally natural for them, and they will talk about
their car, their dress, their dog and their prospective lover with the same glow.
Seducing You into that Mutation
So be careful around them that you don’t take it all too seriously because that is
simply their way, to turn life into a romance, to turn life into something you fall
in love with. And of course, that makes them great, great, great seducers.
They’re here to seduce you into that mutation; they’re here to suck you into
that individual vortex, and that’s the way they get you. They’re Clark Kent.
They put on that kind of innocent whatever, and you really sort of like it, and
then they strip off their shirt and get you. That’s what they’re about.
Individuals are Habitual with Things they Love
The other thing is that if you’re dealing with a 12-22 child, there is nothing
more hilariously habitual than an individual, nothing. I tell you my favorite
56 Channels By Type
story of that. Many years ago, in Spain, I was doing a course in an ancient
monastery that had been turned into a five-star hotel by a friend of mine, and
he had invited me to come out there and teach, and it had this incredible
restaurant. The person that I was working with, the Spanish teacher who was
also the translator, he was a 35-36. I’m a pure individual, and I have the 12. I
don’t have the 22, but I have pure definition in individuality with the 12.
So I go into the restaurant with him, and I see that on menu there is a salmon
salad. It looked really good, so I decided to have that. And then I see that they
have lamb chops, and I wanted lamb that night. So I asked for those things.
Okay, he does his thing. Now we’re going to be there for eight days, and he
loves food; he is a desire person. I’m a passion person; I have to fall in love
with something. He is a desire person; he’s ready for any kind of experience.
So when we come in the second night, I order the same thing. Now you have
to understand, this is a wonderful restaurant with a fabulous menu, and I
ordered the same thing because what I found was that the time before, it was
perfect. Now this is being an individual. Once an individual finds something,
they fall in love with it, and they become instantaneously loyal to it. I’ve had
the same breakfast all my life. I haven’t found one better, so I have the same
one. I’m in love with it. I love fried eggs. Give me a break, that’s what I love.
You can eat cereal, muesli, you can eat anything you want. I don’t care. I’m
going to have what I like.
So the third night we go in, and I order the same thing, and he goes
emotionally apoplectic. He tells me that I’m a deep embarrassment to him. He
can’t even stand watching the waiter come over. He said it’s driving him crazy,
and would I please order something else. I said, “No. Stop trying to condition
me. I like this meal.”
We come in the fourth night. I order the same meal; he leaves the restaurant.
(laughing) He didn’t eat with me again for that trip, and I went back each night
until I left and had the same meal. And it was so much fun to watch the waiter.
I’d walk in the door, the waiter would nod his head like this, and I’d nod my
head like that. That’s being an individual.
And of course, the whole thing about that is that the individual falls in love
with it. And of course, on the nights that he wasn’t there, the people would
come in and sit down with me, they’d say, “What are you having?” And I’d
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 57
say, “Oh, I love this. It’s a great salmon salad.” And I mutate them, and they
eat it because I’m in love with it, and that’s the way it works. It’s an incredible
thing.
So when you’re dealing with your mutative individual child that has the 12-22,
the fact that they will only eat one kind of cereal, don’t turn that into a trip.
Don’t make them feel sick, because if you give them something that they didn’t
want because they were in love with the other thing, you’re really going to
disturb them, and you’re going to disturb them physically.
It’s the whole thing about the protection of human individual right. It’s this
recognition of what a child is in terms of what their mechanics are and how
they can be nourished properly. And of course, what the collective parent or
the tribal parent does is they say, “You know, I’ve got a problem with my child,
he only eats Twinkies. What am I going to do?” The mothers of individual
babies who put them on a schedule instead of just letting the baby tell you it’s
hungry; it will. They’re very good at that. Just let them do it.
And you start feeding your infant child, and you decide because you like lots of
different things that you’re going to get it 8000 different kinds of baby food,
give it a different taste all the time. It’s not healthy. The moment that that
infant enjoys something, keep it a part of its diet. The individual will give up
on things. It’s not like they have to do it for the rest of their life. They may
ultimately find through experience, through their nature, through integrating
with others something that can replace it; otherwise, you wouldn’t have the
28.5. You wouldn’t have this need never to just accept that things are perfect
as they are because mutation can always take place, the 28.5 line of treachery
that so many people don’t understand.
It’s built into the individual process that when you find something you can fall
in love with, you stay with it. That’s where we get the romantic idea of
monogamy. It isn’t in the tribe. The tribe’s bonding is a bargain. If you break
the bargain, you can break the bond. And divorce existed since the beginning
of bonding. It’s the romantic that gives us this notion that you can love
somebody for the rest of your life. I always figured if I could love eggs for the
rest of my life that I may be able to find somebody that I can love for the rest
of my life, maybe; well, we’ll see.
58 Channels By Type
But that is the way the individual works, and of course, that is the dream and
the romance of it, that you fall in love. That’s one of the things about the 12-
22 and their dynamic impact on others. It feels like they’re in love with you in
that moment. And again, I don’t mean this physical love; I mean this love of
interest in you. They make you feel like you are very important; they give you
their full attention. It’s an incredible gift they have that they can just pull you in
like that in order to mutate you, in order to take off their Clark Kent suit and
zap you.
The 12-22 Teenager Falling in Love and Informing
So the 12-22 has to be allowed to fall in love with things. Which means that if
you have a teenage 12-22, they’re going to fall in love with their teachers.
They’re going to fall in love with dreams. They’re going to fall in love with all
kinds of things, and they may, if they are Manifestors, follow their muse. The
12-22 emotional young adult, if they are living out their design, can inform
those around them, “Look, I’m not going to stay in school; I’m going to quit. I
want you to know that. It’s not for me, but I do know what I love, and I do
know what I want to do, and that’s what I want to pursue.”
Let Them Go to Pursue Their Love and the Pain
Then they can get the blessing. They’re an emotional Manifestor. They have
to be clear emotionally beforehand, before they inform, and then you have to
be able to let them go. You have to let them pursue their love. Oh, yes, love
brings broken hearts. That passion that you develop for somebody, when the
fire goes out, it hurts. There’s deep, deep pain in the individual emotional
process. It’s all in the 55th gate, deep, deep pain, the pain that the spirit has not
been found, the pain that love was an illusion and collapsed. That pain is
always lying there.
So when the 12-22 is clear in its emotional field, it is clear to be able to inform.
Then it has to be allowed its freedom. Now most 12-22s don’t get that. A lot
of them run away from home. That’s what they do. They’re emotional
Manifestors, and so they fall in love with the circus, or they fall in love with
someone, or they fall in love with something, and they just ride that wave, and
they run away. And of course, because they run away, because it’s not correct,
they carry the resistance with them.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 59
The Individual Truth: Get the Basics but not all the Way
When I speak of resistance, it isn’t just about the tangible resistance that
somebody is always at your face. It’s about the resistance you carry in your
psyche from forces that don’t let go of you and forces you cannot let go of.
“I’ll show them,” says the 12-22. They’re meant to go out into the world
young; they’re meant for that. You see, individuals grasp things quickly.
Whenever I meet adult individuals, and they’re at these cusp points of their
lives, and because they don’t have a hell of a lot of time available to them, I
always remind them of the individual truth.
The individual truth is that if there is a four-year program, take seven months
of it, get the basics. Get all the basics because without the A, B, Cs, there is
nowhere for the individual to go. Get the basics. Out of those basics, then
you can have your mutation. But don’t go all the way because if you go all the
way, you’re going to be deeply influenced and programmed by the structure,
and you need to get out of it. But you have to have the basics. It’s essential.
So these 12-22s, they grab the basics early; they find something to be in love
with. They find a passion in their lives, and that passion has to be encouraged.
Remember, individuals are not looking for you to care for them, to be worried
about them, “Oh, but you are so young.” And of course, given the way in
which the tribe orchestrates, the way in which we deal with family and social
communion, those parents that are willing to let their children who are 12-22s
follow their passion are abused by their peers. They’re told that they are
failures as parents.
Well, we all understand the joke, and have to take all of that heavy, negative
conditioning, and there’s nothing more painful to a parent than being accused
of being a lousy parent. It hurts. And to establish all of this guilt and blame
because of the propaganda of the tribe or the concepts of the collective. The
collective says, “Your child must be in school so long.”
Crimes of Passion
And so we end up turning these forces, these very friendly 12-22s into serial
killers, into enraged marauders, into people that can come into your life
innocently and thrash you with a deep, deep rage operating inside, a real deep
distaste for humanity. And living out the friendliness of that 12-22 only as a
mask to hide what’s really underneath, and the only mutation they bring is
60 Channels By Type
negative. There is nothing more volatile than these two channels that go from
the emotional system to the Throat; there is nothing more volatile.
The passion to kill, this is where crimes of passion are. Think about what that’s
like. You’re an individual, you’ve got the 12-22, you fall in love with
somebody, they don’t have anything in that channel. They experience it twice
as strongly. In other words, you take them into your love. It becomes a
mutual passion in which the partner rises on that wave. And then at the
moment of consummation, the fire goes out. When that fire goes out to the
one who doesn’t have it, the pain that is inflicted by the loss of that passion,
what it results in,—most crimes of violence are committed by people who
know each other.
25% of all murders in America are spousal. They’re not the ones who get
publicity; the ones who get publicity are the ones in which you don’t have any
motive because those are the ones that we frighten people with, random
killings, meaningless killings. But the truth is that murder is something that is a
part of the family and part of family life and has always been; patricide,
matricide, infanticide, old business.
You see, passion works both ways. And when somebody is taken up to a
romantic high, they really crash when it’s over. That’s about being clear. If you
do not understand your nature, you cannot recognize that in you falling in love
with something, you can actually hurt it and destroy it, without understanding
human beings are so vicious and are so cruel. They don’t mean to be; they
don’t want to be. But the emotional system operating unclearly through this
kind of channel, its impact can be devastating.
The Prophets of Light or Violence
At the same time that the 12-22 can bring us beautiful poetry and songs, it can
bring us hate literature. It can bring us the voice of the demagogue. It can
bring the siren song to violence. That prophet can be a prophet of violence as
easily as it can be a prophet of light or good, and the prophets of violence are
everywhere in our society. All of that is out of a failure to grasp the essence of
how the individual operates and how passion operates and what it means to
live out your Type and what it means to grasp the essence of what the
emotional system is.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 61
The Quantum Nature of the 12-22
In your early study of this, because you learned Human Design through gates
and lines and centers, and if you look at the gates, it
doesn’t give you this. This is the whole thing about
the quantum nature of a channel. You really get to see
what emerges out of those two different parts. After
all, the 22nd gate is the gate of grace or disgrace. But
the moment they come together, the moment that the
emotional system is creating this manifesting capacity,
the moment that you’ve got anger as a theme, rage as
a potential, and the moment you have passion as a
guide and moods as a theme, whoah, look at what
you’re dealing with.
Mutation is Naturally Destructive
And you see, mutation is naturally destructive. I mean mutation is naturally
destructive; it replaces the old order. That’s why, over the years, as long as I’ve
been telling you that Human Design is something for children, it’s here really
that you can grasp this, how difficult it is for the adult 12-22. Appreciate that,
how difficult that is. We had this conversation before this session started about
‘no choice.’ You really have to be lucky. It has to be in your geometry. And if
you’re an emotional being, and you’re caught in the geometry of Human
Design, you’re really lucky and so is everybody else who’s in your life.
You see, the emotional person can bring such pleasure and joy in life. That’s
their gift to the rest of us, those of us who don’t have defined Solar Plex
systems. We need the beauty inherent in that emotional wave. It’s absolutely
essential for us, the pleasure of it. After all, as our third awareness, as the
potential of spirit awareness, it’s actually our doorway to the greatest pleasure
of all, the pure pleasure of being; nothing more, nothing less. When you live
out your Type and you honor the form, the pure pleasure of being is what is
possible for you, always.
We need to have an emotional system that is not controlled but an emotional
system that freely operates out of its wave and out of clarity. So there is a great
deal of work to be done if you have a 12-22 child. You really have to see that
it’s going to be awkward for a parent to have such a child, that it’s not so
62 Channels By Type
convenient to have such a child, that you can’t program them the way you want
to.
But they have a right to see the pure beauty of life, and they, after all, can be
some of our most gifted beings. They bring us mutation in a way in which we
can take it. A little bit of sugar helps the medicine go down. They’re really
sweet at that; they can deliver the goods.
So if we bring them into the world, and we teach them, and then we take the
responsibility of nurturing them, of allowing them to be themselves,—it’s
inconvenient for you as a parent. But think about it this way: you don’t have to
invest as much time in them because they’re going to go early. You’ve got to
give them what they need in the beginning but recognize it’s not a life’s work.
Their freakiness will take them their own way. And of course, in letting them
be that, you get a nice reward as a parent: you get their romantic love.
I’ve got a freak mother; I’ve got great romantic love from my mother. I don’t
know if it’s real love. It’s not about that, and it doesn’t matter to me whether it
is. As an individual, what matters is that I can love her in that way, and that’s
great. And every once in a while, when I hear her voice, it’s nice for me to
have that feeling inside. This is part of what it is to be an individual, to be able
to be in love. So allow these children to find their love, and recognize that the
emotional Manifestor finds it themselves. They just have to inform you about
it; they need to get your blessing.
This is the whole thing about raising a freak. Never forget that what they truly
want from you is your blessing that says, “It’s okay, you’re different. I trust in
your nature. Go for it. Just don’t have any expectation. Just enjoy being in
love with it and see where it leads you.” Then you have a valuable human
being walking around on this planet, changing all kinds of people’s lives,
making a deep impact on others.

The 45-21: The Pure Ego Manifestor
The Tribe is driven by Need
At the beginning of this course, we closed out our Manifesting channels with
the tribe. Remember that the nature of the tribal keynote of support is one of
the most essential things in the
tribal circuitry. The need–
remember that the tribe is
driven by need. This is not
individual passion. This is not
collective desire. This is need.
The tribe is driven by its needs.
And as such those needs are
fundamentally mundane. I
don’t use mundane as a bad word. In other words, they’re the basic needs.
And the basic need is to have a reliable bond. That’s the most important thing
for the tribe, to be able to have a reliable bond and out of that reliable bond
have an assured supply of food and shelter.
The Tribe Spells Out the Bargain
The tribe is concerned, almost exclusively, with bargain in this life. The theme
that’s inherent in the 40-37, the Channel of Community, this theme of bargain
in the relationship. The whole concept of bargain is to recognize that bargain
in itself is neither this nor that. It is, in fact, correct. All relationships require
some kind of give and take. There is a bargain inherent in all of our
relationships. What the tribe likes is to spell that out.
One of the real failures of 20th century relationships is that people are not
having their marriages arranged. There are no clear bargains. There are no
clear agreements. There are no clear standards. And of course, this is
something the tribe lives by. The tribe is deeply upset at the collective for
turning over the apple cart. Because everything was fine up until then because
the bargain was clear. You know, you did this, you did that. Everybody knew
what their role was.

The Propaganda of Free Will is Instilled by the 45-21
The 45-21 is the only pure Ego Manifestor. And as such,
this is the only truly willful being on earth. This is the
only pure will power. And you can see that the 45-21, in
its role of being leaders of the tribe, what they have
instilled in us as propaganda is that we have free will. Our
rulers who are willful assume that we are, too. And our
willful rulers try to make all of us make promises to them.
This is why the rulers collected taxes, or profits in the
modern sense.
Heart Damage
The Ego. In dealing with the Heart Center, you’re dealing with a deep
complexity. And in dealing with the 21st gate, you’re actually dealing with the
gate of the heart muscle itself. It means that if that gate does not operate
properly, the heart gets damaged. The most common is for the 21 in an
undefined Ego, in the identification with will power, the result is a damaged
heart. In the case of the 45-21 where it is defined, if they do not live the rule of
the Manifestor, if they do not inform before they act, then they do damage to
their heart.
Rest is Essential
One of the things to recognize is that the moment you see a defined heart in
somebody’s chart, it’s absolutely essential that you talk to them about the
nature of rest and the importance of rest. The heart cannot produce will power
24 hours a day. It can’t. It will collapse under such pressure. It must have its
rest.
The fact of the matter is this is the most material of all circuitry. The thing to
recognize about rest is that this is not about all Ego beings wanting to be
sadhus. This is about Ego beings wanting to be materially successful enough
so that they can rest when they like. And that the only reason they’re using
their will power in the first place is to create enough material depth so that they
can rest more and more and more.
The Ego equation of work is I have a job, I work eight hours a day, I get X
amount of money and I get two weeks of vacation. Next year, I want to work
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 65
seven hours a day, I want more money, then I want three weeks of vacation.
And so forth and so on.
Think about the nature of community. We would not have the work week.
We would not have regulated hours of labor if it weren’t for Ego Manifestors
demanding it and guiding us because they are natural rulers. After all, as long
as our rulers can rest on their laurels, why not us? And so that ability to be
rewarded went through the society. Even in primitive times it was recognized
that you had to have festivals, you had to have times when people did not have
to work in order to give them that sense of reward. The Ego demands reward
and there is something very important about Ego people.
Commissions, not Flat Rates
I’m an Ego person; I’m an Ego Manifestor but not a pure Manifestor because it
doesn’t go like this directly to the Throat. But nonetheless, I’m an Ego
Manifestor. Now, if somebody says to me, “I’m going to pay you X amount of
dollars to write a book, it’s a flat rate.” I’m not going to do it. I’m not going to
do it because as an Ego person it’s not going to be satisfying at all even if it’s an
enormous sum of money, because the fact of the matter is that no amount of
money is going to be able to compensate for that effort because I’m an Ego
person.
I say, “Jesus, it’s so hard to do this.” So the reality is that the Ego person says,
“If you pay me a commission, a royalty, whatever you want to call those things,
yes, then I’ll do it.” For the average Ego being to receive a check in the mail
ten years later for something they did long, long, long ago, this is joy to the
Ego. This is like YES! There is a God. It’s essential for them.
The Conditions for Work
Now at the mundane level, what that means is that if you’re an Ego person and
you make money, put some of it aside and allow it to grow. It doesn’t matter
that you may not get the best rate; it doesn’t necessarily mean you have to
become a millionaire. It’s simply about you need to get a reward for your
efforts long after the effort has been made. And that means that the Ego
Manifestor always has to have that as its condition in its work. The condition
in its work is: I will be the warrior leader until I can educate my tribe so that I
66 Channels By Type
can sit on my ass in my old age and have them pay for it. Because that’s what
it’s all about.
Selective Will Power
So the first thing to recognize about the nature of using the Ego is that the Ego
has to be used selectively. And that will power is selective will power. It’s not
about being willful to everything. And of course, the gods are cruel; they love
to play with you. And the voice of the 45 says: I have to. The voice of the
channel says: I have to be in control. I have to be in control. This is an
incredible compulsion. It is a will power compulsion. And of course, the
moment that that willfulness is extended to everything is the moment that the
rulers lose their power because they can’t be the ones who do everything.
The Only Reward: To Be a Source of Education
That’s why when you come to really understand the nature of the 45th gate, the
45th gate is very special. It has a special history and it has a special future. The
45th gate is unusual. It’s only one voice for a whole circuit. And the 45th gate
has within it a deep, deep, mystical potential because it is the blood ruler. It is
the natural tribal leader and it is the only force that clearly has a right to
territoriality. That 45, its only way to be rewarded in this life is to be a source
of education. This is the only thing that works for the 45, and of course it’s the
only way to handle the energy of the Ego coming out of the 21.
In other words, the will has to be not so much the will to do the work. “I have
to do this, I have to do that.” But it is the will to get other people to
understand their responsibility and for them to understand what their
contribution has to be.
The moment that the 45-21 takes responsibility for everything is the moment
they exhaust themselves and drop dead of a heart attack. You know, the
commercial, industrial, white-collar world is filled with drop-dead 45-21s. You
can’t do that to the Ego. And yet at the same time, that channel does exactly
that. It puts the Ego under enormous pressure, puts the heart under enormous
pressure because that’s the only way that will power can come out.

The Undefined Ego: Promises Blow the Heart Apart
Why do you think that I tell everybody who has an undefined Ego, never ever
make a promise? Never ever, ever make a promise; ever. You know how
much pressure is necessary to be willful even if you have a big fat Ego
connected to the Throat? It’s incredible. And if you don’t have that defined
Ego and if you’re operating out of an inconsistent field, it’s going to blow your
heart apart. Because that’s what it does.
Heart disease is one of the most common afflictions on the planet. It’s a
common affliction. And it’s the common affliction of the undefined Egos that
make promises and it’s the common affliction of Ego beings who do not
respect their Type; do not know it.
The Generator with a Defined Ego
The Generator that has a defined Ego can only be willful as a response. It
can’t be willful in any other way. It cannot say, “I promise I will love you.” It
can only be willful in response. “Will I see you tomorrow?” “Uh huh.” Then
that will is natural. But if it opens his mouth first and says, “I promise I’ll see
you tomorrow.” Forget it. That will power may never be there; never be there.
So you have an awful lot of people who are walking around on the planet who
have defined Egos, and those people are walking around and they are just time
bombs ready to explode, always making promises, always applying their will
power. And as a result of that, putting enormous pressure on their heart
system and they are popping all the time. You know how much money is spent
in America on heart care? It’s unbelievable. It can feed Africa for a
millennium. It’s unbelievable.
The ‘Free Will’ Pitch – Enslavement of the Psyche
You’re dealing with something that is absolutely essential to our way of life.
That’s why will power has been exalted both in the domain of the public
interest and in all of our religious and spiritual institutions. We have free will as
a result; we are necessarily, could be damned. It’s up to us. If we mess up
we’re going to pay the price. This whole free will pitch. Enslavement of the
psyche, one of the most destructive concepts in the world. A concept that I
would like to destroy; it’s pointless. .

Impact of Defined Egos on Undefined Egos
Free will is something that’s a mechanic of the Maia and it’s limited only to
those who possess it as such; that’s all. But you know how much impact
defined Egos have on making the rest of those people who don’t have defined
Egos sick? They usually do it by trying to help them with the very best
intentions. You have the undefined Ego friend and you’re an Ego person and
you say to them, “You can really quit smoking. I know that you can really quit.
You can really do it. You have the will power.” And as long as they’re in that
person’s aura they are pumped up like hell. And they put enormous pressure
on their heart. “I will do that. I will quit. I will stop.” And they go out the
door and they go onto the street and they stop at the first tobacco store and
they buy some cigarettes and they feel guilty for the rest of their lives. And it
goes on day by day, all the time.
Ego people empowering undefined Ego people to be willful, and not doing it
on purpose, not doing it intentionally, just doing it as a by-product of what they
are, and in the ignorance of what they are, not recognizing the damage that they
do.
Undefined Ego Child
What’s it like for an undefined Ego child to have a defined Ego parent? Wow,
is that ever a trip. You have to be twice as willful. You have to be twice as
good at keeping your promises. You’re held to a much higher standard. Start
off life with a damaged heart. Bizarre, no?
Human beings are so unhealthy. That’s why we spend so much of our
resources on keeping ourselves healthy, because we are so unhealthy. We
happen to be the lucky ones, that out of the 6 billion of us on this planet, we
are an unhealthy lot. And most of us have real problems with our hearts.
Everything about living out your Type and being yourself is about being
healthy. Just as there is nothing more beautiful than a clean Solar Plex system.
There is nothing more impressive that a clean Ego. It’s a beautiful thing to
behold. After all, will power is put up as a standard because it is quite
something. This energy, this capacity to be able to do precisely what one says
one is going to do, and to have the power to live that out. It’s one of those
aspects of human nature that we are impressed with.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 69
Natural Rulers
There are natural rulers, after all. These people that can be willful, they are our
natural blood rulers, not our collective rulers, not our individual masters and
teachers. These are the tribal rulers. These are the rulers of the house, of the
village, of the tribe. They’re the clan rulers. They’re the blood rulers. They
have real power. And they’ve exalted that will power, that’s them. That’s their
expression. And they bring the willfulness to the whole tribe. And out of that,
all of us have been instilled with it from the very beginning. All of us coming
through on the tribal structure, growing up in the tribal environment. All of us
getting the same pitch.
“You have to be willful. You have to promise me that you are going to be
good. You have to promise me that you’re going to do well in school. You
have to promise me that you’re going to study. You have to promise me that
you’re going to do the right thing. You have to promise. You have to promise.
You have to promise. Always. Always. You have to promise to be willful.”
You see it’s a trap. It’s a trap, sucked in to something that you’re not
necessarily a part of. It is not correct for everyone to be willful. It is not.
The Wisdom of the Undefined Ego
The true undefined Ego understands the nature of will. That’s what it’s there
for, to recognize who can be willful, to recognize who truly has the power,
consistently. It’s for the wisdom of what that is. But it’s one of the places
where people are dying all the time. And everything about the tribe is focused
through the Ego; everything. The stream of instinct, the stream of sensitivity;
they find their home in the Ego.
So, the Ego Manifestor has to live out clearly this necessary mechanism of its
Type, this business of informing beforehand. That’s why we finally had a
revolution. We had all kinds of revolutions because our tribal leaders didn’t do
that properly. And the moment that our tribal rulers did not inform us
beforehand, that’s the moment that we had a revolution until finally we went
over to the 31-7 and elected our collective leaders instead, to try to get away
from the arbitrariness of free will.
The Business of Being an Ego Manifestor
Remember, that the whole business of free will, the whole business of being an
Ego Manifestor is that they can be arbitrary in their actions, and their actions
70 Channels By Type
affect the whole tribe. That’s the moment that the tribe resents them because
that’s the moment they’ve not asked for the tribe to come to them and to be
informed. It’s one of the oldest ways of government. It goes back to very
ancient times. This whole business of having councils, often simply councils of
elders. You know, primitive, most often it was sexist, but the fact is that there
was always a way for the tribal leader to take in members of the tribe and to
give them an insight into plans, objectives, directions and these kinds of things.
You see, the responsibility of the tribal ruler is to educate the tribe. It is its
responsibility. In other words, that the tribe is going to fail in its competition
with the other tribes unless it can be better educated. That need for education
is essential and that education isn’t just about education as we understand it
today. It’s about being able to understand what’s necessary to keep the tribe
healthy, functional and successful.
In other words, that’s about providing sewage, plumbing, hospital services; all
of these various things that the tribal ruler is responsible for. They are
responsible for directing the will of the people, and in guiding the will of the
people to provide them with the institutions necessary, to provide them with
safety and protection.
Informing is Not Giving Up Control
One of the most important things about being a Manifestor is that the act of
informing is not an act of giving up control. The ancient king was afraid of the
counselors so they hired the fool. They still had to have a counselor. You
can’t get away from that. Otherwise, it cannot work. In ancient Persia, they
had people who were called Eyes. That was their job. They would go out and
live in various villages and then come back and bring their knowledge of what
they’d seen in real life in the real world so the ruler was not separate from their
people. Essential in the workings of the tribe.
The Obligation and Dilemma of the 45-21
So the 45-21 has an obligation, the obligation that it has in order to receive
what it’s due. In other words, it’s allowed to maintain its territory. It’s allowed
to receive the benefits derived from its rulership: the taxes, the tithes, the
profits, as long as they make sure that the tribe is protected and that the tribe is
informed beforehand. .
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 71
The 45-21 as an Electromagnetic is Optimal
The dilemma is that the 45-21 definition in somebody’s design is exceedingly
difficult. I’ve mentioned many times over the years that the 45, 21 is optimal as
an electromagnetic connection. Then there is a division in the authority and in
the need for will power. There is a compromise necessary. There is a
negotiation necessary, which is a better language, that can exist between the 45
and 21 to clarify where the will has to be applied. And at the moment that the
auras are separate, the compulsion of the 45 to ‘have to do’ is taken away.
The Compulsion of the 45-21 Alone
The moment that the 45-21 sits alone in somebody’s design, then there is this
compulsion to activity, and there is this compulsion to willfulness that knows
no bounds and there is no education of the other. That instead of that, there is
simply the education of the 45-21, and its ongoing “I have to, I have to, I have
to,” in which they want to do everything. When you see the king doing the
plumbing in the castle, you know that the king isn’t going to last long on the
throne. It’s not what it’s about. And of course the dilemma of the 45-21 is
that they insist on being the plumber.
“I am the plumber king.” You have philosopher kings and you have plumber
kings. You have one in Japan, he’s a fishy king. He’s a marine biologist, the
emperor of Japan. Akihito or whatever his name is.
It’s not their job to get down into the nitty-gritty. It’s not their job; it’s their
job to be able to guide, out of their willfulness, to be able to maintain their
territory, to be able to guide others by benefiting them. It’s not about
oppressing them. It is about benefiting them.
The 45-21 Child: What to Teach Them
So, when you’re dealing with the child, you have a 45-21 child, first of all teach
them how to shop. The best shoppers in the world are 45-21s. They are the
world’s best shoppers. They are naturals.
One of my jokes about the 45-21 is that whether you’ve got one or the other,
or you have the whole thing, anytime you get depressed, go shopping. It’s
wonderful what that does for you. See, that’s the reward for your work. It’s
the reward the Ego always needs. The Ego needs those rewards; they’re
72 Channels By Type
essential. Some people go overboard of course. There are a lot of Ego people
who are in debt, they shop until everybody else drops.
So, if you have a child that is a 45-21, the thing to recognize about that child is
that you have to let that child ask you, or tell you about what it’s doing and you
must never ask them. If you have a 45-21 and they come home from school
and you say to them, “What did you do?” They do not like that, that is not
their thing. You have to let them inform you. “You know what happened to
me today.” And you can go, “Oh, no, I don’t. You tell me.”
Let them give you the information. Let them inform you or not. Remember
that. But the most important thing for you to recognize about raising such a
child is to be able to open up all possibilities for them. “You can do whatever
you like, sort of. But tell me first.”
This is the most important thing to teach a manifesting child, and it’s the most
important thing to teach an Ego Manifestor. Because the moment that the Ego
Manifestor learns how to inform is the moment that they eliminate resistance in
their process. They’re naturally accepted and they’re naturally given their
rights. So it’s an essential ingredient for these children that you don’t try to pull
things out of them but that you encourage them to inform you. In other
words, teach them that that is what you would appreciate and what’s healthy
for them but don’t badger them. And they get badgered a lot. They get
badgered all the time. It’s not healthy for them.
The other thing about having an Ego Manifestor for a child is that you cannot
expect them to work according to your ideas of how long things are going to
take. Your child comes home and they say they have homework, and 12
minutes later the TV is on. And you say to them, “Did you do your
homework?” And they inform you that yes they did. This is the way they are.
They’re willful, and the moment they get in to something they will just jump in
there and they will just go ahead and they will do it. You’ll be very surprised
about the fact that they’re not going to labor over things. Laboring is not their
trip. They want to be able to put their feet up as quickly as possible. And they
would like somebody to hand them the remote control on the TV “and do
bring me a snack. And by the way, you can iron my clothes, polish my shoes.”
They are pashas, after all.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 73
And you see, they never get the glory of the pasha’s life unless they learn to
inform. This is the whole thing for them. See, nobody wants to resist a
Manifestor. Please understand that. Manifestors are important to us. And we
would all like to be Manifestors. It’s not like we want to resist them, we don’t.
We want them to say to us that we don’t do things on our own. That’s what
everybody else wants for a Manifestor. They want to know that in that sense
that the Manifestor is not uncontrollable and unpredictable.
They want to know that the Manifestor can be trusted to reveal its intentions
before it acts. Because after all, everybody who knows a Manifestor knows that
they can act anyway. It’s not like these people who are asking to be informed
feel like they’re going to be able to control the Manifestor because of that.
They’re just more comfortable with the Manifestor because of that. It makes
them feel better to see beforehand, “Alright this is what you’re going to do.
Okay.”
Now, this is often very difficult when you’re dealing with children, and
particularly when you’re dealing with Ego children. They say to you, “I’m
going to do this.” And it may be a horrifying idea to you that they are actually
going to go do that. The only thing you can do in that situation is combat
whatever it is that you think is wrong with what they are about to do with just
pure objective education. You can’t stop them. They are willful, they will do it
anyway. You tell them not to smoke, they’ll smoke.
Informing Keeps Tribal Loyalty
You can educate them, but you can never stop them from exercising their will.
That’s why they are what they are. But the moment that you can train them
young enough that they inform you, these are healthy Ego Manifestors and
they are wonderful tribal rulers. You see, because they never lose the loyalty of
the tribe. If you can keep on directing the tribe and you do not inform it, you
lose its loyalty. And the moment you lose the loyalty of the tribe, you’ll lose
your ability to get your taxes, your tithes and your profits. Once you break that
bargain with the tribe, that bargain is often very difficult to repair and to heal.
So, the nurturing of these children, their proper education gives us better tribal
rulers and we need them because the magic in the 45 that I began with, this
magic is that it is the tribe that changes the world. It is the individual with its
74 Channels By Type
individual mutation that can affect, infect the tribe. But it’s only once the tribe
is infected, that change can take place in the world.
The Natural, Royal “We” and Mutation
The collective patina does not change the position of the tribe; never, never.
You can be tribal and accept living in a collective world, but you never give up
your tribe. And if we’re ever going to change the way in which we relate to
each other in which communities operate and in which the family operates,
then it can only happen when the tribe itself is mutated. So, the role of the 45
is the potential through education to mutate the tribe. And that the glory of
the 45 is not when it says “I” it’s when it says “we.” You can get the joke when
you listen to English language royalty, “Oh, we’re fine.”
You’re always looking over the shoulder where the other one is. But this is a
natural “we.” It’s actually the dream of all royalty, to actually and truly be the
essence of their tribe, to be the focus point of their tribe, to be the
embodiment of the spirit of their tribe.
King Juan Carlos II
I’ve had a real privilege in my life to live in Spain, when Spain stopped being a
fascist state and it suddenly became a democracy. And brought into that
democracy was a constitutional king, Juan Carlos II. A very urbane, very
educated man, a true Spaniard and there was a coup d’état in the parliament of
the new democracy in Spain, 1970, I don’t know, it doesn’t matter. Anyway, in
1980.
A couple of militarists pulled out guns in the parliament and said they were
going to take over the country for the military and there were all these people
ducking, politicians jumping under desks or whatever. And there’s Juan Carlos
sitting there, the formal head of the parliament and he was so perfect. This
guy, there was a real king, and you can really see a king. This incredible tribal
ruler. There was no way he was going to let that happen, and there was no way
that he was going to be moved in any way by that experience. You could see
his total disdain for all of that, no move for cover, nothing. This guy was
perfect. He held a country together for years just by being a symbol that had
no power. That’s “we.”
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 75
You see, that’s the royal “we,” it’s the tribal “we.” Anyone who carries the 45
is a king in their house, a queen in their house. It’s not that this is just to those
archetypes of royalty that we have as symbols. In fact, most of them are
perversions of the concept. But the reality is that that 45-21, in its role, is tribal
rulership and the tribal rulership is through that manifesting capacity to really
become the embodiment of the community, to become “we,” to become that
focus point.
The one thing we know about the 45-21 is that that is truly its evolution.
Because other than a few places in this world—Brunei, Saudi Arabia—there
just aren’t many kings left, this is a dying breed. This whole business that you
are automatically the authority because you carry the blood, this is all gone
now. It’s a dead thing that was replaced by the collective promise of we. But
the collective isn’t personal. That’s why the tribe is mutating in that direction
and that mutation can only take place through the 45-21. That’s the place of
that mutation. In other words, to recognize that the tribal law and the tribal
ruler is still essential, but it’s essential at a mutative level. That it is no longer
“I” that it becomes “we.” That the focus point is a point of communion, not
a point of direction. Now, that’s a long process.
We still have kings in the world. We still have this power that exists at the level
of being unaware. And it is exceedingly difficult to teach this to an adult 45-21.
It’s very difficult. They have ‘to do,’ they have to be the plumber kings and
queens. They have to. And it’s so hard for them, so hard for any Manifestor
to recognize that they do not have to do.
The delegation of responsibility is more important to the Ego being than
anything else. They can do specifically what they’re good at, use their will
power specifically for what’s of value and what will work. But not use it for
everything and anything. It’s destructive that way. It’s destructive to their own
heart and their own heart system.
The channel of materialism. Unless we perfect our form both inside and
outside then we do not have the success that is there for us. It’s one thing for
us to come to accept the nature of our form. But the thing to recognize is that
the more there are of us, who live out our Type, the more the organic nature of
the whole will change. It will work according to what its true mechanics are.
That’s deeply true of the tribe.
76 Channels By Type
The tribe is built on the bond and the relationship between men and women.
There has never been a better opportunity for men and women to understand,
appreciate and accept each other than there is though this knowledge. It can
open up for us opportunities to see where the community is supposed to go.
What the possibilities of the pure mechanic of the community are. We cannot
do without this avenue of expression.
All community, all tribal life must go through the 21-45, it is the only way. And
as such can be road block more than anything else because it the only way. So
work with these 45-21 children and encourage them to be a part of the future
instead of a part of the past. Encourage them to inform. Give them the right
and the privilege to follow their will power but insist that they inform you
beforehand. We’re going to get wonderful human beings out of that and then
we won’t have to have teachers who will teach Human Design say that it’s best
to have the 45-21 as an electromagnetic. We’ll get to see the natural power and
gift of this 45-21, once it’s living out its Type, is wonderful and not a threat to
the community but what it’s intended to be, a protector and sever of the
community.
Q & A
Okay. I have some time. You can ask me some questions.
Story of the Ringing Head
Student: A few weeks ago in Boulder, you were talking about the stream of the
39 to the 12. Though I think you addressed it today in the sense that you
talked about the fact that people in these streams become psychopaths or
whatever, the way you talked about it then was that the frequency can lock.
Would you…
Ra: Oh, okay, yeah. It’s a nice story actually, my publisher in Germany. He
had one of those horrendous shocks in his life. He had a younger brother that
he loved very much that committed suicide. And in his experience of being
called by the police and having to go and identify the body, in the shock of
seeing his brother, he got a ringing in his head. The ringing in his head
wouldn’t go away and it was extremely loud and it was very disturbing. He
spent a great deal of time, money and energy trying to find some way to get rid
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 77
of that. He tried all kinds of therapies and programs and different kinds of
things and nothing worked. It was a very painful thing to carry that sound
around in his head. This is somebody that is pure individual, very, very
sensitive to acoustics.
Eventually, he was told about an elderly women living in Munich who was a
breath therapist. And he went to see her. She was a woman in her late 70s and
lived in one of those plastic houses, doilies everywhere, this kind of quaint old
fashioned, funny kind of environment and he felt a little bit bizarre in there.
She asked him to pull away a coffee table and told him to lie down on his back
on the carpet. And then this old lady, bent down over him and tickled—that’s
how he described it—tickled his Solar Plex with her fingers. She just went over
them with her fingers just like that. His mind process at the time, was that this
is really funny, this is really bizarre, “What is this?”
What happened to him is that he immediately went to sleep and he woke up
several hours later, and the sound was not gone but it was in the back of his
head. In other words, it didn’t interfere with his mental process. He could
look for it and find it but it wasn’t a dominant force anymore. Not only was he
was deeply grateful but he was really surprised. You know, what is that?
This woman lived in Berlin during the bombing of Berlin. The bombing of
Berlin was savage in the Second World War. The bombing of Germany was
savage. There were crews that worked on the ground and their job was to go
into bombed out buildings and look for survivors. She was, in essence, a
natural therapist. What she found was that they would get into these bombed
out buildings and that they would find people who were in deep emotional
shock. She worked with these people with the deep emotional shock and
recognized that what had happened to them is that their emotional systems had
locked.
The Slinky Spiral and Tickling the Solar Plex
So let me give you a way of imagining that so you have a concept to work with.
I talk about the emotional wave, the wave of the motor as being a wave that
operates from hope to pain, and the recognition that we are moving in space,
so what we have basically is a spiral moving. This is the whole nature of the
emotional wave: it is a spiral. Now think about that spiral as a slinky, these toys
78 Channels By Type
that kids have, these slinky toys. We’ve all played with them at some point in
our process. It’s a 20th century toy.
The slinky can operate two ways. That slinky, if you push it together, it locks.
So, think about what happens to people who get locked emotionally out of
shock or trauma. In other words, you are in your emotional wave, and let’s say
that you’re at the high end, which is rare but let’s say it happens at the high end.
You have a trauma, a shock, you get locked at the high end, so instead of being
downcast, horrified and depressed by an event, you’re delirious, blissful and
excited and your locked in that deluded state, denying the reality of the event.
Imagine you’re at the low end of your wave. You hit a shock, a trauma. In that
moment, the slinky closes and in that moment, you get locked in that low end
of the wave, which can mean years and years and years of depression.
The other thing is that the slinky goes the other way. In other words, you can
pull it and pull it and pull it and pull it and pull it and pull it and the peaks and
valleys start disappearing, and you pull it and you pull it and you pull it and you
pull it and you pull it and eventually it evens out. There are people who are flat
emotionally, they’re emotional but it’s flat. This is this whole business of how
the spiral actually works. So yes, we can get locked. And of course, all you
need is an old lady to tickle your Solar Plex.
Any other questions?
The Conscious and Unconscious 45-21
Student: Can you comment on the conscious 45-21 and the unconscious 45?
Ra: Sure. This is a common thing that people ask. How do I differentiate,
how do I deal with unconscious as opposed to conscious. Again, if that
channel is all conscious this is somebody who has conscious participation in
that process. In other words, they are consciously being willful. They know
what they want to be willful about, they know exactly what they have to do and
they know exactly how they want to go about doing it. They are consciously
willful, they are participating in the process.
Somebody who has a 45-21 unconscious is not consciously participating in
that. They don’t know why they are being willful, they don’t know why they’re
being willful about a specific thing. They have no idea, whatsoever. Yet on the
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 79
surface, if you look at them, it looks the same. It looks the same, the only
difference is that the 45-21 unconscious is innocent. That’s what the
unconscious channel is all about. That’s why in the sense it’s mystical. It’s not
basically, it’s just because it’s unconscious and we don’t participate with it so it
can be quite mysterious, the way in which it operates. But the 45-21 doesn’t
know why, it doesn’t even hear itself say “I have to.” It just does it. It’s simply
driven by the Ego process.
Whereas the conscious 45-21 is in collusion with it. It’s actually thinking about
it, working on it, you know participating in using that will power. The net
result, by the way, is the same. The only difference is that the unconscious 45-
21 is confused as hell. And the conscious 45-21 has met nothing but conscious
resistance.
The Unconscious 45-21 Has to be Taught to Inform
Student: So, how can the unconscious inform if they don’t know?
Ra: They have to be taught. They have to be taught. That’s the whole thing
about teaching children when they’re young they have to be taught. If you
have a child, for example, that has an unconscious emotionally defined system.
You can’t tell them to wait out their wave in the sense that they can really
participate in that. They can’t. They’re innocent in that. All of a sudden they
go up or all of a sudden they’re on the way down and they don’t know why.
So, all you can talk to them about is that you have to educate them that it takes
time for them.
I have already done that with my seven year old. He’ll say to me that he wants
a toy and I’ll say, “Well, sleep on it. It’s always good for you to sleep on it.
You sleep on it, you tell me tomorrow.” I’m always forcing him to sleep on it.
In other words, I’m helping him be himself. This is the whole thing about
dealing with our children is this capacity to help them to be themselves, to
guide them into being themselves, and to help them avoid the conditioning.
For them to know. I keep on telling him that he can’t jump. “Don’t be
spontaneous.” I’ll do it in ways that are applicable to certain situations in his
process. It’s not like I hammer at him because he can’t. It’s just about being
educated about the nature of your child’s design. It’s both a beautiful thing as a
parent, but it’s a wonderful thing for your child, you know what’s there. You
know what’s there and you know what you can nurture in them. .

How to Educate an Unconscious 45-21
Student: How do they know, how do you educate an unconscious 45-21 to
inform? What do you look…
Ra: Well, look. They have a very strong voice, unconscious voice but they
have a strong voice. There is nothing difficult about teaching that child that
before they do things they should ask you first.
Student: Can they know they are about to do something?
Ra: Yeah, of course. Because the moment they’re about to do it they realize
“Oh I have to go to the bathroom.” They will inform you in the moment that
it’s there. “I’m going out now.” They’re informing you as they’re racing
towards the door. They will inform you. You just have to teach them that
that’s essential. That it’s healthy for them. Otherwise, they can drive their
parents crazy. You worry about these children a lot. They are children to truly
worry about because they simply, unconsciously have to do things and
suddenly they’re gone. And if you haven’t taught them to inform you, then you
have no idea where they’ve gone. You have no idea what they’re up to. They
can really just whoosh.
The 45-21 Tribal Ruler is Private, not Social or Huggy
Student: Staying with this 45-21, this tribal ruler. I have always had trouble
saying that to people, that you’re a natural tribal ruler. I can feel it energetically,
but they always tend to be rather independent people, private. I mean with
tribe they say…
Ra: Well, kings are very private, queens are very private, other than their
entourage. It’s not like they’re out there. They’re not doing the plumbing, so
they do tend to be reclusive and they do tend to like to be in their throne room
because that’s part of their nature. They are not 40-37s, they’re not hugging
you all the time. They expect you to get down on one knee to them. This is
not huggy-huggy; this is the other side of that. That’s the tribe itself and the
tribe is very warm and affectionate and all of those things. Their rulers aren’t.
Great to watch the queen of England try to be soft. Poor woman. I really
think that was a shame that she had to go through that. That’s not natural, nor
should it be expected.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 81
That’s the other thing. That’s not what they’re about. They are the ones that
can be wise in the way of the territory. That is really what they are about and
they do need to be withdrawn. That’s why they need to delegate responsibility.
That’s why they end up empowering others with will power to get them to do
all the things that they want done. It’s what they are always doing. But no,
they’re not social gadabouts at all. At all. At all. At all.
Student: So, it’s very subtle how they introduce the mutation.
Ra: Oh yes. Well, because you see, anybody that carries that energy, again let
your aura do the talking. Their aura does the talking. Anybody tribal coming
into the aura of a 45-21 already recognizes their authority. You recognize it, it’s
not mental. The tribe has nothing to do with the mind. So, it never operates in
that way.
But of course the tribe operates through instinct and sensitivity, through touch
and smell. And you can see the way people take their distance from the 45-21;
touching them is not an easy thing to do. And of course the whole thing about
the tribe is that everybody in the tribe has to smell the same and everybody in
the tribe has to be able touch each other. It’s one of the bases of the tribe but
it doesn’t mean that that’s what they do.
The whole idea of genuflection was created by 45-21s. I guess the Persians
were the best. Ambassadors to ancient Persia, they had to be trained for up to
five years just to be able to go up and present themselves before the throne.
They had to learn how to do certain positions. It was basically dance
movements, all kinds of gestures all of these things representing different blah-
blah-blah, whatever the case may be. And all of that genuflection just to get
into the near-aura of the 45-21.
So don’t ever expect them to be social; that is not their nature. Tribal rulers are
not here to be social. And of course what happens is that they can end up
being blamed for that, that they don’t have social skills. They have to learn as
tribal leaders that they need to delegate responsibility to those who can have
tribal skills because they necessarily don’t want to be out there doing all that.
You know, politicians shake hands…kings and queens don’t. That’s not their
business.

Unconscious Manifesting Channel Awareness to Inform?
Student: How does this unconscious manifesting channel or any of those that
might be like that, for an adult…since you haven’t had this opportunity to
educate them, then in this seven-year process are they going to be able to
become more aware to be able to inform before they do things?
Ra: Absolutely, but they have to be able to live out their Type. It starts with
the Type. Every single aspect of somebody’s design operates through the
continuity of their Type. So if you’re an unconscious Manifestor and you
understand the importance of informing, by living your Type it’ll happen
naturally anyway. In other words, it is really essential and it takes that first step
of experimentation.
This is the part where the real luck is. Human Design is deeply seductive at the
intellectual level. But in terms of turning it into action, it takes the good
fortune or the serendipity to be able to enter into the experiment at least once.
So one of the things for all Manifestors is to have as their good fortune the
opportunity to have that single experiment. To see what actually happens
when they inform before they act and so it’s not just a matter of that being
natural in that sense.
Again, you have to educate them. It’s something that has become more and
more common in my readings and my working with people is for me to remind
them again and again of the basic logic of Design and that it demands
experimentation in order to prove its effectiveness and grow.
Logic is a virus if it works. So the moment that you engage in the experiment
and you get your reward for the experiment, it gives you enormous strength to
approach the next experiment until eventually it’s not an experiment anymore it
is truly your life. So when you bring somebody through their design and you
show them what their Type is through their definition, you really have to see
that you have to encourage them to take the first experiment because otherwise
they can never know.
Now it doesn’t have to mean that they do it tomorrow or the next day or
whatever, it’s just for them to realize this is not just information. Mechanics
really work, and if you try it, you’ll get the results for it. And you’ll see that
being yourself is something that’s deeply productive and deeply healthy. And

I’m going to spend a couple of days frustrating you, okay? No, I don’t mean

I’m going to use the circuit groups here because it makes it easier for you to be
able to see the different qualities of generation. And I’m going to begin, as I
have going through this process, I’m going to begin with the individuality.
Individual Circuitry Channels
Design of the Natural World
When you’re looking at that chart of individuality, any of you that have The
Book of Letters with you, and if you don’t,
take a look at it, make a reminder for
yourself. Take a look at it when you go
home. There’s an incredible illustration in
The Book of Letters and it’s at the very
beginning of the monograph in the back
on the Design of Forms. It’s actually the
cover page of the Design of Forms.
And on that cover page, there is a
composite chart of the natural world. That
composite chart of the natural world is a
composite of the inanimate, the cellular,
mammals, reptiles, all the various different
types of forms all brought together into
one composite.
If you look at that composite, it’s almost identical to the individual group,
almost. That is, it doesn’t have the Solar Plex or the mental awareness, but
everything else is a part of that—all of it being rooted in Integration.
84 Channels By Type
So when we’re dealing with the individual, we’re dealing with a circuitry that’s
very finely tuned to the natural world. It is why it is part of the deep mutative
process in the world. And that
mutation from the human is not
simply mutation that is limited to
the human life and environment,
but that human mutation affects
everything around it including the
cellular and the inanimate.
There are so many people who will
say to me that genetic manipulation
is unnatural and I will giggle at
them. There is no such thing,
given the nature of what human
consciousness and our form is all
about. The moment you look at
Design of the Natural World image – Ra Uru Hu 2009.
the relationship of the Human
Design to the natural world, you’ll see that we are here to manipulate the
natural world and all of its parts. We’re here to breed animals, we’re here to
genetically recreate life, we’re here to do all of those things because it’s inherent
in our capacity to be able to connect to the natural world.
We are here to pollute the Earth. We are here to mutate matter. We’re here to
explode atomic bombs. We’re here to do all that stuff. And you can see it so
clearly the moment you look at this relationship, that humanity, our design, the
Rave, its relationship to the natural world. We are here to fine-tune it. We are
here to create the environment around us in the most mundane sense, in the
same way that I’ve just given you: an exalted representation of how we’re
actually designed to manipulate and to control and operate the entire
environment of our cosmos.
You see, at the mundane animal level, we’re already doing that. Our
relationship to the natural world is to manipulate it, is to change it to suit
ourselves. The 10-57 is sitting there saying, “Build the environment correctly
so that we can have the best possible life.” So it’s okay to have five wolves in a
park but it’s not okay to have 10,000 roaming around. We’re going to kill
them. All of that is part of what we are and is natural for us, natural, all of it,
no choice. Okay.

begin with the format. Nothing carries more overall influence
in somebody’s BodyGraph than the presence of a format
energy. Everything within that body is going to conform to
the laws of that format and how it operates, everything. And
it doesn’t matter whether the circuitry in the rest of the
BodyGraph is similar circuitry or not; it makes no difference.
So if you have somebody, for example, who has the 46-29,
they have an abstract-collective channel that is designed to
operate through its format of beginnings middles and ends.
But if they end up with the 3-60, it means for them that the
design of succeeding or failing is an impulse. It’s there or it’s
not. The opportunity is there or it’s not. The possibility is
there or it’s not because that’s the nature of the pulse of the
individual format.
And it means that if you’re an individual, if you’re somebody
that has the 2-14 and you have a format that’s logical (9-52),
then instead of being in the pulse, instead of your direction
being open to mutation, you get fixed on one direction,
focused on it.
If it was an abstract format, the 42-53, the moment you have
that abstract format, that individual direction would have a
beginning, a middle and an end. In other words, they would
have many directions in their life.
So it doesn’t matter what your circuitry is, the presence of a
format energy is going to dominate the way in which the
design operates. And when I say ‘dominate it,’ I simply mean
in the way of the frequency of the energy, whether it’s going
to be focused, whether it’s going to be cyclical, or whether it’s going to be
mutative and in a pulse. So pay close attention to the presence of format
energy and recognize its importance.

86 Channels By Type
The Channel of Mutation
The 3-60 is the Channel of Mutation. It is the root source of mutation and it is
about energy that initiates and fluctuates. Now, it does not
mean that it’s always initiating, but it is always fluctuating.
The whole thing about the individual energy field is that it is a
pulse and that the whole mystery of mutation is that it only
takes place between the pulses.
This is one of those old mystical things, the space between the
fingers, the space between the notes. And it is the space in
the pulse where the mutation takes place. Always remember
that nothing is static and everything is moving, and then you can understand
what that space is in a pulse.
The Pulse Moves in Space and Time and Jumps
If you go out in a pulse and you’re moving, by the time it comes back, you’re in
a different place. There’s a jump that’s taken place. That’s the jump you see in
the 51, that’s the jump manifested in the sense that it finally comes out as an
action of the Ego to actually leap. The real miracle in the jump is that space in
between, anything can happen in
that space. In that space you either
have enough momentum to get
across and land, or you fall; it’s one
or the other.
So when you’re looking at the 3-
60, you’re looking at this pulse, but
it’s a pulse that’s moving in time.
It’s moving in space. It’s one of the things about individuals: out of their very
energy, that they ‘know’ and ‘don’t know’ alternatively. It’s just as easy for
them to say “I know” as it is to say “I don’t know.”
What happens to them is that they’re always obsessed with knowing. So every
time they go out in the pulse, they’re hoping when they come back that they’ve
made the mutative leap, which is why they have to be existential, because if
they don’t pay attention, they’ll miss it.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 87
Relative States of Existentialism
The whole thing about the drive and the energy field of the individual is this
absolute need for being existential. Given your Type and given the nature of
your design, it’s not always possible. There are relative states of existentialism.
There is the existential Manifestor, and the existential Generator, and the
existential Reflector and Projector, because they can all be existential under
certain conditions. So when you’re dealing with the 3-60, the only condition
for existential existence is to respond.
The Sacral Expresses Anything that is Connected to It
What people don’t necessarily grasp clearly about the Sacral Center is that it’s
not intelligent. It’s not an awareness center. It’s not smart. It doesn’t speak its
own words ever, ever, in the sense of responding in sound. It’s a motor. It’s a
prime motor. It’s our regenerative capacity. And yet at the same time, the
specialness of the Sacral, what makes it different from other motors is that it
acts as a diaphragm. It will express as a vibration anything that’s connected to
it. That’s its gift. That’s why the Generator has a way of getting access to their
response. If the Sacral was mute, being a Generator would be a horror.
So the Sacral Center acts as a medium for expression. When I say to people
“Look, out of your Sacral Center you find your authority if you’re a
Generator—out of the Sacral you find your authority.” So imagine that you
have somebody who is only a 3-60. When somebody says to them, “Would
you like to go out tonight?” and they go ‘uh-huh,’ what is saying ‘uh-huh,’ what
is making that decision is that if it had a voice it would say, “Yes, this can be
mutative” or “No, this is not mutative.”
Just as there is a gift in the third hexagram to be able to tell the difference
between sterile and fertile. What the 3-60 is actually doing is it expresses itself
through the Sacral and then you can understand what is guiding you. You see,
your mind will never understand that. How can it? It’s not connected to all of
that, and your mind is always rebelling against authority any place other than in
the mind. And you have to see that if you’re a 3-60, when you’re going “un-
un,” you have to understand, your mind has to understand that what you are
really saying is “There is no mutative capacity in my accepting this.”
Because Human Design is logical, you have to take the experiment. So if
you’re a 3-60 and somebody says, “You want to go out?” and you hear yourself
88 Channels By Type
go “uh-huh” then you could wait and see what the mutative quality is that
comes out of that acceptance so that you can learn to see that your Sacral
through that channel is guiding you. It’s not the Sacral that’s guiding you.
It’s simply the Sacral that’s the voice of that. It’s very important to grasp.
And you see, charts are much
more complex. Now, this
Sacral is a very, very complex
diaphragm. Look what it
speaks. “You want to go out?”
It answers and says ‘uh-huh’
because it can be mutative, but
that’s not the only thing that
will condition the answer. The
52nd gate will condition the
answer. The 52nd gate will say:
is it worth stepping out of my
passiveness and out of my
waiting to enter into this? Is
this something that I can really work with?
And the 54 says: Will I be recognized? So when the Sacral is going ‘uh-huh,’
this is mutative. It’s saying this is mutative and somebody is going to recognize
my value, the marrying maiden. But it says more than that. It says when I go
‘uh-huh’ not only is it mutative and a potential for me to focus on and a
potential for me to get attention to myself, but it’s also my capacity to have
power. And not only that, but if I go ‘uh-huh,’ it’s mutative. I’m also saying
not only is it mutative, but it’s mutative and it is the right direction for me and
out of that right direction I can initiate and be initiated and be able to find all of
these roles. All of that out of ‘uh-huh.’
You see, more than ever, more than we’ve ever been able to measure the
intelligence of the mind and how the mind could possibly guide us, which of
course is impossible, mechanics allows us to see exactly how we’re guided and
what is the quality of that guidance and the nature of it. And the moment
you’re aware of what guides that Sacral, that’s the moment you begin to
understand why it’s an authority for you. Every time that Sacral is saying yes,
it’s saying yes to that design. It’s saying yes for its own self, for all of those
things are part of that saying yes. .
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 89
Every gate, every aspect, every center in that definition has agreed ‘yes.’ Then
you get to see why I keep telling people how healthy that is. Because every part
of you, the part that has to make the decision, is all in agreement and you didn’t
have to sit at a board meeting and you didn’t have to sit and work out the
negotiations and you didn’t have to sit in your mind and mess around for
months and months. All you had to do is respect the mechanics of your nature
and its inherent intelligence. That Sacral is never going to say yes to
something that’s not mutative, never. That mind, oh yeah. That mind will get
into any piece of nonsense possible.
And you see, given the ignorance that human beings have of their nature, it’s
assumed that that mind is the authority in that being. It’s assumed that the
mind is there to guide them and that when they hear themselves go ‘mmm,’
they don’t know how deep that is. They don’t know how profound that is.
They just think it’s a sound.
That was one of the most impressive things as him as an actor (Dustin
Hoffman) is not the words that he said as much as the noises he made. He had
all these little funny grunts and sounds that he makes in all the characters he
plays. That’s him. And if you said to him, “What does that ‘uh-huh’ really
mean and what’s the source of that?” He doesn’t know. He’ll tell you it’s his
mind, if anything, because people don’t know and they don’t respect it. That’s
a magnificent capacity.
So the whole business about being a 3-60 in this life is to recognize that as a
Generator, as a mutative Generator, that it is your responsibility—because the
mutative Generator is the source energy for our evolution—that you have to
respect what it is to be a Generator. Wait, wait, wait to respond. And in that
response, know that when you’re responding ‘uh-huh’ that you’re entering into
something that will be mutative.
Now, you’re a Generator. It doesn’t mean it’s going to be mutative
instantaneously. It means you’re going to have to spend your time getting
stuck at the various levels that you have to go through as a Generator. But it
means that in the end the mutation will be self-evident, and self-evident not
only within yourself, but through the true role of a Generator and an individual
Generator which is through response to mutate others. Be the mutative
example through response.

Look carefully at the wiring of any Sacral. It’s so important never to forget that
the real simple truth of Human Design is always in the picture; it’s in the
picture. And if you look at the way a Sacral Center is connected, you will
understand its depth and you will understand what it expresses, and then you
begin to see that it’s not just about trusting a ‘uh-huh’ or ‘un-un’ which seems
like what am I trusting in that. You can really see what that is expressing for
you. You don’t need all of the specialized communicative skills of the Throat
Center. You don’t. You have to see clearly the depth of profundity of what is
guiding that Sacral.
And by the way, it’s not about how many aspects are involved. It really isn’t.
You can just have one. Doesn’t make a difference. You can just be the 3-60.
The fact of the matter is, the best astrologer I have ever known, she’s a 3-60,
nothing else. An open sieve to everybody’s vibration and yet at the same time
this incredible capacity to mutate them and to recognize what is mutative.
So if the 3-60 is in your life, the only way you’re going to fulfill yourself is by
waiting for it to respond to guide you. “This is fertile ground for me. This is
sterile ground for me. This is mutative for me. This is not mutative for me.”
Follow the wiring and then you’ll understand the depth, and for your clients it’s
very important.
They all know or can know this sound in themselves. But it’s important for
them to understand its depth and you can guide them to that. You can say,
“Look this sound isn’t just a reflex. It’s deeply rooted and guided by what you
are.” Here is a human being that can truly be a source of direction, a mutative
source of direction for all kinds of beings in its life, and that is only possible
when it recognizes that that ‘uh-huh’ expresses the profundity of all that. And
through the experiment of accepting that is the capacity to be able to
experience it in life and see it.
A few of us had a discussion yesterday about the possibility coming up that
we’re going to be able to have a kind of chat room on our website. And one of
the things that we were discussing was how nice it would be to have the
collected experiences of people. In other words, what’s your experience with
this gate or that gate or whatever the case may be. Not only collect the
experiences, but make it available so that you can see the collected experiences
of others through that. Because, of course, this is the beauty of the
experiment. .
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 91
You see, the beauty of the experiment is it is the confirming agent for us. It is
constantly affirming us in our process, and it’s essential for you to see that in
guiding clients that come to you, in guiding them to their Type and guiding
them to their experiment. You also have to reassure them of their ability to be
able to do that because it is natural for them to do that. And the moment that
a Sacral person can really see the depth of what is programming that response
is the moment that it is easier for them to grasp the essential of the mechanic,
listen to the sound, and then wait and see if it really does confirm the depth
that is behind that. The experiment is everything. But please remember, look
at the wiring. Watch it very carefully.
The Three Tantric Channels
A beat can be your direction like a cop walking his beat though I don’t think
they do that anymore. It’s also a beat. It is out of the pulse.
The 2-14, I have been asked over and over and over again to
please explain why these are called tantric channels. All the time
I get that, why are these called,—where’s the tantra?
First of all, circuitry is self-evident. It really is. If you looked at
the Sacral Center connected to the identity, to the Self and these
are called the tantric channels. The higher state of love has
three variations. The tantra of the abstract 46-29, the higher
state of loving the body; the tantra of logic 15-5, the higher state
of loving humanity; and the tantra of the 2-14, the higher state of loving
oneself.
Now, as direction and tantra, everything about the individual is about the
capacity and the potential to mutate the other, and so to mutate love in the
other through love. It’s very, very common to see how passion is infectious.
When somebody is romantic with you, they’re putting their aura in you and you
are responding to that romance and that romance can always have a mutative
quality to it.
So the whole nature of tantra is the raising of the physical capacity of sexuality
to a higher level, and that is the empowerment of the higher levels of love in
the Self. By their very nature, that love actually diminishes the value of the
pure sexuality. That’s why you see in traditional tantra that the body is simply a
vehicle to be able to find those states of higher love. .
92 Channels By Type
You see, the genetic strategies of sexuality are rooted in the 59-6, are fulfilled
through the 27-50, so that these are not inherently sexual gates at all when
you’re looking at the 5, and the 14, and the 29. What you’re looking at is the
capacity to take this raw reproductive power and use it as an empowerment of
higher states in the Self, and these three channels carry with them the essence
of life.
The 15-5 is universal to all forms. It is the individual human cell. It is the basis
of life itself, pattern and rhythm together, creating the flow of life.
The 46-29 is the mundane process of success in life, or failure, about being able
to triumph in the serendipity of what life is. And in that to discover a deep
love for your body, the body as temple, the body as perfect.
And in the center, the 2-14, the ongoing, endless process of mutating our
direction, of evolving and bringing mutation as a direction into our lives.
There is, in the mutative evolutionary sense, no channel more important than
the 2-14.
The 2-14: The Beat
The 14th Gate: Power Skills to Keep Moving in Your
Direction
It is the mutation of direction and it can be extremely successful at the material
level, the nature of the 14th gate,
possession in great measure. The
tradition of the I Ching is that this is
the wagon that can be overloaded
and full of goods. This is a
tremendous power and it is a skill.
If you look carefully, this is a gate of
power skills—how to use power for
only one thing, to keep moving in your direction only.
Now think of what it means to be a 2-14. If that’s the only definition you have,
the only way you know you’re in the right direction is if you respond.
Otherwise, you can never be in the right direction. Somebody asks you, “Is
this the way to go?” and you go ‘uh-huh.’ Boy, are you ever right and right for
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 93
them. And if somebody needs to know something from you and you respond
positively, you are bringing them mutative direction. And for yourself in your
own life, you have to wait in order to recognize and respond to what is the
right direction for you. In other words, a 2-14 has to be offered a smorgasbord
of opportunities in order to recognize which one to respond to so that can be
their direction.
It’s so important for us that 2-14s operate correctly according to their Type,
and it’s the thing to recognize about the nature of evolutionary direction. The
nature of evolution is that it doesn’t just make jumps all the time. That’s why
this is really the symbol of our evolutionary process. In other words, it is a
pulse.
When we were talking about emotional individuality, I talked to you about the
plane, the plateau, and about spiking. And the whole thing about the nature of
the 2-14 and its direction is that it goes along and goes along and goes along
and goes along in the same direction, like the individual that has the same
breakfast every morning. Goes along, goes along, goes along and then it’s
possible, in the pulse, in the space between that suddenly there is a mutation
and then, the new mutative direction.
Direction is an Existential Process, not about the
Destination
So it’s important to see that this generative capacity in the 2-14 is an essential
ingredient and that it is a Generator which means that once it actually responds
to something, ‘uh-huh,’ it doesn’t mean it can manifest it. It means it has to get
involved in its generative learning process; getting into it, going through the
level that it’s at, waiting for its moment of metamorphosis to jump to the next
level. And it means that the direction is not about the destination. That’s
about as mystical as I can get today.
There is no way of being able to see the actual direction because there is no
way that this is deterministic. People used to come to me in the early years and
say to me, “This is all deterministic.” It’s not true. Being a freak myself and
bringing a mutation into the world, I know that. It’s not true. The rules get
changed all the time. You know how many physicists are out of a job because
they’ve proven that neutrinos have mass? Who have spent 10 and 15 years
trying to invent something that has mass? .
94 Channels By Type
So this whole process of the 2-14 and the nature of its direction is that you
have to see that it is a process and it is an existential process and it’s not about
what the destination is. It’s just about knowing you’re going the right way and
not necessarily that language, the correct way for you.
And the moment that one can accept that that is their process, then you don’t
have to get caught up into abstract expectation. Individuals are not here to live
in a world of expectation. They’re here to be in the now. They’re here to be
tuned to the frequency of the moment. And so the whole trick about direction
is to recognize it’s not about whether you know how to actually get there.
I have a defined Self in a very individual design and often I’m in a lot of strange
places and often I’m in a place and I have to find where I have to go, and I
really don’t know how to get to the destination, but I know the right way. And
as long as I follow—I have the second gate—as long as I follow that intuition
of mine that I’m going the right way, 9 times out of 10, I bump into my
destination. It’s not about knowing where the destination is. It’s about simply
recognizing that as a 2-14, you’re here to follow your way, and your way only
exists out of response and then your way is correct.
Evolution has many, many tentacles and fingers. Everything is operating in an
enormous macrocosmic harmony and that the initiation of mutation is caught
up into many factors in many different places at the same time. Everything is
waiting for the right moment. So when you go ‘ah ha’ and you’re a 2-14, what
you’re really saying is “I’m on my way. I don’t know where I’m going. I am on
my way and I know that this is my way.”
Now this is something so important for the psyche of humanity. Because what
happens with direction is that through the Cross of the Sphinx, the second
gate, the gate of the driver that programs our direction, that programs our
ways, splits up into three different views of those ways. And as it splits up, it
becomes three different views. It creates three different kinds of roles in life.
And because two of those three roles are collective, it is through the collective
that direction is seen, not through the individual.
Direction is experienced by the rest of humanity through the perceptions of the
logical pattern and its projection into the future, and the abstract reflection and
its perception on the past. Because of that, because it is the dominance of the
collective that it establishes that, we get stuck into the expectation program.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 95
We’ve come from there so that was our direction to get here and out of that
hindsight logic, we try to find the destination in the future. That’s why we have
soothsayers. That’s why we have psychic, mystic, prophets, blah, blah, blah.
The collective has created in us a deep need to know where we’re going.
Every poor politician who has to stand up there and say, “This is what we’re
going to do for the next four years,” only to be told after those four years that
they didn’t do any of it and then everybody’s disappointed because we want
everything in the future. We want to know exactly what our direction is.
There isn’t a politician alive that doesn’t tell you that they are your direction.
That they’re pointing the way to your secure future. Only the individual knows
that’s a potential lie. And when I say ‘only the individual knows,’ I only mean
that at the genetic level not at the consciousness level; anybody can perceive
that. But the individual is not here to say that there is a place to go. There is a
way.
I have so many people in my life over these years who want to talk to me about
the direction and the future of Human Design and all of these things and all of
that stuff. And I hear all of these concepts about research and this and that
and many, many things, and the fact of the matter is that everything awaits its
time. Everything, everything, everything awaits its time. This whole process of
direction is that it is about the way. It isn’t about what you have to get to.
Planting and Fertilizing the Seed is the Way
I’m an archetype of Arian energy, that is, the planting of the seed. The seed
shows you the way and the way may be a tree. But as to what the branches will
look like, and as to the nature of the fruit of that tree, as to how far the roots
are going to spread, as to all of those things which is the ultimate direction of
the mature tree to show its grandeur, there’s no way of knowing from that
seed. All you can know is, this is the way. Put the seed into the ground,
fertilize the seed. That’s the way. So the individual has to live with that
existential acceptance.
And so it’s very, very important in the consciousness of individuality always to
recognize that the destination is never self-evident. Therein lies mutative magic
because it is not self-evident. You can never know when you’re in the pulse
when that magical moment is going to take place. And in that magical moment
96 Channels By Type
you may then get to see what the destination was for your particular way in that
particular phase of your process. But you cannot know until it’s there.
One of my poetic reactions to life is the delight of its surprises. This is an
inherently individual and romantic concept that life is delightful for its
surprises. And of course this is the magic of the 2-14, recognizing through
response its way, and since it is the correct way the surprise will come. So
many individuals don’t know why they’re moving in the directions they do.
They don’t know why and they don’t know why and it disturbs them because
they’re trying to find out their destination.
Only logical people need to know where they’re going. Logical people become
obsessed with knowing where they’re going, because that’s their job in life.
They have to see some kind of direction and they have to see it over the long-
term pattern, whereas the abstract person just simply needs to see the
gratification at the end of an experience. But they’re really all caught up in, at
the collective level, destination.
And by the way again, I’m not a moralist so this is not about that being good or
bad; it’s just about the way structure is. Now the individual can never afford to
be caught up in that. That’s why the individual cannot afford to be influenced,
that’s why the individual is basically deaf, that’s why the individual insists on
being stubborn. They’re the ones that are obstructive, they’re the ones that are
going to fight, and they’re the ones who need to have their own way.
But because of the propaganda and conditioning of the collective, they’re
forced to explain their way as a direction that leads to something, and that’s
when all knowers get into trouble. It’s one thing to know something, it’s
another thing to try to speculate on where that’s going to go because it’s not
the gift of knowing.
Any speculation I have about the nature of the pattern of Human Design and
its future comes out of the seven activations I have in logic, so that I can work
with those patterns. But the essence of what I am as a design is that things are
just what they are in their way. I’m on the way, this is the way, there isn’t
anything else. I don’t know where it goes, it’s just the way.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 97
So we’ve seen that through the Sacral Center that we have these two very
powerful channels of the individual process generating our mutative direction
and our mutation of love in life, and it comes out of response to the other.
Individuals Need Social Skills
We’re never allowed to be alone. And the joke is that no matter how arrogant
the individual can be in their capacity to be a mutative source, it doesn’t exist
without the stimulation of the other forces around them—the collective, the
tribal—in order to elicit that response of mutation. You see, it’s essential for
every individual to be raised in the world in which their individuality is allowed
to flourish, but at the same time, they recognize and develop the skills
necessary to integrate with the rest of the world.
Out of Conformity Comes Mutation
Like learning a course, the individual has to take the basics in the course which
means that they have to conform at that stage of their life. They have to accept
the constraints of the other forces around them in order to truly be able to
understand their place in the world, but more than that, out of that conformity
comes the mutation. Out of the pattern that is established by logic comes the
possibility of individual mutation to go beyond the pattern, to change the
pattern.
So it’s not like they operate alone. It’s not like the individuals can go around
like “Hi, it’s only me.” We’re not alone. It’s all deeply integrated. And it’s
important to see that our evolution is actually a communal act that everybody
participates in it, but there are those of us who manifested, who generated, who
bring it out.
Gate 34: Power of the Great
And finally, in the individual Sacral, something that we have already looked at,
but I will briefly look at it again because it involves two different generative
channels is gate 34, the power of the great. As I’ve said, as an energy gate,
there is nothing that compares to it. It empowers three unique processes and is
the root energy of the whole integration system. So it is a primary source of
98 Channels By Type
energy for life itself. (Note: The Channel of Charisma 20-34 is discussed in the
Manifesting Channels section.)
The 57-34: Empowerment of Acoustic Intuition
The first aspect we look at here is the 57-34, this channel of the archetype, this
Channel of Power. The 57th gate is an extraordinary gate and tells us the depth
and profundity of intuition. Just as the 34 is an energy that empowers three
different processes, the 57 is the intuition, is the awareness of three different
channels. It is the awareness of our basic nature and it is pure intuition. It is
the right ear. And it means quite literally that what you’re dealing with when
the 34 hits the 57 is the empowerment of acoustic intuition.
The penetrating capacity of the 57, the gentle. It’s always one of my favorite
descriptions in the traditional I Ching. The gentle is described as a cool wind
that chills you to the
bone, this penetrating
capacity of intuition.
And of course the
intuition is something
that is conditioned
entirely by acoustics. So
it’s one of those things
to recognize about the nature of hearing and listening. The fact of the matter is
that there is a deep, deep, deep listening program built into the lymphatic
system and it is one of the most primary senses for any kind of sophisticated
life in order to be able to survive.
Nothing is more important to our survival than sound. It is at the core of our
survival. And what that means is that we are constantly, all of us, alert to
sounds and that sound is the most threatening thing to us and the elimination
of sound can be absolutely horrifying. You’re walking in the jungle and all of a
sudden everything gets quiet. Boy, do you get nervous. When you have a gun
and you put a silencer on it, it’s twice as frightening—just the sound or the lack
of it.
So intuition is operating in an acoustic environment and that’s not about your
conscious listening capacity. That’s not about whether you hear me now or

not, or whether you’re listening to me or not. The fact is that at the lymphatic
level, you’re taking in everything and you’re taking it in at a level that is not
interested in the language, it’s interested in the tone, and it’s interested in the
quality inherent in the tone.
Individuals will quickly pick up variations in tone of people they know. That’s
how they read them. That’s how they know they’re up or down, accessible or
not—they’re reading the tone.
So this 34 to the 57 is this empowerment of our listening capacity. Otherwise,
we don’t survive. When you think about the early nature of homo sapien and
the kind of environments that we were living in, and the kind of predators that
were around that we do not experience today. Very few of us as human beings
in this era understand what it is to be under threat from animals. We don’t
know that. We can’t imagine what that’s like to listen for the sound of hungry
creatures that are just as capable of killing you as you are capable of killing
them. We do not know that.
And in terms of the way biology and evolution works, we are not very far at all
from our ancestors who did live with that. We carry it within us. We have
tried to orient our life to the eyes, and we’ve tried to convince ourselves from
the mental plane that our eyes are what can warn us about what is good for us
and not, that our eyes will save us, that what we can see will save us. Well,
yeah. Nice try. You can see all you want to see. Seeing is something that can
be easily blinded. Seeing is something that can
be easily confused. Seeing is something that’s
very limited.
In the early years, people would say to me,
“I’ve got the 34-57. What does this mean, this
archetype?” I said, “Well you’re human” and
that never seemed very satisfying to them, but
it really is what it’s about. It is the basis of being the human animal. This is
prime. You try to take away a baby from a 34-57 and she will eat your face.
This is deeply alert and powerful. It’s the essence of what was necessary for us
to survive in the world and it was the only way in which that pure power could
be given a qualifying agent of awareness.
100 Channels By Type
Think about what it means to be alive, because to be alive is self-evident in the
34-57. That is life. Life is to generate the archetype of alertness. That’s what
we’re here to do. And the archetype of alertness comes out only in response.
This is what the animal that is hungry knows. “Ssshhh, don’t move, wait.”
You wait for it to come to you, and then you burst out and grab it. You wait to
respond to that moment, and then you survive. And as you wait, you listen,
because it’s your ears that tell you everything.
There are Maasai warriors that can put their ear to the ground,—the right ear,
by the way. You look at those pictures, they will put their right ear to the
ground and they will tell you that there is game 50 kilometers away. They know
how to hear, and you see, hearing is survival. It’s everything.
So one of the things to recognize about the 34-57 is that because it is the purest
generative form—it’s so pure—that the archetype truly comes out through the
response. I have had the experience of knowing many, many 34-57’s in my life
and through these years of working with them and teaching them and rarely,
rarely, rarely does that archetype shine and come out, rarely. And of course,
these are people that are meant to be like Methuselah.
If you’re a 34-57 and you live out your Type from birth, you will live the full
potential of a human life which is about 125 years. Now, not everybody wants
to be 125 years old, which is probably why people don’t live out their
archetype. However, that’s what it’s there for. It is the purest survival
mechanism.
The True Creators of Human Disease
And one of the things that that means is that 34-57s who do not live out their
Type, who do not live out their generative life, that they do severe damage to
their splenic system and they bring the archetype of disease into human life.
They are the ones who are the true creators of human disease.
And when I say creators, it’s not like I want to blame them because it’s not
about blame. It’s simply that they are deeply mutative, and they are the
mutative archetype of survival and this is a binary system. They can be the
archetype of mutative survival or the archetype of mutative destruction. And
because it’s involved in the immune system, they can bring mutative processes
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 101
that damage the immune system. That would never happen to an undefined
splenic system, but the defined Spleen is the carrier.
Just as it’s important for us that Solar Plex definition awakens to its nature in
order to protect us, the same thing is true for the splenic being. If they are a
generative splenic being, they must honor that Type because in not honoring
that Type, they prolong our struggle with disease in this life and make disease
one of the major enemies of humanity. So this archetype is very significant.
The 10-34: The Creative Empowerment of Life
Now’s the time to tell you about 34-10, which I mentioned earlier. See
everything in its time, patience. See the magic and the joke of integration. The
magic and the joke of integration that all that beautiful feel good stuff is all
projected. It’s nothing but projection. So many people who have never lived
are bitter, because the living’s
in the Sacral. It’s where the
energy comes from in
integration to get any of that
stuff to manifest. There are so
many people who go around
and they are really bitter.
See, on the other side is the
beautiful stuff, eh? ‘The awakened, perfected form, aware in the now.’ It’s all
projection. Come on, bring me all of your guru tapes, and we’ll get the same
pitch in all of them. It’s my pitch too, no? It’s the same pitch.
‘Perfected form, awake in the now.’ It’s all projection. Get the joke. Without
the Sacral. And of course the moment that you bring in the Sacral, look at that
beautiful, beautiful aspect of the Sacral that goes to the G Center—the 10-34.
When you look at how we started with the creative channels and we saw that
the creative channel of centering was the 51-25. You can’t even talk about the
10-34 in those terms.
It’s another kind of creativity that’s beyond any of that stuff. It is far beyond
the creativity inherent in the 10-57. It has to do with something else. It has to
do with the creative empowerment of life, this direct connection between the
102 Channels By Type
Sacral Center and the identity, not tantra. It’s not tantra. It has nothing to do
with that. It’s the empowerment of behavior. And behavior is everything. It’s
everything. You see, if you don’t know how to act, you’re fucked.
Well, it’s true. What to do. And not everybody has a 10th gate so that they
have a conditioned, genetic methodology for their behavior. When I give you
the essence of Type, what I’m giving you is a general rule for behavior so that
you can follow your conviction. Because you can only follow a conviction if
the behavior is correct. Human beings don’t know how to behave. We don’t
know how to behave because we still think we’re in charge of everything. The
moment we live out our Type, whether you’ve got the 10th gate or not, you
have the right conditions for behavior.
Following one’s conviction is the energy and is the ability to truly be centered,
to be centered in your being. Not only that, but if you look at the projection of
the 10th gate without the 34, where are you going to really get the self-love?
Think of the mystical power inherent in the 34th gate. Where are you going to
get the self-love? As a projection? As just words? I have heard so many
people tell me they love themselves, and it’s so obviously a lie. But it’s what
they say. It’s just words. It doesn’t mean anything unless it’s your life that
you’re talking about. Not a concept, not a feel good.
Remember, this morning we were talking about how the splenic side of the
Throat needs to express the feel-good in order to minimize the pain, in order
to feel good about tomorrow. Without the Sacral, what does it mean? It
doesn’t mean anything. It’s just talk. Oh yeah, it feels good to hear it, but
you’ve got to live it. It feels good to hear me tell you how wonderful it’ll be for
you after seven years—feels good. But you’ve got to live it. It’s one thing to
have the capacity in us to recognize verbally what is healthy for us as a
community, what is healthy for us as a specie. But it means nothing, it’s only
utopian literature, if we don’t live it. And the living, the living is in the Sacral.
There are all kinds of mystics who talk about how we have chosen to come
into form and all these other things. These are people who operate only out of
a projection field. You see, out of the projection field, there is no body. There
is no body. The body is the energy. So out of the projection field comes all
kinds of nonsense. It really does. We have a talent for nonsense. You have to
live it. This is the essential beauty of what the Sacral Center is. It brings this
aliveness to us when you see somebody who has the 34-10.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 103
The moment you see the 34-10 in somebody’s design, you have to see that you
have to treat it in the same way that you treat the 20-34. What I mean by that
is that neither one of them know. The 20-34 does not know what to be busy
about, doesn’t know what to do with its busyness power, and doesn’t know
how to behave for its own benefit, to be busy for itself. At the same time, the
10-34 does not know what conviction to follow. And only if it knows what
conviction to follow can it be awakened in the now.
It means that whenever you’re looking at those two aspects of integration, or
the 20-57 by itself, then you have to see that guidance is an essential aspect for
these human beings in their life. They need to be guided but never controlled.
You can talk to them. You can suggest things to them, but you can’t control
them. The moment they learn that they can benefit from guidance, and they
can see that guidance is not control, then they’re going to be able to live out
with dignity those powers that are in them.
The other thing is that if you’re just a 34-10 and there’s nothing else in your
design, it’s very clear to see that all of that works automatically for you if you
just live out your Generator nature. You’re always going to know what
conviction to follow the moment that somebody asks you and you respond to
it. But you see this incredible joke about what it means to really be awake.
You can only be awake in the world.
You can’t be awake on a mountain, and you can’t be awake in isolation, and
you can’t be awake outside of the body. You can only be awake here in the
world. This is the whole point about seeing the 34-10, the presence of the
Sacral. That 34-10 is one of three aspects that the Sacral brings. It brings the
20-34. It brings the archetype (34-57). But the key in that is the connection to
the behavior. It’s so important for us.
I come out of that side of the BodyGraph. It’s part of my role as an initiator to
initiate you to a form that you can live awake in the world. In the world. I
didn’t have the 34 in this life, so I was always trying to figure out how you take
all that stuff and put it in the world, and it made me a very negative intelligence,
because I saw that most of it was nothing more than idle speculation and that it
wasn’t real in the world.
104 Channels By Type
The nature of what this knowledge is, is so you can live out your form in the
world. Not as a speculation, not as a philosophy, not as a concept, not as a
salve to make you feel better, but a reality, a mechanical reality, cool. Not
driven by the nature of emotions or mind, but ruled by the intrinsic nature of
our mechanism. That’s being in the world. To surrender to your body, to
surrender to your body’s life, to let it live its life. That’s the moment that
you’re awake, and that’s the moment that your behavior is correct.
So look carefully at the nature of projection, and find your own jokes; there are
lots of them. Each and every one of these channels that are projected in nature
carries with them their own ironies, and their beauty in being able to look at
those ironies. Don’t forget what happens in all of these centers that we have
undefined. In no way do you escape the impact of the conditioning, but the
conditioning is different. To be clear that for anybody you’re going to be of
benefit to, you have to make sure that you point out to them those centers that
they cannot give authority to, and to keep it simple.
Melancholy is Generated
Keep in mind when you’re dealing with the generative capacity in individuality
that these are moody beings who suffer from melancholy and the melancholy is
something that is generated. It doesn’t just pop out, it is a response. Always
keep in mind that in the nature of melancholy, that it’s so important to be able
to protect your aura. Any individual who suffers from melancholy must be
able to protect their aura when they go down, when they’re sad.
Making up a Reason Instantly Becomes Depression
The most damaging thing to an individual when they are sad is to have
somebody come up to them and say, “What is the matter?” You would think
that that’s really kind of sweet and nice, concerned, best intentioned, loving,
friendly. All of that stuff, it is not true. You see, the moment you say to
somebody who is melancholic, “What is the matter?” is the moment they make
up a reason. And the moment they make up a reason, they’re identified with it
and their melancholy instantly becomes depression.
Genetically, they know that they can’t put it on to anything else and so they end
up suffering because they cannot control the other. Not only that but the
person that has asked them, “What is the matter?” When they hear that
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 105
person’s reason, they’re going to correct their reason. “That’s not really the
reason. Why don’t you tell me the truth?” And of course it becomes a horror
story.
Parenting the Melancholic Child
This is one of the most common things in the upbringing of melancholic
children or emotional children, that their parents become very uncomfortable
with their emotional child being down or their melancholic child being sad.
Not only is the parent uncomfortable with it, but depending on the design, they
may be deeply affected by it.
The melancholy, the sadness being lived out twice as strongly by the parent, or
the emotional down being lived out by the parent, and then of course the
parent is under pressure to eliminate that. And so they want to make the child
happy in order not to be unhappy themselves because they’ve fallen in to the
conditioning of their child. And then they get their child to make up reasons
and when the reasons aren’t good enough, and when their reasons and answers
aren’t good enough, and they hire a therapist to make up the reasons, and the
psychologist to make up the reasons, it goes on and on and on—and there’s
nothing wrong with the child.
By that time there is. No question about that. Welcome to the age of Prozac.
The reality is that the moment you ask them is the moment you’re telling them
something very basic. You’re saying to them you’re sick. You’ve got a
problem because you’re unhappy and we’re going to fix it, whether you like it
or not because there’s something wrong with you.
All individuals know the hypocrisy of a happy life. There is no such thing.
There is life. Whether it’s happy or not, good or not, right or not is really not
the point. That’s all Maia. It’s just life. So protect your children who are
emotional and protect your children who are individual and protect them by
not being so damn sensitive to their discomfort. Let them live out their
discomfort and encourage them to see that you recognize there is nothing
wrong with that. “Oh, you’re sad today. Yeah, so what? Why don’t you go do
something creative. It’ll be good for you.” Don’t turn that into, “Oh, you’re
sad today, let me make you happy.”

Parenting the Undefined Throat
Awareness does wonders for the upbringing of children. It does wonders. Not
only that, it takes all the guilt trip out of the parent. You don’t have to feel bad
that your baby doesn’t smile all the time. It’s okay. It’s like parents who have
babies and they’ve got undefined Throats and I say to them, “Look, it’s going
to take your child time to speak. It may come early, it may come late, it
depends on how the thyroid works. They may not walk right away, they may
be crawlers.” And if you don’t tell the parent that, the pressure they put on
their child to say the first word, say “mama.” You know?
And this poor kid with the undefined Throat is looking at that and what does
that mean? “Mama.” These are the kind of children that when they do speak,
you’re astonished to find out that they already have collected like twenty or
thirty words that you’ve never heard them utter. They’re collecting it in that
open Throat. They’re beginning to figure out how all of that works and there
are these parents going nuts.
Parenting Child without Motors
Or the child that’s born without motors and everybody expects that they are
going to be walking and running and crawling all around all over the place.
And if you put them alone somewhere and you come back two hours later,
they haven’t moved. You think they’re dead and you go into a complete panic.
You think there’s something wrong with them. This goes on and on and on
and on. Ignorance is so destructive of young lives, our lives. After all, we were
all raised by ignorant parents, eh?

Collective Circuitry Channels
The 42-53 Cyclical Energy, Abstract Format
We’re going to move into the collective process. We’re going to start with the
abstract. The nature of the abstract is really revealed in the movement of the
abstract energy from the Root Center to the Self. It really reveals how the
abstract is intended to operate, and
it really gives you a way of getting
out of the chaos of the impersonal
experiential way.
So the first thing that we’re going
to look at here is the format of the
abstract process, the format energy,
42-53, the Channel of Maturation.
Here we have a channel that is rooted in cyclical energy and that cyclical energy
is what we label as a movement of beginnings, middles and ends.
One of the things to recognize about the experiential cycle is that it’s not to be
repeated. Remember, we talked about that when we looked at the creativity of
the 35-36 and we saw that its creativity is based on collecting experience, but
not repeating experience. The most profound 35-36 is the one that’s had the
largest collection of experiences on their pallet, so built into that, it is
conditioned by its format. In other words, the format insists on that.
If you have somebody who has the 42-53 as their design, then you know right
away that everything in their life has a beginning, and a middle, and an end.
Now doesn’t mean that you’re going to have the timing always
the same, but it does mean that it is part of their process to go
through things and complete them. Now this business of
going through them and completing them is so that the net
result at the end of the experience can bring value to the
collective. This is the whole thing about experience.
If you enter into an experience and you’re suddenly frightened
and you quit, you’re useless to humanity, useless. You have to be able to go
through the whole experience. And in going through the whole experience,
this is the natural frequency of the abstract process. So when you’re looking at
108 Channels By Type
the 53 and the 42 together, what you’re seeing is that no matter what the design
is, that’s the theme.
Logical Person with an Abstract Format
Now think about what that means for somebody who is fundamentally logical.
Let’s take somebody that has a logical talent like the 16-48 and they have this
format, the 42-53. They are not going to be masters in the sense of which the
pure logic being can be. They can’t, because the frequency
will not allow them to repeat things endlessly. It won’t.
And so they will go through a cycle in their talent and they
will leave it behind.
This is often people that will have two careers in their life.
They will have a career that goes up to the midlife point,
the nodal midlife point, and then they’ll enter into, as a
result of their mid-life crisis and a change of themes, they’ll
enter into another cycle.
Now by my saying that, I don’t mean to suggest that’s anything other than a
generalization. You will find logic people with an abstract format who will
have many, many things that they will go through in their process. But of
course because they are designed to master things, there is going to be a deep
dissatisfaction in a logical person with an abstract format. That dissatisfaction
is not being able to stay with it to the point of true mastery simply being
accomplished. And accomplished is not enough for the pure logic.
So in those kinds of situations where you see that format energy is directly
different than the dominating circuitry, you can see right away that you have to
be able to address that for your client because it’s going to condition the way
you talk about how they bring out their logic or their abstract or their
individuality, because it’s going to be conditioned by format energy.
Other than those of you that listen to the Sacral tape and in dealing with the
centers and in dealing with my extended discussions of formats, any student of
Design has to pay a great deal of attention to format energy. It’s essential to
see its role in anybody’s design, and it’s not the same as dealing with potential
activations in the formats.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 109
Somebody like me who has the 60 but doesn’t have the 3, that is very, very
different than somebody who has the whole channel. In other words, though it
is natural for me to be conditioned by the pulse format, it is not the only
format open to me in my experience and it’s very different. But the moment
that somebody has a defined format energy, the impact of that on their design
is extraordinary. It really forces them out of that frequency, out of that power
to follow the laws of whatever that format happens to be. So pay close
attention to that.
Second thing, in our discussion about the nature of the Sacral Center and how
it is a diaphragm that expresses what is connected to it, and therefore the
authority is from what is being expressed through the Sacral, if you see 42-53
definition and you go up to them and ask them if they want to go out to dinner
and they go “uh-huh,” it means that they actually can go, eat and come back.
In other words, they know there’s a beginning and a middle and an end. If they
say “un un,” it means something will disrupt that in the middle. They get sick
and vomit, whatever the case may be. And there’s no way for the mind to
understand why those decisions are being made in that way. You can only
understand by recognizing what is feeding the Sacral for its response.
The 42-53 is the most wonderful tool to have if you listen to it as a Generator
in terms of what careers or what relationships to have. It’s essential. Think
about what that really says. A career is offered to the Generator that is abstract
and they go “uh-huh” and that means “I can go through this from the
beginning through the middle and to the end and complete it.” That’s
fulfillment for the abstract. They do not have to stay. That’s the whole thing
for them.
The impersonal nature of the abstract leads to a lot of relationships just simply
ending, an ending in a way that there doesn’t seem to be any particular reason.
This format energy generates the cycle. It has a beginning and a middle and an
end. And if you enter into it correctly, going out of it will be natural. It may
not be easy to grasp, but it’s a natural law of the format that it must go through
cycles, that things must come to an end.
Now the moment you tell people that things have to come to an end, they
think that’s finite rather than understanding that it just leads to a new
beginning. In other words, if you apply that to relationship, it does not mean
that the relationship has to come to an end, but a phase in the relationship
comes to an end and a new phase has to begin. So it’s very important for
110 Channels By Type
abstract people to respect the nature of their cyclical program and remember
through genetic continuity, it’s not like you have to have the format to
recognize that this works in everything—in everything.
The 11-56: An Idea has a Cyclical Process
The 11-56, the beginning is the idea, that’s the idea. That’s
the kernel, that’s the beginning. Then you have to move
through that to the middle, the development of the idea,
the translation of the idea into a capacity to be able to
express it through the 56 gate. And the completion of
that program is the attempt to be able to stimulate others.
It’s a process. At the moment you’re finished stimulating
others, you’re designed to go on to a new idea.
Logic Format with an Abstract Channel
So think about what happens to somebody who’s got the 11-
56 and a logic format. Are these people ever obsessed. You
see, they get that bee in their bonnet and it never gets out.
They stay with it because that’s the focus and concentrated
power of the logical format and they get stuck on the same
idea and they keep on repeating the same idea. Haven’t you
met this people? Don’t you know them? They’ve been giving
you the same idea for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years.
The Format Channel Conditions Everything in the Design
So pay attention to the format. It’s very important because the presence of a
format energy changes the way the frequency operates in anything that’s in that
design. And it’s not just that it changes the frequency of the individual
definition, it changes the frequency of every single aspect there. So the
moment you have a gate activated and you’ve got that format, it’s conditioning
how that gate is looking to operate. It’s looking for something that will have a
beginning and a middle and an end, and of course, it’s generated.
This is where you see the great quitting capacity of the Generator. Nobody
quits more than the Sacral Center and you can see why through this format.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 111
The moment that the Generator is not respecting the Sacral response, the
moment they’re looking for authority elsewhere, then they’re not getting
involved in something that truly has a beginning and a middle and an end. It is
no longer its potential. And because of that, they get out because it doesn’t
work, and of course the motor has not been taken into the confidence of the
being. The authority has not been sought out, and so they end up quitting.
The recognition is that the essence of what it is to evolve this business of life
being a response is that you can see that experience is a response, that the
whole experiential way is generative. And in order to have the right
experiences, in order to have experiences that you can truly just simply enter
into complete, then you have to act out your Type as a Generator and you have
to respond. You have to wait for that response. And remember, only the
Projector needs to be formally asked, formally invited.
The Generator is here to respond to anything. They’re simply not here to
initiate. And that means in order to find out as a Generator what there is for
you to do in this life as an experience, you have to wait to be initiated. Think
about the collective and think about Solomon, because when Solomon said that
there was nothing new under the Sun, he was only referring to the collective. It
is the nature of the collective. In other words, the collective starts with what’s
there and responds to it. Out of that response, it gathers the diversity of
potential experience.
Format Gates without Definition: Depression
All format energies carry with them a deep potential for depression, yet the
depression itself only exists in the gates being activated without definition. In
other words, all six of the gates of the format energies by
themselves without definition, these are all gates of
depression. If you have the 52nd gate, you can be depressed
because you don’t know what you’re sitting still for. If you
have the 9th gate, you can be depressed because you can’t
sit still to focus. If you have the 3rd gate, you’re deeply
confused. And if you have the 60th gate, you can’t get out
of your limitation. If you have the 53rd gate, you always
want to start something new. If you have the 42nd gate, you
can never get out of things.
112 Channels By Type
Healing the Depression is Mechanical
Depression is in all six of those gates. The greatest healer of depression is the
format energy fully defined. It’s one of those things to recognize about the
power of the format. If you’ve got a 9 in your life and a 9-52 steps into their
life or a 52 steps into their life, it immediately takes away the depression,
immediately. It’s just a mechanical aspect and it’s one of those things that’s
very, very important as a healing energy, in that sense.
You see, that format energy, the moment it operates properly, it doesn’t have
this powerful chemical build-up that is the potential of the Root and the
Sacral—very powerful motors. The Root Center is the center of stress. It is
our stress hormone, the adrenaline system. And it truly is a pressure center that
has us pressured under stress. The pressure to complete that is inherent in the
53. The pressure to mutate that’s in the 60. The pressure to be able to focus
that’s in the 52. It is deeply stressful. And the moment there’s a format, it
moves easily.
So format energies are very valuable in terms of their contribution to work. If
you have a group of people that are doing scientific research, it’s truly an
advantage to have a logical format present. Now obviously the more people
you have together, the more that is going to be present, but one of those things
to recognize is that these formats bring with them specific controls over how
the frequencies operate. So do not ignore them, see them for what they are.
Accept Frustration, Have Patience when Stuck
The nature of the frustration is inherent in being a Generator. To go through
something from the beginning and the middle and the end, even if you have
the whole format, even if you recognize its nature, does not mean that you’re
going to be able escape the frustration inherent in the mechanism. You simply
don’t have to identify with it and suffer.
You can know that this is the level you’re at and that you will stay at that level,
be stuck at that level until your next opportunity of metamorphosis, but the
metamorphosis is guaranteed. It will come to you because you entered into it
correctly.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 113
It is a learning strategy for all Generators to recognize that patience in their
stage where they’re stuck is necessary because they need to have the experience
before they can move on to the next stage. And you’ll see as a Generator that
some stages you’ll jump quickly and some stages will take much longer to
complete. As long as you’ve entered into it correctly, it will work for you.
Depending on the nature of the format and how it’s structured in somebody’s
design, the beginning can be the longest portion. The middle can be quick, the
end can be fast. There could be all these combinations, but the reality is it’s all
about moving through that process and seeing that you have to accept the
frustration of that theme. Again, this is not about us erasing anything, it’s
about us being aware.
It’s only about being aware, to be aware of the source of the frustration which
is just a chemical manifestation, a chemical result. You don’t have to get lost in
it. You don’t have to suffer from it. You can see that it’s simply your
timekeeper.
As long as you’ve got that feeling inside, it’s saying to you you’re not complete
at this stage yet. And you know as a Generator from your experience that by
the time you get to the next stage, you get the same feeling anyway. It’s an
ongoing part of your mechanical process.
The 46-29: The Mystery of Success in the Body
Look carefully at the crossing of the energy in the Sacral Center
and the magic that you get to when you get to the 46-29.
Everything about the abstract process is about our unique
human experience. The 46-29 carries within it the mystery of
success in the body.
Remember that the abstract process is never truly aware. It’s
dominated by the emotional system and it’s dominated by
desire. It’s dominated by the expectation that desire points
towards. If it were not for the 46-29, the abstract process would
really be well, a hell of a lot more chaotic than it is. There are
several things.
114 Channels By Type
The 29th gate is one of the gates of incredible mystery. I’d love to give you a
mystical day on the 29th gate. It’s a gate that initiates the commitment to life.
It’s a gate that initiates the onslaught of death. It is a gate that actually brings
us our living nature, our Sacral nature into the world, appropriately called the
abysmal. This 29th gate of
saying yes. Yes to life, yes to
experience.
When you have the 46 at the
other end, you have one of
the four gates of love. We’re
dealing with the tantra of
empowering a higher love of
the body. The 46-29 can have a quality of sensuousness that is rare. And the
46th gate pushing upward is one of the great dichotomies out of the original I
Ching in this channel. You have the abysmal, the deep within the deep, the 29.
And then you have pushing upward into the kingdom of God on the other
side, gate 46. There’s this incredible difference between these two gates.
The 46th gate at its mystical level is the capacity not simply to enjoy the
mundane of the body, the potential sensuality of the body, but at its highest
level that 46th gate is about recognizing the body as temple, but the body as
inviable absolute temple.
This is the gate of Buddha who says the body is not yours. The recognition is
that we are given as gifts these beautiful vehicles, all personalized, and the
magic of accepting its beauty. That’s at the highest level. And there is nothing
that carries more potential success in life than the 46th gate in its lines. No
hexagram offers so many opportunities for success, even presumptions of
success. See, the secret of the 46-29 is that it is existential. That’s its secret.
In order for experience to be of value to the collective, the experience has to be
taken in purely. It means non-interference in the progress of the experience.
Let the experience happen, don’t interfere, don’t stop, don’t think, just be
there, just be in it. This is serendipity. The serendipity of just being there.
And it is the only magic that is available to the 46-29 because the moment
they’re not being there, the channel of succeeding where other people fail
becomes the channel of failing where other people succeed, instantly.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 115
The moment that the 46-29 is not living out its Generator role, the moment it’s
not waiting for that opportunity to respond, to recognize what to enter into, it
can’t be purely in the experience and as a result will fail. Now, when I say ‘will
fail,’ just as the 46th gate carries the greatest opportunities, the 29th gate carries
all the themes of disaster.
After all, the weirdest gate, the weirdest line of universalization, all 5th lines are
the way we want to see experience. The way we want to see something. In
other words, if you’re looking at the structure of a hexagram, the first line is
always giving you the foundation that is the true nature of the hexagram. But
by the time you get to the 5th line, you get to the projected field, you get to
what everybody would like the hexagram to be.
So think about what the 29 is. The 29.1 is the draftee. It says you can be
pulled into commitment, but you can get out. In other words, there are
opportunities you can get pulled into things. If you really are in it, it can be a
valuable experience. If not, you can get out.
How does everybody want to see the 29.5? As failure. That experience brings
disaster, crisis, confusion. 29.5s in the detriment is failed ambition. So it’s very
important to see that what you’re looking at in the 46-29 is the quantum of
those two. It’s not like having either one. It’s very different. The moment you
have that whole process there, the opportunity of the real experiential, pure
experiential way is available out of the generation.
Because if you’re asked, if you’re given your opportunity to respond, and you’re
a 46-29 and you enter into it correctly according to your Type, you’re going to
be in the experience. You won’t know what the hell is going on. You’ll be
totally lost in it. The Generator on the fly. But because you’ve entered into it
properly, when the experience is over, that’s when the magic of what it is to be
abstract comes alive.
The value of the experience is directly related to how deeply you are in it,
because only later out of reflection can you then make sense, which is the
theme of the abstract, make sense out of it. This is not the logic system where
you go step-by-step and somebody has outlined a program for you. This is not
the way it goes. This is being there in the experience because what you’re here
to do is to be able to describe the experience afterwards.
116 Channels By Type
If you’re trying to describe it to yourself while you’re doing it, you’re missing it.
You can’t. A logical person can stop in their tracks and say there’s something
wrong with the pattern. That’s correct for them. It is not correct for the
abstract being. They have to be in the experience. Damn the consequences.
Go down, fly with it, be in it, after.
That’s the whole business of the 33-13. The whole business being of prodigal,
of being a witness, of being the voice of revelation, the voice of remembrance,
the witness of the way. But the 46-29 provides no ammunition, no
information, no fuel for that witness if it’s trying to figure out what’s going on.
That’s not its job. That’s why 29s generally get into so much trouble in this
life. They get into trouble because they’re always trying to make mental their
decision process and by making it mental, fill it with the expectation and
expectation is the curse of the abstract.
At the moment there is an expectation that an experience is going to be a
certain way, that’s the moment as an abstract person that you do stop in the
middle and say, “No no, you’re not supposed to do that on your left foot. Do
it on your right.” Everything’s lost. For them, it may have been essential to
see what it is like to do it on the left foot and live out the experience of that left
foot and not jump in and say, “Look, I had the expectation that it was all going
to be right-footed, and so I want to stop this now.” Completely unproductive.
Nothing is made available to the 33-13. No revelation is possible out of that,
and of course, the net result of that is frustration with experience. “Why did I
do that? It doesn’t make any sense, I didn’t learn anything from that
experience, it didn’t live up to my this and that blah, blah, blah, blah.” And
here you have all these people with all their failed expectations because they
didn’t enter into it correctly and they didn’t understand that abstract principle.
There’s no need for the abstract to be chaotic. There’s no need for anything to
be chaotic if it lives out its Type. The essential recognition in a 46-29 is that
these are people that can always be recognized. They have a huge wealth of
talent in them and they have no idea about the talent unless the talent is just
coming out—in the now—without their reflection, without their identification,
without anything, just being there.
The first line in the 46 says ‘art for art sake.’ To be in the experience for
nothing else but to be in the experience. Not for what it’s worth, not for what
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 117
it can bring because you don’t know. You don’t know, you can’t know. You
can never be there. And remember, something so essential about the abstract
experience is that it’s not personal—it’s not personal. If you take it personally,
you fail. It’s not personal.
The 33-13: The Wisdom of Hindsight that Guides
Humanity
It’s a collective gift. It’s a gift that says that the individual, the personal, can get
into the experience, be in the experience and then be a representative of voice,
a direction of humanity. That’s what the 33-13 is. It is one of the ways in
which we guide humanity. The expression of where we have come from along
the way, what our collective human experience is so that we do not have to
repeat experiences that are detrimental to us.
How many times do you hear the cliché that history repeats itself? We only
know that because we’ve been charting it, not that anybody has learnt too
much from that. But it sure as hell is obvious.
And then our real wisdom of the human way is always the wisdom of
hindsight. The Monday morning quarterbacks of the world, they’re endless.
And of course that’s what the abstract process is all about. To be intelligent
through hindsight. To look back and say, “Ah, yeah, well it went this way, but
that’s what happens to you when you do it only on your right foot.” They’re so
important to us. It’s so important that we see that the human experience is
properly operating so that we
get those things that we need
to learn and we get those
teachers that we deserve.
Everything, everything is
hierarchical. It never ends.
We need our witnesses because
our witnesses fulfill the needs
and interests of many who wait for that witnessing. And we need to have
valuable witnesses who are clear in their experience, that their experience is not
tainted by their expectation. That the experience is something that they live
118 Channels By Type
through purely and then they can reveal the results of that to us. These are the
most important teachers we can have. It is the essence of that.
If you look at the abstract process and you get to the 11th gate, the 4th line, you
see the genetic continuity of the brilliance, the brilliance of the abstract way.
This is the line of Einstein, this is the line of teaching, of the guru, of the sage.
It is all built into the reflection upon the abstract way, ideas that grow out of
experience, stimulation derived from the experience, the value of that reflection
in order to be able to assure all of us what our historical continuity really is, to
see our place in the movement of things.
I’m deeply grateful for historians. I have loved my lifetime of looking at the
continuity of humanity and seeing its movement in time. It’s a great privilege
of our specie, and yet at the same time, how clear it is to me that that reflection
is often deeply skewered, filled with expectation, filled with judgment, rather
than the pure reflection and revelation that is essential in that process. We
need to have those that enter into experience correctly according to their Type.
So the moment that you’re dealing with somebody who has the volatility of the
abstract through the emotional system—the 35-36, the 41-30—the moment
you are dealing with that kind of volatility, for them to understand that only if
they wait out their wave, only if they enter into an experience correctly is it
truly going to be valuable for them as an experience and for others later. And
if they can give up their expectation, then they will learn so much more.
It’s like somebody with an undefined mind who wants to tell you something.
They never reveal their intelligence to you. They don’t. But if you ask
somebody with an undefined mind a question, they’ll reveal their intelligence to
you right away clearly.
To be able to grasp what it means to live out your mechanical nature and to get
the reward for that mechanical nature. How essential it is for the abstract
person to simply be able to fall into the experience without the expectation of
the mind that says, “I’m going to tell that person that. I’m having this
experience just for that.” And they tell you beforehand, and the experience is
only going to be a crisis, automatic; going to be a crisis. They have no idea
what the experience is for.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 119
We don’t choose. It’s not up to us what moves us. They don’t know so they
make up their expectation, they live with their disappointment, they cannot
bring their message to others, and then they feel deeply inadequate and they
feel like life is a drag and they suffer in their frustration. It’s hard not to laugh
at the pain that people live through. That sounds funny, I know. But it’s so
obvious to me how simple it is to remove that from your life, how mindless it
is, how ignorant it is to suffer.
If you don’t know that a computer needs to be plugged in, to sit before the
screen and suffer that it doesn’t work is really a joke to me. I can only see that
as a joke. They need to be told to plug it in and turn it on.
So this whole thing about being abstract, yes it’s chaotic, yes it is the driving
force of what our lives are, but it’s essential to see that that is exactly what we
need. Part of our process is to be able to taste all the fruits and to be able to
see all the things and live all the experiences.
No 35-36, no Kama Sutra. Life can be boring without experiential depth. It’s
essential. And what we need is those who are entering into experience
correctly so that they can be valid teachers and they can truly guide us with
their experience.
The love of the body. If you look
carefully at the 46th gate in the
wheel, you will see that it is the lead
hexagram of all the
seven hexagrams that
are in the Spleen. If you look
carefully at the structure of the 46
in the wheel and its hexagram
chop, you’ll see that it’s the head of
the family, the head of a house that
includes eight other hexagrams—
seven other, eight altogether—and
the other seven are all in the
Spleen. Now think about that.
This idea of the 46th gate being the gate of the love of the body, it is connected
to the whole splenic system. It’s connected to our deepest survival and fear
120 Channels By Type
mechanisms. And the experience of being in a body and the fear of being in
life is conditioned by all the 46-29s in the world. That 46 energy conditions
whether or not life is something to be feared and the body is to be hated, or life
is something to be lived and the body to be adored and considered divine. It’s
the inherent dichotomy in that 46.
Any Lack of Love of the Body Distorts the Body Physically
I have mentioned throughout our process the importance of recognizing that
living out your design according to your Type is healthy for you. It brings you
your natural well-being and it brings you exactly what is correct for your body.
Nowhere is that more true than in the 46-29 and in the way in which it operates
in the world. You see, that love of the body, any lack of love of the body will
distort the body physically. Any lack of love of the body will distort the body
physically.
The distortion of the body begins in the liver and it is out of the liver that the
body can be distorted permanently for life. One of the few areas of our body
that does not replicate every seven years is certain kinds of liver cells that stay
alive for your whole lifetime.
The fact is that the moment you do not accept the inherent beauty of your
body, if you do not accept that being in an experience in the moment is all
there is, that’s the moment you begin to distort your body.
I have seen so many 46-29s who do not have their
body. They have a distorted body. And one of the
things to recognize about honoring the generative
capacity, the Generator Type of this, is that that
condition, first of all, is eliminated in children, and can
be slowly over seven years mostly corrected in adults.
It’s one of the things to recognize that each design has
an absolutely perfect body—each design. And the
closer you come to living out your nature, the closer
you’re going to come to seeing the transition in your
physical form because it will correspond to that. How many Generators make
up their minds that they’re going to eat? It’s endless.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 121
To live out what is truly yourself is to have the physical vehicle that belongs to
you. Most of us get these vehicles and then we start adding things. Trailers in
the back. Carrying cases on the top. We pack on all this stuff and carry it
around as baggage. It doesn’t belong to us, doesn’t belong to our vehicle and
this is the whole thing about the correct commitment, because I want you to
understand how that works physically.
It’s all about the proper use of energy. If you’re not living out your Type, if
you’re a Generator who’s not waiting to respond, it means you’re using your
energy indiscriminately in things that are not productive. You end up changing
your metabolism. You’re using energy in a way that you’re not designed
to use it, so you change your metabolism. You need more food, for
example, or you need richer food, and yet your body isn’t designed to be able
to burn that. It’s just you trying to be a conditioned Manifestor that does that.
So you put all that stuff into your body and your body cannot process it. And
it’s all because you’re using your energy incorrectly. It works the other way, not
being able to eat. It works the other way.
It’s so important to understand that if you’re using your energy properly, your
metabolism will work properly. The Generator needs to apply its energy
specifically to things that it responds to. In that response, it is using the energy
properly and every Generator knows that in the moment they can use their
energy effectively and properly, they feel terrific. They feel terrific. It’s good
for them and then they don’t have to deal with the distortion in their form.
The other thing is that because the 46 is the lead hexagram of the whole splenic
process, that love of the body is couched with a deep fear. I want you to
remember that everything in Design is dualistic. Love of the body is the hatred
of the body, the love of self is the hatred of self, the love of humanity is the
hatred of humanity, the universal love is the hatred of God and the universe.
Those polarities are in each of those four gates of love. That 46th gate is
terrified of letting go in the experience. Do you understand? It’s afraid—it’s
afraid.
What happens then is that it’s the mind that simply takes over, or if they’re
emotional, the emotional system takes over. Whatever the case may be. And
this incredible capacity to really be in form. After all, the 46th gate is a doorway
to being awake. At the moment one sees that life is to be surrendered to
totally,—if you have the 46-29, unless you’re a god damn saint, you’re going to
122 Channels By Type
suffer. Unless you’re like the greatest of the holy ones, you’re going to suffer
because the only thing you can do with the 46-29 is let go. Don’t interfere.
Let go. Deal with it later—deal with it later. Later comes the clarity.
Have Space for Reflection Alone
One of the things I always recommend to people is that they have their own
bedroom and they have their own free aura space. It’s so that we can follow
the law of human experience. Whether you have any abstract activation or not,
the human experience demands reflection. It simply does. It’s essential for all
of us to have time to reflect on our daily activities, to have time to reflect on
our process and not as an intended thing. In other words, the day is over, now
I’m going to think about my day and life. It’s not about that. It’s simply about
having that time alone in your own aura after your process of the day is done to
be able to reflect on that.
Now this is the most natural thing in the world for those who are abstract, that
opportunity to be left alone with your thoughts, to be left alone with the
experience of the day. Because out of that comes the potential revelation. Out
of that comes the ability to codify the experience. Out of that comes the
potential to be able to instill in others as a stimulation that retelling, the sharing
of that experience—it comes from reflection. Abstract people need to have
time at the end of each day without their aura being cluttered by other people
and their demands, to be able to have a chance to reflect on what they did not
involve themselves in mentally in the first place.
In other words, you’ve gone through your day as an abstract person just being
in your process. To truly live out the 46-29 is to be a spiritual being. That’s
what it is. And it is this wonderful opportunity to be able to recognize the
absolute beauty of being in form, and that strangely enough, you don’t have to
do anything, that the experience happens to you and afterwards you can reflect
on the experience. This is truly the nature of our intelligence. The whole thing
for us to recognize is that we do not create, we react. We are in a program.
We’re not the creators of the program. We’re reacting to the program. That is
our gift. This is the way of being human is to react to the program.
And so it’s essential for all of us to see that to be able to reflect on human
experience, to get the right reflection on human experience is very, very
important for all of us. So important for the abstract person to recognize that
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 123
it is their role to help us in the way in which we experience life, because they
are our historians and teachers of the life experience.
A Child with the 46-29
What do you do with the child that has a 46-29? This child has to have its
experiences and when they’re young, they don’t think about them at all.
There’s nothing more beautiful than a 46-29 child. They’re great. They’re right
in things—they’re right in them. They’re totally absorbed in them. And then
there’s some adults saying, “Look out! Why are you doing that?” Somebody
interfering with them just being in it. Let them be in it until they’re finished.
Let them go through their experience. You can talk about it afterward.
You have a child who has the 46-29 and they’re learning how to eat. You
cannot interfere with their experience. They’re deeply absorbed in the food
and the food is flying everywhere, and they’re slapping it onto their face and
their shoulders, and it’s dropping on the floor, and they’re flipping things—
don’t interfere. When the meal is over and everything is cleaned up, then you
have an opportunity afterwards to talk about that experience, to talk about
what it looked like, what it felt like, the result of that. They will grasp it after
the fact. But if you stopped them in the middle, they get very upset. They get
very flustered. They don’t get to finish their experience properly and they don’t
learn anything from you telling them that they just did it wrong. They resist it
and resent it.
We mess them up all the time. We take these beautiful children who are really
into just being alive and then we tell them about all the risks of being like that.
We tell them to pay attention to everything that they’re doing. We give them
all the wrong instructions to keep them away from their pure nature and then
we wonder why so many people suffer failure in life. And I’m not talking
about financial failure, I’m talking about failure in life. To feel like you’re a
failure, to feel like you have not accomplished what you could, to feel like
you’ve missed your possibilities in this life, to feel like it’s impossible to climb
out of the pits and reach the kingdom of heaven. And of course that’s just the
distortion of conditioning in these children’s lives. That’s not what they’re
about.
So when you’re dealing with an adult that has the 46-29, you have to get them
to grasp number one, enter into your experience correctly. And number two,
124 Channels By Type
let it happen to you. Once you go ‘uh-huh,’ let it happen. Later you can
process that. Later you can see its value. Its value for you, its value for others
if it’s applicable. But upon reflection, you get the depth of the experience.
This is the great reward. There is no other reward for experience, but the
clarity of being able to share the experience; no greater reward than that clarity.
I have this thing with Generators. I tease them a lot. I tell them they have the
easiest path to enlightenment, I give them all these bones, I tell them they’re
dumb as hell, they quit all the time, that they’re the world’s great slaves, blah,
blah, blah. I go on and on and on and on and on. It’s just the jealousy of a
Manifestor. These Generators are powerful people.
It’s so important for them to honor their Type so that the glory of what they
are as beings, as individuals can come out. It’s essential and it’s deeply, deeply,
deeply essential in this 46-29. This is one of the most important tantras that we
have. This elevation to the recognition of how divine our form is. The divinity
in your own form is self-evident when you’re responding—it’s self-evident.
Out of that comes well-being. Out of that can come great good fortune.
That’s the whole thing. 46s are intended to be recognized, intended to be given
success. It’s what waits for them in life, but only if it’s art for art sake. Only if
it’s just to be there. In that you can see its deep existential nature. It’s one of
the ironies of the abstract that even though the abstract is designed to be totally
involved with looking at the past and understanding the past, it can only
understand the past by being existential in the now. Otherwise, there’s no
other way. And their existentialism isn’t for the experience of the now, it’s for
the possibility of clearer reflection afterward.
The 15-5: Diversity Operates out of Pattern and
Rhythm
In the tantra of logic, whenever I
come to the 15-5, I always come to
this very special place, this universal
channel. We know very little about
the real diversity that is possible in the
program. There are so many people,
chaos theory, this and that, all of these
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 125
things that have a hard time imagining that the cosmos is orderly.
If you really pay attention to the 15-5, you’ll see that the level of diversity that’s
possible is mathematically so huge, it is unbelievable, and the diversity operates
out of two frameworks. One is it operates out of pattern and the other is it
operates out of rhythm. You can have things that have the same rhythm and
have different patterns. You can have things that have the same pattern,
different rhythms. You can have many, many, many, many, many
combinations. But most of all we understand about the 15 and the 5 and the
way that it operates is from the perspective of the gate activations only—only.
The Fixedness of Definition is Very Narrow and Limited
It’s very different when you’re dealing with the quantum of that. I try to
explain often the fixedness of definition. Most people don’t recognize how
truly narrow that is. It’s really narrow. It’s a specific planet in a specific line
connected to another specific planet in a specific line and it’s just that. And if
you figure out how many lines are there and you figure out how many planets
and planet combinations could be there on either side, mathematically you
could go nuts counting all the possibilities. It is incredibly endless. And yet all
of us in our definitions are limited to that very, very, very fine line. So when
you’re dealing with a 15-5, you’re dealing with something very, very, very fixed.
Now of course that’s true of all channels that are defined. But when you’re
dealing with 15-5, you’re dealing with a fixed pattern and a fixed rhythm and a
fixed flow. Totally different if you’re a 5 or a 15 in which you’re always open
to the possibilities of either having the pattern operate through different
rhythms, or the rhythm be fixed by different patterns. And out of that comes
the ideas of extremism that’s in the 5, out of that comes the diversity and this
flow of all possibilities of all different patterns and rhythms. But somebody
who has the 15-5 is fixed in that specific way.
They’re the most magnetic people on the planet. That’s what they do. The
tantra of this is to empower the love of humanity. The potential of the 15-5
when it lives out its Generator nature is that it appears to be a source of love
for humanity, and not only that, but a direction for humanity in love. It’s the
natural step to finding logical leaders. It’s the 15-5s that bring people into the
hall, bring them into the flow so that they can meet their potential leaders.
126 Channels By Type
It is the nature of the 15-5 to establish fixed ways of life on earth. Every 15-5
brings a unique combination of what life can be on earth. It is our diversity.
And because they bring their unique version of what life is on earth and
because they are magnetic, they’re always influencing other people. Remember
that in the genetic continuity, this is the tantra that feeds the ultimate
expression of influence in the 31; 15-5s are influential. They’re influential
through their rhythm and pattern and in the magnetism that brings people into
their rhythm and pattern.
In that they are very restrictive. “It is my way or the highway.” The beauty of
the 5th gate first line, if the captain must, he or she goes down with the ship.
The foundation of a pattern is don’t mess with the pattern. Logic is terrified by
freaks. Don’t mess with the pattern. The pattern’s okay.
So what you have in the 15-5 is fixed rhythm to a set pattern that says, “Don’t
mess with my pattern,” and their aura does the talking because
you cannot deal with them unless you’re in their pattern. They
are deeply influential. They bring the other into the flow, and
they bring them into a way of living their life, and they bring
them into a way of sharing their life with others.
The most sharing, collective force is here in the 15-5. They
want to be able to share their rhythm and pattern by imposing
it naturally. In other words, they have to impose it because
they can’t be anything other than what they are. And yet at the
same time, it is their role to impose that as long as they’re asked, as long as it’s a
response.
If you allow your aura to do the talking and you are a 15-5, someone who steps
into your aura takes that into them. They are instantaneously in your flow and
if in being in your flow they then ask you to do something with them, they are
not going to resist your flow. They won’t. They’re already taking it in and
they’re asking for it.
There is nothing more disturbing than a 15-5 who tries to be a Manifestor
because then it’s not simply that they naturally impose their rhythm and flow,
it’s that they push their rhythm and flow and that’s when it creates all kinds of
hostility and resistance. “I don’t want to do things on your timing. I don’t
want to do things on your rhythm.” When they’re asked, they’re getting those
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 127
people who naturally need that tantric guidance. The whole thing about living
out your Type is that so many of these channels become deeply, deeply
distorted the moment you’re not letting them work the way they’re intended to.
The work of being in the flow is that it is about the love of humanity, being
able to provide out of love a way for humanity, a rhythm, a flow for humanity,
to be a stream for humanity. But humanity has to come to that flow, has to
come to that stream, has to know that you’re there and ready to share it with
them out of humanism. But at the same time the only time you can impose
your rhythm is when they come to you and they ask you to do so.
The whole thing about being a Generator is that a Generator has a task in their
waiting to respond. They can bring to them their perfect form, quickly. I
mean quickly. The beauty of this tantra is you must wait, you must wait for the
opportunity to respond and then you can really be there and be of value.
Q & A
About the Roads Leading to Rome from the Sacral
Student: One of the things that I’m not totally clear, if everything aims to get
to the Throat. When you talk about the tantra, you’re always referring to the G
gate going into the Sacral to respond. And so really it looks like the order, if
you will, is from the G to the Sacral Center. And then when you look at that
column that goes to the Throat, what happens in the G? From the Sphinx
gates, it goes to the Throat from the lower G gates to the Sacral? That was my
question. I’ve been wondering about it a long time. You say everything needs
to get to the Throat, but…
Ra: That’s a valid question. The first thing to recognize about that statement,
I started off by talking about the Throat as all roads lead to Rome and
everything is about the Throat. Everything is about manifestation. That is
true.
The fact is that when all of us are in the world together that manifestation is
always a theme. It is always present as part of being in the world and it’s an
absolute essential for us as human beings to be Manifestors—absolutely
essential.
128 Channels By Type
All of us, whether we are Reflectors, Projectors, Generators, or Manifestors live
in a manifesting world. We live in a world in which the whole design is active.
In other words, we are always living in a world that is an emotional Manifesting
Generator. That’s really the nature of the world. And everything does have to
get to the Throat in order for metamorphosis to take place.
The nature of tantra, because of its relationship to our sexual source, not to our
sexuality, but it’s relationship to the Sacral Center itself, that the tantra itself can
only come out as a by-product of response. But the quality of that tantra going
out into the world, as an example, when you bring a couple together and they
have a tantra together, 8 times out of 10 they’re going to be Manifestors. In
other words, manifestation is always hanging around. Just like the emotional
system is always hanging around the moment there’s more than one of us.
And it’s one of the things that I’ve always stressed about looking at a chart is
the recognition that that chart is never like that, never. You’re a design. It’s
never like that. It’s always in the world. It’s always in the program. It’s always
in the aura. If we did a composite of this classroom, we would see that we’re
an emotional Manifesting Generating group like the rest of the planet.
So there is a difference between everything leads to the Throat at the universal
or global sense—the sense of what our social environment is—than at the
personal level. There are lots of people who don’t have a defined Throat.
Manifestation is not going to be their theme in life. Their personal theme in
life is going to be rooted in whatever areas they have that they can operate out
of.
However, at the personal level, they may be a Generator working out of
response. But the moment that they step into the aura of the world, that
generating capacity makes its contribution towards manifestation. Generators
don’t move from one level to the other without metamorphosis
taking place, without the Throat getting involved in order for
them to be able to get to the next level, get to the next stage.
The question about the nature of the movement of the
circuitry, the fact of the matter is that the tantra and the 2-14,
which is specifically about direction, the direction and the
direction of our evolution, that all of that is going to come out
as roles in the G Center when it moves towards the Throat.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 129
Even though when we move in circuitry we say that the 15-5 leads to the 31-7
and the 46-29 leads to the 33-13, but the reality is that out of that 2nd gate
comes those three roles.
Circulation Systems in Our Body
The nature of the real tantra, the love of humanity and the love of the body,
they actually go out—and this is very technical—they actually go out through
the 10th gate. That is, the 15 goes through the 10, it’s opposite, and the 46 goes
through its 25, it’s opposite.
Now this is the vaguest system in our health process. In other words, this is
literally the way we breathe and live, okay. And it’s a very important circuit
that’s in the body. It’s not a circuit I teach you, because it’s something that’s
involved in health and in medical practice to understand this circuit.
So when you’re looking at, for example, the love of humanity (gate 15), that
the natural outlet of the love of humanity is to go through the 10 and either to
be awakened, to find your form, or to follow your convictions. That’s one.
On the other side, the love of the body (gate 46) leads to initiation and an
entry into communion. In other words, those movements are like this. So you
can see what happens is that the individual tantra fuels our direction and the
themes of our direction whereas the tantra that is collective then goes back into
the body itself, goes back down. It’s not looking for the Throat,—goes back
down into us.
So, for example, the nature of the 15-5 establishes its rhythm to find the
perfected form. In other words, to bring that rhythm to a perfected form and
in bringing that to a perfected form, the ability to have the energy necessary to
struggle in this life. In other words, there’s a whole movement that goes
around.
The same thing is true for the love of the body. To initiate the community to
the love of the body. To initiate the community to the body as temple which is
why we build temples. We build temples because the 46 leads naturally to the
25, it’s opposite which is the priest or the priestess who says we will give them
a temple for them. We will create a temple for them. We will create a body.
This is the body of faith. You go into a church, you go into a synagogue, you
130 Channels By Type
go into a mosque. What you’re going into is the 29-46, going out the 25-51,
and down into the 40-37.
So you can see that there is a very different movement, that the collective
circuitry is moving out through its oppositions, whereas at the same time the
individual tantra is fueling the three possible expressions or roles of our
direction. As I said, that’s not Human Design in the sense that that’s not about
Human Design as analysis, which is why I rarely talk about it because there’s so
many more things that I would have to describe to you and discuss, because it
has to do with the way in which our physical bodies operate and these are two
very important circulation systems in our body.
However, it’s one of those things to see that only the center channel—the 2-
14—actually has a direct impact on the way in which it’s finally expressed
through the Throat, whereas the other two sides are going back into the
system, revitalizing the system with their process. That answer your question?
Student: Yeah. A couple of more things with that. So when you’re looking at
those other ones going into it too, if you’re looking at the Sacral responding,
does it eventually,—you say 2-14. So the direction is only coming out of
response.
Ra: That’s right.
Student: Somehow those channels have to operate in a way that they function
going into the Sacral Center.
Ra: Except for the 2-14. They’re going back into the BodyGraph. They’re
going back in an ongoing cycle. Because of course when they go back in, they
come back into the Sacral and then go back out of the Sacral again.
Student: Back in their formats then?
Ra: Well, I don’t want to get into all of that because it’s too much information.
It’s just too much information. When I’ve taught that it’s taken me two days
just to describe that to people because it’s a lot of information.
But yes, it does do that. It goes back in, and then it comes back into the Sacral
and it goes back out again. It’s an ongoing process. It’s really about our
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 131
circulative system within the body and how we keep ourselves alive. And it’s
really a very important mechanism that is within us. But your speculation is
correct. Okay. Good, it’s sidetracking me
One day that material hopefully will be will be written down and described and
all of those things because Human Design has many different applications. My
responsibility in working with you is preparing you as best I can. Informing
you as best I can so you can be good analysts.
And when I get involved in teaching you things that really are not applicable to
your work, it really to me seems pointless. That is a whole different avenue of
knowledge out of Human Design which has to do with Human Design’s
medical application, and how we can through understanding these medical
applications help people to stay healthier by helping them to be themselves by
recognizing where they need help, where they need to be strengthened in order
to understand how their system operates.
And so much of the way in which these collective tantric channels work is that
their most important work takes place long before we’re born. In other words,
in the 88 degrees of the Sun, from the design to the personality time. That’s
when these channels and the impact of these channels have some of their
greatest impact, but all of that is information really that is not directly
applicable.
One of the things to be clear about is that in recognizing the reactive nature of
what it is to be a human being is to see very clearly that so much of what is
important to us in life can only come to us that way. After all, only the
Manifestor, and only when we are in manifesting relationships, which again is a
lot, only then can we have this illusion of being able to dictate the course of
events.
But the reality is that we are here to respond to life and respondability is one of
the most important gifts for a human being to develop. To recognize that, how
essential it is for us. To recognize that we are here as perfect, perfect forms in
our ability to be able to respond to the demands of staying alive and of course
that’s what it’s all about. What happens to us is that we put our consciousness
to work trying to stay alive, instead of allowing our bodies to operate correctly
so they will stay alive.

You Get to Manifestation According to Your Type
This whole business about non-interference, don’t get involved. Allow your
vehicle to do exactly what is correct. And the thing to recognize is that if you
are a Projector and you’re invited and you’re recognized, you get your
opportunity to manifest. And if you’re a Generator and you respond, you’re
ultimately given your opportunity to manifest. And if you’re a Manifestor and
inform, you eliminate the resistance to you being able to manifest.
In other words, it’s not that manifestation is not taking place in any of the
Types. Because of the nature of our world, because of the nature of the fact
that we’re almost always in a manifesting mode, the manifestation is always
there but you get to it according to your Type. It’s the only way to get to it.
And these two very essential processes, the logic and the abstract, here through
the Root going to the G Center, they are so important to us and they’re so
important to the stability of our societies. They govern both our capacity to
recognize what is a valuable experience to enter into, and what is a valuable
experiment to enter into.
The 9-52 is deeply Fixed
Think about the 9-52. As I mentioned to you, in any kind of format energy
depression is something that is always a potential, always. If you just have the
52 gate keeping still mountain, you can be still but you don’t know what to be
still about. You don’t know
what to focus on while you’re
still and it becomes very
depressing. “I can’t do anything,
I can’t think, I don’t know what
to do.”
If you’re the 9th gate, you don’t
have the 52 then depression for
you is that you’ve got something that you’re ready to focus on but you can’t sit
still. So you can’t focus on it and so you get really depressed. The moment
you have the 9-52 together, this format capacity to be focused and
concentrated, means that you’re looking at a very, very fixed being. Think
about that. Nothing more fixed than a 9-52 format. They’re deeply fixed.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 133
Format Diseases
I want you to recognize that the format energies are deeply connected to the
way in which our bodies function and about the way in which illness operates
in our bodies. That is one of the things to recognize. If you’re dealing with the
logic format, you’re dealing with diseases that are dry. If you’re dealing with
the abstract format, you’re dealing with diseases that are wet. And when
you’re dealing with the individual format, you’re dealing with diseases that are
hot and cold. So the individual can get a very high fever suddenly or
pneumonia instantly.
The logic person has that dry endless cough, but the abstract person is spitting
out the phlegm and the liquid. These formats are very, very profound. Your
question probably points to medical aspects. There’s all this information that is
lying there. So think about the 9-52. The 9-52 is this very, very dry focused.
When the 9-52 gets sick, they go right into the sickness. Deep, deep, deep into
that focus on that, concentrated.
If you have the 9-52 and somebody says to you, “Would you like to do this
thing?” and you go ‘uh-huh,’ what it says is “I can be focused and concentrated
on it.” That’s the only criteria. I can be focused and concentrated. Or ‘un-un’
I cannot be focused and concentrated.
The Movement of the 9-52 to the 5-15
When you look at the collective formats, look at what happens when they cross
the Sacral. What does naturally the 9-52 look for in order to be
focused and concentrated? It looks for the 5, and the 5 is the
gate of our habits. It is the gate of ritual. One of the most
important things to be clear about in the logical process is that
regardless of whether you have the format or not, if you carry
logic definition, if you carry a lot of logical themes, you need to
have ritual, habit as a part of your life.
You get a glimpse of that when you go to school and the logical
institution says to you that you have to have a study schedule.
They say to you, “You’ve got to do two hours blah, blah, blah,
X amount of days,” —this kind of thing. In other words, to
134 Channels By Type
structure a habit and they’ll tell you what times are best to do that. To do it
when you’re not exhausted. To do it when you’re fresh. To be able to build a
proper schedule.
And when the 9-52 goes and agrees to anything, when it says, “Yes, I can be
focused and concentrated,” that cannot be fulfilled without being in the flow.
It cannot work unless they have their habit. The 9-52 says, “I will repeat
endlessly. That’s my gift. I will repeat endlessly.” In order to repeat endlessly,
one can only do that through habit. That’s why we have mastery in the logical
process.
Now what happens to so many people that I know that if they are the 15-5 or
they just have the 5 is that they think that the structuring of habit is something
that is mental. In other words, they decide what the habit should be. They
decide what the rhythm should be. They decide what the pattern should be,
instead of seeing that there is a natural pattern. And it is the natural pattern,
once recognized out of response, that then can be ingrained as ritual.
I always give the example of the person who recognizes out of their 5 that
every day at 4:00, they’re suddenly fatigued and they need to have a rest. And
they see that it’s really good for them to have a little nap, a little lie down
between 4:00 and 5:00 every day. It gives them a better appetite, they feel
better in the evening. They just notice that as a part of their response to being
alive. It is one of those responses that’s natural in them. Suddenly they
become tired around that time of day and they need to relax.
Now you see, if you understand the value of recognizing that, it then has to be
something that is ritualized. In other words, it becomes your program and it
becomes your announced program. Somebody calls you up and says to you
“Can I see you tomorrow at 4:00?” The answer is automatically, “Uh-uh. This
is my quiet time and please don’t call me between 4:00 and 5:00 every day.
This is my quiet time. I do not accept calls.” And then that person can have
their natural rhythm and habit that is healthy for them.
Now if they’re living in an apartment building and they hear the fire alarms
going and they see fire engines arriving, don’t move a muscle. If the captain
must, he or she goes down with the ship. It is the basis of ritual. Do not give
up your ritual. Do not give up your ritual under any pressure. Never give up
your ritual.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 135
And so while you’re lying there flat on your back and everybody is running
around in a panic, spraining ankles, breaking legs, falling down stairs, inhaling
smoke, opening up their doors in panic while their apartment’s flash with fire,
you’re lying there flat on your back enjoying yourself. Nothing happens to
your flat—nothing, nothing. Absolutely nothing. No water damage, no smoke
damage, no nothing. And you really feel rested afterwards. It’s magical. It has
to do with being who you are.
It’s not just about saying this 9-52 wow, focused and concentrated. On what?
And how are you going to maintain that focus and concentration? You can’t
practice 25 hours a day. You have to have time, space, breaks, and you have to
be consistent. The need for the focus, the need for the repetition, and so it
means that that’s the part of us that needs to schedule things.
We have that in all of our collective institutions that deal with us is that they
give us schedules. They give you schedules as to when things are going to
appear on television and all of this stuff. You got your schedules. They got all
of that lined out for you because that is part of the logic process and part of
logic is to be able to establish habits that are safe and secure for us into the
future.
That’s the most important thing that the logic system brings. It is that it brings
this capacity to be able to show us that patterns are secure, that we don’t have
to worry, that tomorrow is not going to be scary, that everything’s going to be
just fine. They’re very soothing.
See, the abstract is not soothing because the abstract remembers what
happened. The future is always much prettier than the past. The future always
has the potential of being different and wonderful. The past is self-evident.
So we need these logical people in order to give us this salve that says that life
isn’t so bad and even if it is, it’s going to get better. It’s going to get better and
the pattern is right and we’re all going to be safe in the future.
The Movement of the 15 to the 10
The love of humanity in the 15th gate is the expression of that. The movement
of the 15 to the 10 is really very magical because you see that the moment you
can assure humanity out of your love and guidance, you magnetize them to
136 Channels By Type
your flow, and in magnetizing them to your flow, what you’re really saying to
them is, “Don’t worry. The collective pattern is okay.
Everything’s all right. Why don’t I take you over here to the
10th gate so you can start working on yourself—on yourself.
Everything’s okay.”
“The pattern is secure as long as you stay in my flow, you’re
going to see that everything is really okay. And the moment
that you can relax that the pattern is secure, then you can go and try and find
yourself.”
Remember that the 10th gate is an opening up into life. It is the gate of
behavior. It is the gate that’s able to say, “I am alive in the world. I am myself
unique in the world.” Collective doesn’t know that. That comes out of the
individuality. And that in being correct and in being unique in the world, “I
have my own form. I have to follow my own convictions because the pattern’s
secure. I don’t have to always be on guard for crime. We have a pattern that’s
secure. We have those that are responsible for that” or whatever the thing may
be.
The fact of the matter is that the logic process is there to outline, clarify, and
present us with the way in which everything operates and what the pattern is so
we know that it’s all reliable. You don’t want to go to the bus stop in the
morning and not know if a bus will ever come. And it’s only logic that says
“Don’t worry, the pattern’s okay, you can go to the bus stop. A bus will
come.” And we trust that, don’t we?
Now if you had to worry about whether the bus was going to be there or not,
you’re going to spend a lot of energy in this life, wasted energy, worrying,
running around. The moment that logic tells you that the bus is going to be
there, while you’re walking to the bus, you can enter into yourself. You’re not
thinking about whether it’s there or not. You’re not thinking if you can get to
that place or this place or whatever.
In other words, that logic provides us with a very important gift. It provides us
with a kind of security and the value of that security is to turn us in on
ourselves. That’s the joke. Turn us in on ourselves and why I say that’s a joke
is that the collective is always trying to get its members to be mutative which
seems very funny to me.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 137
In other words, the love of humanity is saying “Okay, this is the pattern,
everything’s established.” And of course you don’t want to say excuse me, but
of course this pattern’s only temporary until the next mutation. So the logic is
saying, “Hey look, this is the pattern. It’s really secure, everything is terrific,
and by the way now that you know that, go find out about being mutative, go
find yourself. Don’t get lost in being concerned about all these collective
things. Follow the flow.”
The Movement of the 15-5 to the 31-7
You see, the 15-5 leads naturally into the 31-7. It leads to the alpha experience.
Now the truth is that the 31-7 is directly connected to the 62-17, just as the 33-
13 is directly connected to the 11-56. It is not that they are, in that sense, an
absolute, direct line of the collective tantra between the Sacral and the Self
because, in fact, they go through this wheel. They go out in a cycle. But of
course it doesn’t mean that they don’t have a direct connection to
it in the sense of circuitry. They, in fact, do.
The net result of being able to bring people into the flow is the
capacity to be their alpha or to lead them to their alpha. This is
one of the truths of the hierarchical structure of humanity, that
there must always be alphas.
There has to be those that lead the collective, and particularly
that lead the logical collective because the logical collective is the
most hierarchical of all the circuitry. The 17.5, no man, no
woman is an island. There is no end to hierarchies. It is the
nature of logic to recognize that.
And so the alpha is essential. The alpha is the logical leader. But
no logical leader can be supported without the 15-5. It’s not
possible. It is that 15-5 that will point the way, will say “this is the flow, there is
the alpha.” In the same way that the 46-29 says, “Here is the experience; there
is the revelation” in the 33-13 or “There in the mundane sense is the
remembrance” that’s in the 33-13.
138 Channels By Type
The Movement of the 46-29 to the 25
In the 46-29, that love of the body becomes the 25 and universal love. Please
understand that movement because it’s just as special and just
as mystical as the movement of the 15 to the 10, the collective
security opening up the possibility for individual perfected
form. On the other side, that love of the body opens up the
possibility to love the greater body, the universal body. In
other words, as high a form of spirituality as you get.
This is where we get the love of God. Everybody that’s on a
God trip, everybody that’s ever been on a God trip, has been
on a God trip through the 46-25 hook, because this is the natural movement.
The natural movement is the mundane. We are in a body, it is the microcosm.
If we can learn to accept the perfection of this body, learn to accept the
mechanics of this body, the next step is to recognize that this is only an aspect
of an even larger body and then we get to accept that larger body as our own.
I described to you this morning the feedback process in the neutrino field and
how we program the outside. This is our body. This is my 25 speaking to you.
This is our body. This is the godhead. We are the godhead. We are it. This is
our body.
The Law of the Greater Body
And you see the moment that you can recognize that your body is not yours,
the moment that you can recognize that it has its own way and it has its own
mechanical movement, you can also recognize that the greater body is also
ruled by the same law. No choice. And it is our body and all we can do is
surrender to it, nothing else.
Love it as our own body, all of it. Every rock, every stone, every comet, every
star, every galaxy for as far as our imagination can stretch. It is no further than
the distance from your nose to your toes. It’s just all relative. This is the
grandeur of our body. This is the magnificence of recognizing that we belong
to something. We are of it and a part of it which is why we cannot see it.
If you could be the size of a neuron in your brain, you’d be astonished at how
huge that is in there and all those lights flashing and all those stars. It’s all
relative. So there is a magic in this movement from the 46 to the 25.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 139
By the way, please understand that those things work the other way. That the
perfected form of the individual affects the flow of the community. The
perception of the priest changes the way in which the body is accepted. After
all, there are priests that tell us to cut our bodies up, to mark them, to scar
them, to cut them. There are priests that tell us that our bodies must be
whipped and punished. After all, it works the other way.
The moment that the Ego is dominating the way in which the body has to
operate instead of the other way around. The moment that the Splenic Center
is dominating the flow instead of the other way around. See, we are intended
to come out of it out of response, but these things are always going to work
both ways.
The key, always, in dealing with the Sacral Center and anything out of the
Sacral Center is not how complex and how deep we can go in understanding
them. Because you see, their real magic is expressed in action. Sacral people
are action people. It’s expressed in their action. And that the moment that
they are living out their Type and that they’re responding to the world, the
value of their actions, the quality of their actions and the effect of their
actions is self-evident. It’s the most important thing to keep in mind.
But it’s also essential to recognize that both out of the 15-5 and the 46-29, we
have very, very important processes at work and that the concept of this tantra
is to see that it is to open new possibilities for us to transcend the mundane
level and to go beyond it. Not just to be secure that the bus is going to arrive,
but to be secure in who you are as a being is much more important. It’s the
higher level of that. The animal needs to be secure. The human needs to be
aware. First help secure the animal, then go for the awareness.
And on the other side, the same thing. Without the ability to be able to honor
the beauty of the body, there’s no way to find God. There’s no way to find the
whole. It’s not possible and you can only honor that body by accepting that it
is your life and that you are a passenger, and then you can see that you are
really a part of everything. Okay, questions? If you have no questions, I’m
going to quit early.

The Stream Of Schizophrenia: Emotionalized Melancholy
Student: Is there something more you can say about the stream of
schizophrenia?
Ra: Yeah, it’s interesting to call it a stream. I would call it a stream with a dam.
Everything operating out of the individual process is subject to radical changes
and moods. Now of course we have clinical terminology for all of that. The
real power of the spiking in the emotional melancholy is when, of course, that
capacity is emotionalized. In other words that the moment that you bring a
defined Solar Plex Center together with individuality, then of course what you
have is emotionalized melancholy.
The nature of schizophrenia as it’s looked at by the medical community is
this—just on the surface, simple level—is this radical changing of mood. In
other words, what I call turning on a dime. People who look at you,—I lived
with somebody who was clinically schizophrenic and somebody who was, by
the way, individually emotional and it was an astonishing thing to experience
that. He would go along fine for days, everything would be great, and very
friendly and very warm and all kinds of things, and it would change. I actually
watched his face change. I actually watched him go through that transition in
front of me. It was horrifying to watch that. It was like out of some kind of a
bad movie, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Others Reinforce “Sickness” in the Individual
So the reality is that because individuals can go on a plateau for a long time in
their emotional process, the moment that you bring in this emotional spiking,
they can go down very, very, very quickly and very deeply. Now the moment
you have that as part of a pattern in your process, unless you understand how it
works, your condition is something that is going to be reacted to by the other
and it’s the other that turns it into schizophrenia. Please understand that.
The moment somebody sees you drop like that, is the moment that they really
think that you’re really sick, and it’s the moment that they feed you into that
sickness. In other words, they reinforce that in you. They give you a reason
why you’re spiking down like that and they give you drugs to compensate for it.
And of course you end up being a prisoner of that conditioning.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 141
The fact of the matter is that almost all individuals can appear to be
schizophrenic at any given time, truly. They can turn so easily in their mood.
And thank God that all of them aren’t being witnessed by people with a ready
pen to write prescriptions, because of course they’d all be dosed up all the time.
They would be,—give them Lithium. That’s the solution today. They give you
Lithium, and they even you out and they get rid of all of that. And they think
that they’re really doing you a lot of good when there wasn’t anything wrong
with you in the first place except they made you sick.
We Put Illness onto our Children
This is the whole thing about why I put so much emphasis on talking about
health and design. It’s not about you just being healthy yourself by living out
your Type, it’s about recognizing how much illness we put onto our children,
that we raise our children to be sick later in life, that we condition them to be
ill. This is going on all the time at all kinds of levels in the world.
It’s one of the most important tasks that we have in the ability that you have to
be able to reach out to all kinds of people and to be able to give them a clear
recognition of their nature so that they aren’t these polluting forces in the
world, distorting forces. So this whole business of the nature of being
schizophrenic, in that sense, the nature of turning quickly on moods, the nature
of dropping like a stone and all of that, it’s all natural. There’s nothing wrong
with it and there’s nothing wrong with those people.
There has never been anything wrong with me in my life because I’ve been
melancholic, but I spent a good deal of my life thinking that there was. And of
course the moment that you think that something about your nature is wrong
or unhealthy or incorrect is the moment that you really begin to eat yourself
alive. You begin to tear at yourself, you begin to blame yourself, you begin to
blame others. You go through this whole horrendous process. It’s not what
it’s about.
That was one of my resistances to esoterics and one of my resistances to
religion when I was a younger man. Because being melancholic, I realized that
nothing was ever going to alleviate my sadness. I was always going to be sad
and I saw that all of these people were pitching happiness, and it just didn’t
make any sense to me. I always assumed that couldn’t be for me. What’s that
142 Channels By Type
got to do with me. I’m not going to walk around the rest of my life smiling.
That’s not who I am.
And it’s so clear, the prejudice that we bring to,—and again individuality and
emotionality. When I mention those two things and the prejudice that comes
to children carrying those elements, you have to see that they’re incredibly
common. The individual definition is incredibly common. There’s so many
ways that that can happen.
We know the presence and power of the defined Solar Plex Center and these
are the children that are most distorted growing up. They are are the ones then
that bring those problems of their conditioning into the world. And, all of that
is simply about not understanding, being unaware, and then saying that your
children are sick.
Being a product of post-second world war being, I’ve seen so many children
put into therapy. It’s a way of life for people now. They put their kids into
institutions because they can’t get along with them. They put their kids into
institutions because they take drugs. They put their kids into institutions
because they have sex. It’s incredible what they do. And all of that out of a
complete lack of understanding of what they’re dealing with, themselves as
beings, being ignorant of their own nature, being ignorant of the nature of their
children. And then taking that whole conditioned ignorance and using it
against their very children in the deluded idea that they’re actually going to
make them better citizens, healthier citizens, better people, all that junk.
It is astonishing how many individual and emotional children and how many
children with undefined Solar Plexus who are institutionalized, who are
drugged, who are in therapy, and who are deep disappointments to their
families. It’s astonishing. And of course they bring their families down. The
whole thing is a self-fulfilling horror story. So, to be able to tell people it’s one
of things that I love so much about having so many women involved in
Human Design is so many of them are mothers and that’s the first step. They
can then turn this around and they empower their children with this knowledge
because this is what it’s all about. It’s the most important thing.
It’s not about the clients that you’re going to have because the clients you’re
going to have are going to be like yourself. They’re going to have to deal with a
difficult process and very few human beings are going to have the good fortune
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 143
that you have in your geometry to make the financial, physical, and psychic
investment to go through this process and to master this information. They’re
not. You know that.
The vast majority of the people who are going to come to you, they want to
hear something of value and go on about their business. So it’s so important—
so important—that you let them know and so important that you focus on
them understanding that it’s not just about them, but it’s about their lovers,
their families, their friends. It’s about the environments that they live in, how
much easier life can be for them. They don’t have to learn all this stuff, that’s
your job.
But they need to know and they need to understand that if they follow certain
basic patterns in their life, if they follow certain basic rules of their nature, then
life’s going to be easier for them. And it’s going to be easier and more effective
and more empowering for those people that are around them. And most
important of all, it’s going to be an enormous opportunity for their children to
grow up unfettered by negative conditioning, to grow up as healthy beings. No
other aspect of my work carries as much significance as that because of course
that’s the future.
We don’t want to keep on teaching adults Human Design for the next 100
years, give us all a break. We don’t want to do that. We want to make sure that
as quickly as we can, that this knowledge is institutionalized for children so that
they can know that. So that the work is informing them and teaching them so
that we can have a better society as a net result, that we can have a deeper
spirituality in the world as a direct result, that we can all share in the glory of
having the same body and not get lost in the diversity that leads to prejudice
and competitiveness and violence. And that’s all about children, that’s all about
teaching.
So much of this stuff that I explained to you is so difficult, because of course
the conditioning is already so deep and the years that it takes to be able to
overcome that. I know a lot of Generators, and I don’t know a lot of
Generators who live their Type. I know a lot of Manifestors, and I don’t know
a lot of Manifestors who live their Type. I know a lot of Projectors, and I
don’t know a lot of Projectors who live their Type and so forth and so on. I
know it takes time and I know it’s not easy for any adult. It isn’t. That’s why at
144 Channels By Type
this point in the development of Human Design in the world, it’s time to give
people the simplest possible tools to be able to awaken their potential.
I always teach you that no matter how deep I take you and no matter how
complex this knowledge, you always got to come back to the surface for those
that you serve. And you can only serve them well by serving them on the
surface, by teaching them the very basics that they need to have to be able to
live out their Type and enter into the experiment.
This is the revolutionary work that’s in front of you. It’s not just that relief for
them. Remember, you have to give them tools to work with. You have to give
them a way that they can access their nature just as I’ve given those tools to
you. You have to come to the point of seeing that the simplest level for them
is to get them involved as soon as possible. And when you’re dealing with
parents never forget to remind them of the impact on their children, because
the moment that you mention it and the moment that you can describe it is the
moment that they’re interested in having the charts of their children done. It’s
very important. It’s very important.
In the last month or so while I’ve been on tour, I’ve had a couple of situations
in which people familiar with Design have asked me to do the readings of their
parents. Now, I want to tell you that is such a trip. I mean that is such a trip.
As an adult to actually finally see clearly and understand what happened to you
as a sibling, what happened to you as a child, what happened to you in that
environment, what was going on between them, why did things work the way
they did, so you understand the conditioning.
It’s so important to see that the family aura is a manifesting aura. The family
aura has to be dealt with. The moment that somebody comes to you and you
give them their Type, you’re sending them back into the conditioned field.
They have to learn to see what that field is. Eventually they have to learn to
recognize that.
Mothers are astonishingly open to having the design of their children done.
Thank goodness for that. So remind them of it and make sure that that
opportunity is there and you can offer it to them. Don’t let them get away
without you telling them how important that is. As an analyst, it’s to your
advantage materially and otherwise. You want as many people to take
advantage of your skills. But it’s so important that you don’t allow an adult that
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 145
has children to leave your aura without you reminding them how important it is
for them to know their children in this way so that they can help support them.
No parent that loves their children is going to walk away from that opportunity
and it’s so important to get that information across. There is so much built up
animosity and problems between parents and children. It’s the oldest piece of
business that we all have. And most human beings go through years and years
and years of blaming their parents. Years and years and years of that tension in
their lives.
The most important thing for me in my own process was that Human Design
allowed me to accept what it is to be a father, what it is to be a son, what it is to
be a lover. I’ve learned to really see what it is, what the limitation is, how I’m
conditioned, how I condition the other. In that way, you have relationships
that are healthy and you can give up this business of blame and shame and guilt
and finger pointing. They didn’t know any better. They didn’t know any
better.
The most dangerous people on Earth are the ones with good intentions. It’s so
true. I’ve learnt that. It’s such a wonderful cliché. The road to hell is paved
with good intentions. Well, it’s true. All these therapists, psychologists, all
these Florence Nightingales of the world, all of these dedicated parents who
have no idea who they are and are doing such damage in their caring. It’s our
job to alleviate that, to eliminate that. One more question.
More than One Channel between Centers
Student: I’ve heard you say when someone has more than one format they
might get more sick.
Ra: Yes. Yes, that’s right. Any kind of multiplicity of channels between
centers always creates problems. So, for example, if you have somebody that
has the 17-62 and the 43-23, or somebody that has the 31-7 and the 8-1, or
somebody that has the 28-38 and the 32-54; in other words, the moment that
you have channels duplicated between centers you already have a problem. It’s
much more difficult for the processing to take place.
If you’re somebody that has both logic and individuality in the mind, though
they have some kind of relationship to each other, they operate very differently.
146 Channels By Type
And it means in order to be clear in your own conceptualization will take a very
long time in life because you have to find the common ground between the
two. It becomes very difficult in that sense.
So when you have format energy and you have somebody that has two of the
formats, it’s not so much that it brings more disease. It brings more
complicated disease and that’s really what it’s about. You can take the dry
disease of the 52-9 and you can make it hot and cold with the 3-60. In other
words, you add on complications to the way in which both the disease operates
and the way in which it can finally be cured.
Human Design and Hahnemann’s Homeopathy
My description, by the way, of these three processes in the format energy about
the way disease operates, this is about the relationship between Human Design
and Hahnemann’s homeopathy. In homeopathy, these are the three processes.
These are the three ways of illness and healing, and these three ways of illness
and healing are there in the format. So the moment that you have complexity
of formats, you have a complexity of condition.
You can have many more side effects; you can have a much longer process of
being able to recuperate from the disease so it adds complexity to it. And of
course the secret to that is operate according to your Type and then you’re only
going to get those things that that specific design is meant for. In other words,
yes, it’ll be a more complicated illness, but yes, you’re designed to deal with that
complicated illness. As long as it’s not the not-self disease, then it’s not going
to turn into a great problem but otherwise it does. It is a complexity.
Martin Grassinger in Hamburg, the homeopath that I’ve worked with for many
years, in his practice he has seen clearly over the years that multiple formats
have much more complicated problems. Their physical problems are much
more complicated and he can’t use a simple homeopathic approach that he
could have used if he was just dealing with one format. In other words, there’s
a whole different strategy that has to come into effect in order to be able to
deal with the disease.
Gates in an Undefined Center
Student: Are formats created or associated with miasms?
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 147
Ra: Yes, yes of course they are.
Student: So you’re talking about where the channels are, when people have
gates that are in those channels that are not in the defined center. For example,
if somebody has a Sacral gate, does that gate in the Sacral Center need to
respond? And the only way it gets activated is by having a harmonic so if a
person isn’t a Generator Type…
Ra: Right. Okay. So if you’re not a Generator Type and you have an aspect in
the Sacral Center, obviously that aspect in the Sacral Center, first of all, is only
going to operate when the Sacral Center is defined. That’s number one. So
that’s either going to come from whatever electromagnetic, compromises,
another person, or come from the program.
Now of course what that does mean is that that aspect can only come out
through response, but that response is always conditioned. In other words, it’s
not something that you can ever trust or rely on, but it is something you can
take advantage of.
So, for example, if you have the 5th gate in an undefined Sacral Center, the
opportunities of the Sacral Center being defined are opportunities to see your
rhythm or see your pattern that aren’t necessarily there because when the Sacral
isn’t defined, you don’t know you have natural habits. So you can take
advantage of the Sacral being defined, respond to a situation in which you see
that that can be a very good habit or pattern for you and hold on to it later
after the transit is gone.
In other words, you can take advantage of that, but again it would have to
come out of a response. But the most important thing about that is that no
matter what the transit is, if you have the 5th gate in the Sacral and you are a
Projector, you have to be invited to have your Sacral connected in order for
you to respond to that aspect in your nature. In other words, you’re still going
to have to go through it through your Type in order to get access to it.
We can take advantage of any thematic that is in a center as long as we don’t
identify or give it authority in our life. If you have the 5 in an undefined Sacral,
you may find that the ritual or habit is interesting, that you learn through that
being defined, but you don’t have to hold on to it. You don’t have to keep it as
your ritual for life. That would not be natural for you because, after all, the way
148 Channels By Type
in which that 5 is going to work is going to be inconsistent. But you can take
advantage of it as long as that pattern does work for you.
So many people with the 5 in an undefined center will suddenly do aerobics
every morning, because they’re getting their Sacral defined. And the person
they do aerobics with is always defining their Sacral, taking them there. And
then of course that person breaks their leg. That ritual doesn’t work anymore.
Their Sacral isn’t being conditioned. They can’t take advantage of that ritual at
that time and when the phone call doesn’t come, they just ignore it. They don’t
go on their own, necessarily. They can. It’s possible. But they don’t
necessarily go. In other words, they can take advantage of the conditioning,
but at the same time, the conditioning is not something that is a law for them.
They can never trust it because it’s not truly who they are.
And of course, from your earliest training in design you know how
uncomfortable that can be if that’s your Sun or your Earth or the Nodes.
Where there’s an aspect of your nature always waiting to be conditioned by
somebody else. And even though you can take advantage of having your Sun
light lit, you can never trust what it shines on—never. The only thing you can
trust is the authority and the Type that you have in order to guide you correctly
to those opportunities to have your Sun’s light conditioned and opened up.
And now my Sun’s light is closing down.

Formats Present in Relationships
I just want to give you a couple of examples of what actually happens in Design
when format energies are involved, and what happens in relationships when
format energies are involved.
In discussing the formats yesterday, I hope that I was strong enough in
influencing you to pay close attention to the presence of a defined format in
anybody’s design and to recognize that it has a deep effect on the way in which
that design is going to operate.
One of the most complicated things that happens in relationships is when
formats become part of the relationship. There are very often situations in
which the presence of a format, as a result of the relationship and
electromagnetic—and we’ll take a look at that—or the changing of format
where there’s already format potential. This is one of the most common
things. It really has a deep impact on any kind of bond that you have with the
other, whether that’s going to be a lover, or a friend, or in business, or your
children. I really want you to pay attention to the presence of format.
Examples of Partnerships with Formats
Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier
So the moment you’re looking at potential format energy within yourself, pay
close attention to the activations
Grace Kelly that you have as potential
formats. And recognize, for
example, if you have one, as in
the case of Grace Kelly, you’ll
look here (chart next page).
Here’s somebody that has the
53 in an undefined Root. Now
obviously the harmonic gate to
that is the 42. Yeah, she’s
rolling in her grave. Sorry,
Grace. Say good night Gracie.
I’m bad.
150 Channels By Type
This is a a triple split; it is a very, very complex design. So the 53rd gate is there
as an activation, and obviously the harmonic gate is what is going to be the
most interesting. One of the most important ways for this person to find their
conditioning, their wisdom, if you will, is that they’re going to explore that
through the Root Center being activated through that 42.
It means that for them, what is most attractive is to go through things as a
cyclical process. This is the kind of human being, that what conditioning
brings into their life is cycles, and those cycles are going to be brought by
others into the life.
And whether you’re aware of the conditioning or not, you’re still going to have
the same experience. In other words, stupid before, stupid after. You’re still
going to have the same experience. There is no way that she could ever escape
that being one of the themes of her Root. Every time that Root Center gets
defined, those themes are activated.
That’s something always to recognize when you’re looking at somebody’s chart.
You’ve seen an undefined center. Look at the activations in that undefined
center and recognize clearly that every time that center gets defined, those
themes are the themes that dominate, and those are the themes that become
consistent for the person who has them.
In other words, my 49 in the undefined Solar Plex, that being my only gate
activation, it is always about acceptance or rejection and there is no other way
for me to experience emotions, even when people bring me other possibilities.
The fact is it’s my only activation in the Solar Plex and therefore is the only
consistent emotional theme I will have all my life.
So, when you’re looking at that Root, there are two things in that Root—the 39
and the 53. Any activation of that Root, turning that Root into a defined
center, automatically those themes are active and over a lifetime that is the
consistent way in which her adrenaline will operate. So she’s going to provoke
people by going through cycles—the 39-53. She’s going to provoke people by
wanting to start new beginnings, the 39 to the 53. That’s what she is designed
for.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 151
And then, you have Prince Rainier. So think about what that means to you as
a being. This is not about how
Prince Rainier many electromagnetics you
have, whether it’s a single or a
split in the relationship, whether
it’s a 9/0, 8/1 or 7/2. This is
something even deeper in terms
of impact.
Format energies in relationships
that are not electromagnetics
always create dilemmas within
the relationships, always.
You can see that her natural
theme is to provoke through starting new cycles. That is her natural,
conditioned theme, and that’s what she’s looking for in her life.
If you don’t get what you’re looking for in your life, you don’t feel good. You
see, look at all your undefined centers. Recognize that they are looking for
completion through those centers.
That’s why the Maia is so delicious. Grace Kelly
We’re looking for that completion.
What she’s been looking for
genetically in her life is to be able
to provoke through cycles and she
doesn’t get that opportunity
because the moment that he comes
into her life, he brings the logical
format. And in bringing the logical
format, the relationship becomes
dominated by the presence of that
format and he becomes a dominant force in her life.
Now look at the nature of her design. You have an emotional Generator. It’s
the first thing to be clear about. You have somebody here who is an emotional
Generator, and the reality of being an emotional Generator is that she is here to
respond through her capacity to be a Generator, to wait for her opportunity to
152 Channels By Type
respond. And when she responds, to quantify or put conditions on that
response by saying that she needs time to be able to work things out.
The other thing is that it’s natural for her to be designed to say yes or no to
short-term cyclical processes. In other words, that’s the conditioned pressure
that’s there in the undefined Root Center and it’s healthy for her. The moment
that the 42 is there, that 42 is impacting on her direction. Is the direction in her
life going to be cyclical direction, or is she going to be focused on one
direction?
Before Rainier, she was cyclical. That is, she was an actress, she was taking
many parts. She was in many roles doing many different things. She was
constantly beginning and ending projects. So it was okay in a movie to become
a princess and a queen because the movie came to an end. The project came to
an end and a new project could begin.
But when she got into a real fairy tale, not a movie fairy tale but a real fairy tale,
she stepped into a logical format, that instead of giving her individuality and
her intimacy new cycles, which is what she’s yearning for, instead of that she’s
forced to be focused on one direction and one intimacy. And that’s what he
brings the moment he steps in there with his defined format.
Now, you can understand the anguish that can produce. The resentment that
can produce. This is not about blame or fault. This is not about saying to
Rainier, “We should surgically remove your 52-9 because it really is causing
problems.” That’s not what it’s about. But be clear that format energies
impact deeply on relationships—deeply. Format energies have a lot to do with
problems in the way in which organizations are run, have a lot to do with what
happens in small groups where a certain format dominates that can make it
very difficult for other people. Formats are very powerful.
So, it’s important to see that when you’re looking at your design and you see
that you have potential in the formats, to recognize what that potential is really
saying to you. We tend to forget, because the way in which you’re taught, so
much emphasis is placed on the definition. Because the definition itself gives
us the ability to recognize Type and authority, we put so much emphasis on the
definition without realizing, of course, that these undefined centers are where
we have to go to school in life. There’s nothing there to be avoided and an
undefined center is deeply seductive. It’s seductive.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 153
One of the things to recognize is that, particularly with the Root Center or an
undefined Sacral, where you’re looking at potentials there, to see that this is a
very powerful yearning for completion in that. It’s very powerful. That means
that the moment you’re going to get a format that is different, that it’s going to
bring problems into the relationship because it’s going to be very, very
confining.
Formats and Health
The other thing is the medical nature of it. You see, when you’re in
somebody’s aura, they change your wiring. So, for example, it is natural for me
as a 60 without the 3, that if I’m going to be ill, it’s important for me to be
conditioned in individual illness, because that’s what I’m best at. In other
words, the sudden spike. Everything is fine and then all of a sudden, I’m very
sick, and in that spike get very sick and then it’s over. But the moment that I’m
with somebody that has a logical format, I’m going to get focused on that
illness and I’m going to get deeper and deeper and deeper into it. And it’s
going to take me much longer to get out of it.
Your health gets changed by the presence of a format because it conditions the
way your body energy works. And through your body energy, what your well-
being literally is, how healthy you can be. Obviously, that all goes back to each
and every one of us living out our Type in order to be as healthy as possible.
And it does not mean that you’re here to avoid such a condition, like Grace
and Rainier.
It’s about Awareness, not Avoidance or Blame
This is not about avoidance. There is nothing in conditioning that is here to be
avoided. We have no choice. You get what you get. It is about the awareness
of it. If she was aware of that, she could see that when she was in his aura she
had to focus on his direction and focus on him and his need for intimacy. But
at the same time, she could realize that when she was not in his aura that she
could have all of those opportunities for different things and different cycles.
She could find a way to both fulfill the natural bond of their geometry and not
suffer from it, but at the same time find her own way in her own role.
None of this information is about setting up a hit list of things you don’t want
in your life. I don’t want this and I don’t want that and I don’t want them.
154 Channels By Type
You put them on your list. Forget that. You’re not in charge of that. You get
what you get. It is about the awareness that you have and at the moment you
have that awareness, you don’t have to blame the other.
That’s what happens in these relationships. What happens is that the net result
of that is blame. “It’s your fault that I cannot live an interesting life anymore.
It’s your fault that I’m stuck with having to do things this way. It’s your fault
that I have to put so much energy to be focused on doing things your way. It’s
your fault.” That creates enormous tensions and problems within the
relationship instead of seeing it’s not about blame or fault. It is the geometry,
the mechanics of somebody. And the moment you can recognize that, the
moment that you can mutually—mutually is the key—recognize and discuss
that, then you can compensate for it.
I have people who ask me about their relationships all the time. And one of
the things that is a deep truth about relationships is that it's not a matter of
Design, it’s a matter of awareness. I will tell you clearly that if you have a
relationship that is not a single definition, you've got problems. And if you
have a relationship in which there are more than two centers open, you've got
problems. But even though those things are technically, mechanically, difficult
to overcome, they can be overcome through awareness. You can have difficult
relationships work, but then both partners have to be clear and aware of the
mechanism, have to know how to share in that game together and only then
would it be possible. Out of pure ignorance it would never be possible.
Awareness is what it's all about. It's not the design. The design simply tells
you what is there and inviable. But it's whether the awareness can handle that
or not. That's really the key. So when you're dealing in a situation like this and
you're looking at the mundane relationship where people are unaware and you
see that somebody's being changed by their partner’s format, you already know
what to deal with. You already know that the one who’s being conditioned by
the format is suffering from it. One of the easiest places to eliminate
difficulties in relationships is to make clear that the presence of a format is
something very powerful. It changes the frequency of the relationship and it
has to be dealt with.
So don't treat format energies as something that's sort of like everything else.
Pay attention to it. It's like paying attention to a defined or undefined Solar
Plex, or whether somebody can manifest or not, or what their Type or
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 155
whatever. It’s always important for you to pay attention to the presence of a
format energy or its potential.
If you're somebody that has the full format in your design, you have to
recognize your impact on the other. Again, this is one of those things for all of
us to pay attention with this little mantra of mine: let your aura do the talking.
Let your aura do the talking. To see what it is for you to put your Throat into
somebody, your Ego into somebody, your emotions into somebody, and
recognize what it means to put a format into somebody. You change their
whole frequency.
Where Obsession Comes From
You can have somebody who’s incredibly abstract, 35-36, racing around the
wheel on experiences, flying into this and that, going up and down and up and
down, and then all of a sudden somebody steps into their life with a logical
format and they’re stuck in one thing. This is where obsession comes from.
The 30th gate can be a gate of obsession, clinging fire, because it recognizes a
feeling. It is the source of recognizing that feeling, but it can get very, very
fixed there through a logical format. You can get focused and concentrated on
that feeling. It becomes obsession. And the moment that the format is pulled
away and it shifts over to the abstract format, the obsession is gone. You go
through the experience, drop off the end of the table and it's over. So format
energy brings the potential for radical change in somebody's frequency, which
can come out as a real change in their behavior. That's what it's really all about.
This is when the real incredible nature of the electromagnetic is evident
because only in format energies are electromagnetics really magnificent.
Remember that the nature of a format is that it is a dynamic. It brings a
dynamic between what we call love and hate, but basically that is a deep
stimulating factor in any kind of relationship.
Paul McCartney and John Lennon’s Partnership
But, here is the electromagnetic meeting in this channel (53/42) and at the
moment that you have that, what you have is a relationship rooted in a
frequency of cycles. And everything about the two of them together,
everything about them together being a Manifesting Emotional Generator,
156 Channels By Type
because that’s what they are together, is conditioned by that format. Cyclical,
experiential, try this, try that. Their music was evident of that. In other words,
going through very, very quick cycles. Each one a transition in the nature of
how they presented themselves and their art. It was the nature of that.
Paul McCartney John Lennon
And you can see very clearly here, Paul McCartney had the 42. He’s the one
who was given the responsibility for ending the cycle. John Lennon, the 53,
was very proud of the fact that he picked McCartney and let him come in. He
started the cycle and together they went through the quantum of that. The
quantum of that allowing that format to condition the nature of their work and
art together. Because, of course, together they were deeply creative.
You can see the number of creative channels present. The 35-36, the
experiential; the 16-48 that comes as an electromagnetic; the 59 going across to
the 6. In other words, there is all this fertile creativity inherent in that
relationship and all of that creativity being conditioned by that format.
So it was clear that at some point all of that was going to come to an end. It
just was. And at the same time you can see how it conditioned their nature.
Separately they would be very different, but they would always end up coming
back to the same things because both of them would look for that format in
their lives; essential for them.
I have threes all over the place in my life for my 60. And my new son is a 3-60.
So, the gods are kind. They bring me the right format for my process. But it’s
very important that if you have activation in these format channels to really pay
attention to that. To really see what kind of an impact that has.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 157
How the Individual Format Changes the Collective
The other thing is that when you’re dealing with the individual format, you can
see that it will change the way in which the collective operates. One of the
easiest ways to mutate the collective is to bring them into the mutative pulse.
And 3-60s can be very powerful at changing the way in which the collective
functions because they do that with the presence of that format. You know
how they do it? I’ll tell you a secret, they depress the hell out of them. Well,
it’s true.
You’ve got a collective person, they’re either ready for their cycle or ready to be
focused. And then the individual comes along and says, “No, no, no, first you
have to be really sad,” and the collective goes bananas. And if they don’t
accept the presence of that sadness, they don’t get its beauty or its creativity,
and out of that doesn’t come the mutation. So what the individual format does
to the collective can be quite disturbing to the collective.
Mutative 3-60 Babies — One of the Last Fertile
Generations
We just went through, as I said, about six months ago the presence of the 3-60
and the recognition that you have a huge generation. It lasted quite a while.
(Ed. Note: for approximately 8 months from May 30, 1998 to January 25, 1999.) You
had Saturn in the third gate, Neptune in the 60; that’s quite a combination.
There are probably a hundred million children in the world right now and only
about forty million of them will survive long enough. But there are a lot of
them in the world right now that are carrying this energy. And the fact is that
they are going to bring deep mutation into the middle of the next century.
Again, one of the most exciting things for me personally in watching the
program and in watching how the energy moves is to recognize day-by-day
moment-by-moment that you have these generations that are coming into the
world and you can see them. You can see them. You can see what they’re
going to be. Look at the design of today. Look at it as if it was a human’s
design with the 88 degrees. You can see who these people are going to be in
the future, what this generation is going to carry (the channel 3/60). And so
we know that there is going to be a huge mutative process taking place in the
next century and that every one of those beings—all those freaks, Neptunian,
Saturnian freaks—carrying a mutative format impacting on the whole collective
around them.
158 Channels By Type
One of the things about the next cycle as we enter into it in 2027 is to
recognize that it’s not necessarily going to be pleasant. It’s going to be quite a
sad time. We’re going to have a lot of sad energy around because we have a
whole generation that’s going to instill it in others, and at the same time open
up the possibility for vast mutation because those babies are everywhere.
They’re in every nook and cranny. They’re in every neighborhood. They’re all
over the planet and these babies are growing up and they’re all carrying that 3-
60 and they’re all going to have a mutative impact on the world around them.
They already are doing that by being in the world, already. That’s the magic of
seeing the program work and it’s the magic of understanding the nature of a
format.
It says to you that we have a huge moody field that’s entered into the
consciousness of the world. It’s here among us now. It’s growing and it’s here
among us and it’s something for us all to be clear about. We are now in a time
of available mutation at a level that’s never existed before—never. I mean
never existed as far as our ability to understand how these things work and to
be able to actually time them.
So, we’ve got this whole generation that’s come into the world and remember
the nature of aura. All these babies, they’re all little babies. Their auras do the
talking. What my little baby’s aura did to my life. Whoa, what a 3-60 brings—
whoa. And that baby doesn’t have to be able to do anything other than to be
alive and that aura does the talking and it has a deep mutative impact. He’s a
signpost for me. When he came into the world, his impact on me and my life
showed me where things had to go. It’s a time for mutation. It’s a time clearly
that humanity is more open to mutation because of the presence of all of these
babies. Bless them.
So I know that we’re in a time now where deep impact can take place at the
collective level just because of the presence of this format. So while all of this
potential for deep mutation is now in the world and alive all over the planet,
we’ve got Pluto and the 9th gate going, “Alright, now let’s focus on the
practical. We focus on the practical and we link up that with the mutative, and
we’re going to see what is new and practical, or new and improved.” It’s a time
for new and improved.
It also means that because the 3-60 is present in the world, we’re going to have
an outbreak of diseases unlike we’ve ever seen before, and that’s probably
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 159
something that is a regular cycle. But what you’re going to have is a mutative
field which means that if you look at the design of a living cell, the design of a
living cell is a 15-5 with the third gate. And the third gate is a trans- or cross-
speciel gate that opens up to the potential 60. In other words, all cells are open
to mutation—all cells.
I’ve been telling you that in 2027 that we’re going to
have a new generation of children who will be born
with the potential of true emotional awareness. You
have to see that their parents were just born—they
were just born. These babies that carry the 60 and the
3, they’re the ones that carry the mutation of the cell.
They’re the ones that are going to bring the possibility
of the genetic mutation that will actually be lived out
by their children as a true mutation in their being. So we have a very important
generation that’s just come into the world and they’re one of the last
generations that we’re going to have that are truly fertile. So they’re a very
important generation.
And they will bring this mutative capacity, create the mutative environment, so
that specific mutations can take place on one side, the positive side; the
mutation of the emotional system. On the other side you’re going to have the
mutation of those things that are dangerous to us—mutations within the cell
that will lead to different kinds of diseases. What we call retroviruses that are
now the greatest enemy to human beings, and retroviruses are becoming more
and more complex because they have a multiplicity of genes.
They have the capacity of evolving very quickly. And so what we’re looking at
with this mutative field opening up, we’re looking at two phenomena coming in
at the same time. Always the binary, always the duality. The miracle of the
genetic change in the Solar Plex in the 55th gate, that can open up this whole
field of consciousness, but at the same time, devastating mutations in terms of
the human body.
If you live out your Type, and hopefully 30 years from now, 40 years from
now, there will be an awful lot of more people living out their Type than there
are now. That living out your Type is something that will be inherently
protective. But you see, by following the information of the program, by
understanding the nature of a gate and the way it works, by understanding the
160 Channels By Type
lines, you’re also able to, like any great seer, look into the future and see what
the future is going to hold and to recognize that that future is created every
moment.
We’re part of a continuum, and recognize that we’re part of a continuum.
Everybody likes to believe in incarnation—watch the continuum. And in
recognizing that continuum and watching the program as it operates through
the birth of children,—because this afternoon all we’re going to look at is this
deep Sacral drive for us to be reproductive and nurturing. That as these
children are coming into the world, they set the field of the program. They’re
the living program of any moment. They carry it. They carry each day, like I
carry the day and the program of my birth, like all of the people of my
generation. And that had somebody been alive at that time who had the
knowledge they had, they would have been able to look at that and see what
we’re all in, because you can see the themes of what that brings.
And you see, it’s not about generational themes the way an astrologer can look
at it. These are specific themes within the physical mechanics of the body.
You can see how they’re going to work out.
The presence of a 3-60 definition in a whole generation. Now watch carefully
with Pluto being in the ninth gate. Watch for the transits to the 52nd gate,
because that means over Pluto’s three year span of being in the ninth gate,
there’s a scattered generation coming in and out according to transit, and
different each time because the transits may be from different planets, who will
bring that format as part of their process. You can see what’s working there,
day-by-day, moment-by-moment, each of these generations coming into the
world and impacting on the future. Every time you look at the format coming
into the world, you know that that is going to bring vast changes.
So the 3-60 is something to be concerned about. And to look around clearly.
These babies, they’re just at the cusp of whether there’ll be enough Human
Design information around to be able to help enough of them because they’re
very important to our future. They carry within them the seeds and egg of
what is going to be the final completion of our process as human beings in
these vehicles. So it’s a generation that has a great deal of importance. And if
they’re awake and their children are awake, then that positive mutation is
something that will have a very beautiful impact.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 161
I’m not a dreamer, so I tend to be rather practical in the way in which I look at
the basic nature of humanity. I know that you can never, ever get all of the
people. You can only get half, and you can only get half, half of the time. So
how that’s going to look, and how these generations are going to be met, and
how they’re going to deal with their offspring—because that’s the whole thing.
It is their children that will come into the world with the genetic mutations. So
how they will treat their children and whether they will be able to handle such
an emotional nature, that’s something that nobody can know now. That’s
something for the future to reveal. So beware format energies and have lunch.
And remember, don’t allow anything to really bang into you. This is a nice day
for waiters or waitresses to drop plates into people’s laps. Don’t let them bring
the coffee or the tea too close to you.

Tribal Circuitry Channels
The Defense Circuit — A Fundamental Genetic
Strategy
So we come to the close of looking at the generative channels. Where we come
to is the backbone, if you will, of our whole human experience. That is, the
thing that keeps our specie going. To be simple, remember that this is the
defense circuit and the defense circuit operates at two levels. Out of intimacy,
we are able to have reproduction, and reproduction is a fundamental defense of
the specie. It allows us to continue to exist in the world. The Channel of
Preservation, of custodianship is there on the other side to make sure that we
not only reproduce and bring new life into the world, but we condition that life
with effective nurturing so they can be strong enough to continue to exist.
So everything about the defense circuit and how it operates genetically is to be
understood as a fundamental genetic strategy for the specie. And in that sense,
it’s often very difficult for the individual, given their individual perspective and
given the way minds work, to be able to understand why we are in
relationships, and the kind of relationships they are, and why those
relationships are filled with problems for us.
This mechanism to reproduce and to nourish, you can see that it is pure
generation. This is a response to being in the world, to being in a body, to
being in these vehicles, and our response to that is to continue to generate life
itself.
The Two Sides of Our Sexual Process
We’ve already looked at, when we began with the creative channels, the power
of the 59-6. This power of intimacy.
Yet at the same time, the balance
always has to be seen, that the
relationship between the Sacral and
the emotional system is much more
confused and much less clear than
the relationship between the Sacral and the Spleen.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 163
These are the two sides of our sexual process. One side is governed by the
wave of the emotional system and emotional attractiveness, and it is that
emotional attractiveness that results in the reproduction. And on the other
side, the splenic system, where the source of what we call caring—the
awareness to care—is established.
So there is always to be seen this balance in the process. It is unaware of us to
have reproductive intimacy unless we can actually care for what it produces,
and that’s basically what the formula is. The difference, however, is that
because the emotional system is so much more powerful than the splenic
system—the Spleen isn’t a motor—is that we tend to be overwhelmed by the
sexual side of bonding and a price is paid at the nurturing side.
The 50-27
Well, the only way really to express that is as an absolute. The 50-27 is the
purest splenic awareness. It is the purest splenic awareness because it does
not,—the Spleen gets to the
Throat. It is not empowered,
it is projected. But the nature
of the 50-27 is that it’s always
there as a generative response
to life and this is the pure
connection between our
fundamental existential awareness, our lymphatic awareness, and the Sacral
Center.
Out of this is the purest opportunity for awareness to recognize that the
product of the Sacral has to be—has to be—properly nurtured and that
nurturing is to endow it with awareness. That’s why the 50th gate, once we
translate that to the mundane level, is a gate of the law. It’s where the values
of the tribe and how the tribe nourishes is governed.
Again, that capacity to nourish and that capacity to be trustworthy—because
there is a deep potential trustworthiness in the 50-27—is dependent on that
Type being expressed. If you have a Generator—and in this situation you can
only have a Generator or a Manifesting Generator or the emotional
164 Channels By Type
combination of those things which are always going to have a Generator—
recognize that only when it is responding can it truly nourish, can it truly care.
What often happens is 50-27s, because the aura does the talking anyway, that
other people try to latch on to their nurturing. And for all kinds of reasons,
not-self reasons, ignorant reasons, that’s allowed to take place. These people
get easily drained, and they take in a lot. Remember something, the undefined
Splenic Center is actually taking in, in a sense, less damaging conditioning than
a defined Splenic Center.
In other words, the defined Splenic Center simply doesn’t notice what it’s
dealing with, and because it doesn’t notice what it’s dealing with, that
custodian, that nurturer can suddenly be overwhelmed, suddenly realize that
they’ve been giving so much that their cupboard is bare, and they didn’t notice
that the cupboard was being emptied out at all. So without the strategy of
living out the mechanic of the Type, this can end up being something that
brings disease, sickness into that life, and sickness into the way in which the
tribe is led, the way in which the laws are established. All of that becoming
distorted.
Because of the mind field that we live in, and because the mind dominates the
world, and because it’s in mind that we decide who we want and who we don’t
want, and who we need and who we don’t need, that we have an ongoing
struggle with our defense circuitry. It doesn’t care about what your mind
thinks is good for it or not. It doesn’t care whether you want the person or
not.
It’s a mechanical thing and it’s a genetic strategy. And you’re only going to
respond in the defense circuit when that genetic strategy is properly met,
because otherwise your genes aren’t going to turn you on, and if they don’t turn
you on, it isn’t going to happen. And so we end up in our mental lives having
all kinds of difficulty in our relationships.
To accept the mechanical nature of what you are and to live out your Type
means that you do get the relationships that belong to you. It’s the most
important thing of all. It’s very difficult. There are some things in the
experiment of living out your design and living out your Type that are easy.
There are some things that are difficult.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 165
The most difficult is when it comes to love, because the mind, in and of itself,
is always the factor that is dominating that. It’s always the one that is trying to
control the situation. And to live out one’s Type when one’s mind is telling
you something can be exceedingly difficult. And yet it’s the only place where
you really get the deepest reward. That is the reward of having the right kind
of energy in your life, the reward of having the right kind of behavior that helps
you stay yourself.
So I want to give you an insight into the nature of the tribe and how the tribe
needs to care, and the importance, particularly, of these gates in the defense
circuit. There are two gates in the BodyGraph that have specific and essential
functions. I’ve already given you a deeper insight into the importance of
format energy and what format energy does in Design. Many of you know
about the nature of being able to profile, to be able to look at the lines of the
Sun-Earth in order to be able to see the nature of somebody’s incarnative
purpose.
The Eight Profiling Gates
Those of you that are interested in understanding the nature of lines—and it’s
something that I’ve recommended for a long time—is that you have to look at
the eight profiling gates, and the eight profiling gates line-by-line. If you look
at the lines in sequence with each other, the eight profiling gates give you the
deepest possible insight, at a larger level, into somebody’s purpose. (Ed. Note:
A table with the profiling gates is in the Library at the end of this book.)
Now those gates are the four gates in the Self—that’s the 10, the 7, the 1, and
the 13. These are the four role gates of the Self. And then there are four
gates that are profiling gates. Two of them are role gates, the 59 and the 27.
There are six role gates altogether. And two of them, the 50 and the 6, are the
harmonic gates to these genetic role gates and they carry a very specific
function.
The 6th and 50th Gates — Harmonics to the Genetic Role
Gates
It is through the 6th gate that the wave of the emotional system is generated.
And when I say through the 6th gate that the wave is generated, not only is the
wave generated, but it’s broken up into its three variations. In other words,
166 Channels By Type
within the 6th gate is a complexity of waves and out of that 6 comes all of those
variations.
Gate 50 — The Guardian
Here we’re looking at the 50th gate and you can see that the keynote for this
gate is not a keynote that you’re normally familiar with. This is the gate of the
guardian. This is in the language of these illustrations, from the courses on
human sexuality and Human Design. And there are different keynotes
depending on what subject you’re looking at in Human Design. That is the
depth of the way in which the logic operates. So here you’re dealing with the
gate of the guardian.
What’s important for you to look at is the way in which the lines are structured.
You see, the 50th gate is where the frequency of awareness is initiated. Just like
the 6th gate is where the motor wave of the emotional system is, the 50th gate is
where the awareness frequency is initiated.
For us, that awareness frequency is broken up into three different parts and
those three different parts follow an order. So you will notice by the keynotes
that are being used that you’ll be able to see their relationship to circuitry.
Line Circuitry Keynotes
So, for example, here you can see
Line Circuitry Keynotes
that the 1st and 2nd lines are
instinctive in nature. In other
Lines 5-6: Taste, Collective Logic
words, this is tribal. And when you
Lines 3-4: Intuition, Individual & Mutative
have the 3rd and 4th lines, which are
Lines 1-2: Instinctive, Tribal
rooted in the keynote of intuition,
these are thematically individual
and mutative. Remember, I told you earlier how third and fourth lines are
inherently mutative, particularly the third line. And then when you get to the
5th and 6th lines, you get to the circuit of logic in the collective process and you
have the keynote of taste.
The moment you look deeply into the structure of both the 50 and the 6, you
get to see that out of this Channel of Preservation and custodianship is the real
framework out of which not only does our awareness get focused on the Sacral,
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 167
but that our emotional, sexual life gets
focused on the Sacral. In other words, that
regeneration becomes the theme. And that
the regeneration of the human spirit, the
capacity of being able to create a vehicle for
us, that that has to come by the fusion of the emotional field and the awareness
field.
In other words, when I talk to you about awareness in form, the defense circuit
is the symbol of this. The form is created on the emotional, sexual side. And
the awareness to endow that form comes from the Splenic-Sacral side, and you
can see the magic of what it is. It’s this meeting together of the new form
endowed with awareness. So the 50th gate and the 6th gate take on much greater
significance when you understand them with that kind of perspective.
(cid:1)
168 Channels By Type
Understanding the Formula of Lines
Let’s take a look for a moment at the nature of the way in which these lines
operate as themes. Because the moment that you’re looking at any knowledge
in Human Design, you have to see that if you understand lines and you have
enough keynotes to work with related to any line, you understand everything in
the formula. It’s a formula, and in genetic continuity, that formula is there in
everything.
The First Line — Awareness of Strengths-
Weaknesses
Emotional Wave of Weakness-Strength
So think about it this way, here’s the first line. This is the foundation of
awareness. First lines are always foundations, so here’s the foundation of
awareness. The foundation of awareness is the instinct for strength-
weakness.
If you go to the 7th hexagram, the first line, you’ll find the authoritarian. You
will see strength and weakness if you look at all the first lines. Every first line
you look at operates out of this awareness theme of strength and weakness.
This is the 6th gate on the other side. And in
the 6th gate on the other side, in this context,
it is the gate of the builder—the builder of
the form. In our biology, the 6th gate is
related to our pH so it creates the
boundaries for us and it can open them or close them.
But it’s also very important to see that in this gate of the builder what you have
are the various emotional waves. You can see that in the same way that the
first and second line waves are basically tribal, and they’re basically there to
operate out of the tribal stream of sensitivity. This is the source of the tribal
stream of sensitivity, where the third and fourth lines are the source of the
stream of emoting, and the fifth and sixth lines are the source of the stream of
desire, and that these waves have themes.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 169
So the first line wave is a wave of weakness and strength. Now think about
what that means. You go up on your wave, you feel strong. You go down on
your wave, you feel weak. It’s a weakness-strength wave. What that means is
that if you look at any first line, anywhere, somebody’s chart, in the ephemeris,
in the program, if you look at any first line, those are its two basic themes, and
that theme all comes together in weakness and strength. That’s why the first
line is a foundation. It’s the basis of everything.
So when you get to the genetic strategy of the 59.1, you get to the
caveman/cavewoman. The strong take the weak. And we’re designed to have
the strong take the weak because that’s the basis of all things.
So, on the sexual side, the strong ones take in the weak ones. The very fixed
ones take in the very open ones. It’s the way we were designed. We’re
designed that way because if the strong only made it with the strong, then we
would have a very weakened genetic pool, because the weak would have to
bond with the weak. So we’re designed to have, as the foundation of intimacy,
that the strong take the weak.
And on the other side, on the caring side, the strong nurture the weak. Because
if the strong only cared for the strong, then only the weak will care for the
weak. Ask anybody who’s poor and they’ll tell you that only the poor care for
the poor. There’s something wrong in the foundation.
See, we have these themes and they don’t just stop at any given place. This is
the genetic continuity. And think about what that means if your Sun and Earth
carry a first line theme, because it means that that is the awareness and
emotional fields that it’s most comfortable with, most natural with, and will be
most effective with. It becomes a theme for them and they’re always attuned
to it.
I have 10 first lines in my design and I’m a 5/1 profile and I love first line days.
They’re just great. But this is the nature of being able to see that the genetic
continuity is moving through everything.

The Second Line — Awareness of Determination
or Not
Emotional Wave of Advance-Withdrawal
So we come to the second line which is about being called. It’s a line of
projection. And when you’re looking at it emotionally, this is the wave of
advance and withdrawal. Now, second lines are traditionally in withdrawal
until somebody advances, and they can always advance out of their withdrawal.
But it’s the wave and it’s emotional and it’s tribal. So you know that it goes
from withdrawal to advance. It’ll withdraw when it’s down, it’ll advance when
it’s up, or vice versa. And then you can see the awareness that matches that.
So look at every second line that you have and recognize that every second line
you have goes through phases.
You may not have it, and you’re going to get it from the world any way. In
other words, we’re always in the program. But you think about the second
lines that you have and that second line is always operating in a theme of
withdrawal to advance, and that theme is rooted in an instinct of whether to be
determined or not.
Now remember, second lines love to be left alone. “Should I be determined in
being left alone and be withdrawn, or should I advance?” That’s only
dependent on when they are called; they have to be called. When they are
called, they have that instinct, that instinct to respond in the moment and to
recognize whether they can be determined or not, determined in their
withdrawal or not; determined in their advance or not. But that’s the awareness
that guides every second line.
When you hit a second line day, that’s what’s at work in the frequency in the
wave. One of the jokes for me is I love newspapers. I love newspapers
because if you look at the ephemeris and you read the daily newspaper,— by
the way, you have to read the newspaper the day after the design for it because
you’re always getting the news late. So don’t get caught in looking at the
ephemeris for the day and what comes out of the newspaper that day. In other
words, look at the ephemeris and then look at the next day’s newspaper. And
then you get to see how all of these patterns are operating, particularly in this
age of live, interactive communication where you can watch people make
statements on given days. If you look at that, you can see what kind of
awareness is dominating.

The Third Line — Awareness of Partnership-
Dependency
So by the time we get here to the third line, we get into the mutative phase.
And as we know, this is the awareness frequency of today. The general
frequency operating through the 42.3, 32.3. The general frequency today is
intuition. And it is mutative. It is open to mutation. It’s open to trial and
error. It’s open to being banged into. And in that openness is an intuition for
partnership dependency.
Emotional Wave of Allegiance - Rejection
You see, the third line doesn’t know that there’s anybody out there, so they
really do not know their value in any kind of social context. So they do not
know whether they enter into partnership or they enter into dependency; they
do not know. And of course it all happens by surprise because it’s something
that has to bang into them, and emotionally the wave at the other end is the
wave of allegiance-rejection.
Now, it’s very important to understand the third line themes. If you’ve got a
third line personality, or you have a third line unconscious Sun-Earth, then you
have to see that there is inherent instability in your relationships. Are they
partnerships or dependencies? That’s what you’re concerned about at the
awareness level. Every third line says, “Am I dependent? Or am I a partner?”
when it’s looking at anything. And on the other side of that is this emotional
wave of allegiance and rejection.
Unless the awareness is clear, if it’s dependency, then the emotional wave can
lead to rejection. If it’s partnership, then the emotional wave can lead to
allegiance. Now one of the curiosities of our time is to have had the Uranus,
Neptune, Pluto transits of the 59 and the 6 so that all of these variations are
alive today in the world, and they have brought the greatest instability and the
highest divorce rate in the history of humanity. Because the moment you look
at Pluto stepping into the third line of the 59-6, you look at the real breakdown
and disruption of relationships.
Remember, genetically, the third line there is there for a reason. This is the
first truly individual line, and as such, has to be there to be able to provide
genetic mutation. So much of third line relationships, you bump into
172 Channels By Type
somebody, you have a one night stand, you get pregnant. That genetic
material, that intimacy, was only for the genetic material. That “mistake” that
took place that allowed that unusual genetic mix to come into the world, under
ordinary circumstances, given other kinds of criteria for a relationship, never
would have happened.
The abundance of third line and the fact that we have had a vast population
increase in the last 150 years means that there’s been an enormous mixing of
genetic material. This is the most cross-tribal genetic material that we have
ever had as species, and all of that is a deep by-product of the combination of
those transits through the 59-6 and the jet age. It has to do with the place and
the cycle of time. 256 years ago when Pluto was there in the 59-6, a different
movie.
It wasn’t like you were going to get out of your village for the week and go
down to the Riviera to meet somebody. Things were locked into the tribal
matrix. So our twentieth century, third line intimacy has produced all kinds of
very unusual genetic material.
It’s a sign that things are coming to an end. I mean the end in the sense of a
cycle. The fact of the matter is that if you look at the development of a human
being and you look at the development of the human baby, and you look at
how the neurons are developed in the brain, you can see that there’s a vast rush
to expand neural development in the first year or so, and then there’s a culling
back. In other words, there’s this attempt to go out in many, many directions
to see what’s possible, and then by exploring as many directions as possible,
recognizing out of that what will work. Now that’s an evolutionary principle.
One of the greatest risks to the world being able to feed itself is that for many
years, the vast agro complexes had been using cloned variations of corn. And
the fact of the matter is that you can go across a field that might have a billion
ears of corn and they’re all the same. In other words, they’re clones. Now they
developed the clone in order to be able to develop a perfect and reliable
consumer product.
But when you only have one variation of something, you’re in real danger
because the moment that something comes along that isn’t part of the logical
pattern, that clone is only going to work if the pattern remains cloned, and it
doesn’t. The pattern grows and changes. All of a sudden there’s a mutation.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 173
All of a sudden all that corn can disappear overnight. And you won’t have any
of them survive because if it can kill one, it can kill all of them because they’re
the same. Now this is the advantage of genetic diversity.
So right now you have a movement going on. It’s been going on for about ten
years in which all kinds of traditional corns, their seeds, are being gathered,
particularly from South America, so that we can replenish the corn stock and
develop new types. Right now the commercial corn in use could actually be
wiped out by anything truly mutative that came along.
So the advantage that we have coming into an age in which we expand the
genetic pool is that by stepping outside of our tribal standards, by stepping
outside of our blood types, by stepping outside of our racial types, what we end
up doing is creating new combinations that may be exactly what’s necessary for
the future. So out of this vast population expansion, what’s going on is that
natural selection is taking place. The vaster the selection, the easier it is for
humanity to have the necessary tools to survive.
One of the most interesting discoveries in AIDS research has been direct
evidence that families that survive the Black Death in Europe, the bubonic
plague, that they carried within them a mutation that led to those very rare
people—about 12% of the population who are descendants of white
Europeans—who have a built-in immunity to AIDS. In other words, the
moment you have enough diversity, then there is always going to be the
possible advantage in that diversity to be able to survive something that others
simply cannot survive. This is the gift of our species staying alive.
So this diversity for us is inherent in the third line. It’s not like it’s a mistake
that it’s there—this trial and error. It’s an intentional mistake. It’s like, “Yes,
yes, I know it’s going to be difficult, but we’d like to see what black and blue
looks like together.” It really is designed for that. And of course that makes it
very disturbing for people who carry within them very powerful third line
themes.
Allegiance and rejection is their natural wave—it’s their natural wave. This is
all operating under the laws of bonds made and broken, and made and broken,
and made and broken, and made and broken. You see, most people think that
when you say bonds made and broken that the broken is the end. It’s not. It’s
bonds made and broken, made and broken, made and broken. So you can go
174 Channels By Type
through that with the same person, bonds made and broken, made and broken,
made and broken, or you can leave that person every time and get another one,
bonds made and broken.
When it’s really healthy is when you keep on making the bond and breaking the
bond and making the bond and breaking the bond and making the bond and
breaking the bond, then it works. And it’s one of those things for that
generation, and particularly those who carry third line aspects, to recognize that
they can have healthy, long-lasting, valuable and beautiful relationships. Just
because they need to break the bond doesn’t mean they can’t make it again.
This has to do with the recognition of the need for lifestyle and how to find the
right kind of style in order to be able to live as a third line person. It means
that if you have somebody in your life that you love, that’s somebody that can’t
be in your life all the time. You have to have your own space, you have to be
able to go your own way, and yet be able to come back. In other words, to be
able to re-embrace that. To be able to have the honeymoon each time you
make the bond. And then to be able to be free to break the bond in order to
be able to make the bond again.
Anybody who carries a third line theme, if you don’t have that in your life and
that’s an essential theme, it’s very important for you. So you have to see that
you need to have your space. You need to be able to break bonds with things,
but it doesn’t mean that you cannot return to them. And all of this breakup in
relationships and the distortion that it’s brought to a whole generation of
children to be the by-product of all kinds of broken families, that’s something
that certainly could have been alleviated if people understood the nature of
how a third line really operates.
It’s not somebody’s fault that they need to break their allegiance with you
because they cannot feel like they’re going to be dominated for the rest of their
lives. So they need to break that allegiance. Third line people cannot be
dependent all their life. They can’t. They will accept a certain amount of
dependency and then they have to break away from that. Then they have to be
able to have their own space, have their own time, and then be able to come
back into the bond.
At the same time, they’re also designed just to break the bond. They’re also
designed to have those intimacies that are reproductive, but are not going to be
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 175
successful as relationships. That’s inherent in trial and error. It’s inherent in
this movement. Now again, that’s not a moral thing. It’s not about whether
that’s good or bad. It’s simply that it is an absolutely essential ingredient for us
to be able to have this stepping out away from the tribe. This is what this
individual line does, it steps away from the tribe and it steps into its own. It
says, “I am not going to be dominated. I’m not going to be locked in to the
tribe.”
The first and second line, because it’s not transpersonal, it’s very personal, you
can see how tribal it is. It’s all deeply enclosed into its own world. By the time
you get to the third line, even though it’s not transpersonal, it recognizes that
anything is possible. That’s why third lines have problems with relationships,
because it’s a non-transpersonal line bumping into the very personal going
through that trial and error. And because it’s not sensitive to the other, it
makes mistakes in the other that it takes into its life. Now all of that’s
eliminated if you’re living out your Type. We’re just talking about the way this
works in ignorance.
The moment you accept what it is for you mechanically to live out your Type,
you’ll see that these aspects in your nature work properly, and the most
important of them is intimacy—how to enter into your relationships correctly.
The moment you do that, whatever these aspects happen to be, they will
operate properly. If you enter into a relationship properly and you’re a third
line, the fact of the matter is that it will be natural for you and acceptable for
you and your partner to be able to ask for your space because you entered into
it properly and that’s the way you’re going to be.
The Fourth Line — Awareness of Corruption or
Not
Remember that as I go through these lines, carry that information into
everything that you think about in terms of lines. Remember it travels through
the continuity. So I’m looking at a fourth line. You look at any fourth lines
that you have and recognize that in the genetic continuity of things, the
awareness and the emotion of this fourth line is lived out through your fourth
line because that is what it resonates to and that’s the environment that it
operates best in.
176 Channels By Type
Now the fourth line is the upper trigram. It is the beginning of the
transpersonal process. And the fourth line is the line of externalization. This is
the line of the opportunist. And remember that rule of opportunism, if you
have a lover and you hate your lover don’t leave your lover until you have
another lover. If you have a job and you hate your job, don’t leave your job
until you have another job. Because if you have a lover and you hate your lover
and you leave your lover before you have another lover, it’s going to be as hard
as hell to find another lover. And if you hate your job and you quit your job
without having another job, it’s going to be very painful for you to find another
job. The rule of being an opportunist.
And the opportunism here in the fourth line is that this opportunism is ruled
by intuition and the intuition to corrupt or be corrupt or be corrupted or
not. The 50th gate is the gate of the tribal law maker. This is the Moses’ game.
You go up there and you hack all of this stuff into stone and you show it to
everybody, “Here is the law.”
And when you get to the fourth line and you get to corruption, corruption’s a
word that people are queasy about. Don’t you love it when a client has the 50th
gate in the 4th line? You can say them, “You’re corrupt.” People feel queasy
about certain lines. Terminal disease. Lines like this make people nervous.
Corruption’s one of them because like all of those things, we have word
prejudice. We all carry word prejudice, and word prejudice is limited
understanding. Think about what that means. You have a decent human being
and they get stopped by a policeman at a street corner and they happen to be
smoking marijuana. And they have a productive career and blah, blah, blah and
they happen to be caught smoking marijuana in a state that has zero tolerance
and they have to go to jail for a year or two or three years. They go up before
the judge. Pray that you meet judges like this in your life. They go up to the
judge who’s a 50, 4th line. That’s the only judge they have a chance with.
That’s the only judge that’s ready to corrupt the law.
You see, corruption does not have to be negative. Corruption can be very
positive. Out of that corruption is the possibility to see that a law is not fair or
doesn’t work or isn’t correct and then the law can be corrupted. It isn’t about
just saying, “Oh my God, corruption.” Don’t get stuck in the word prejudice.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 177
You see, the first three lines of establishing the law have very little recognition
of what’s really going on in the tribe because they’re not transpersonal lines.
It’s an inner process of what one thinks the law should be rather than what
works in reality. That’s why the third line bumps into all those things.
The third line comes out saying, “Here is the law,” and then is surprised to find
out that nobody has any respect for it and doesn’t want to have anything to do
with it and they get surprised. And out of that they can find that through trial
and error that they had made a mistake.
By the time you get to the fourth line, you get to a transpersonal gift. You get
to the recognition that there is somebody at the other end. That that law has to
apply to the other because the fourth line is a theme of friendship. So what
you have here in this corruption or not is the possibility of whether the law can
stand as it should and be externalized, or whether it needs to be corrupted. By
the way, that isn’t to say you cannot corrupt a 50, 4th line. They get easily sick,
they can be corrupted, and corruption is something that’s never going to be
alien to them.
Emotional Wave of Kindness - Meanness
But the fact of the matter is that corruption has the same and equivalent
positive value and it’s going to operate correctly if it’s operating according to
their Type. This is the wave of kindness and meanness—the fourth line
wave.
And of course everything that operates out of the friendship process of the
fourth line is that externalization is only possible through friendship. Having
the intuition for that, to be able to corrupt your friends. To be able to corrupt
them with a new law. To corrupt them and take them away from their old law.
When you get to this side of the kindness-meanness, it is one of those things
that I always remind people who have the fourth line as a sexual strategy.
Remember that everything you’re seeing here is the emotional response to
sexual strategies. We’ll look at those after the break.
Please understand that in coming to grips with the nature of what channels are
and how they work, that in going into the detail of the defense circuit,
recognize its importance. It is a minor circuit. We know something about
178 Channels By Type
minor circuits. Minor circuits dominate the moment that they’re in anybody’s
design.
The world is dominated by this minor circuit. It is dominated by this
generative process. It’s dominated by a generative process to be able to bring
form and endow it with awareness, to bring awareness to our intimacy, to bring
emotional pleasure and make us feel good and healthy. There are so many
things that are caught up with this. So here within this defense circuit lies basic
themes out of which all gates, and lines, and channels operate.
And most important of all, if you look at these themes carefully and you relate
it to your own profile, it will give you a much deeper understanding of the basic
programming of what you are. In other words, the basic purpose and
imprinting that you brought with you coming in on this particular incarnation.
Oh, kindness/meanness. One thing, just to finish that. Every time you have a
strategy like friendship, you have to recognize that kindness works going in and
meanness can always be the result, because kindness reveals things and brings
things out that can be used later. And it’s something to recognize about that.
Being corrupted can seem to be very kind. Somebody bribes you and gives you
half a million bucks. And then of course it can turn out to be very mean, you
get caught.
The Fifth Line — Awareness of Discipline-
Rebellion
When you get to the fifth line, you have now stepped into the collective rooting
of awareness. At the moment you get to that, you can see that it’s keynoted by
taste. And remember that taste is the judgmental capacity to be able to
distinguish between what you like and don’t like. It’s not moral. It is not
about good and bad. Something so important to understand about the
collective authority is that collective authority rests on being able to establish
what it likes and what it doesn’t like, and it gets into a lot of trouble when it
turns it into the moral good and bad.
I do not like violence. I do not have a taste for violence, but I have no moral
problem with violence. It’s very different. In other words, not to have a moral
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 179
position doesn’t mean that you can’t have a judgmental position. We are all
designed to like and not like things. I have many activations in logic. Liking
and not liking is what logic is really about. So here this taste, understand it in
that context to be able to recognize what it likes and doesn’t like. That taste is
a taste for discipline or rebellion.
Now remember that the fifth line is the ability to bring universalization. It is
the line that receives the greatest projection. All first lines establish what a
hexagram is. The basis of a hexagram, the basis is instinct, basic awareness,
instinct for weakness and strength. That keeps you alive, basic. But how does
everybody want to see this hexagram? Everybody wants to see this hexagram
as discipline or rebellion. In other words, this is the projected field.
So what that means is that the law universalized is either going to organize
society and bring discipline, or it’s going to disorganize society and
bring rebellion. Again, you can see the collective importance, that the
collective is our opportunity to create global villages. To be able to bring all of
that together, and to be able to bring that together means that the dichotomy
of that is discipline and rebellion. There are those that will accept the discipline
of any system, and there are those that will rebel against it, and it’s always the
equation in the world, always.
Emotional Wave of Selfless - Selfish
On the emotional side, you can see the nature of the wave. The wave is to be
selfless or selfish. The discipline brings this selflessness, the rebellion, the
selfishness. “Yeah, the system is good for others, but it’s not good for me.”
Now remember that the success of all fifth lines lies in practicality; in other
words, unless the awareness itself brings a practical law that can accept, be
accepted and find the discipline through that law. And if it’s not practical then
there will be rebellion against the law.
You know how many revolutions have been about impractical taxation? Trying
to tax people beyond their limits. And the moment that it’s not practical, the
law slowly begins to disintegrate. The whole thing about 5th line lawmakers is
that their reputation means everything for them.
So it’s essential for them to be practical. If they can bring you practical laws,
they will avoid rebellion. But the moment that the laws are not practical, that’s
180 Channels By Type
the moment that the rebellion is there. That’s the moment that the selfishness
is there, and that’s the moment that the collective purpose is defeated. And it’s
running through every fifth line.
I’ve told you many times about the fifth line and the symbol of the line as the
general. This idea that there is somebody outside of the day-to-day affairs of
the state, and in moments of turmoil, they’re sought out to be the hired
dictator. To come in and to be able to provide practical solutions and when
everything is done, to go away again, out of sight, out of the day-to-day affairs.
That underlines every fifth line, and that selfishness is also part of the
selflessness. In other words, they need to be selfish in order to have their
opportunities to be selfless. They need to be withdrawn, in that sense, in order
to build the energy and to wait for that practical moment to be selfless. All
fifth lines carry this information.
The genetic continuity runs through everything. The moment you look at a 5th
line in the Sun and Earth configuration, you know that it has a deep impact on
the way in which you operate in the world. It is the resonance for you with
your process in life.
The Sixth Line — Awareness of Leadership or
Not
The 6th line is a taste for leadership or not. And nothing better expresses the
whole dilemma of the 6th line and its true nature in a profile than the 50th
hexagram, 6th line. This is the ultimate aloofness to be the judge of judges,
to be the judge of laws, to be aloof and above the law, to look down upon it,
and to look and see whether this law or that law are good laws or not.
For all 6th lines, completion lies in entering in, finally, to the experience. And
the thing that you know about a 6th line judge is that it’s going to take until
they’re in their 50s before they can really enter into what they can recognize is
correct. Between their Saturn return and their Kiron return, between
approximately 28 and 51 or 52, that’s going to be a period in their life of
aloofness in which they’re going to be judging the laws around them.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 181
So to become a leader or not, you can see that the real leadership begins when
they become aloof. That’s when they guide others. That’s when they have the
capacity, from their perspective sitting on top of the house of the hexagram, of
being able to look and judge its processes, and the 50.6 is here to judge the law.
It’s here to judge the tribal law in its various shapes and forms, and it’s here to
verify or not which laws are effective. But ultimately, it cannot stay above the
law. At some point, it has to embrace the very law that it gives recognition to.
Emotional Wave of Sympathy - Apathy
If you look at this on the other side, you can see the sympathy/apathy wave.
And of course, this wave operates in the 6th line, the apathetic phase, the fence
sitting phase between Saturn and Kiron’s return. That fence sitting phase
where in their aloofness, they’re not committing to anything, and are really
apathetic about life. There’s a great deal of apathy inherent in all sixth lines.
Because the moment you have a 6th line is the moment that, from the earliest
part of your life, you’re trying to get that 6th line experience, and of course it’s
very difficult to get a fulfillment out of a 6th line.
You’re meant to be disappointed when you’re young. You’re meant to get
burnt in the very thing you jump into in order for you to gain wisdom through
the experience of dealing with it. After all, sixth lines are the harmony of the
3rd line trial and error. And, you’re not born wise. It’s a nice mythology for
new mothers, but you’re not born wise. You’re born open. Wisdom is
something that we grow through in this life.
Summary of Understanding the Lines as a Valuable Tool
In looking at the way in which these two gates operate, I want you to be able to
concentrate more and more on your ability to understand the nature of a line
without having to read it. It’s been part of our process of working with
structure in the hexagram and going through the 384 lines, going through the
continuity in that, but the more you understand about the nature of the line,
the more you can easily relate that line to its hexagram, because the lines carry
with them the genetic continuity. They are the formula that comes together in
various combinations.
But that line 1 is riding through everything, and everything that has that 1, you
can use your understanding of that line to interpret it. So very important to
182 Channels By Type
grasp these various aspects of these lines. From now on when you think of
first and second lines, and it doesn’t matter whether they’re in a logic circuit,
an individual circuit, a tribal circuit, you know that when you’re looking at first
and second lines, they’re inherently tribal. So they bring a tribal instinct, if you
will, to individuality, or a tribal instinct to a collective process.
And when you’re looking at third and fourth lines, you know that they’re
basically mutative, that they carry individual capacity. It isn’t like they are
individual, but it’s that they will resonate to those processes.
And the fifth and sixth lines are fundamental collective. By understanding
the infrastructure, it makes it so easy for you to see things on the surface. So
often people are really amazed at what I can say about just looking at whatever,
just looking at the profile and just blurting a couple of things out. But that’s
only because I understand the profile gates.
Line Circuitry Emotional Wave Keynotes
Line 6: Collective Desire, Leadership or not, Sympathy-Apathy
Line 5: Collective Desire, Discipline-Rebellion, Selfish-Selfless
Line 4: Individual Emoting, Corruption or not, Kindness-Meanness
Line 3: Individual Emoting, Partnership-Dependency, Allegiance-Rejection
Line 2: Tribal Sensitivity, Determination or not, Advance-Withdraw
Line 1: Tribal Sensitivity, Weakness-Strength
If you understand the profiling gates, if you understand the relationship
between all first lines in those eight gates and all second lines in those eight
gates, boy oh boy do you know a lot, because of course that’s what shapes it.
Those six role gates, plus this 50 and 6 that bring the emotional frequency and
the awareness frequency—those eight gates, if you study the lines.
One of the most important exercises in learning how to use profiling
information, how to really understand lines, is take each of the first lines of
those eight gates and write them underneath each other. Put them together so
you can see all eight of them. You’ll be astonished at what happens. All of a
sudden what that line is really about comes out because these eight ways, they
are really keys to how we operate. The moment you can look at these eight
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 183
gates and those lines in that way, it’s a valuable tool. It’s one of those things
where you can instantly begin to get a real deep sense of what a line is.
So that when you look at the energy of the day and you see it’s a second or a
third or fourth line, you really have a quality to give you a focus. You can get
all that background information about what that line represents as an
environment, and then you can see it in relationship to the hexagram and you
really know your stuff.
The other thing as an analyst, by being able to look at the profile and
understand what those lines mean, it gives you a much broader framework to
be able to see the person you’re dealing with and to understand how they will
have difficulty or not in being able to live out their Type. So understanding the
lines at this level, it’s the most important thing to understand the lines as one-
two, three-four, and five-six.
Understand the line from its own nature, and at the moment you grasp the line
from its own nature, it becomes a very, very valuable tool for you. And it gives
you much more knowledge in terms of what you’re looking at and what you’re
trying to interpret. Okay, have a break and then we will do the rest.
The Defense Circuit — The Role Gates
So to finish this examination of the complexity of the themes that exist in the
defense circuit and in these two generative channels and to be able to recognize
how much impact they have on our lives, they are the foundation of life itself.
They’re the foundation of our reproductive lives. They’re the basis of our
communities. They are the creators of the emotional and awareness
environment that we grow in and live in. So there is a great deal of depth here
in these particular gates.
In the 59 and in the 27, what you meet is the genetic strategies that operate out
of the Sacral Center. And in meeting the genetic strategies of the Sacral,
recognizing that genetics and the genetics operating out of the Sacral, overrule
your mind—much more powerful than the mental field.
184 Channels By Type
Gate 59 – The Sexual Strategy for Intimacy
When you’re dealing with the 59th gate, you’re dealing with the sexual strategy
for intimacy. And the various qualities of intimacy, these various strategies,
these six different strategies, that in fact each of these strategies operate either
best with the resonance, in terms of the
emotional wave, the 59.1 with the 6.1, or the
harmony of a 59.1 with a 6.4. (Note: The
Channel of Mating 59-6 is discussed in the Creative
Channels book.)
Always keep in mind the relationship between
lower and upper trigram: the first and fourth
lines, second and fifth lines, third and sixth lines are harmonies. Now it isn’t to
say that if you don’t have a resonance, same line, or you don’t have a harmony,
that the dissonance is going to be something that’s negative. It’s not true. It
simply means that the way in which the intimacy is going to operate is not
going to be smooth, and again, that smooth is not a moral point. It’s not about
good or bad, it’s just about different.
The First Line Sexual Strategy Role — Pursuer / Pursued
You can see that the role of the 59.1, that its strategy in that role is the
pursuer/pursued. This is the whole business of the foundation of what
intimacy is all about. In other words, that the foundation of intimacy is the
caveman or cavewoman.
We have these funny things about the way in which our genetic strategies work
because our minds are always getting involved. The moment that we have the
pursuer and pursued, the moment we see the caveman with the club and he
goes up and he whacks his potential mate on the head, we think that it’s all the
pursuer.
Now come on. She did her hair that morning; she knows he walks by that way.
She sat there. She knew that he wouldn’t hit her hard. This whole business
that all of the stuff goes on the pursuer, and that you forget about that the
pursuer-pursued is a relationship of weakness and strength, and it does not
mean that the one that is pursued is weak. These are all games. They’re all
strategies.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 185
It’s one thing to pretend you’re weak. The old joke about marriage that every
husband pretends he’s strong and every wife pretends she’s weak. This is just
the basis of relationship. The pursuer-the pursued who are playing the game
with each other, they play the game out of those roles and out of the wave of
being strong or weak. And remember that the moment you’re dealing with
four, you’re dealing with any of those possible combinations. In other words,
the pursuer can be weak and the pursued can be strong. You have all these
possibilities that are there in the program and we tend to live them all out at
various stages in our development.
If you’re carrying that first line theme, if you have that 59.1, then you’re going
to go through those themes of pursuer/pursued, weakness/strength.
Second Line Sexual Strategy Role — Shyness / Boldness
When you come to the second line, you come to the role of
shyness/boldness. And again, these are genetic strategies, they are not
personalities. This is really confused sometimes. See, this is a genetic strategy
and the only time this shyness is going to come out is in a sexual context. In
other words, it’s a role that’s played out in order to attract the right kind of
mate.
So what the 59.2 does is it plays shy, and the wave here is advance and
withdrawal. So if you’re a 59.2 and you’re sitting up against the wall and
somebody comes up to you and pursues you, somebody comes up to you and
pulls you out with their boldness, and they say, “Come with me and dance with
me,” that’s right, because that’s the way it works. One of the things to
recognize about the nature of second line people sexually is that their genetic
role is to be shy. It does not mean that is true of their love making. Don’t get
caught up in that myth. It’s simply a genetic role.
The genes want boldness for that shyness. The genetics are always looking for
the balance—always. That’s what they’re attracted to. So if you’re on the bold
side, you’re going to look for the shy because it’s the natural genetic bond.
Now remember that you may have a very aggressive mind and then find
yourself in a sexual situation in which you can’t say anything, and you’re sitting
there like a shy little whatever and be totally baffled inside about that, think that
there’s something wrong. There isn’t. It’s simply the way that the strategy
186 Channels By Type
works when the genes are looking for somebody to make babies with, and
they’re doing that all the time. They never stop speculating.
Your genes never stop speculating. They get to a certain point where they
don’t care much, but they never stop speculating, okay? It’s always interesting.
It always could bring some new genetic material and damn those poor suckers
up there that have to follow our laws. You see, they don’t care about us.
They’re busy about their own business.
Third Line Sexual Strategy Role — Bonds Made / Broken
In the third line, you can see that when you’re dealing with this wave of
allegiance-rejection that it’s based on this role of bonds made and broken.
So the moment you’re dealing with the 59.3, you’re dealing with somebody that
you can never expect to have a continuous bond to, that you must be willing to
give them up in order to have them again. Now, this is the third line nature.
It also means that when you go beyond the sexual implications of the Channel
of Intimacy and you go into its social implications, it is a highly social channel
and intimacy is there to create intimacy at every level and is not necessarily
reproductive. It also means that if you’re dealing with 59.3s, in their career
work, they’re better to have projects in which they can make bonds and break
them instead of having to be caught up in long-term processes in which they
have to get out because they need to break the bond. They’re not going to be
happy.
The moment you have a third line that’s in a situation where it feels trapped,
that’s the moment that allegiance becomes rejection. That’s the moment, at the
emotional level, they’re going to resonate deeply to rejecting that kind of
authority. They don’t want to be dependent. Remember, the awareness of
third lines is understanding the nature of dependency and partnership and its
difference, and no third line wants to feel dependent. They want to be a
partner and the only way that they can be a partner is by proving that they’re
not dependent. So the way they do that is to break the bond and they set
things on their terms.
So keep in mind this quality of this third line, because if you’re dealing with a
design and you see that somebody has a third line personality or a third line
design, or if you see that they have strong third line sexual themes—gates out
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 187
of the Solar Plex to the Solar Plex—then you know right away that that’s an
issue for them. This sense that they can’t find fulfillment in relationships. The
sense that things are turning over, they don’t really go through them, that the
bonds are being broken. And what often happens for third line people is they
don’t realize that their aura is doing their talking, that they’re putting into the
other the need to break bonds.
You get a third line person who falls in love with somebody who isn’t
interested in breaking bonds and they will become very interested in breaking
bonds because they’re going to take on that conditioning. That’s why, to be
able to understand the nature of your relationship at a mechanical level, that
awareness will allow you to have a decent relationship no matter what the
situation is mechanically, but it’s the awareness first that can do that, and only
then.
Those three roles, by now you should recognize that that’s all lower trigram. It
doesn’t matter that you have the most social of all channels—the Channel of
Intimacy, a design of mating. It might be the most social of all channels but
first, second and third lines have no transpersonal capacity. They are only
focused on the gate. They don’t see the harmonic. They don’t see the
potential of the real process of mating and they can’t imagine who to mate
with. They can’t.
You know if you’re a first line, you’re really looking for the foundation. You’re
looking for the basis. But it doesn’t mean that you’re actively out there
looking, you’re just doing research. “What is it I really need? I’m weak, I need
somebody strong.” “I’m strong, I need somebody to look after.” Whatever
the case may be, it’s looking at basic things.
The second line is just sitting there and waiting. It doesn’t know that anybody
is going to break through with shyness. It doesn’t think that anybody really
wants it. And by the time you get to the third line, because it’s inherently
mutative and carries an individual flavor, that through trial and error, surprises
happen.
It gets surprised by intimacy; 59.3s are forever surprised that they’re intimate all
of a sudden with somebody. It just sort of happened out of nowhere. One
moment they’re just drinking a cup of coffee, and the next moment they’re
188 Channels By Type
telling you about their life. It’s just boom. But by the time you get to the
upper trigram, you have a different process.
Fourth Line Sexual Strategy Role — Kindness / Meanness
The fourth line is inherently transpersonal. It is there to externalize intimacy
through friendship, and so you have this role of the confidante or not. That’s
the whole thing about understanding the wave of kindness/meanness
emotionally.
You see, if your sexual role is a fourth line role, or if you have a fourth line
personality, or a fourth line unconscious in your Sun-Earth configuration, then
you have to recognize that friendship is your only pathway to true sexual
intimacy. It comes out of friendship.
Now the whole thing about the wave of kindness/meanness is that friendship
is only possible through kindness. You don’t become friends with somebody
by being mean to them. It starts with kindness. And of course the kindness is
a kind of bribe. The fourth line, while making friends with you, are trying to
externalize their one-track mind. That’s what they’re here for. They’re here to
externalize whatever that is. So they’re here to externalize intimacy in this
context and they’re here to externalize it through friendship.
And then out of kindness, you tell them all about yourself, your lovers, your
past lovers, your problems, your bank statement. You tell them everything.
Kindness is really like that. Friendship opens things up. And then one night
it’s raining and you’re bored and the two of you make love, because that’s the
strategy of all fourth lines.
The strategy of all fourth lines is that genetically, they will not accept anybody
into their life unless they’re first friends so that they can feel them out, suss
them out. And of course what happens is that the moment you consummate
that relationship and it becomes sexual, that’s the moment that the meanness
comes out. Because the first problem that arises in the new lover relationship,
you are both going to remind each other of all the things that you’ve told each
other you did with your last lovers. “You’re doing to me exactly what you said
you didn’t do to him, and now I think you really did do that to him because
you’re doing that to me.” It gets real nasty.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 189
My recommendation to all fourth lines when they enter into friendship, sshh.
Don’t talk so much. Don’t tell them so much about your past lovers and your
fetish for hot chili at 2:00 in the morning. Don’t tell them all those things. Let
them slowly find out, it’s much better.
Anyway, kindness/meanness. The whole business of that transpersonal gift is
that because it’s the first transpersonal line of intimacy that leads to family, you
really have to see that this is the secret to long-lasting relationships. And the
secret to long lasting relationships is the bond of friendship. After all,
regardless of whatever the excitement is of any sexual bond, the only thing that
holds a relationship together is actually the bond of friendship. It is the sharing
and the intimacy of a growing life together and that’s the one thing that’s truly
of value.
So this being the first transpersonal expression of intimacy, you have to see that
it says a lot about the nature of what is the basis for a solid relationship. That
is, friendship. And that friendship is obviously, in that sense, very important.
It’s very frustrating to your teenagers who have fourth line themes—it’s very
frustrating because they want to fuck somebody. And they’d like to be able to
do it the way they do it in the movies. They’d like to be able to just fall in love
and do it. And of course they have a fourth line theme and they can’t do
that—they can’t. Because the very girl or boy they want to make love to only
wants to be their friend, and tell them about all the other girls and boys they’re
interested in, and they have to put up with that.
Until they finally get their opportunity. When the girl or boy that they’re
interested in gets dumped by the girl or boy they wanted, they suddenly have a
chance to become their lover, and of course this is the strategy of a fourth line.
Now, for a teenager that can be very difficult, because with the pressure of the
hormones and the nature of what kind of a sexual drive is inherent in being a
mammal, it’s very difficult for them to be able to be just the friend. It can hurt
them. Yet at the same time if they understand that’s a strategy, it can really be
presented to them.
I’ve done this in a very cool way. It’s really okay because they get to find out all
kinds of stuff and they get to spend much more quality time with all of those
girls or boys that the very girls and boys are looking to meet in others. They
190 Channels By Type
have a different basis for a relationship in the future and they will get their
sexuality out of that if they play out their role. But it’s so important to see that
the basis of relationship has to be this communion, has to be this friendship.
Fifth Line Sexual Strategy Role — Seducer / Seduced
The fifth line, remember that the nature of all fifth lines is that they’re here to
be inherently practical, but of course they bring practical heresies. The fifth
line is the line of the heretic. It’s the line of the saint. They bring their
potential of practical heresy. And when you’re dealing with the role, the role
of the fifth line is the role of seducer/seduced.
Now, I’m a fifth line personality. I seduce you, but you’re willingly my
seduced. That’s right. That’s our relationship. You see, the fifth line
personality individual like me romances you. I seduce you into knowledge. But
again, if I take credit for the seduction, I’m in big trouble because it takes two
to tango. The seducer and the seduced, they run together. That’s the nature of
the game.
So the whole thing to recognize about the fifth line is that it is here for practical
seduction, not frivolous seduction—practical seduction. I live in a pair-bonded
relationship because it’s practical. As a fifth line, that’s only natural for me. I
find family to be practical. I find children to be practical, and it’s good for me,
otherwise I wouldn’t do it. I don’t do things that are frivolous. I’m a fifth line
personality. I cannot escape the practicality of things.
So it’s very important to understand that seduction is a practical thing and the
actual act of seduction is minor compared to the amount of time it takes for
that moment of seduction to exist. In other words, the 5 is usually out of the
scene. Remember this selfishness/selflessness is the awareness that guides
the seducer. And there are times in which the seducer has to pull away and
wait for its reputation to grow so that there are more possibilities for seduction.
Because after all, this is an agent of universalization. The more that can be
seduced, the more successful the universalization. And the more practical the
seduction, the greater the reputation. And remember that the fifth line is the
only line that deals with reputation as a theme.
All fifth lines suffer terribly if somebody projects on their aspect and they
cannot fulfill it. I’m a 51.5 personality Sun. I’m expected to shock you. Now
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 191
if I don’t, I’m going to lose my reputation. That’s a drag and it happens
instantaneously. And that personality Sun of mine is part of a defined channel,
so it’s a projection on me that I can initiate you. And if I can’t, I lose my
reputation. And if I can, my reputation grows. This is how the fifth line
operates.
So look at your fifth lines. And see that the application of the fifth lines in
your design is about practical applications and that’s where you have your
greatest seductive power—out of your fifth lines. There you have the capacity
really to bring others to your universalization. So wherever those fifth lines are
in your design, pay attention to them and remember that you have to be selfish
about it before you can be selfless.
I spent most of my life being deeply selfish in my knowing. My knowing was
for no one. My knowing was only for me. It’s part of the process of being
able to have something to universalize, that first it must be everything for you
personalized, and then selflessly for practical reasons, selflessly you can go out
and universalize that.
Sixth Line Sexual Strategy Role — Soul Mate / or Not
Finally, we come to the sixth line. The sixth line is the role of soul mate or
not. Given the special nature of the sixth line, it is really not part of the
hexagram; the hexagram ends with the seduction of the fifth line.
We want everybody to be a romantic seducer, to be seduced in romance. And
yet the foundation is whacking them over the head, and in between are all the
variations. The sixth line sits up there and looks and just looks. It wasn’t the
sixth line that wrote the Kama Sutra, but it’s a sixth line that wrote the
criticism. “This is okay, that’s not. This will work, that won’t.”
The nature of having a sixth line when it comes to anything related to your
sexuality,—. So if you have a sixth line personality or unconscious in your Sun-
Earth themes, if you have sixth lines that are in the Solar Plex or pointed at the
Solar Plex, you have to recognize that they are going to bring out in you
promiscuity. In other words, they’re going to bring out in you jumping into
whatever those particular streams are—into the need, into the desire, into the
passion. And you’re going to go through that phase when you’re very young
and that phase ends when you’re around 28 years old—your Saturn return.
192 Channels By Type
If you look carefully, and it’s one of the very strange things about looking at a
BodyGraph, if you look carefully at the sixth lines in your BodyGraph, all those
sixth lines operate according to your age. In other words, generally speaking,
the sixth line in somebody between the age of 28 and 51 is in a stage of
aloofness, whereas up and until the Saturn return, they’re in a state of over
activity. The best way to describe that is to see that the sixth line plays out the
third line role in the first Saturn cycle—trial and error, bumping into things,
jumping into intimacy.
And then because it gets burnt, because the nature of the sixth line is that it not
only can recognize that there is a transpersonal harmonic gate in the channel,
but it also recognizes that there is an entire circuit. Which means that the
perspective of the sixth line sitting on the roof of the house is to be able to
look out over that vast expanse of the circuit and to be able to say, “Yes but,
that’s okay, but we need to complete this and that and that and that and the
other.”
So what’s so important about that sixth line is that it needs to fall into all of
those early intimacies in order to be able to step out and step into its aloofness,
back away from intimacy, be indifferent, in a sense, but actively be in a role of
looking for real intimacy that can truly be fulfilling within the context of the
circuit. And remember the context of the tribal circuit is that intimacy,
ultimately, is a bargain that is successful in two ways: materially, and in terms of
loyalty. And the moment that any sixth line can see, as a by-product of its
intimacy, that it will have both material gain and social loyalty, then it’s ready to
leave sitting on the fence and enter into the embrace of whatever that happens
to be.
So this illusion of the one-night stand is that yes, but if you read that line
carefully it speaks of a one-night stand that can last forever, what can be
absolutely perfect. And the goal of the sixth line is to perfect its hexagram.
Every sixth line is ready to embrace fully its nature if it can find the one that
really works. So when you’re dealing with 59-6s, you cannot change the nature
of the promiscuity in the first part of their life, in their first Saturn cycle.
But if they’re living out their Type, they will only enter into those relationships
that are of value to them, even though they will appear to be promiscuous. In
other words, that they will not last long, but they will be healthy relationships
that do not last long because they entered into them correctly. It will not stop
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 193
them from going through that phase nor will it eliminate them becoming aloof,
because the aloof stage is necessary. Otherwise, we don’t have anybody that we
can rely on to make sure, and for all of us, that the nature of the hexagram is
correct.
This is my favorite story of the relationship between the 5/1 and the 6/2,
myself being a 5/1. The 5/1 and 6/2 are left angle transpersonal crosses.
They’re very, very powerful. They’re there to do a specific job. The 5/1 is
there to take the foundation and universalize it. The 5/1 is the seducer, and
the seducer can be both the devil or Christ, because it’s all seduction. So the
5/1 comes into the village and says to the village, “God just spoke to me and
it’s going to rain. And it’s going to rain so long we’re going to have to build an
ark so we’ll survive.”
The villagers, at least one of them, are going to go up the hill and see the 6/2.
You know, the 19.6, the recluse, the fool on the hill, the theme of the sixth
line’s aloofness. They say to the fool on the hill, “Look, there’s this 5/1 in the
village who says that God told him it’s going to rain.” Now if the 6/2 looks
around and says, “Smells like rain,” everybody in the village starts building the
ark. If the 6/2 says, “I don’t think it’s going to rain,” then the 5/1 gets stoned
by the villagers. It’s the power of the sixth line.
Now in the case of the 6/2, that power comes from it being called. In other
words, you go up to the recluse and you call them out of their reclusiveness to
ask for their sixth line judgment. Now transcendence for the 6/2 is not that
period of aloofness where they can become sources of confirmation. For
them, it begins when they, themselves—and usually it comes around their
50s—are ready to embrace what they judge correct. And this is the major step
for all sixth lines.
In other words, you run around when you’re young, you have a lot of
disappointments in your relationships. You go into a long period of
aloofness—doesn’t mean you don’t have relationships during that period, it just
means you’re aloof—and then finally you can get to a point where you can re-
embrace intimacy at a personal level again, by seeing correctly for yourself what
intimacy is really for you. And so ultimately the 6/2 not only has to say, “Yes,
it smells like rain, but wait for me, I’ll help you build the ark.” That’s
completion, in that sense, for the sixth line.
194 Channels By Type
Sympathy/apathy. This is its emotional wave. And it’s very important for it
to have that apathetic period in their life. It is natural for sixth lines to have
that within them. They’re often given a hard time for that. You have to
recognize that to carry any sixth line in you, that’s an aspect of you that often is
annoying to other people. It does seem to be above the fray. It’s like having
the 36.6—you’re always above the crisis. You’re blowing everybody up around
you and you are above the crisis. And you know it can really be annoying to
people. And you’re up there saying, “Yep, that was a good one, wasn’t it. Oh,
I’ve seen worse crises than that.”
The sixth line can really make people mad because it doesn’t enter. If you meet
them when they’re young, that’s very different. The thing about that is to also
see very clearly that there is a real mystical death at the Saturn return. There is
something very, very significant about the Saturn return, and of course for the
sixth line they truly live that out.
One of those things I know is that it’s there in the third line in the harmony,
but quite frankly I don’t know how that works in the third line. I don’t. It
wasn’t something that was really explained. I understand it clearly in the sixth
line, that the sixth line must go through these stages.
So when you’re dealing with a sixth line in a child, and particularly when it’s in
dominant places, particularly when it’s the profile, you have to make sure that
they understand that they are going to go through a very, very different kind of
life process. They have to know their Type when they’re very young so that the
wild stuff they jump into, at least, is healthy for them.
Again, it’s never about control. It’s never about elimination. It’s never about
stopping things. It’s just about being aware of them and operating correctly so
you get the right kind of experience you need. If you’re living out your Type
and you have a lot of lovers, it’s less likely that you’re going to have any kind of
sexual infection or disease than if you’re running around and having a lot of
lovers and you don’t know what’s going on and you’re not living out your
Type. Then you can count on it, that you’re going to end up with problems
associated with that.
So, the sexual education of our young people who carry sixth line themes is
very important. It’s very important, so that they’re clear about how they enter
into,— not that you’re going, “No, no, no, no, you can’t do that,” because of
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 195
course they will. There’s nothing going to stop your genes from playing out
their genetic strategy.
In being able to look at, in detail, the way in which these line themes operate in
these two channels, is to keep you clear about when you’re looking at a chart
and you see the presence of either the Channel of Preservation or the channel
of mating, that you’re dealing with powerful, conditioning beings.
Conditioning beings. They are conditioning the other.
I used to make a joke with my 59-6 son, I’d say, “If you want to get pregnant,
I’ll rent him to you. He can go to sleep in the next room beside the wall where
you have the bed. He’ll bring the 59-6 to your aura. You can consummate.”
You see, this whole business about letting your aura do the talking and about
the power of the aura when you put your aura inside of somebody else, when
you’re dealing with the 50-27 or the 59-6, any of you who has contact with
people like that, or you have that design, please understand that’s very
powerful. 59-6s are the greatest
aura busters in the world.
They’re aura busters.
Now, I don’t like all of them. It
is their design to be intimate. I
don’t have anything in the 59-
6—nothing. There are people
I’ve had as students over the years and all of a sudden I’ll be standing there and
I’ll turn and they’re right in my face. They’re right here and they’ve stepped
right into my aura and it’s like “back off, back off, back off, back off, arms
distance, back off.” They’re incredible. They go whoosh. They’re right inside
of you.
I’ve watched that. I’ve watched my son. He’s a 59-6. I watch him break into
people’s auras. Oh, he’s so good at that. Wap, right in there. So you have to
understand that these channels,—and by the way the 50-27, womp. Instead of
penetrating you, what they do to you is,—you know what tow trucks do? They
put a winch on you and they go (noise), that’s what 50-27s do. They bring you
into their law. They bring you into their thing. They bring you into their
custodianship.
196 Channels By Type
The 59-6 goes busting in and the 50-27 just pulls you into them. These are
very powerful beings. These are strong auras. And, of course, this is pure
generative power, and it operates its best that way. If you tell a 50-27 who is a
Generator that they have to wait and let their aura do the talking, boy do they
love it, because their winch works automatically (noise) and they get to see right
away it works.
My new son is a 50-27 so I got this whole defense circuit in my life now—
monsters. I mean, powerful auras, pulling you in, breaking in. So when you
look at these two channels, keep in mind that they’re very powerful. They have
a deep impact on our lives, they have a deep impact on relationships, and if you
take these two channels along with the presence of format energy, it helps you
to understand nuances in charts. It helps to give you another kind of
perspective on how they work.
Gate 27: Caring and Nourishing
The gate of genetic imperative. The 27 is the mirror role of the 59. What you
have in the 59 is a genetic strategy to be able to bring people into your aura so
that you can make love and reproduce. And the 27 is a strategy of how you
care and how you care for those that you nourish. That’s why the 50-27 pulls
in. In other words, this is the yin side of the defense circuit. The yang side is
the penetrating side, the 59-6. So here is this pulling in.
The First Line Role – Self-provider / Coveter
The first line role is the role of self-provider, or coveter; strength and
weakness, pursuer/pursued. So the first line strategy about nourishing is
someone has to be the self-provider and someone has to be the coveter. And
it’s the way it works. Someone has to go out and bake the bread. Someone has
to covet it for breakfast. Don’t covet thy neighbor…never mind. I keep on
being reminded of bad jokes.
The Second Line Role – Nourisher / Depleter
The second line role is the nourisher/depleter. This line has a lot of
potential problems. Anytime you’re dealing with a second line, you’re dealing
with real vulnerability in the design. All second lines are waiting to be called,
and as such, don’t realize that they’re being seen naked. A second line is always
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 197
being seen for what it is on the outside. Now, that may be or not, a projection,
but it is an open window into your being—any second line in your design.
People are always speculating on that. Always looking in that window of that.
So again, that boldness comes from seeing the shy one sitting there inside,
minding its own business, unaware, and then the boldness to break through.
So here is the role of nourisher and depleter.
Now one of the things to recognize about the 27.2 is that it can deplete
endlessly, and as such, can bring a lot of sexual disease, and it does. So it’s one
of those things to recognize that entering into relationships correctly is
something very important for the protection of the body. This is a classic line
of the role of being the nourisher. In other words, that the shy one, that the
bold one, has to be able to bring nourishment to the shy one. It’s isn’t just
about breaking down the barrier, it’s about being able to provide where one
breaks down the barrier.
When you break down somebody’s barrier and they haven’t asked you to, then
they can continue to deplete your resources. If you’re a 59.2 and somebody
breaks down your barrier, you got them. After all, that’s what the strategy is
about. Be the shy one, wait for the bold one, and then when they break
through that barrier, you have them. Well, the same thing is true in terms of
the nourisher/depleter. The depletion can get out of hand. This is the ‘using
up resources’ and using up more resources than the nourisher can provide.
And, of course, there is a lot of illness that’s inherent in that second line.
The Third Line Role – Bonds Made / Bonds Broken
In the third line role, we have exactly the mirror role that we saw in the 59.3,
the role of bonds made and broken, that is conditioned caring. The 27.3 is the
line called greed. People never understand these lines. You have to know
what a line is before you can understand the lines. If you don’t understand the
structure, you can’t understand the line. The bonds made and broken in caring.
Remember that this is lower trigram. The first three lines here don’t know that
there’s a 50th gate at the other end. That caring is not being guided by
awareness; that caring is not being given the perspective of values. It’s just a
genetic strategy. It’s not aware. So that genetic strategy in a 27.3 is to break
the bonds. In other words, to care and then to stop caring. Not to continue to
care, or you can come back and care again.

Remember what I told you about the nature of individuality. And remember
that when you’re dealing with a third line theme, you’re dealing with a flavor
that is individual. It is an inherently mutative line. The intuition for the third
line is partnership or dependency. So this is bonds made and broken, it doesn’t
want to be dependent, but it doesn’t know what it’s like. It doesn’t know what
the values are, so it tries to care different ways with different people. It always
comes as a surprise to it that somebody wants its caring.
Just as if you have the 59, the 6 is really sexy. If you have the 27, the 50 is
really intriguing. It gives you a way of being able to recognize what to care
about. But more than that, to find the right values for the right caring strategy
is to come up with a quantum that leads to the proper nurturing of the young,
and in the end, that’s what it’s about. It’s about the proper nurturing of the
young.
If you look at an animal’s design, the channel 50-27 is the channel of herding.
This is where the herding instinct is and this is where sexuality is in mammals.
So in other words, this is where we are able to establish our proper herd. How
do we look after and nurture the young? That comes from the 50 at the other
end. This is just a strategy trying to hook the right values.
The Fourth Line Role – Benefactor / Dependent
The fourth line role is the first one that is transpersonal. It’s going to operate
out of friendship. The 27.4 becomes your friend and cares for you in that
friendship. They’re very well-liked, 27.4s. Their kind of friendly caring is
exactly right for corruption. The friendly caring is ready to see that by caring
for something, you may have to change some of the values. And that this
particular quality of being a benefactor or a dependent, that both benefactor
and dependent are always open to corruption. The benefactor can corrupt.
The dependent can corrupt the benefactor, both positively and negatively.
But again, if you’re looking at the language here and you’re looking at these
lines, I want you to recognize that out of that you’re getting to see basic laws as
they evolved in humanity. In other words, tribal morays, the tribal values, and
the basic law of the tribe is property. Self-provider/coveter. You have to be
able to have things of value, you have to be able to provide; otherwise, you
cannot assume the responsibility of family.
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 199
Remember that the 50th gate is the fear of responsibility. And so the basis of
being able to nurture a family, the 27.1 is the mother/father, that the basis to
nurture a family to be mother and father is that you must be able to be a self-
provider. You cannot be dependent and be able to raise a family—the first law
of nourishment. “Well, your boyfriend’s interesting. Does he have a job? Is
he ever going to make any money? You can’t expect that I’m going to pay for
that.” That’s the basis.
So when you get to the transpersonal, to the benefactor/dependent, then
you’re dealing with the first opportunity to bring these basic laws out.
Remember that the first line and the fourth line are a harmony to each other.
A harmony from being a self-provider to being a benefactor. That’s the
progression. You’re a self-provider in your own personal destiny and that can
lead the way to family. But the moment you’re going to bring transpersonal
laws, that you’re going to bring laws that are going to touch everyone and are
going to condition the way we nurture, then you have to see that you have to
grow from being a self-provider to a benefactor. In other words, somebody
that can say, “All right, he seems like a nice guy. I’ll give him a loan. And then
maybe he can make money later.” To be the benefactor, to corrupt the law.
“All right, you don’t have to be a self-provider. All right, you can marry him.
It’s okay. I’ll help him.” It is the corruption that comes out of that potential of
the fourth line.
The Fifth Line Role – Distributor / Hoarder
When we get to the fifth line of universalization, remember this is about
practical law. It’s about practical things. How do we practically protect our
young? How do we practically nurture them? If you look at harmony, you’ll
see that the nourisher has to become the distributor. It’s not enough to just be
the personal nourisher because then your resources can be depleted. The real
growth is to become the distributor and you can see that the growth out of the
depleter is the hoarder. Keeping everything and all the stuff for themselves.
These are these societies that had secret laws. There you can see the secret
laws, the hoarders hoarding the laws. On the other side, the distributors.
The moment you move into the transpersonal in the preservation, you have to
see that the awareness is guiding you towards larger concerns. It’s not just
what we call the nuclear family which you can see in the concerns of the lower
trigram, but it’s the larger question of clan and tribe that you see in the fourth
200 Channels By Type
and fifth lines. The clan is very much in the 4, the extended nuclear family and
the tribe very much in the 5. In the sense that their interests are much larger,
that nourishment is not simply for one, it’s for all. And of course a fifth line
does have a collective flavor. It’s really that jump into saying that the real
distributor distributes it over the full collective in order to be able to be
responsible for the largest possible community in order to establish what are, in
fact, universal laws.
You’re talking about a gate of real significance when you’re dealing with the
50th gate and its capacity to inform us with awareness. And remember that the
fifth line, the distributor/hoarder has to do with discipline or rebellion. You
see, if there’s no proper distribution, there’s no discipline. The law has to be
fair, distribution has to be equitable, otherwise you lose discipline. So these are
really practical laws. This is the real practical law—practical distribution that
brings discipline. Everybody has a right to certain things: food, shelter,
medicine, education, right to language, right to national territory. It’s necessary,
otherwise, no peace; practical. And as long as that distribution is disciplined
and fair, then you’ve got a really great universal law.
And by the way, that universal law isn’t just about the practical application in
the social context. Because this is the root source of the awareness field that
moves through us, it’s also about our need for practical laws when it comes to
physics, or chemistry, or biology in order for us to really understand how we
can care for ourselves as a specie, our planet and its various aspects.
The Sixth Line Role – Leadership or Not
And finally we come to the sixth line. And remember this is about a taste as
an awareness, as a taste for leadership or not. And given that sixth lines are
going to go through their phase of running around and tasting everything in the
first Saturn cycle, and then going into their aloof phase, their leadership is a
guide in that aloof phase, until finally they, themselves, can be involved. In
other words, they finally can take their place within the process of their
hexagram, and their role is one of trust or not.
You can see very clearly that the sixth line is never to be trusted until it’s had its
Saturn return. Don’t trust anybody; don’t trust anybody under 30 who has a
sixth line theme. And then you can trust them in their aloofness because in
their aloofness by disengaging, they become objective. It’s like looking at, I
Manifesting & Generating Channels and Circuitry 201
think it’s the 1.6, at the pure objectivity that’s possible in creativity. It’s out of
the sixth line, this objectivity that arises out of aloofness and then out of that,
the capacity to be trusting.
You can trust in what they say about the validity of the law. They are respected
elders in the classic sense of that. They’re the ones that you really go to and
say, “Look, what do you really think? We need your guidance.” Sixth line
themes are themes of being able to provide guidance. And all of that is being
conditioned by where that sixth line is, whether it is a profile theme, what the
Type is, because you’re only going to get into a situation where you’re going to
be able to fulfill the potential of any line by living out your Type. It always
comes back to that.
Live out your Type, live out your authority in definition and then in return,
those aspects of you will have their opportunity to come out. Those first lines
will do their homework. Those second lines will be called. The third lines will
make their mistakes. You’ll go through the whole thing. We have all of that
inside of us.
I have a third line mind. It’s all third line except for my 61.1, and it’s all
unconscious. So, my mind has been bumping into things I didn’t even know
about for years. If you understand the nature of the line themes and you know
how you work, you can relax in your life. You can relax inside of your body.
But pay attention to these format definitions and to these defense circuit
channels.
These five generative channels have enormous impact. They just do. They
generate all by themselves out of a response to being in the world and each and
every one of them carries deep impact and effect. And if these people are
living out their design, if they’re letting their aura do the talking, then they’re
really going to benefit in their life process and those around them from their
capacities.
After all, if you are only going to approach energy of that kind or have energy
come into your life, if it is correct for you, if you’re living out you’re Type, then
it can be an enormous advantage. But never forget that they do carry, because
they’re pure Generating channels. It’s not like a projected channel, and there
are more projected channels than anything else.
202 Channels By Type
You really have to see that this is an energy that’s there. It’s always working.
It’s always pumping. No Generator is ever still even while it’s waiting. So that
energy field is out there and everybody is taking it in, so these are very
important channels.
It’s very important for those Generators who carry that to recognize that by
living out their Type, that because these things are so powerful, that they’re not
going to have a distorted or disruptive effect on others in their life. And as a
result, they’re not going to meet resistance. They’re going to find the rightful
allies for those kinds of powers that are inherent in this kind of design. And
that’s all, and if I left anything out, tell me tomorrow, okay.
