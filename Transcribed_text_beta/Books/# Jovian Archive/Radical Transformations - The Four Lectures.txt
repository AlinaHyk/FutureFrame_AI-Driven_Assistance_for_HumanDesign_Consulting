DETERMINATION
Nice to see you; nice, particularly those of you that came here, I think that‘s great.
It‘s a nice place to spend a weekend in Ibiza. And maybe by the time we get
through, there will be some sunshine for you at the end of the day, which would be
nice. It‘s always an irony for me, I do things for people in Ibiza; never mind, I‘m
glad you‘re all here.
Radical Transformation, one of the things that I'm entering into in my career is going
back to working with people personally in their auras, something I haven‘t done for a
very long time. What I've begun to see about the work that I've been doing in Radi-
cal Transformation, trying to get people to understand that there is a radical ap-
proach to this knowledge, that for those who are really interested in supposedly what
the spiritual path is all about, if you really want to align yourself to what's correct, it
is quite a thing to step into.
Working in a Wa
I think that when you only get that abstractly, I think when you only get that virtual-
ly, or you learn about it, it's not really quite the same thing. Just having come from
Toronto where we had our annual event, it's always remarkable to me what happens
when you bring people together in an aura. We happen to be in a Wa in this particu-
lar configuration. It means that all of us in very specific ways are taking advantage
of everybody else's potential, which is one of the most interesting things about com-
plex auras. It means that the kinds of things that I will talk about over these two
days and the kinds of things that I will work with, with you, that the impact in one of
you is an impact that will be in everyone.
Shattering Barriers
Basically these kinds of gatherings are really about trying to shatter something.
Everybody's got things that have to be shattered. It doesn't matter whether you've
been in this a long time or you just arrived. Everybody has stuff that's waiting to be
shattered. The more intelligent you are, which is always a problem in Human De-
sign, the easier it is to rationalize and protect and defend those very barriers that
need to be shattered.

So, this kind of experience is about—I‘m sick and tired of people on the spiritual path
who don't take their life seriously. And I don't mean seriously without humor. I
mean that they don't take the process seriously. They‘re waiting for some kind of
miracle to happen. Most people that I know that I've met over all the years are
always waiting for a miracle. This is the thing that they‘re counting on. It‘s the
cosmic lottery ticket. They're all saying ―Okay I'm a good person. I'm waiting for
the cosmic lottery ticket. Let them show up. I deserve this.‖
This is about You
I'm a profound atheist. I am not somebody who assumes for a moment that there is
going to be divine intervention that's going to take place if you want to make a cor-
rection in your life. It's about you. And it's only about you. It isn't about anybody
else. And this is also one of the dilemmas. So many people that I've met in this
process try to become something because they want to make an impression on
somebody else. They want to show somebody else, they want to prove something.
It becomes a some kind of an ego maneuver, all of this stuff.
This is not for anybody else. It's only for you. As a matter of fact, if you really get
to the place in this process where you really can fulfill your potential, it will never
matter about anybody else, because it's not what it's about. It's only about you. It‘s
only you who can make this happen. It's only you who can take that journey. And
the joke, because I do love jokes, is that there is no choice. When you put those
two things together, you get a bizarre irony.
Awareness is Seeing What’s Going On
The reality is that you're either on a path that is going to take you to that place or
not. You cannot force yourself to do any of the things that I‘m going to describe this
weekend. You cannot make that happen. It will not happen. Anymore than you can
make enlightenment happen. It doesn't happen that way. It has to happen. One of
the most beautiful things about awareness is that awareness is not about trying to
figure out what's going on. It's about watching what's going on. It's about seeing
what's going. And it's about in that recognition recognizing that you are moving in a
direction that's correct for you.
It Starts with Strategy and Authority
Everything about Human Design starts with the basic thing. Anything that I will
discuss with you this weekend has no value if you're not living your Strategy and
Authority. It doesn‘t. It just becomes intellectual crap, other stuff that you can just
turn around and doesn't really make any difference in your life, because everything

about mechanism begins with the core of this. And the core of this is that you have
to operate correctly in terms of your design.
It doesn't matter what you are. In this environment, here we have actually a dis-
proportionate number of Manifestors. We have two Manifestor women and me. We
have two Manifesting Generators, a couple of two or three pure Generators, a couple
of Projectors, no Reflectors in this particular group. But each and every one of us
has a basic mechanism in terms of the way we‘re here to operate correctly.
If you live that mechanism everything else becomes natural for you, because in fact,
the thing that's so simple in a way to grasp about us is that because we move—
everything is movement—the way we navigate on this plane, the way we go from
this to that and the next thing, all of this is decision-making. If you're making deci-
sions with your mind, you're never going to get to that place where you have no idea
that you could get there.
That‘s the thing that I find so interesting. Most human beings who fantasize about
their spiritual potential have no idea what that looks like because they don't know
who they are. And it has nothing to do with halos and all that stuff. The great tra-
gedy for me is that human beings truly don't know who they are, so they cannot
project out there what they think they should be or can be.
If you're living what you are, instead of projecting what you think you should be or
what you should get, you get to see what's there. And you get to see that the gifts
that are inherent in you—and we‘re going to look at those gifts—that the gifts that
are inherent in you are designed to deal with precisely what your movement is sup-
posed to be, and not the other way around.
Dietary regimen is not going to do anything for you if you can't operate according to
your Strategy and Authority. It won‘t, because the very decision to do it—I can say
to you eat correctly according to your design, if your inner authority goes ―uh-uh‖
then don't do it. It‘s not about me saying you have to do this. It‘s not true. This is
not what this is about. It‘s not about being sheep, it‘s not about following orders.
It's not about having any generalization because we're all unique. And the way in
which you approach anything has to be correct for you, regardless of who is putting
up whatever in front of you.
Liberation from the Power of Mind to Distort Our Lives
The reality is that all of us were born conditioned; all of us. All of us, at some point
in our process, have entered into a deconditioning process. But in fact, we are never
going to be able to fulfill the potential of this vehicle the way a child is that is born
that operates correctly and is raised correctly from the moment it comes into the
world. We've got tons of baggage, all kinds of conditioned baggage that we carry
inside of us.

It is not an easy thing for a human being mentally to clean out the closets. Human
beings carry that crap around forever. It‘s one of the things you get to see in a de-
sign. We have three awareness centers, so-called, and the mind is the cruelest be-
cause its frequency is all time. You make a mistake today and 40 years from now, if
you're lucky enough to be alive, you‘re still going to be going ―ah, shit, I could have,
I might have, they could have, they should have,‖ carrying all that stuff as if your
mind was responsible in the first place.
This is the great seduction of mind. Mind says ―I‘m certain. I‘ve got the answer.
I‘m certain, so let‘s go do it.‖ And it‘s a disaster, because that's what your mind is
not for. And it‘s not there to torment you either. The whole thing about Strategy
and Authority that people don‘t grasp is that this is the most incredible thing that's
ever happened to us because it liberates us from the power of mind to distort our
lives. And it‘s decision-making, because your mind will always mess you up. Every-
body's mind; you don't want to be inside of Krishnamurti‘s mind, it was a horrible
place. Any of these so-called gurus, masters, enlightened this and that, their minds
were constantly swirling around in their own crap because that's what mind does.
Something to really grasp, Strategy and Authority frees you from your mind fooling
you that it knows what's good for you. It does not. It‘s only when you enter onto
that path that anything can change for you. It‘s not up to your mind to decide
whether it's right for you to eat this way or that way, because no matter who you are
I can make it sound good. Your mind can easily say okay, I'll believe that. Then you
don‘t have any authority and you don‘t have any truth of your own.
This is Not Something You Have to Do
So, the thing to recognize about all of these things, this is not a commandment. This
is not something that you have to do. This is a doorway that opens up that says,
―Here‘s a possibility.‖ Is it correct for you now? And if not now when? And it may
never be for you; understand that. Not everybody is going to be able to differentiate
on this plane who started off conditioned. The vast majority of people that meet
Human Design and experiment with Strategy and Authority what they discover is it‘s
easier.
It doesn't mean that they‘re enlightened, awake. It means that they're coming close
to actually being the kind of person they're supposed to be, making decisions that
are correct for them. But, it doesn‘t mean they‘re transforming their entire process.
It doesn't mean that they're getting to live out what's inherent in everybody's de-
sign, an incarnation cross, a profile, a design, a purpose on this plane, a role to play,
a movie to act out in, a storyline to live. And each of it being deeply, deeply unique;
it‘s the beauty of this.
The beauty of this is understanding that each and every one of us are not limited by
the way in which the conditioned not-self world has created all these different ways
to structure what we‘re supposed to be and can be. There are no rules. There are

Determination
no generalizations. There is only the possibility that‘s there in each human being to
fulfill their process.
Passenger Consciousness
In doing that, everybody thinks there‘s some kind of big reward in that. I can tell
you there isn‘t. Stupid before enlightenment, stupid after enlightenment; it‘s still
life. You still have to eat and work. You still have to deal with human beings. You
still have to deal with what life is. But it's not the same. It's not the same because
you are not connected to it in the same way, that you‘re a passenger. It‘s what we
are here for, is the perfection of our process. We‘re here as passenger conscious-
ness. We‘re here to watch the perfection of these forms on this plane. That‘s the
magic that‘s there for us.
But the life itself? Life is always mundane. It‘s what I like about it. You get your
fingers dirty. This is life. But it‘s about who you are in that process. Are you con-
stantly trapped in the whole mental trip of being on this plane? That's where most
people are. What to do, what not to do; what to think, what not to think; when to
act, when not to act; how to act, all that stuff, on and on, instead of just seeing that
this mechanism that you have is designed to exist. You can just sit back and let it
be. You can watch it. You can see that it‘s something really marvelous. That takes
courage.
Surrendering the Power of Your Mind to Distort Your Life
In the spiritual world people are always talking about surrender; surrender, surrend-
er, surrender, surrender. Follow your Strategy and Authority. That‘s surrender.
That‘s actually what it is. And what you're surrendering is you're surrendering the
power of your mind to distort your life. You‘re giving it up. You don't stop it. You
can never stop the box. I know. I have one myself; it rattles on and on. That's
what minds do. It‘s what they always do. If I listen to my mind I would not be here
today. I don‘t know where I‘d be, but I wouldn‘t be here. I wouldn't be in my mar-
riage, and I wouldn't have children and God knows what.
Listen to my mind? I remember when I was listening to my mind, what that circus
looked like. But it's still my mind. It still operates the way it's always operated. It
still has its ―this and that.‖ ―Oh, there is this and that. Oh, this is better than that.‖
Sure! The whole thing is I don't fall for it anymore. It's been decades. My mind
says, ―That‘s better. That‘s better. Let‘s do it.‖ I don‘t do anything. I‘m a splenic
Manifestor. I wait for my Spleen to do something. If it doesn't do anything, I don't
do anything.
I love it when my mind says to me, ―You should really call that person.‖ And of
course, my mind knows that I‘m a Manifestor, so it likes to pick on me. It says, you
should really inform them. You should really inform them now.‖ And I sit back there

in my movie and I watch and I noticed something that's really wonderful. My hands
don't move. I don't go grabbing for the phone. It‘s just mind being mind.
And the very next moment, if I had made that phone call and it was a terrible thing
to do, absolutely the wrong thing to do, my mind would then say to me, let's do
something else now, okay. And you can trust me on this next one. After three mil-
lion times during a normal life you really shouldn't trust it anymore, because as we
do all the time it‘s our mind going (sound). And you go, oh yeah, right, sure.
Outer Authority
That‘s what Strategy and Authority is about. Strategy and Authority says, ―Mind, do
all the measuring you like. Enjoy it.‖ And it's not that it's pointless. I will watch as
my mind processes something and then whenever, a day later, a week later, I splen-
ically manifest something. It‘s a byproduct of the collection of information and all of
the things that mind does. Mind is valuable. Your mind is at its best in outer author-
ity, what I'm doing here. This is what we‘re all here for is to be able to express our
outer authority, our unique awareness. It‘s the whole point.
Transforming Your Life on the Surface
But you can't get to the place where your mind is innocent until you strip it of the
illusion that it has the power to dictate what you're supposed to be and what you're
supposed to do, because it doesn't have that right. And as long as you‘re there you
can't get anywhere else. One of the things I‘ve talked about for years is that to
transform your life you do it on the surface. For the vast majority of human beings,
that's where they live, that's where they‘re stuck, on the surface. They never break
through. You can't break through as long as your mind is tormenting you and con-
trolling you. You can't. The mind creates so much psychic pain for human beings
that for many of them they can barely function. It‘s cruel.
And it's only when you get to that point that you can trust in something else—why
do you think you hold onto your mind? You think it‘s the only thing that can help
you. You think it‘s the only thing that can figure out what's good for you. Strategy
and Authority is saying there‘s another place inside of you that is capable of making
the decisions that you need to have made in this life that will liberate your mind so
that you can begin to see it.
What I will show you tomorrow, I will show you ways to focus on seeing your mind
so you can free yourself of the illusion that it's actually serving you, because it‘s not.
At its best, it‘s here to serve others. That‘s what mind is good for. We‘re here to
commune with each other. One of the most important things that we can do in this
life is to communicate with each other in a way that is correct and honest. And it is
unique. Instead of what we get, which is the constant repetition, the constant bab-
ble, the same stuff repeated over and over and over again, the same clichés that

everybody nods their heads to. Instead of having within you the recognition that
what you have to contribute is important, is significant, because there‘s nothing like
it. It‘s what uniqueness is.
MMAI
So let‘s get to the subject of this morning. I'm going to take you through the four
steps of transformation. This is the graph of today, so the assumption somebody
being born at this particular moment. What you're looking at, by the way, is Maia
Mechanics Advanced Imaging. Advanced Imaging was developed about four years
ago now. It was an effort of mine to be able to put together visually into a graph all
the deeper knowledge of Human Design, the work that was done in Rave Psychology
and Primary Health System, to be able to see the underlying themes, the underlying
structure of the Colors, the Tones, the Bases, all the information.
The Four Arrows, Variable
And so, in this kind of configuration it is possible to see all of the basic data of a
Human Design calculation graphically displayed. And one of the most important

elements of this are these four arrows. They are called Variable. And everything
about these arrows is their Left-ness or their Right-ness, and this is a theme that's
very important. The arrows Left and Right are determined by the Tone underneath.
You see the Tone here in this triangle.
Left and Right Orienting Tones
There are six Tones. The first three Tones are Left-orienting Tones. So, if you have
a tonal configuration, for example in the charts that I gave you, if you look at these
little triangles on the side, on either side, the Personality side over here and the
Design side over here, if you have anything from 1, 2 or 3, it's pulling it Left. And if
you have 4, 5 or 6 it‘s pulling it Right.
Left: Focused and Strategic
And basically we‘re made up of these four combinations of Left-ness and Right-ness.
This is something that's very, very important. And it's important at many levels.
But most of all, it‘s about the learning process. Left-ness is about being focused and
strategic; focused and strategic. In fact, we come out of a history of Left-ness. That
is, the seven-centered being, our predecessors, were Left-oriented. Neanderthals
before them were Right-oriented. We‘re a bridge. We are Left and Right. We‘re
moving towards an era of Right-ness.
So when we carry Left and Right inside of us, we‘re actually carrying the past and
the future, and the past and the future that we live holistically as this now. But
they‘re very different. Our history was based on strategic thought. Yet the reality is
that since 1781 half of all children being born are Right-minded. They‘re carrying a
totally different way of dealing with the phenomena of existence.
Right: Peripheral and Receptive
Now, Rightness is about being peripheral and receptive. So it's extremely different.
It is diametrically different to the Left-ness. We all have this combination in us. And
for many human beings the Right-ness that they carry becomes a dilemma in the
way in which they're raised, the way in which they're conditioned, the way in which
they learn.
The example of my son, Loki, he‘s three parts Right, one part Left. So, when he
started to go into senior school, my advice to him was never study. Just pay atten-
tion. Don‘t study. Study is strategic. It's Left. It‘s focused. It‘s digging into some-
thing. It‘s burrowing in. It‘s grabbing it that way. But if you‘re Right, you can't
work that way. If you are a Right person, you can't even remember whether the

book you read last week is a book you actually read. It takes you a while to go
through it again and say, oh gee, I read that. And it‘s not because you forgot it.
Who is in Your Life?
This is the whole thing about being Right, about being receptive, is that you're taking
everything in; everything. And you're taking everything in without focus. You're
taking everything in without agenda. And you yourself can't get it back out. This is
the dilemma of Right-ness. And all the beings that carry Right-ness on this plane
are the beings that are so deeply dependent on their associations, who is in your life.
But if you're a child and you‘re Right-minded and you grow up in a neighborhood of
kids that are under nourished and under educated, you‘re going to be an under edu-
cated mind. And you're only going to talk and communicate at that level, because
that's what it's all about for you. And when somebody asks you something at that
level you deliver at that level. The same child, same design, same everything, go
into another environment where their childhood friends are better educated and so
forth and so on, so will they, because they are only going to mirror what they receive
in the communion with those around them.
In other words, the level of awareness that you have is determined by your associa-
tions. One of those things in Human Design that‘s so important to grasp is that the
most important decision that you make in your Strategy and Authority is who you let
into your life, because who you let into your life has an enormous impact.

The First Step in Transformation: Determination
So we have these four arrows. And out of these four arrows what we get is a pro-
gression that starts up here at the Sun/Earth Design; this is the first step in trans-
formation. Now, the Design Sun/Earth, what they represent physically for us is our
brain system. Now obviously, the brain system is very complex. When you're talk-
ing about the brain system you're actually talking about the whole core of the way in
which the vehicle, the body, operates.
Now, this brain system that we see in the Sun/Earth, what we're dealing with here is
something that's called determination. Determination is about the potential that
everybody has to differentiate by having their specific diet, and a specific diet that
has nothing to do with food. One of the first things to recognize about uniqueness is
that uniqueness is not a personality chimera. It isn‘t. Uniqueness is something that
goes very, very deep within us.
Now, one of the most important things for us to understand is that as we‘ve evolved
as a species our digestive system has evolved along with us. And when you're look-
ing at this particular graphing here, if you go down to the very bottom here where it
says ―appetite,‖ number 1 and you move upwards to number 6, what you're looking
at is an evolutionary process. You're looking at the evolution of the digestive system
in human beings, beginning with number 1, which is the cave person and going all
the way up to number 6 in which you have the most deeply sensitive of the digestive
systems. We go from the most primitive digestive systems to the most sensitive
digestive systems.
The Conditions
If you look in the middle you can see that there's a line here that separates what is
called upper and lower, the bottom three are the lower, and the upper. And you can
see that they have keynotes. The lower three Colors are called conditions. So if you
look at your graphing, and you look at your Design Sun/Earth, if you have 1, 2 or 3
then what you're looking at is that you're looking at the most severe demands for
you in terms of your digestive system because your digestive system is basically
primitive.
The 1st Color: Cave
It starts with number 1. So if we look at the number 1, what we‘re looking at is this
is the cave person. Again remember we‘re talking about six divisions of seven billion
on the planet, approximately. So we're talking about 1.2 billion people who will have
this 1st Color digestive system. Now, in most places in the world they're not going to
get the chance to have that kind of diet. This is a cave diet. It‘s one thing at a time.

Determination
And when I say one thing at a time, I mean one thing. You want salt? Take a pinch
of salt and put it on your tongue; one thing at a time.
The Left Brain Needs to be Well Fed
The thing to understand about the primitive diet, there are places in the world, ob-
viously, not nice places where people are starving and all that kind of stuff—and by
the way, in places where there is famine, something that is very odd but something
really important to understand, when you're looking at the Design Sun/Earth you're
looking at brain systems that are either going to be Left or Right. Now the Left brain
system, what we‘re looking at here, the bottom three, the Left brain system needs to
be well fed. It‘s very, very important for it to have a regular diet. In other words,
don't go hungry; don't miss a meal, those kinds of things. But the Right, which is
the three above, they‘re very different. They don't need, the brain does not need as
much food. As a matter of fact, it‘s unhealthy for it.
In famine areas where children unfortunately are deeply disadvantaged in terms of
food access, it's the Right-brained children that don‘t suffer the mental damage that
the Left-brained children suffer from the starvation that they go through. Not that
that's a help to the Left-brained children, but nonetheless, it‘s something to under-
stand about the difference between the lower conditions and the upper circums-
tances is that the brain system from the conditions it needs regular food. And when
you're looking above, it doesn't need as much. In other words, over eating is really
a problem.

Fasting
For example, if you have 1 to 3 you should never fast. People who have from 1 to 3,
people who have conditions, should never fast. People from 4 to 6, fasting is some-
thing that is all right for them under the correct conditions, obviously because I've
done long fasts—and I‘m the upper part—I know the kind of care that you have to
take for your system when you do that.
Feeding Your Differentiation
Okay, the very first one is the most simple. In other words, what you're talking
about is a very primitive digestive system. Remember we‘re not talking about food.
What we're talking about is if you are following your dietary regimen, the food you
take in, whatever it is, you process it, you digest it in such a way that it feeds what
is your specific differentiation. In other words, it helps you become individual.
Cognition/Senses
Let me give you an example. The Tone underneath, that Tone that creates whether
we're going to have Left-ness or Right-ness, those six Tones are incredibly important
to us because that's what we are all about. The Tone represents cognition. It's our
cognitive architecture. It is the Tone that gives us that special something that we
call our inherent intelligence.

Page 12
Radical Transformations – The Four Lectures
Determination
And when you're looking at the Tone, the Tone basically is operating through six
senses or what is called senses in this case. And when we're looking at them, for
example, here you can see in this particular drawing that we've got the 3rd Tone.
And when you're looking at the 3rd Tone, that 3rd Tone is called outer vision. You can
see it here on the side under cognition.
So basically what happens to you when you're digesting food correctly, when you're
taking the right regimen in, what you're doing is you're feeding one's sense. It
doesn‘t mean the others are being starved. But what it‘s meaning is that you are
here, this person for example that's born today, is here to be an outer vision person.
In other words, their most powerful sense in terms of their physical acuity, because
we‘re talking on the body side, is that they're going to have very powerful eyes, that
their eyes are going to have very, very—they're going to be able to have this kind of
pinpoint outer vision, they‘re going to be able to look out in the world. They‘re going
to be able to see very, very clearly and visual stimulation is going to be incredibly
important for them, because that's what they're here for.
As an adult, as they mature if they‘re eating correctly, their vision is actually becom-
ing more acute and they are able to see, in a sense, what others cannot see. In
other words, they‘re able to take in information visually that is very special. It is
that visual information that's part of the basis of how they are going to develop their
overall holistic awareness. Each and every one of you have a specific sense that is
there to be fed, that is the key to the way in which your brain system is going to
work.
Intelligent People
It was very interesting for me in the early years of my work. I‘ve always been fortu-
nate; I‘ve always worked with intelligent people. But I realized that there was al-
ways a place where they couldn't go any further. You can grasp a concept without
actually being able to even come close to living it. And you can think you grasp
things when in fact you really don't, because you don't get to the next place that
that‘s setting you up for. You just don‘t get there.
And it was clear to me that a lot of that is just simply that their brain systems are
handicapped. If you're not feeding yourself correctly, it's not about that your body
thinks to begin with, it‘s about understanding you‘re not feeding your brain correctly.
So what happens is that instead of that pinpoint accuracy of your diet feeding your
sensory capacity, you're throwing these huge buckets of paint to cover this little
spot. And you're not getting the advantage of what your sensory system can provide
you.

Highlighting Your Sensory System
So one of the things to really be so aware of is really about understanding that when
we're talking about dietary regimen we're not just simply talking about okay, you're
a cave person, you eat one thing at a time. Your eating one thing at a time is going
to highlight that sensory system that you have. The highlighting of that sensory
system is going to change the way in which you take in your environment in your
life. There are consequences to all that. And beyond that, when you're operating
correctly, and you're providing your system with the way in which it can digest suc-
cessfully, the byproduct of that obviously is that you are going to be physically
healthy.
Now, one the most dramatic things to see is to look at 1st Color people and what
happens to them when they enter into that diet. Because they‘re the most primitive,
they also have the most powerful reaction. We have many examples in the Human
Design community of people that went from this to this whose body, whose skin, all
kinds of things changed through this process because it's so extreme. After all, this
is a very extreme diet.
This is Either Correct for You or Not
Now, this goes back to what I started with today. I know there are a couple of you
here who have the 1st Color diet. You can‘t have me tell you to do this because
you‘re going to hate this diet. ―That son of a bitch is making me eat this. I don't
want to do this anymore.‖ It's not the way it works. It either has to be correct for
you or not. And if it's not correct for you it‘s not like something wrong has happened
to you. It‘s just simply that this is not the time. It‘s just not the time. There may
never be a time.
Again, the whole thing here is about understanding that this is your process. How
your process evolves is how your process evolves. But the thing is that when you
get to talk to people who've been doing this kind of diet for three, four, five years
now they're in heaven. They found their thing, because you have to go through this
whole—anyone who has a 1st Color diet has to go through this whole process of
changing the conditioning of their palette that went on through their whole life, their
concepts about what is good and what isn‘t good, the memories of the smell of foods
that they think are better than others, all of this stuff.
For most of those beings they don't really get it until they go back and forth, be-
cause that's when they begin to get sick, and usually when you get sick you get the
message. It‘s one of those things that just works.

The 2nd Color: The Gatherer
If you‘re a 2—I‘ve got a special thing about 2s. I love the 2 frequency because I
think it's one of the great miracles of evolution. Everything about the 2 is that
somehow it has the potential that nobody knew was necessary. This is one of the
remarkable things about it. And everything about the 2nd Color diet is that the 2nd
Color diet is extremely rigid in the way in which it needs to eat regularly; the same
thing day after day. We go from the cave person with their one thing at a time to
the gatherer that basically is going out there and is collecting the local goodies.
Eat Local Produce
It‘s very important, by the way, if you‘re 2nd Color to eat as much local produce as
you can, what comes from the area that you're living in. Imported goods, ultimate-
ly, foodstuffs are not necessarily going to be particularly healthy. The most impor-
tant thing, you can see this in a 2 baby—the 2 baby, you‘ve got a spoonful of some-
thing, if it's the open kind of baby it will immediately open its mouth and let the
spoon in. And if it doesn't like it, it will spit it out.
You are Here to be Discerning
The closed baby won't even let you put the spoon in its mouth because it knows
before it even gets there that it doesn't want to have anything to do with that. Of
course, we know what mothers do, unfortunately, it‘s not their fault, what they do in
these circumstances, because they‘re saying, look, baby, this is healthy, this is good
for you, open your mouth, and eventually they find ways of stuffing it in there. The
reality is that if you have a 2nd Color diet you are here to be discerning.
They used to have these kind of desert island trivia questions, what book would you
take to a desert island, what movie. Well if you‘re a 2, what diet would you take?
What do you want for breakfast? What do you want for lunch? What do you want
for dinner? What is available seasonally, because the only changes that you can
make in such a diet are seasonal changes, something goes out, something new,
something is fresh in that season so you can go through those kinds of changes. But
everything about being a 2 is finding exactly what's perfect for you and staying with
it.
I have the great joke of a sister of mine who is a 2. She suffered enormously in our
family from being so bizarre about food. She insisted on eating the same things.
She didn't know any different. It was hilarious when I finally told her about her diet.
She would go to extremes to find—she wouldn‘t simply buy the same product, but it
was the same product from the same producer.

But the thing about that is you have to recognize something about diet. Being able
to digest what you take into your system and take the best from it for you is really
an incredible thing. The other thing is, you're going to know whether this is correct
for you or not. If it doesn't feel good you can‘t do this. You can‘t do this because
you think you should do this or because somebody says it's right for you to do this
and on and on and on and on. It has to be something that you enter into as yourself
and only in that way are you going to begin to see whether or not this is correct for
you.
For a child that‘s born this way it‘s so simple. You never force the 2 child. You just
never force them. You let them decide what their diet is going to be. You trust
them. But as adults, of course, we‘ve been so deeply conditioned. These first two
groups, you can see the term here, rigid, primitive, these two together, these are the
most primitive of our digestive systems, which means they are the most extreme.
So it takes a deep discipline. And you can only be there if it's correct for you. You
can‘t be there because of something else.
The 3rd Color: Hot/Cold
When you get to the next two that bridge, the center here, you‘re dealing with some-
thing else. You're dealing with forces that are energetic. And when you're dealing
with the 3 you're dealing with hot and cold. This was always my classic example to
shock people. I‘m a 51 so I like to shock people. The classic example of shock is to
think about the child that is born and they are a 3rd Color and they‘re cold. That is,

Determination
they‘re on the Right side. That child that‘s cold, that the only thing that it should
take into its body are those things, liquids and foods, that are below body tempera-
ture. So think about that child coming into the world and being at its mother's
breast. Right away you have instantaneous conditioning.
The other side of that is the hot side. Interesting that my youngest son is cold and
he was born two and a half months premature and never had that. He was given
warm milk, though. It‘s just bizarre the way the mechanisms work that nature in its
own way tries to work these things out. We ignore all of that.
The Cold: An Overheated System
And then on the other side of that is that you have the hot. Now think about the
way that works. The child that has cold, basically what they have is an overheated
system. It‘s just overheated. And because it's overheated, anything that they're
taking into their system they're burning off what they need. So if they're putting hot
food in on top of their hot system it is all wasted away.
The Hot: Very Weak Digestive Systems
The other side, of course, the hot side is that you have those people that have very,
very weak digestive systems that run cold. They cannot burn off what they need to
burn off and need the heat for the chemical reaction. So you have the hot side
where everything has to be above body temperature. So those are conditions. The
conditions are very, very specific in these three Colors.
The 4th Color: Calm/Nervous
When we go above we begin to change because we‘re moving into circumstances.
I'm a 4th Color. And I‘m a 4th Color on the Left side. That is, I‘m a calm. And fun-
damentally what that means is that it‘s not about me being calm. It's about me
being in a calm environment when I eat. My instant reaction in an environment
where I'm eating where somebody's being disturbing is to be an aggressive Manifes-
tor and hit them. For me eating is supposed to be calm. And of course, that‘s my
prejudice because that's me.
The other side of the coin is my son, Loki, who‘s nervous. He‘s the other side. So if
we‘re having dinner together and it's calm it‘s bad for him. If we‘re having dinner
together and it's disturbing it‘s lousy for me. It‘s really something to grasp about
how important it is. I take most of my meals alone, calm. It‘s wonderful. It‘s just
wonderful.

Circumstances
It‘s something really to grasp about how important it is to see that these upper Col-
ors are always going to be about the world you‘re in. It‘s not about you controlling
your own digestive process the way the lower Colors do, because for them it's very
specific. There are conditions that are involved; temperature conditions, restrictions
on what one can eat, one thing at a time, these are conditions. But above it be-
comes more complex in the sense that you have to take in consideration the envi-
ronment around you.
So, it's not about my son needs to be nervous while he's eating. I will tell somebody
that has a nervous dietary regimen, don't sit through a meal. If you sit through a
meal you must be in prison. It‘s like sitting here; whoa, I need to move, I need to
do something. These are people that eat while they‘re walking and can eat and
dance. It doesn‘t make any difference for them. They need the energy. They‘re the
kinds of people that get up and talk on the phone while they‘re eating, all this stuff.
It's all about just simply living who you are. And this is what embeds it the deepest
into our system, because our first dilemma is our bodies. If you get the body thing
right everything else comes along, because this is where the whole movie is played
out. Taking in your nutrition correctly has enormous advantages for you in terms of
energy. For example, Projectors, if you‘re a Projector and you're following your die-
tary regimen, you‘re going to have much more residual power—I don‘t want to con-
fuse terms by talking about energy—real residual power that is there that you can
take advantage of without being the typical Projector exhausted, because it's so easy
for Projectors to be exhausted. Again, if you're taking the right nutrition into your
system, it makes an enormous difference in the basic vitality that‘s there in your
body.
The 5th Color: Sound
When we get to the upper part we get to the most sensitive. In essence we're get-
ting to the most modern. These are digestive systems that have actually emerged
over the last 300 years, so they‘re relatively new and very much connected to our
modern world. The first thing is the 5. This is sound. Again, we're dealing with
environment here. We‘re not dealing with the sound inside of somebody. We‘re
dealing with the acoustic environment that surrounds them.
For example, if you're a high person, if you're on the left side, you need sound
around you when you eat. These are people that I tell put your iPod in, plug-in, turn
up the volume and enjoy your meal, because you're really here to have sound
around. These are people that are perfect—there are very few people that belong in
restaurants. But 5s on the Left, particularly the [unknown Spanish word] restau-
rants, they‘re perfect, the hustle and the bustle and the noise and everything.
They‘re terrific in there.

Technology and Sound
But if they bring their friend who is on the other side, unless they're carrying Bose
sound reduction headphones and have them on they‘re not going to have a good
meal because they need silence. And what‘s so interesting about that is the modern
connection. They‘re really reconnected to our technologies, these two. Our capacity
to be able to carry portable noise; all of us carry portable noise now. We can all plug
in.
And the other side of that, the technology to eliminate noise, which is also something
very profound and important for people who have the passive side of this, the low in
the sound, to be able to have a soundproof room. To be able to have sound discon-
necting headphones is something that's really important for them because they need
silence. Sound is going to be very, very disturbing to their digestive process and
they‘re not going to be able to digest correctly.
The 6th Color: Light
And when we get to the final grouping here we get to the light. And for me it‘s the
most fascinating to work with, particularly the Right side because I work with a lot of
indirects. Here we‘re dealing with the light. So we've gone beyond people. We've
gone into another dimension here, really. It‘s the end of this process. It is the most
sophisticated and most sensitive. What we‘re dealing with is people, for example,
the direct people. These are people that can only eat when the sun is up. Only eat
when the sun is up. And on the other side, the indirect, I call them nocturnals, the
people that can only eat when the sun is not up, when the sun is down.
Nocturnals
Now, it‘s interesting to think about our planet. Given our huge population we have
an enormous number of people on the planet; it‘s nearly 800 million people who
work while others sleep. It‘s a huge swath of the population. We have in the great
major cities of the world, cities that never close. And in my counseling for people
who are indirect, my guidance for them is to change their lives. Sleep in the day-
time, get night shift work, and eat their meals that way. Some of them have be-
come so successful materially, happier, all of those things because they finally
shifted.
I have one student of mine, a very, very nice woman from Greece and she says at
some point I'm going to teach Human Design to nocturnals nocturnally. But again,
you can see what a step it is to not get caught in the mind trip of ―okay, this is who I
am so this is what I have to do.‖ If you‘re a nocturnal, as an example, that is not an
easy thing to set yourself to, given your conditioning and everything else and the
way in which everybody else eats. There are things to really grasp.

By the way, liquids are not involved in that. Liquids can be taken throughout the day
in any of these diets. And the direct, the same thing, this being limited. For exam-
ple, that's okay if you're living on the equator or in southern climes where you‘ve got
a nice big daytime swath, but if you get into northern countries and you get into the
winter time where your amount of daylight is seven hours, it can be quite a chal-
lenge.
So again, this is something to really see. To be yourself is to recognize that you
have no control over where it leads you, where it leads you in terms of place, life,
and people. It‘s simply about understanding that each and every one of us has a
way in which we can transform this brain system.
Neural Development
When you're born, you get about three years as a not-self conditioned being of neur-
al development. You have this neural expansion that takes place in all babies. It
lasts for three years in most children. The fact is that in prodigies and all of these
things in studies that have been done in super intelligent kids, they get neural shut-
down at about seven. Now I know that neural shutdown is supposed to take place at
seven. We operate in cellular seven-year cycles. All of us including myself had
neural shutdown when we were around three. That's what conditioning does to us.
Now, one of the things about dietary regimen is that it can't give you back anything.
What's been shut down has been shut down. But it's full of gunk. It‘s full of all of
this stuff that has been forced on those different areas of the brain system that do
not serve you, the energy that is going into sensory systems that are not what
you're about, distorting the way in which you take in experience, the way in which
you perceive things. So it's very, very important when you start this process to
grasp that it's got to be correct for you. And if it's correct for you, this is a great
adventure, because this is the beginning of truly transforming yourself.
Ra’s Experience
It‘s what happens in the brain with this slowly but surely. The first thing that I no-
ticed—I've been doing this now for nearly 5 years—the first thing that I noticed was
the energy that I had. I‘ve gone through periods where my teaching load has been
absolutely incredible. And it used to really drag me down. The first thing that I
noticed was the change in my energy level, a sharpness. And I'm an outer vision
person, so seeing things. It may be coincidental to the nature of the work that I was
doing over those years, but I saw things I hadn‘t seen before, all kinds of things that
were very obvious to me in my own process of what a difference it makes.

Setting the Foundation
But it sets the foundation for the rest of what we‘re about. We‘re here to differen-
tiate. And they are links in a chain, one after the other. You start with Strategy and
Authority and then you begin to treat your body correctly. That's the first step.
You're honoring the body's intelligence; the body is going to be able to guide you.
The next step in that is to feed this system correctly.
You‘re not going to put diesel in a gasoline engine unless you‘re really fucked up and
stoned. You wouldn't want to do that to your body. And we have this perfect oppor-
tunity through the knowledge to be able to feed ourselves correctly. Feed yourself
correctly. This is what starts cleaning away all of that residue conditioning that men-
tally you‘re stuck with.
We’re Fear Collectors
We‘re nothing but fear collectors. That‘s what human beings are. We collect fears,
all kinds of them. And we pack them away in all kinds of places for those special
days when we want to scare the hell out of ourselves. And the vast majority of
those fears are ungrounded, but they are rooted in the way in which we perceived
experience and the way in which our lack of awareness dealt with it. And we don't
know how to get rid of them because in most cases we have forgotten that we have
them stored inside of us until they have their moment to pop out.
And they're being fed. I mean that quite literally. They‘re being fed. And they‘re
being fed because you're not feeding your system correctly. If you're feeding what's
correct for you, you're not feeding all that stuff. The fact is that if you‘re supposed
to eat one thing at a time and you start eating many things, all of those other things
that are not supposed to be there are going into your system and they‘re giving
strength to things that are not supposed to be there, that that diet fed all along be-
cause it was part of the conditioning. So you got heavily conditioned by a father or a
mother. You associate that with a certain food. Those things stay with you.
Everything that I‘ve taught over all these years is about understanding that we are
nothing but layers of conditioning. And the only way that you cut through the condi-
tioning is not by thinking you can. It‘s by changing your physical process. It‘s the
physical process that's full of the conditioning. It‘s the mental conditioning that is
energized and holds on because of all that stuff that doesn't belong inside of you, so
it‘s part of getting that out.
Okay, for all us smokers, let's have a break. And when we come back I will go along
and I will look at each of your charts and give you some points.

ENVIRONMENT
There‘s really an amazing thing you get to see in substructure. This morning we
were looking at the Sun/Earth. We were looking at dietary regimen and the brain
system. But the moment we drop down to the Design Nodes, we‘re talking about
something very special. We‘re actually talking about literally your life. It‘s where
your life unfolds. Your life actually unfolds in a line that moves from the design side
to the personality side. This system going across here is called the story line.
It‘s about the way our
life is established
when we get to our
Saturn returns, so by
the time you get to 29
to 30 years of age is
the time you‘re de-
signed to establish
your place in the
world in order to set
in motion what is
going to be your sto-
ry. The story of your
cross, of your profile,
of who you are as a
being.
We have two things
that are important for
our well-being. One
is that we eat correctly according to what is correct for us as individuals. That is
about bringing proper nourishment into the system itself. But we don‘t just live in
here. We have this outside world that is around us. And when we‘re looking at the
Design Nodes, we‘re looking at the world around us that is our outside body.
How do we nourish the outside? We nourish the outside or we turn the outside into
something that‘s nourishing by being in the right environment. Environment is
something that‘s very special because it is not something that has any value when
you come into the world. For the first 28 to 29 years of your life, this is not the

point. There are some subtleties that can be useful in terms of making things easier
with health problems. But basically speaking, it‘s only when you become an adult in
the Saturnian sense that your environment becomes an ingredient for you in your
life. This is how you find and live out your purpose.
The first thing is we have very different vehicles. We‘re 9 centered beings. We have
an Uranian body. Literally, we‘re designed to live on an 84-year plan. On that plan,
it‘s only the last 30 years or so that are really the time for us to flourish. It means
the way we are designed to flourish is after 50. Everything up to 50 is building up
the material and getting ready for that process of the fulfillment of possibility.
We have a dilemma in that of physical well-being, physical health. If you‘re not
healthy long enough, you‘re never going to enjoy those latter years in your process.
So many human beings in the not-self life with bodies that are designed to be func-
tional for 84 years, at least, they end up dying early, being diseased, being senile,
being incapacitated in one way or another and never get to live out the beauty of
what their process can be.
It‘s not just about what you do for yourself on the inside. It‘s about what you do for
yourself in terms of where you are. We are all designed to live in and thrive in a
unique environment. Just as we‘re designed to have a unique dietary regimen. So
environment is something that is extremely important to us. We have this distinc-
tion in that we‘re going to have environments that are Left, and ones that are Right.
Left Environment
When we were looking at the brain system, we saw that this was about food. The
Left brain, regular eating. The Right brain, eating less. But when we‘re looking at
the Leftness and Rightness of the
environment, we‘re looking at
something that is very important as
a distinction. This person being
born today has a Left orientation.
That means their environment, in
order for them to be healthy, al-
ways has to bring out their activity.
These are people who are healthy
when they‘re busy in their envi-
ronment.
Take the example of somebody
who‘s designed to be busy in their
environment and they go over to
somebody‘s house and all they can
do is crash down on a chair. Right away they can know they‘re in the wrong place.
This is a place that‘s unhealthy for them. And because it‘s unhealthy for them, and

Environment
because they don‘t have their normal activity level it means they‘re much more vul-
nerable to negative conditioning in that situation. It‘s very important to understand
that if you have a Left environment, that environment gives you that activity level, a
place where you don‘t sit still and relax – a place that keeps you going and keeps
you busy.
Right Environment
The other side of that is the Right environment people. We‘re looking at the envi-
ronment as a stage, a stage upon which you watch the movie. To be a Right person
means that when you‘re in the right environment you‘re not active at all. You‘re
much more laid back, you‘re much more with your feet up, you‘re much more re-
laxed. It is a very, very different way in which your environment nourishes you. It‘s
really something to understand about the physical environment itself. It‘s another
way of seeing signposts. You can see, for example, if you‘re designed to eat one
thing at a time, you can see that‘s a signpost about your personality. You‘re here to
take things in one at a time.
The environment is also saying something about a foundation of who you are. So if
you‘re Left, you‘re here to be active in this life. This is what‘s good for you. If
you‘re Right, you‘re not here to be active in this life. That‘s what‘s good for you.
The joke that some people are couch potatoes. Some people are designed to be
couch potatoes. It‘s not that there‘s anything wrong with them. They‘re designed to
be couch potatoes. It‘s terrific.
Again, we have all these generalizations about what‘s right and what‘s wrong. The
processes are different. If you‘re Left, you‘re strategic. If you‘re Left in your envi-
ronment you‘re focused on things to do. If you‘re Right, you‘re peripheral. You‘re
here to take in what‘s going
on in your environment. The
dilemma is if nothing is going
on, you have a problem. The
environment is a frame
through which you experience
many things including the
other.
Everything about the Nodes is
about ―you‘re not alone‖ and
―there is the other.‖ What
protects us in our relationship
with the other is being in the
right place. Environment is
everything because environ-
ment protects your aura. It protects the longevity of your vehicle. It gives you the
potential to live a longer, healthier life because it reduces resistance.

Understanding what is your correct environment is incredibly important to your long-
term well-being so you can get to the latter parts of your process and still be funda-
mentally healthy.
So we have this Leftness and this Rightness. Let‘s see the way it breaks down.
Again we have the same story. We‘re looking at Color and Color going through six
stages. The same progression rooted in the six, working from the most primitive
which is the first Color at the bottom, the caves, and working all the way up, this
movement to the most sensitive Color 6 which is shores. As in looking at the dietary
regimen, you can also see that it‘s divided into two parts.
Hardscape: Cave
The lower three Colors are called hardscape, and the upper three colors are called
landscape. The Tones that create the Leftness and Rightness, here you can see
under the Left and under the Right, the tonal variations of these environments on
either side. Later I‘ll go through each of yours specifically. Let‘s look at the frame-
work first.
Hardscape. This is something that‘s very important in our evolutionary develop-
ment. What we were developing is ways that more and more and more of us could
be squashed into the
same space together.
Literally.
Most people think of
a cave and think of
some hermit or
Buddha alone, but if
you go back to our
history, caves were
the first true com-
munal dwellings.
You would have 40,
50, 100 people in a
cave all together.
This is the beginning
of Shanghai. This is
the way these things
work. When you‘re
looking at these first
three colors, you‘re looking at the development of our world in terms of the way our
civilization was built on creating walls around an environment and filling it up with
people.

Environment
So the first thing is the cave. The cave is an interesting thing. The cave, in terms of
the way we perceive it, appears to be an environment that only has one entrance.
Now it may have other secret (entrances) but fundamentally it‘s a concept. It‘s a
one-entrance thing. It‘s what makes a cave a place that can be secured. It‘s why
it‘s a number 1 theme. Fear, security, all these themes of the number 1. Here in
the cave, security is an important thing. There‘s only this one door.
Think about a child who‘s born and is a 1st Color environment and has a room of
their own that has two doors. A door to a bathroom and a door that goes out. Or a
door to a closet and a door that goes out. That child is going to have disturbed
sleep, and something is going to disturb and frighten it. In many of these cases,
these children will demand the lights be on, there‘s ghosts or demons behind the
door. These are cave children. If you put a barrier in front of one of those doors,
like one of these dividing things, just to block the image of it, it would change com-
pletely the child‘s sleeping patterns. Everything would be fine. Again, they would be
secure.
Think about what it‘s like to be a 1st Color environment person. You need to have
the protection of your environment and the control of the entry and exit. In this
way, you‘re safe. You‘re the gatekeeper. You control who comes in and you control
them when they go out because they‘re coming in to your space. There‘ll be a billion
variations of this particular type in the world. A lot of these people are automobile
people. Moving caves. Now, yes, it has more than one door but it is the same thing.
An enclosed, safe space where they can control who gets in or who doesn‘t get in.
These are people who need to have an office rather than working in an open envi-
ronment. They need to protect themselves and have this physical protection that is
in their cave. What the cave is all about, because what all these things are about,
every single one of these environments are about—you could put it in the context of
a dating game. Where do I meet that special one for me? ―Well, you‘ll meet them
when they come into your cave,‖ is the answer for this person because their whole
social life is about bringing people into their cave. Whether it‘s their office while
they‘re working, or their home, it‘s always about bringing people into their cave.
They control the cave.
Now there‘s always something else that‘s going to be there. Just as underneath the
basic dietary regimen, you had the tone, the sense underneath, you also have the
same cognitive potential underneath the environment as well. It lends a quality to
that environment that I‘ll show you when I do yours individually. What‘s important
here is to recognize something.
These are indoor people. They belong indoors. It doesn‘t mean they can‘t go out-
side, but it‘s quick from the house to the car, the car to the office. They‘re indoor
people. That is really something important for them to understand. What happens
to people when they‘re not correct is that they‘re always on the other side. So in-
door people dream of living in the countryside, which is really a joke when you think
about it because they‘re indoor people, after all. It‘s important for them to have the
control mechanisms because that‘s what‘s going to be healthy for them.

Everything about us is if you‘re eating correctly, if you‘re in the right place, hey,
you‘re going to have it go your way. You‘re creating the whole momentum of your
process.
Markets: Internal & External
Every single one of these names can be deconstructed into many levels, just like me
saying the cave person can be in a car. You have to use some imagination. Markets
is all about business. It‘s all about moneymaking. Moneymaking wasn‘t designed to
take place in the valley with two trackers meeting each other. The money business
is something that grew out of these enclosed spaces with all of these people there so
you could have this system of exchange of energy. These people need to be where
the action is. They‘re hardscape people. They‘re fundamentally urban.
Not only that, you can see it‘s divided into Internal and External. External market
people need to be out in the marketplace. The Internal market people have their
business at home and bring everybody into their home to do business with them.
They bring them inward. Working from your house is absolutely perfect for them
because that‘s what they‘re for.
External market people are out there in the urban world where the action is – the
people who live behind or above the store to really be part of what‘s going on. So
often you meet somebody who is urban like Markets, and they go, ―Yeah, but I‘ve
always wanted to live out in the country.‖ This is what they are all about.
Not only that, but the whole thing about environment is that it is the bedrock of your
material success in life. If you‘re not in the right environment, you‘re not going to
do well. If you‘re a cave person who‘s operating in a business where you‘re sitting in
an open environment, you‘re never going to succeed. Never. Never. Never‘s a big
word.
It‘s about understanding how important environment is for you. It is a key. It is a
key at the material level. The longevity of the vehicle, the well-being of your life
over a long period of time isn‘t just dependent on physical matters. It‘s dependent
on resources. If you don‘t have resources, your vehicle can deteriorate because you
cannot nourish it with what‘s necessary. Those resources within the context of how
we live, this is the material life. This is what you do in the material plane. It‘s not
about the material plane being a struggle. It‘s not what we‘re about. It‘s simply
about understanding that if you‘re a market person, and you‘re not playing the mar-
ket game, you‘re crazy, because this is where you belong. This is the world you
belong in.

Environment
Kitchens: Wet & Dry
Kitchens is really interesting from a number of levels. As you can see from the Left
and Right side, the wet and the dry, these are people who have very strong reactions
to the wrong kind of humidity or lack of humidity in the environment. If you‘re a wet
person and you‘re in Ibiza, you‘re going to be happy. But if you‘re a wet person and
you‘re in Sedona, Arizona you‘re going to be very unhappy because it‘s going to be
very unhealthy for your system. Wet people need a lot of humidity; dry people ob-
viously the opposite. They need to get the humidity out of the environment.
Kitchens are about where things are transformed. It doesn‘t mean you‘re supposed
to live in a kitchen. It does mean that you‘ll find naturally that the kitchen is a place
that you love to be, where you love to talk, where you love to eat, all that kind of
stuff because it‘s going to be a part of it. This is where the urban environment be-
comes its most sophisticated because this is where things are created. This is one of
the most creative environments we have. This is where things are designed and
built. This is where all the things are that make the development of our civilization.
If you go back to the old days, these were the potters. These were the people who
turned something into something else, because this is what kitchens is all about.
And to do this with others.
The industrial revolution was a classic example of getting all these people into the
same kitchen. These huge factories where everybody was involved in doing things.
This is what this environment is all about. One of the things to realize is that built
into the program is that all these various niches in our world are intended to be filled
out. It‘s never about place. Here in Ibiza you can find every environment. You can
do that in any place in the world because it is about a quality of a place that you‘re
in.
Now obviously there are exceptions. If you need a lot of humidity and you happen to
be in a very dry place, it‘s really unhealthy for you even if you have a humidifier in
your environment all the time. It‘s a lot healthier for you to be in a naturally humid
environment. These are not decisions that you can just make. They‘re a byproduct
of what is correct and your Strategy and Authority. They‘re a byproduct of your
process. But they make a huge difference in what your potential is.
If you‘re not in the right environment, you never get to see properly. What we‘ll
look at tomorrow – the transformation of your consciousness. In order for your con-
sciousness to be transformed, you need to have the right perspective. That perspec-
tive is grounded in your environment. If you‘re in the right environment, it opens up
the possibilities for your particular unique perspective to emerge. So your environ-
ment becomes something that is not just a matter of your health, but it literally lays
the foundation for the way your life is intended to unfold.

Landscape: Mountains
Now when you get to the upper three, you get to Landscape. There is a real differ-
ence between the hardscape and landscape. Basically the landscape is a reaction, in
a sense, to the development of the hardscape. This movement back into the conti-
nuity of nature. And yet at the same time, despite the fact that it sounds like it‘s all
very natural, it can still be deconstructed, and you can still have these environments
in the middle of a city. For
example, mountains. If
you‘re living in New York City,
make sure that your condo is
on the highest floor. And
then you‘re in the mountains
just like that. The reality is
that that mountain is about
oxygen. It‘s one of the things
that‘s really, really, really
important to understand
about mountains and valleys.
Mountain people suffer from
having too much oxygen. If it
wasn‘t so horrendously, politi-
cally incorrect for me to say
so, I‘d say smoke. If you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, it‘s like living at 17,000
feet. No, really, that‘s the equivalency. It‘s about 17,000 feet. You have all the tar
on the cilia; it cuts down on the oxygen to the brain, so basically you‘re at high alti-
tude, which is not a joke. The reality is that if you‘re a mountain person, thin oxy-
gen is what you‘re looking for because this is what you thrive on. And it‘s healthy for
you.
Remember something about oxygen. Oxygen is a corrosive. It can have a deeply
negative impact. Anybody who‘s ever gotten drunk knows that because what being
drunk is that your neo-cortex is flooded with oxygen, literally. Oxygen just destroys
cells. We think of it as life giving but, in fact, it is a corrosive. Look at the side of
any car. So it‘s really something to understand about being a mountain person.
The high ground isn‘t just about the fact that you have a better view, which by the
way, is very important for mountain people. Everything about being a mountain
person is about being above things. Think about that—it reflects on their personali-
ties. They‘re here to be aloof. They‘re here to be above things. They‘re here to be
looking down on them. This is what it is to be on the mountain. It‘s not to be down
in the heavy oxygen with this heavy weight that it brings, with the pressure that
brings. It is about getting up to the high ground. A lot of that is psychological.
Being high enough so you are looking down, that you do have this kind of refuge.

Environment
Active & Passive Mountains
You can see that mountains are active and passive. You can have the mountain that
is deeply isolating and you can have the mountain that‘s not. But the whole thing is,
going back to the deep activity levels that are there. To be passive in the high
ground or to be very active on the high ground. Everything having to do with envi-
ronment has to do with your activity level whether it‘s high or low activity. The high
activity mountain people need to burn off as much oxygen as possible, literally.
The diminishment of oxygen in the brain is the bedrock of the hallucinatory expe-
rience. If you take LSD, it cuts oxygen to the brain. If you take amanita muscaria,
it cuts oxygen to the brain. So basically these are people who are intended to be
high. And I don‘t mean that in the drug sense because that‘s not the point. I literal-
ly mean that in the sense that they‘re here to be high. Anybody who‘s ever gone to
very high ground knows that there‘s a certain giddiness that comes when you begin
to not have enough oxygen.
This high ground for mountain people is very important. But the other side of that is
really getting to see what it means for you as beings. Mountain people are not here
to get involved in the nitty-gritty. They‘re not Moses. They don‘t have to come
down from the mountain and deal with all that stuff down there. It‘s one of the most
important things for mountain people to realize. You‘re above all of that. It means
the only people you want to be connected with are those who are ready to climb the
mountain and come to you. Because that is what high ground is all about.
Sometimes that‘s not about ground at all, that‘s just philosophical. You take the
high ground in some kind of discussion or argument and you have to wait for the
other to climb the mountain to you because you take the high ground. So keep this
in mind about any of these aspects. They are always going to reflect on your basic
nature and allow you to see that if you‘re not taking the high ground, if you‘re not
above things, and you find yourself getting stuck in all that nitty-gritty, you know
right away something is wrong and you‘re with the wrong people dealing with the
wrong things.
Valleys
When we get to the next step, we get to the valleys. The valleys are interesting
places. They are some of the most interesting places on earth because every major
settlement on this planet is built in a valley, usually a river valley. All the great,
ancient cities of the world. What makes valleys so important to us historically is that
valleys were the original highways. This is where everything moved along. This is
what valleys are all about.

So valley people are really interesting people because they‘re the ones who are here
to integrate with the world. In our modern language we would call them internatio-
nalists. We would say that these are the ones—it‘s a 5. It‘s about universalization.
It‘s about all these themes. The reality is that a perfect valley person is the Vara del
Rey in Ibiza town and you‘re sitting at the Montesol café and it‘s the middle of July
and all the freaks are on parade. And they‘re from every place on the planet. And
you‘re sitting there in your valley watching the movie and watching all of that flow
by.
The chances are as a valley person that you‘re more likely to end up with a lover
that comes from some other place on the planet, some other culture, some other
religion, some other this or that. This is a place where you‘re meeting the flow of
things. It‘s very important for valley people to see that it‘s not just about necessari-
ly living in the valley in the middle of nowhere deeply isolated. It‘s usually about
these little towns in valleys. Or it‘s about living in the concrete valleys of the cities,
if that‘s what it turns out to be.
If you‘re a valley person, you make sure your apartment is on the ground floor. Or
depending on the city, have bars. It‘s about being down below. It‘s the opposite of
mountain people. Valley people need a lot of oxygen. If you take a valley person
and a mountain person, and you put them in an elevator in a 70-story building going
up, from the bottom, the mountain person isn‘t feeling quite right. And the valley
person feels terrific. And then it starts going up. You can watch the two of them
change. The mountain person is feeling better as the elevator gets higher and high-
er and higher. And the poor valley person is like ―oh, I hope it doesn‘t crash.‖ They
just want off the elevator.
Narrow and Wide Valleys
It‘s about oxygen. In the end, it‘s about oxygen. It‘s about being down at the
ground floor. It‘s about being there and seeing everything that‘s going on and con-
necting to the world around them. The divisions are narrow and wide. The narrow
valleys you find in any city. It‘s not about looking at gorges in the countryside. The
wide are different. This tends to lead more to the natural way of life. More bucolic,
as they say (rural, rustic, country, pastoral). Little valley towns, much more out
there in the wide, open spaces. And taking in that movement of the world that way.
In the old days it would have been on the Roman roads or on the first railroads. This
place where things are happening and things are going by even though you seem to
be in an isolated place.
Valley people have to realize that true isolation is never something that‘s healthy for
them. They always need to be in a kind of situation in which there is this flow and
movement that is going by, even if it is just a bus stop outside their door. They
need to be connected to this movement.

Environment
Shores: Natural & Artificial
Finally we come to shores. This is mine. I‘ve always marveled at the fact how lucky
I was in my life. I was born on an island in the middle of a river and grew up there.
This is actually the third island in my life that I‘ve lived on. I‘ve lived here 27 years.
The only time I didn‘t live beside water, I nearly lost my youngest son. Horrible
things happened. It‘s something to understand how profound environment really is,
how nurturing environment is.
Now shores, you see they can be natural or artificial. An artificial shore is the park
that is a boundary in a city. Or the tracks – one side and the other – this shore of
the city on the other side. The division between suburbia and the city. Exurbia and
suburbia. All of these places where there is a horizon where one can try to look
beyond, because that‘s really what shores are about. Anything having to do with
shores, water is very much a part of it, so the connection to water and the connec-
tion to having water around is something that is deeply important.
Children & Environment when Ill
Children. I mentioned in the beginning that your environment only begins to be
important the moment you reach your maturity, the moment you get past your Sa-
turn. Yet at the same time environment can be very handy with children. So for
example let‘s say you have a mountain child and they get a bad cold. Don‘t put
them on the ground floor. If you have two floors take them upstairs. Take them to
a higher floor, take them to a higher ground. It‘s going to make things easier for
them and it‘s going to be more helpful for them in recovery.
If you have a child who has dry kitchens and they‘re sick, take them in the kitchen.
Make sure the kitchen is dry. Open up the oven and let the dry heat come out and
this child is going to recover much faster. So you can take advantage of environ-
ment for children in terms of their well-being. It is beneficial for them. But it really
doesn‘t set the standard in that sense for the direction your life is going to take.
This is the thing to grasp about this.
Discovering Yourself
Everything about the surprise of discovering yourself is rooted in being in the right
place so you can see correctly. If you see correctly everything changes. This is the
dilemma of human beings. They look but they don't see. And it‘s not their fault.
It‘s about awareness. It takes great good fortune and discipline to get to a place
where you‘re really going to be aware in this life and not get lost in all of these
things.

One of the things environment really does is nurture your relationships. It‘s not just
about if you‘re a mountain person and you‘re on the high ground it‘s good for you.
It‘s good for your life because it is going to make sure that you‘re protected in the
connections you have. If you‘re in the right environment and somebody comes in,
you are protected. You‘re not going to have to deal with resistance.
When I say you‘re protected, this is the assumption that you‘re operating correctly.
But you‘re not going to have negative forces in your life that are going to be able to
thrive in your life if you‘re in the right environment. The longer you‘re in the right
environment, day-by-day-by-day, it changes the way that you see. This is really
what this whole thing is about in the end.
The Nodes here, as they go across, the Design Nodes to the Personality Nodes. The
Nodes are related to each other. They are connected to each other. It is though this
connection of the Nodes that we have the continuity of our life. It is the thing that
brings the ‗this and that‘ of us, our Design, our Personality, together into this holistic
package. It gives the whole meaning to what our existence is from environment to
perspective. Once you‘re correct, once you know how to make a decision, once
you‘re feeding yourself correctly, then what is there for you is to begin your life as
yourself.
You begin your life as yourself by being in the correct environment and in that envi-
ronment, it opens up this window to perspective that is what you‘re all about, what
you are here to see, what you are here to conceptualise, what you are here to offer.
And while all that at the intellectual awareness level is taking place, there is no panic
over ‗oh my god, how am I going to keep my life together.‘ Because you see, in the
end, that‘s automatic pilot. It‘s just about setting everything in motion.
Environment: Tone 3 Outer Vision
When you look at the environment, and you get to see that underneath that envi-
ronmental Color you also have a Tone. So in this case, we have the 3rd Tone. We
know the 3rd tone is about outer vision. So think about this person in their environ-
ment. This is a market person and that outer vision is about making sure that they
have visual stimulation around them. Their environment needs to be visually stimu-
lating because they‘re outer vision. The more stimulating their environment, the
better it‘s going to make them feel.

Environment
If you go into this person‘s office, you‘re going to see that it is incredibly decorated.
It may be over-decorated. It may have too many things in there, all kinds of stimu-
lating things that this person needs to have around them to look at. And at the
same time, the person who has their environment impacted in that way, outer vi-
sion—fill it up with all kinds of stimulating things—it‘s precisely the way they can tell
other people are connected to it. They‘ll come into that environment and those who
really enjoy the stimulation of the environment will come across. This is a way they
will have a sense of the correctness of those beings in their space. Each of us has a
sensory quality that‘s connected to our environment. That sensory quality becomes
very important.
If you put this child in a boring room with nothing stimulating to look at, they‘re not
going to be happy or healthy as they‘re growing up. They need a lot of visual stimu-
lation around them in their environment to make them feel good and make them feel
correct. In their life, as they mature, the visual stimulation of their environment is
going to be very important for them. This isn‘t just simply a matter that this would
be connected to a market person, you can have that tonal quality in any of the poss-
ible environments. Each of you have a very unique nuance to that environment
that‘s rooted in the sense.
Your Four Tonal Settings
The Tones, when we‘re looking at variable, these four tonal settings (Design Internal
and External and Personality Internal and External), they basically represent your
potential as a being to be aware. This is where your fundamental intelligence is. It‘s
not just simply a matter that your brain functions well, and that your mind can con-

ceptualize, it‘s about what does that feed on. Everything about the brain-mind sys-
tem is based on what you live. What is here above (Design and Personality Internal)
is the way in which it is all just simply digested. Whether it is being digested physi-
cally by the body or being digested intellectually.
And what is going
on down here (De-
sign and Personality
External) is the way
you experience life.
We‘re each de-
signed to experience life through a unique story line. We each have our way. It is
an environment that opens up a unique way of seeing. This is what we‘re here to
live. It is actually the phase of our lives for a nine-centered being that is intended to
run between the time you‘re approximately 30 until approximately 50. It‘s a 20-year
program of developing the tools you need in order to be able to express yourself.
We can‘t work on that timetable because all of us were conditioned. For children
coming into the world, that will be their natural timetable. It‘s why I have this radi-
cal approach: Do everything you can as quickly as you can, right down into it, be-
cause we have a lot of time to make up. I‘m in this process since 1987; it‘s 23
years. Basically, I haven‘t even reached the Saturn, if you know what I mean. The
first 30 years of a nine-centered being is just eating correctly and being raised ac-
cording to your Type. That‘s the only requirement in the first 30 years.
It‘s only at 30 that you begin to set your life in motion. So we‘re making up time in
that sense. One of the things to grasp is how important it is in a radical process is
that you just simply go into it because there‘s so much to deal with. How important
it is for us to be in the right environment to begin to take the pressure off the deteri-
oration of our bodies. Every day that you spend in an environment that‘s not correct
for you, basically what‘s happening to you is that you are deteriorating at a faster
rate than necessary. It‘s just the way it is.
We’re Not Designed to be Sick
The longer you‘re in an incorrect environment the more deterioration will take place.
And that deterioration isn‘t just simply that the body breaks down and there‘s dis-
ease. It‘s all kinds of things that simply hamper the vehicle from operating correctly.
One of the biggest issues in the nine-centered life is that we‘re not designed to be
sick. I don‘t use the word ‗healing‘, I use the word ‗alignment.‘ We‘re not designed
to be sick creatures. We‘re not. The moment we‘re operating correctly, this is not
something that is a part of us. It isn‘t.

Environment
Homogenized Disease World
But you have to see that there is a fine, narrow line in serving yourself. And it‘s only
when you keep to that narrow line, you‘re no longer part of the homogenized disease
world of cancers and heart attacks. It‘s all homogenized. It‘s everybody having the
same disease, the same problem. It‘s not the way we‘re designed. It isn‘t. It‘s
something to understand about your long-term longevity. The long-term well-being
of your vehicle is dependent not simply on doing the right thing, operating correctly,
eating correctly. You gotta be in the right place. How important it is for your vehicle
to be nurtured.
When you‘re looking at your environment, you really have to begin to see this is your
key to meeting the world as yourself. This is what being you demands. It demands
that you are in the correct environment. As long as you honor being in the correct
environment, you‘ll see who comes to you and who doesn‘t. You‘ll see who belongs
in your life and who doesn‘t. You get to see it very, very, very quickly.
Tones in Environment: Tone 1 Smell
You can see on either side of these diagrams here is a tonal construct. If you go to
the left side, you can see that the 3 tones here are listed. You can see in teal what
they are at the Design
level. The first tone is
smell, the second tone is
taste, and the third tone
is outer vision.
Let‘s talk about smell. If
you have a 1st Tone with
your environment, it is
very, very important that
your environment has,
what is to you, a good
smell. It is deeply impor-
tant for you. There are
many, many human be-
ings who live in environ-
ments that don‘t smell
right for them and don‘t do anything about it. They‘ll get incense and things to add
on but they‘ll never get rid of the fact that there‘s something in the space that they
don‘t like the aroma of. And no matter how much they try to cover it up, they‘re not
going to get rid of it. This is like a thorn under your fingernails. This is not a nice
thing to have. So it‘s something to recognize if you have a 1st Tone environment
that the aroma you live in is very, very important for you.

A Digital Book For Students
It‘s that aroma that is going to establish your well-being. If you don‘t have that
smell that‘s right for you, if you‘re constantly dealing with aromas that are unhealthy
for you it‘s such a problem.
There are different ways this works. We have assumptions, for example, that some
things smell good and some things smell bad. They‘re subjective. For example, a
cave person that has Tone 1, they‘re here to be urban, indoor people. The smell is
important for them. They‘re urban. When they sniff the air, they‘re not going to feel
the same discomfort or questionability as somebody who is upper and sniffs the air
and realizes right away that it‘s full of pollutants. As a matter of fact, if you‘re 1st,
2nd or 3rd Color, you‘re designed to breathe city air, even though you may claim that
it‘s awful. The reality is you‘re actually designed to breathe it.
These are really things to keep in mind. The fact that the environment will smell
correct for you, means that everything else about your environment will work for
you. The moment there‘s a smell that you don‘t like, there‘s something there that‘s
wrong in your life. You get to notice it right away.
Tone 2 Taste
The second one is taste. Taste is interesting in terms of environment. It goes to the
discernment of it. Most of what the 2 is about is barriers. They should never have
picture windows. There‘s too much information coming in. It‘s better to have little
windows all over the place than it is to have some big, huge window on the world.
You‘re here to block most stuff off. You don‘t want windows that look over at the
garbage dump. Only open up your windows to things that you‘re receptive to. The 2
is about establishing barriers so that something special can come through.
The environment isn‘t just the cave or the market; see it in its sensory context.
Understand there is another value there that is really, really important to grasp.
Tone 3 Outer Vision
We get to outer vision that we looked at before. This is somebody whose environ-
ment needs to be visually stimulating. It can be so visually stimulating that they
don‘t even need to go outside. Or it could be so visually stimulating that they‘re
never inside. It depends on their environment. You really need things to attract
your attention. It‘s strategic. It‘s about things to focus on, things to look at, their
favorite painting.

Environment
Tone 4 Inner Vision
When we get to the right side, everything begins to change because we‘re moving in
this evolutionary pattern towards what‘s coming. We‘re moving towards a different
kind of sensory sensitivity. In an inner vision environment, nothing needs to be
interesting. It‘s so different from the outer vision. The other side of the coin. This
is somebody, when they turn the lights down, doesn‘t matter what the place looks
like because it‘s not the point for them. This is an inner world. This is a world where
the eyes are closed and the world is alive inside of that world.
It‘s not a matter that they want to be distracted by stuff on the outside. These are
people who hate distraction, those things that pull them away from their inner
process. The moment they‘re pulled out of their inner process, they‘re pulled out of
themselves, in that sense. The moment you get to the 4th Tone, you‘re dealing with
somebody whose environment is very much passive in which they‘re allowing things,
when it‘s correct, to come into their environment so they can experience them. So
much of that experiencing is not what takes place in the moment. If you have inner
vision environment, what you get out of the experience is something that only really
comes out later.
It is something that is going in at a very deep level and is being taken in at a recep-
tive level. You‘re taking in people very deeply. Again, this doesn‘t have to be a
great, stimulating environment because it is not the key.
Tone 5 Feeling
I mentioned when it came to dietary regimen how important it is to understand the
impact of electronics around you and all of these various mechanisms we have.
Having this 5, basically you need to spend your life away from technology. In the
sense that the technology, in and of itself, is very disturbing to your environment. It
is very disturbing to your development. Obviously that can‘t be so for everybody
and it isn‘t. But it is really something to understand about feeling people is that
they‘re so sensitive to all of this.
If you‘re with them and you have all this tech stuff around and all these machines
around, their whole system is disturbed. It blocks the way they can deal with the
other, and it ultimately impacts their well-being. These are people whose environ-
ment, to a greater extent, needs to be free of that.
Remember, you have this reaction when you get to the upper tones. As we move
forward in this progression, this has nothing to do with being environmentally locked
in with others. This is really about not being modern, in a sense. It‘s almost anti-
modern. There‘s a part that is just ―I want to get away from all of these machines.‖
So one of the things you‘ll see with people like this is that they need to have the kind
of spaces in their home that‘s free of all of that technology.

Tone 6 Touch
And finally you come to touch. Obviously it‘s about the tactile. It tends to create
situations in which the best environments are very, very tight. In the sense that you
go into somebody‘s flat and it seems like there‘s no free space. You sort of have to
walk around chairs and everything is packed and dense. You can‘t go into a place
like that and not touch everything. Everything is touchable. Very important for
these people. They‘re going to feel very, very uncomfortable if they‘re dealing with
emptiness, if they‘re not dealing with something they can put their hands on.
What‘s great for touch people in their environment is simply to have something in
their hand. Worry beads or god knows what. A rubric‘s cube. Anything. Always
nice to have something you‘re touching, something you‘re connecting to at a physical
level. These are touchy-feely environments. Just the quality of a fabric can turn
them on. You know what that‘s like when you can touch a certain fabric? For these
people, touch is sexual. It is so powerful in that way to tap into the essence that‘s
there. For them, their environment really needs that.
The other thing is these are physical people. If you have touch environmentally,
you‘re here to be physical with others. You‘re here to touch them. You‘re here to
make physical contact with them.
You see there can be dilemmas in all these things. A manifestor who has touch in
the environment. You can imagine what that‘s like trying to figure out how to do
that. But then again, we have all these mixtures and when you‘re correct it doesn‘t
matter what all the nuances are, it comes out as you.
Right Environment Establishes Your Way Of Seeing
Not only are our environments unique for us in the general context, they‘re even
unique for us in the way they‘re decorated. Unique for us in the way we take advan-
tage of them. And all of them are creating a platform, not simply for our connection
with the other, which of course is so important, but more important, what we‘ll begin
with tomorrow, being in the right environment establishes for you your way of see-
ing. Until we get to a place where we see as we‘re intended to see, only then can we
deliver what is ours to deliver, which is our awareness.
We are deeply positioned as creatures, we‘re given this way of moving in the envi-
ronment, we‘re given our space, we‘re given our dietary regimen – all those things
we need to be unique as beings. Out of that unfolds the unique awareness on the
other side. So your environment is the last step in the body. Strategy & Authority,
dietary regimen, environment. These are the things that establish the platform for
awareness. They‘re all physical.
So they all have to do with a commitment to a way in which one lives physically.
This is what sets the platform for change. This is what makes the difference. It‘s

Environment
out of those three that arises the possibility of who you really are and what it means
to live your unique process. It‘s not what you think. It‘s never what you think. You
don‘t get there until you get there. That‘s the beauty of the journey.
But the journey begins with the body. And the final step, the most significant step in
that journey is that you establish yourself environmentally where it‘s correct for you.
Out of that—I see that in my garden. I have a place in my garden that I find fasci-
nating. No matter what I plant there, it dies. And I have a garden where everything
grows. I mean everything grows. But I have this one place, and it‘s one of those
things to grasp. If you‘re not in the right environment, you‘re not going to grow.
You can‘t. It‘s not providing you with what you need. It isn‘t giving you the re-
sources you need, it just isn‘t.
The other day I decided no more. I‘ve planted three orange trees. I have an orange
grove. I‘ve planted three orange trees in that place. It just won‘t grow. Nothing I
can do about it. No matter what I do, fertilizer, love, care, water, you name it. No
way. Those plants, you put them in the ground and they say ―you son-of-a-bitch,
you put me in the wrong place and I‘m going to die here.‖ Because poor plants, they
can‘t move. Somebody comes along and throws them down in a hole and they die.
They say ‗nice, thank you.‘
If we‘re in the right environment, we grow. If we‘re not in the right environment we
don‘t grow. Ok, let‘s have a break and then I‘ll go through your charts for you.

PERSPECTIVE
Today we go to a very interesting place and the place that we go to is the place
where it seems to be the most familiar and actually know the least, and that is the
mind and dealing with the nature of the mind.
I have to begin by sort of telling you a fairytale. It‘s Sunday. It‘s a nice day to tell
you a story. I‘ll tell you a fairytale, a science-fiction story, because I love science
fiction. You have an alien species and you have an alien species that lacks one
thing. They lack experience. They have all the potential for awareness, but they
lack experience. So, they travel through the universe looking for a place where they
can find experience. They arrive at a planet, and when they get to the planet there
is a dominant species that‘s there on the planet. And they go inside these creatures.
They go inside them, because what they're all about is they‘re all about experienc-
ing; they‘re looking for experience. And they‘re looking for the experience of con-
sciousness. They‘re looking for the experience of consciousness in form.
So they embed themselves inside of these creatures in order to be able to expe-
rience that consciousness in form. That‘s what we are. We‘re the aliens. I‘m not
talking about what you see in front of you because what you see in front of you is
the dominant species on the planet. That‘s us, the humans. But in fact, we‘re the
aliens that are inside of the humans experiencing it. We are passenger conscious-
ness. This is what we are.
If I was writing a science-fiction movie I would tell you how screwed up this alien
species became because they got so embedded in the experience of the dominant
species that they forgot who they were and what they were all about. That‘s us. We
are so lost in this machine. We think this machine is really us. And it isn‘t. It‘s a
ride. We‘re here to experience.
The crystals of consciousness that are at the bedrock of Human Design are made of
something called dark matter. Now, dark matter is actually hilarious when you think
about it because you can‘t see it and you can‘t touch it and you can‘t smell it and
you can't feel it. There is no way that we can even grasp it. Think about the un-
iverse that we live in, what I call the biverse. Think about this thing. We think of it
as being absolutely incredibly massive, enormous, all those galaxies, and super clus-
ters and quasars. All of these things are atomic in nature.
If you were going to put the entire biverse on a scale and weigh it, what you would
discover is that only 4% of that weight is all that stuff that we think is so incredible,
all those stars, all those galaxies. 96% is not atomic. It's not. It's rooted in dark
matter, what they call dark energy. It has nothing to do with atomics; but atomics

are special. You can see that every night. They light up the sky. These things are
hot. They're mutative. They‘re volatile. They‘re extraordinary in their potential to
transform and evolve; what we are as a passenger in this mechanism.
I love the life. I think it's extraordinary to be a passenger here. But I also see that
for most of the seven billion people on this planet it is a horror to be in the body. It
is a horror to live with the life. We‘ve got a couple of billion people on this planet
that barely have enough to eat on any given day. We have 40,000 babies that die
every hour. We have a hell of a place that we all live in.
One of the things about privilege is that privilege, and this here is a privilege, has to
be honored and it has to be honored with real dedication to what's possible with the
privilege. We're not here to get lost in the meat, the carne, the incarnation. It's not
about the meat. It isn't. It can look after itself.
I took a lot of drugs in my life. And one of the things I used to love to do is take
LSD and I‘d get in my car and drive. Now, most people would think that's nuts,
because there is absolutely no way that you can actually think about driving. You
can't; but you can drive. It was an amazing thing for me to sit back as a passenger
and watch my body drive me down the road and take me to wherever I needed to
go. And there was a certain wonder in that. How does it do that? The drunk you
know who somehow manages to get home. How does it happen? They can't even
remember it. They don't even remember walking.
These vehicles are quite capable of operating on their own if you stop interfering with
them. That‘s what Strategy and Authority does. The only thing that can interfere
with your life is your mind; nothing else. It‘s the only thing that can interfere with
your life. And the moment you take the mind out of the equation, the moment that
you just allow your vehicle to make decisions, it gets its life, this thing‘s life, what I
talk about of the life that you can have as yourself, because that's what is. And it's
not the self of the passenger; it‘s the self of the vehicle. You can see it in Design.
It‘s there in the G Center. It‘s a self.
What I'm going to show you today or attempt to show you today is that your mind is
as much a pattern as your elbow, nor anything else. It‘s just another pattern. And
it's just another pattern that you never had any control over. It‘s just another pat-
tern. And that other pattern doesn't mean that's you. It isn't. It‘s an aspect of this
thing that we‘re riding in.
The moment you can step back and be the passenger in the vehicle is the moment
you get the experience. We‘re so concerned about ourselves, whether we can do
this or that, be good at this or all that stuff. We don‘t understand that uniqueness
has no measurement, that when you actually get to experience what it is to be you,
you realize that nobody can be you better than you. Who else is going to be better
at you than you? You‘re you. And you get to see the perfection of that, because it is
a perfection.

Perspective
We only get messed up when the mind jumps in and starts measuring. Are we as
good as this? Are we as good as that? Should we have done this? Couldn‘t we have
done that? All the bullshit that people do to themselves all the time on the mental
plane. It‘s a nice fairytale. It‘s a wonderful thing to understand the nature of what it
is to be passenger consciousness. But I'm in the business of being practical. I‘m a
5th line Personality. It‘s about you getting the opportunity to be able to come into
contact with your passenger.
I‘m going to show you how to do that. Then you can do it for yourself, and you can
discover something rather remarkable. You don't have to be caught up in your Per-
sonality‘s trip. You can just experience your life. That's all. It‘s just there to be
experienced; nothing else. Everything else looks after itself. I used to love it; when
I first came to Ibiza, the Druids have this saying: do without doing and everything
gets done. It rolls off the tongue in English. Do without doing and everything gets
done. And I thought what the hell are they talking about. What is this ‗do without
doing‘; but, this is what it is.
The moment that you‘re a passenger, you‘re not doing anything. People always like
to say to me, ―Oh, Ra, you‘ve done such a terrific job.‖ And I look at them like
they‘re nuts. And it‘s not some false modesty. It's the reality. I didn‘t do anything.
The doing got done. This thing does what it does. And all I can do is experience
what it‘s doing. And if it fucks up I experience that. And if it doesn't, I experience
that. And it‘s not like I can take credit for it because I can‘t take credit for this me-
chanism that I happen to be imprinted with. There‘s nothing I can do about it. All I
can do is watch the movie.
The moment you‘re in a place where you‘re watching the movie, this is not detach-
ment. Don‘t be confused. This is not about backing away from your life. It‘s not
about stepping outside of it. It is about being an enthralled audience, because that's
what we're here for, to be totally absorbed as an audience, because then you see.
You watch the way in which your mind does its thing, the way the conditioning
works, the way life works. Awareness becomes natural, because there's no agenda.
The moment your mind has to make a decision for you is the moment you have an
agenda. You've got a reason. You're making things up. You're going to get stuck
with all that stuff. And in the end it comes back and it bites you. Every time the
mind is in control of your life is when you are no longer a passenger. You‘re just
caught up in the mess.
Environment Establishes a Foundation to Develop Correct
Perspective
So, how do we get to that place practically? Today we're going to take a look at this
zone over here, the Personality Nodes. Now, they have a very powerful connection—
and I‘ll give you the whole image. This is today‘s graph. They have a very powerful
connection to what we looked at yesterday afternoon. That is, together they form
Radical Transformation Lectures is a program of Ra Uru Hu’s Radical Transformation Clinics

what is our storyline, our movement in this life, our direction in this life, the way
we‘re here to develop. And what we saw yesterday is that environment establishes a
foundation for us to be able to develop our correct perspective. That's what you're
looking at here in these Nodes. You're looking at the potential of perspective.
Fundamentally what it's saying is everyone has a different way of seeing. Look at
the perspective. To begin with they‘re going to be activated by gates, obviously.
The Nodes are always in opposition to each other. So you're going to have a funda-
mental 32 basic ways in which we‘re imprinted to see within a framework, and yet,
each and every one of us have this deeply unique quality of perspective that we see
underneath; that is, we see in the color and we see in the tone.
You Don’t Have to See What Other People See
The first thing to grasp about what it is to be yourself is that you don't have to see
what other people see. Now, that may sound simple, but it‘s really profound. You
don't have to see what other people see. Nobody can force you to see what you‘re
not here to see. And yet, most human beings are constantly being conditioned to
see things the way other people see them. But by design we‘re all given a unique
way in which we‘re here to look at the world.
But before I could show you how that works I have to take you into something that
is really very magical in a way. It has to do with the nature of color. When we were
looking at color on the design side, color on the design side locks in. So from the
moment of your birth you're locked in, in terms of the specifics of your dietary regi-
men, the specifics of your environment, but on the personality side color transfers.
And what that means is that color is always a binary. It's always moving from one
thing to another. And that one thing to another is a pattern.

Perspective
Now, the way the pattern works is that the pattern works numerically. So, let me
show you. Here we have the personality external, what we're looking at, the Nodes.
And here down at the bottom you can see the number 1 going up to the number 6.
When we're talking about transference, transference is what happens when you have
the combination of the 1 going to the 4, the 2 going to the 5, or the 3 going to the 6.
2nd Color: Possibilities
So, let me give you an example. You‘re somebody who comes into the world and
you have a 2nd color personality Node. That 2nd color personality Node, you can see
that the view here is called possibility. So you came into the world to see possibili-
ties. That‘s what it means to have a 2nd color personality node. This is what you're
all about. From your particular environment you can look out and you can see pos-
sibilities. Now, possibilities can be rather amazing, because in fact, theoretically, you
can see a possibility in anything. This is the gift that‘s there. But it never stays
consistent. It‘s not like your dietary regimen that if it‘s 2nd color is locked into that
2nd color of being either open or closed.
Now, this is different. What happens here is that possibility will move. It will trans-
fer and it will transfer to the 5. And so instead of this person seeing possibilities, all
of a sudden they think they're seeing probabilities. It‘s a duality system. Now,
we‘re not dealing with the body anymore that works on a firm, fixed thing. We're
now dealing with the whole basis of our consciousness and our mind, which is a bi-
nary. Everything about mind is based on the binary, this and that, up and down, in
and out, and all that stuff that makes up our binary, our DNA, RNA, all of this is bi-
nary.
So when you get to the personality side, you get into this binary that‘s rooted in this
movement of color. When we‘re talking about the movement of color at this level
here with the Nodes, it's called distraction, because it's about your seeing. So you
are designed to see possibilities, but you get distracted by probabilities. If you're
somebody who has the 5th color, you're going to be designed to see probabilities, but
you get distracted by seeing possibilities.
It‘s not about getting rid of one or the other. You come into the world and you‘ve
got a 2nd color and its possibility, it doesn't mean that you need to never see proba-
bility, because in fact, you would no longer be able to measure properly in the bi-
nary. It's more like a seesaw. In other words, if you're designed to see possibilities
most of the time, that‘s what you're seeing. But at the same time, you need to be
able to see some probabilities as well.
The fact that you can see a possibility in everything can, in a sense, become quite
frustrating, because in fact you‘re not necessarily seeing anything. And the person
who‘s designed to see possibility likes seeing probability, but they can be fooled by
it. So if the seesaw reverses and they‘re distracted too much by the other side, they

lose their perspective and they don't see properly anymore. So this is a distraction
that‘s taking place.
Now look, here‘s the thing that‘s so interesting. One of the things that I love so
much about mechanics is that if you understand something mechanically you can
always develop a technique out of that. Anything, whatever it is, that‘s mechanical.
So, think about this as a mechanical thing. Each and every one of us is designed to
see in a certain way. You can see that this isn‘t about what you're actually seeing;
this is the way it‘s framed. In other words, you're looking for the possibility.
So here you are designed to look for the possibility and you know at the same time
that you're always going to be distracted by probabilities. So let's say anyone of you
who have this and you're watching yourself, you're noticing that you're looking at the
possibilities, you're seeing the possibilities and then you notice that you're shifting to
the probabilities. This is what this is all about.
Who noticed? This is something that anyone of you can do. I‘ve had students of
mine doing this now for years. Who noticed? Who‘s watching this? That‘s the pas-
senger. It‘s not your Personality. Your Personality is a program. Sometimes you
see the possibility. It‘s not like that‘s original. Do you know what I mean? You see
the possibility because you can see the possibility because you‘re designed to see the
possibility, and you're designed to be distracted by the probability. But the point is
not to be concerned about what that means, but to see it, because if you‘re operat-
ing correctly you‘re going to have the right balance.
The 3rd and 6th Colors
For example, I'm somebody that has the 6 at the top, which is called personal. My
distraction is to the 3rd color, which is power. So if you're born with the 3rd color
you're somebody who is always watching things within the context of who is winning
and losing. It's all about winners and losers. It‘s all about seeing who's up and
who's down. It‘s like a 3rd line theme connected to the world, very much seeing
what's up and what‘s down; that kind of thing.
If you have a 6th color, personal, you see everything within your own context. It‘s
very narcissistic in that way. In other words, you don't see it framed through possi-
bility or probability; you see it framed through your own process. So, I‘m designed
to see things through my own process, but my distraction is to see the winners and
the losers. Now, when I was not me, that is, when I didn‘t live this life, I was always
on the other side. I can remember how important the scores were in games, your
sports team, seeing who was up and who was down, who was at the top of the list,
who were at the bottom of a list, who were the best at this, who were the worst at
that. The moment I get into that I lose everything. I lose my unique perspective —
I‘m deeply individual.

Perspective
However, if I didn't have the power as distraction, I would never get out of my own
narcissistic trip to see what's actually going on in the world. In other words, a cer-
tain amount of that distraction is healthy for me as long as it doesn't take over. If it
takes over I really have a problem.
The point is not whether I'm going to be seeing things this way or that way, because
if I'm correct it will have its right balance. It‘s that I can see my whole system doing
that. I‘m the passenger watching. I‘m not interfering. I'm watching. And there's
an incredible wonder in seeing these mechanisms operate not physically. It‘s one
thing with the body when we talk about body stuff. It gets very different when you
start talking about the way your mind actually works because you take your minds
very personally to recognize that this is just a complex set of patterns that operates
in a binary system and that you can experience that. You can actually be there as a
passenger and experience that. That's called being awake.
That‘s the moment that you actually have what we're here for. You‘re here to expe-
rience the phenomena of one of these bioforms. They‘re magnificent, after all, what
they can do. This is what it's all about. And out of that comes our capacity to com-
mune with each other, to be able to share the unique experience. Again, go back to
the science fiction and think about it that way. The alien doesn't go just into that
experience for itself. It wants to be able to share that experience with everybody
else. ―Wow, you should see what it's like to be in one of these. This one is so
fucked up. It‘s so crazy; unbelievable. They do silly things.‖ It‘s a totally different
space. And that's what the passenger is all about. That‘s where the cosmic joke is.
That's what it's about. And you can get to see that.
All right, so let me take you through each of them and give you a bit of a look at
them. The interesting thing about everything having to do with the Personality is
because you're always going through these movements you have to see something.
If your mind is busy with your problems, you're not going to get to notice any of this
because you're going to be caught up in it. The very distractions, the very processes
that are there in terms of the way your perspective operates, the moment that
you're into your mental trip, that's the moment that all of that just becomes part of
your confusion. It's not like you're really going to be able to experience that.
This is about letting go at a very, very deep level. That‘s what it is to come into
contact with the passenger and it's not something you have to believe. This is not
science fiction. You can experience that phenomenon of witnessing your own dis-
traction and then all right, who's watching. This is what we're about. When your
mind is no longer occupied with having to control your life every day all the time,
your mind is capable of beginning to be aware. And awareness just isn‘t about being
able to see what‘s going on outside of you. It‘s about recognizing how everything is
flowing out from inside of you. You‘re watching the whole drama this way, the enth-
ralled audience that has this—talk about 3-D movies—has this four-dimensional ex-
perience to go through. It‘s meant to be exhilarating.
And of course, what happens is that the moment that the mind steps in, it can no
longer be sensitive to the demands of being aware. It can‘t. It just gets grabbed

down into the lowest level. The mind that has to make decisions is the mind that
has to lie, has to lie to others, and has to lie to itself. It can never tell the truth. So
you can't get to this level of sensitivity to be able to experience this yourself until
you've gotten to that place where your mind isn‘t constantly occupied with trying to
drive you towards doing things, because this is the exact opposite of that.
This is about seeing how the way in which your life unfolds is a very natural thing
that does not require your control. It doesn't. This is what the mind is most afraid
of, is losing control, no longer being in control, no longer being able to push you
where it wants to push you.
The 1st View: Survival
Okay, we start at the bottom and we deal with the 1st view which is called survival.
By the way, these terms that you see on either side, communalist, separatist, I‘ll talk
about that in the afternoon because it‘s related to the Personality, to the Sun/Earth
more directly. The survival view is just that. These are people that know what can
survive, and know what's necessary for survival. They see things within the context
of survival. Now, for many of these beings, particularly in more difficult places on
the planet, it is probably an enormous advantage for them.
The fact is that in the West, in developed societies, this kind of perspective often
leads to very deep materialism as a potential. In other words, the concerns for sur-
vival leading to—again, I‘m talking about the not-self—the concerns for survival

Perspective
leading to trying to amass as much material as possible in order to protect them-
selves.
But everything about this 1st view is about really very primary things. It's also about
seeing what people are afraid of, and seeing things that are fearful, as well. In other
words, it's quite a perspective on the most primitive level of the world, seeing the
mundane, the basic level of the world, its foundation.
The 2nd View: Possibility
When you get to the 2, you get to the possibility people. There‘s something to rec-
ognize about people who see possibility in everything. It‘s sweet. It can be wonder-
ful for the spirit of others as an outer authority. You‘re a possibility person, and
there's somebody there and you can always see some possibility in them. You can
always see it, because that's what you can do.
The dilemma with the possibility people is that because they have distraction to
probability, there is always is part of them that yearns to see possibility realized; not
enough to assume for example that the 2 says it's possible that God exists. This is
one of those classic possibilities. But the 5s don't say it is a probability. They can't.
So, one of the things about the seeing the world through the eye of that perspec-
tive, the frame of the 2 is that in seeing those possibilities there‘s also a lot of inhe-
rent hope, belief that is rooted in that kind of seeing the world. By the way, that‘s
neither positive nor negative. Again, we are a binary dealing with binaries. So it‘s
always going to be the potentials of this and that on either side.
The 3rd View: Power
When we get to the 3rd and the final in the lower grouping, we get to the perspective
of power. As I said, this is really about who is up and who's down. This is somebody
who says to you, did you hear that Harry just lost his job. Everybody knows. You
know who‘s up and you know who‘s down and you‘re hooked into all of that.
Obviously that has its importance. The 3, wherever you see it in line, in color, in
tone, it always is related to the material plane. So, everything about this way of
seeing is really about seeing who is winning and losing on this plane, literally. And
it's not just sports. It‘s life. It‘s the whole thing. And they‘re the measuring ones.
The 1st view may be concerned about the fears that it sees out there, but this is all
about the winners and losers and the prizes and the classifications and the mea-
surements and it‘s a five-star, it's the best restaurant and he does the best this. It
goes on and on and on. And obviously by the way, we seem to need to know all of
that stuff. It seems to be part of the movie.

The 4th View: Wanting
When you get to the upper part, you get to the 4 and you get to want, wanting. And
that's what's missing. These are interesting people. They see what's missing. And
to see what's missing is very, very important. It‘s the other side of the 1 and the
way in which the 1 looks at things, because this is the transference. The 1 is all
about all kinds of fears. I could die crossing the street. I could die going up the
elevator; all of that stuff.
The 4 is more about what's missing, what do we need. It really sees the neediness
that is out there. That in of itself can be a trap. If what you see is need and want,
then you can end up being caught up in having to deal with that all the time, trying
to fix it, make it better, all these other things. Remember that what you see inhe-
rently is going to impact who you are as a being, obviously; the way you frame
things.
So, this wanting, to really be able to see what is needed out there, but more than
that, what is being called for as well. 4s in and of themselves are deeply social. This
is a way of really connecting. It‘s the line of friendship. So, it really has this capaci-
ty with it.
The 5th View: Probability
When you get to the 5, you get to probability. These are ―I'm sure‖ people. It‘s
really nice. By the way, I can laugh at all of them because there‘s nothing else you
can do. It‘s a joke when you realize we‘re so programmed. So you‘ve got the prob-
ability people. The dilemma with them is that they can bet their life savings on
probability. All this goes back to Strategy and Authority. All of these things have to
operate within context.
You can see what happens though to somebody who's got probability and they‘re
not-self. They see probability in everything. ―Oh, this job‘s going to be great. She‘s
going to be a great lover,‖ all that stuff. Sure; you think there‘s a probability. The
other side of that is that their distraction goes back to the other side to the possibili-
ty. It's possible that this may not be probable. So, they get a bit of a balance in
there. You can imagine what happens if you didn't have distraction. We would be all
these very one-tracked, we would really not see well. It's interesting that we get
this delicious binary that we move through.
The 6th View: Personal
And then at the top of this you have the personal. And again, narcissistic may be
harsh, but nonetheless it describes it well. It‘s seeing things through yourself. It‘s
seeing things through your own dimension in that sense. So, you‘re putting every-

Perspective
thing in context within yourself. Obviously, that can be deeply isolating. These are
the kinds of beings as not-self that can really live in a world where they have no idea
what's going on, the Marie Antoinette‘s, ―let them eat cake.‖ They have no idea
what the hell is going on in the streets; none. There is an inherent naïveté that can
be locked into this because they‘re seeing everything through their own rose-colored
glasses, or worse, dark-colored, blinded, whatever.
So, the other side of it, to get out of that trip of just being locked in is to see what's
going on in the world. ―Oh look, there are people who are up here and there are
people who are doing this, and this one has just done this, and this one‘s gone
around the world,‖ all that stuff that‘s there in the 3rd perspective that's tabulating all
of the trial and error that's taking place on the planet.
Specific to Gates and Lines
We have this balance, all of us. And not only do we have a unique way of seeing this
way, but think about how complex this is. We're not talking about the gates. What
we‘re talking about is what's underneath. In this particular case we‘re talking about
the 4th color. We‘re just talking about the view that‘s there. This is the view of
wanting. But we‘re not talking about the gates that are there. It's not just a general
―there's possibility people and probability people,‖ it is about what specific gates are
involved as well. Here to see opposition (38th gate) and obstruction (39th gate).
They're here to see people who are fighters. They‘re here to see people that are
provokers. They‘re here to see provocation. They‘re here to see the roots of strug-
gle. They‘re here to see those things and in that see what's missing.

But it's specific to the gates. And it‘s specific to the lines. In other words, when I
talk about outer authority, your outer authority is this finely honed perspective. Yes,
it has its distraction, but the distraction isn‘t necessary balance. But you have this
beautifully honed specific way that you‘re designed. Remember, this 38/39 over
here is dependent on that environment being correct. Here is somebody whose envi-
ronment nourishes inner truth (61st gate) and detail (62nd gate). And that inner
truth and detail of their environment leads them to being able to have a perspective
where they can see the world of provocation, of struggle, of all these things and see
what's missing.
This is the magic that each and every one of us carry, that we have this unique way
of looking at the world. It also says something, if you can mark that down, if you
can draw it out on a map, then the moment that you're not like that you know that
there's something wrong, because it‘s the way you‘re supposed to see. And the
moment that you are operating that way, you know that you‘re really operating cor-
rectly, because it's just a mechanism. And all you have to do is not interfere with
that mechanism.
The way in which all of us have been educated and the way in which historically
we‘ve looked at our consciousness is this assumption that we are doing something,
that our way of seeing, communicating, being aware, recognizing that somehow all
of these things are kind of like magical little things that pop out of nowhere. Well,
they don‘t. They‘re just mechanisms. If you look deep enough in science now—one
of them said the other day that they‘re going to find the gene for free will. You‘re
going to find a gene for everything. That‘s what we're looking at here. We‘re look-
ing at an amino acid break down. It‘s all there anyway. It's just a mechanism.
This thing that you take so personally, your mind, your life, who you are, who you
think you should be, all that stuff, is just a mechanism. There's no need to suffer
over that. You're not responsible for it. You‘re not. You‘re a visitor. It‘s like show-
ing up and you get into a taxicab and the cab‘s broken. It‘s not your fault. You
don‘t have to fix it. You don‘t have to worry. It‘s really something to understand
about what it is to be us, how messed up we are because we‘re constantly interfering
with what is so perfectly natural. It's all there. All you have to do is sit back and let
it be.
And the moment you begin to watch your personality as a mechanism it's quite a
feeling. It‘s the same as having gas, or breathing, or anything else. It‘s just another
bio-mechanism; nothing else, no matter how much you want to personalize it. The
only way you can personalize this is through the enthralled audience. I absolutely
adore this life. I think it's wonderful. And it's not because it's perfect, because what
does that mean. It‘s a life like any other. It has good points and bad points and
high points and low points and pain and no pain and this and that. It‘s life.
But it's magical when all of that simply operates on its own. The moment I stopped
controlling what my life was going to be is the moment that I got my life. It‘s the
moment that I became a clarion. I was never a clarion. All of these things, your

cross, your profile, your ―this,‖ your ―that,‖ everybody thinks you‘ve got to get there.
You don‘t. It takes you if you let it, because that‘s what you are. It‘s who you are.
The magic of what we can look at today when I go and I do each of your charts, is
the possibility that you will see this yourself, because that's the beginning of the
process, to see these mechanisms at that level, the way you're looking at things,
later today the way you're conceptualizing things. How original you think all that is—
this is my mind working this out. And it‘s just a pattern. You can see it on a piece of
paper, you can point to it. So, you might as well step back a bit and enjoy the thea-
ter of that and see where that really goes when you're not interfering with it.
This is the most difficult thing. When I first started work in Human Design most of
what I did was readings. I did readings for so many human beings. What amazed
me, because I've never been social, I certainly was never interested in people's
problems, was how much people disliked themselves. It astonished me. I couldn't
get it, this deep dislike for what they were and what had happened to them in their
lives and this and that. This is not what we're here for. It's not what these forms
are about. They‘re really magical, these things. They work really well. These for-
mulas are really incredible.
It's not like we have to take responsibility. It‘s like those people who want to save
the earth. I could kill these people. I could just rip them apart. Save the earth?
You've got to be kidding. We‘re a little scuzz on the surface of this ball. At any mo-
ment it could all go whoosh. We‘re going to save the Earth? Human beings assume
that they have to take control of everything. They do. And everything they put their
hands on they destroy. It‘s just the way it is.
This is not what we‘re about. We're not here to struggle on the material plane. We
are not here to be sickly. We're not here for these things. The moment that you're
operating correctly, physically correctly, that's not what you're about. Your mind
might say to you, ―oh, but I want more.‖ Sure your mind can say that. Your mind
can say anything. But whether or not you're going to accept that and do something
about it—if you follow your Strategy and Authority you‘re going to get what‘s correct
for you. You may not like what that is mentally, the mind being not-self. ―Oh, I
wanted more. I thought I was going to be enlightened and sit on a mountain and
glow. I thought this meant more. I thought it was going to mean more,‖ because
you had no idea what it was in the first place.
To be aware should be, quote, unquote, ―normal.‖ This is not an exalted state. It
isn‘t. This is part of the problem. The moment that the mind builds it up into some
kind of enormous, incredible exalted state, wow—it‘s so nobody feels really bad that
they don't get there. But it's normal. Being aware is normal. If your mind isn't
involved in trying to control your life you actually become intelligent. It‘s an inter-
esting thing. You begin to see things. And you don't see things caught in the melo-
drama of what the not-self has brought you, and all the bullshit.

Most people are still stuck on the surface. This design here, I look at this design, all
I have to do is just see the open ego. I don‘t have to look at anything else and I can
tell you that the chances are one in a thousand that this person is going to on their
own somehow figure out that this is all crap. They‘re not. Not until they have a
breakdown because they've been
a slave most of their lives. Not
until they discover that all those
people that they did all those
things for couldn't give a damn
about them. And that the mo-
ment that they would say ―no‖
then all of those people would
react really aggressively with
them.
Most human beings are just
trapped in their conditioning.
They never get a chance to let
go. They never get a chance to
just let go because their mind is
constantly in there saying, ―Oh, we have to be afraid. We have to nervous about
this. We‘re got to be worried about that. We have to take control over that. We‘re
not going to have enough of this. We‘re not going to get that.‖ And while you‘re
doing all of that, you are absolutely blind. What do you see? You don‘t see any-
thing; nothing. Not even the things you think you think you're looking at. You don‘t
see anything. You can‘t. You‘re making it all up. You‘re absorbed in that whole
process.
Mind isn't for turning off. It‘s for aligning. It‘s for correcting it. We have great
minds. They‘re beautiful things. But the mind is not there to be your enemy for life.
It isn‘t. It‘s here to serve. It‘s here to express you. This is our medium for expres-
sion to each other. It‘s through these minds. And what we're here to express is that
quality of uniqueness that differentiates us from everyone else. All this talk about
the collective consciousness, there is no collective consciousness. It‘s just a smudge.
It‘s made up of three or four ideas that have been rehashed over and over again. It
isn‘t about uniqueness. It isn't about the universal importance of anyone's expres-
sion of truth.
The reality is when you get to see how you‘re designed to experience life in such a
unique way it‘s clear that nobody else can represent that experience but you. Who
else is going to share that experience? You can see that. One of the most important
things in all of book publishing is biographies. There are more biographies produced
every day than people can imagine. We have a deep need to learn from the other.
It‘s designed in us. It‘s what we're about. There‘s nothing worse than having a
relationship where there is nothing original coming from the other. It‘s boring. And
it‘s not what we‘re here for.

You don't get to express your unique awareness if you‘re conditioned because you're
afraid of what people will say. Or you change the way you think in order not to
create problems. Or you refuse to get into an argument that you know is going to
lead to problems so you just back away from your principles. This is what people do.
The little white lies that you tell all the time. This is mind. If you let mind do that
you‘ll never be aware. You can only be caught up in your trip; nothing else.
My point earlier about privilege, very few people get an opportunity to have the time,
the energy and the resources to move someplace else in their awareness in this life.
It is not something that's just hanging there on trees. It isn‘t. This cannot be
another kind of variation of tourism, because so much of the spiritual world is, it‘s
just tourism. You visit this and you visit that and you try this and you do 37 differ-
ent kinds of yoga and you go to 19 different masters, blah, blah, blah and on and on
and on. This is not about tourism. It‘s the whole thing about Human Design. It‘s
real. It‘s a mechanical way to transcend what it is to live on this plane. That's what
it's all about. And there you get to live passenger consciousness. There you get to
see the beauty of you.
I‘m really impressed with this mechanism. It does great. It is a pleasure to just sit
back and watch its movie without being concerned about where that all goes, what's
going to happen. I never know what I'm going to do. You can already see. I never
even know what I'm going to say. I have no idea. I'm not concerned about all of
that. I'm well aware of the fact that this mechanism is really good at doing this.
And so I listen like you listen. I learn from myself. I‘ve always throughout all my
teaching. It‘s just the way that it is. These are mechanisms.
So here you have a chance to meet your passenger. All you have to do is experience
your own distraction and in the moment of experiencing that distraction you have
something to ponder for the rest of your life. What the hell noticed? What‘s notic-
ing?

MOTIVATION
Right and Left Minds
Okay, here we go. In a sense we come to the heart of the matter. We come to the
potential to conceptualize. When you‘re looking at the Personality Sun/Earth you‘re
really looking at your mind. And one of the most important things to keep in mind
about this is that we're dealing with Left-
ness and Right-ness. For example, in this
particular case, this Just Now chart, here
we‘re dealing with a Right mind. A Right
mind is receptive. A Left mind is strategic.
They are incredibly different from each
other; incredibly different.
So, if you‘re a Right-minded person you're
here to simply take in and you take in
everything. So those of you who have a
Right mind that have been sitting here
during these two days, you‘ve not simply
taken in every single word I've uttered, my
body movements, hand gestures, you‘ve taken in everybody‘s energy, you‘ve taken
in everybody's movements, everything that's been in the frequency, you‘ve taken it
all in.
Left-minded people, tomorrow when they think back they're only going to remember
what they focused on. So, if you‘re a Left-minded person and I say something that
strikes you, you go to that place and just about everything else that is going to hap-
pen is going to go by, which is nice that you have a recording, for those of you that
are Left-minded like me, so you can go back and say, oh I didn‘t hear that at all.
The Right-minded person heard everything. The problem with them is they can‘t go
find it.
If you‘re Left-minded, the thing you focused on that caught your attention that you
put into your system you can always go back in your memory and get it. That's the
thing that you're focusing on. The rest of the stuff you‘ve long forgotten. If you're
Right-minded you're taking in everything but you can't get it out yourself. It takes
somebody else to get it out. This is the whole thing about being Right-minded. A
Right-minded person, the most important thing to understand is what is the intellec-
tual level of your milieu, because if your milieu is bottom floor, so are you, because
that's exactly what you're going to express because it's the only thing that can come

out of you. So, who is in your life, who you‘re communicating with as a Right-
minded person becomes something that's very important.
It‘s important to keep those things in mind, the difference between being Left-
minded and being Right-minded. Those of you who are Right-minded, you never
have to hear the recording even though you want to, because Right-minded people
are nervous as hell. They think they missed everything. ―I didn‘t get anything.‖
They walk out and go, ―I didn‘t get anything. I didn‘t get anything at all. What was
that all about?‖ But if somebody the next day asked them a question, it's all there.
So it‘s something to keep in mind the difference. The Left, you‘d better have a re-
cording because you were only paying attention to those things strategically that you
thought were important for you to pay attention to, and the other things have drifted
by. We‘re all different. The moment we understand our difference and we live with
our difference, everything is okay.
Motivation Brings a Quality to Your Lines
The next thing; when we're looking at the mind we saw in the way in which we see
things, our perspective, that our perspective is conditioned by this movement in the
Color, this distraction that comes into our perspective. Now, when we're talking
about the mind and we look at Color in terms of the mind we‘re looking at something
else. What we're looking at is motivation.
We all have lines. If you look at your design and you‘ve got a gate and a line, eve-
rybody has lines. Think about those lines in the way in which an actor or an actress
thinks about a line. I've probably seen in my lifetime, maybe two or three or four
hundred Hamlets, different Hamlets, different actors playing Hamlet. I've seen high
school versions, university versions, film versions, stage versions. I've seen all
these—same lines, exactly the same lines, like you and somebody else who have the
same line in the same gate. You‘ve got the same lines. But you know you‘re not the
same.
What makes you different is what you bring to the line. What makes an actor great?
Who is the greatest Hamlet? People say Olivier, for example, Sir Laurence Olivier,
the greatest Hamlet. Why was he the greatest Hamlet? He said exactly the same
lines as all the other Hamlets. But, we believed him. We were right there. This was
somebody who gave something to his lines that nobody else gave. You all have
lines, but what do you bring to them? What you bring to them is rooted in your
motivation, because your motivation brings a quality to that line.
If you have a line that says you always do this, the motivation behind it changes the
quality of it. It‘s like when you're saying goodbye to somebody. What‘s in that?
You can be motivated to say goodbye for many reasons. And you can say goodbye,
that line, in many ways. It‘s what's underneath the line.

Motivation
Seeing Turns into Thought through the Agency of Motiva-
tion
And here is where the magic is underneath the line because this is the motivation,
what is pushing the framework of the way you conceptualize. We know the way
you‘re intended to see. But how does that seeing turn into thought? It turns into
thought here. And it turns into thought through the agency of motivation. But like I
showed you this morning, Color on the Personality side transfers, and motivational
transference has our world upside down. Let me show you how that looks.
Motivation Transfers
Like all of these formulas that we're looking at, it‘s a 6, so we're looking at the very
bottom down here in the middle under Color. We see the very bottom is fear and it's
moving all the way up to the 6 to innocence. These are six themes of motivation.
But again, these motivations transfer. So for example, if you have a fear motivation
you're here to be motivated by fear, and again I'll explain that so don‘t jump to con-
clusions. You‘re here to be motivated by fear; your transference is to be motivated
by need.
Okay, so think about the nature of the world. Let's take a look at somebody for
example—the vast majority of people on this planet who are going to have the 1st
Color, that their motivation isn't going to be fear. Their motivation is going to be

need, and it's going to be dumb need, because it‘s not going to be cognitively driven.
In other words, the moment that your motivation goes into a transference you end
up with very empty concepts, concepts that simply cannot work.
1st Motivation: Fear
So, let's look at first of all these six different motivations so you have a sense of
them. The 1st motivation is fear. Now, you‘ll notice something really interesting
here. On either side of these Colors we have keynotes. So for example, on either
side of fear, on the left side we have communalist and on the right side we have
separatist. These themes are about something that's called trajectory. I don‘t want
to give you too many complex concepts to work with, but this is something to keep
in mind. Trajectory is very important for us because it tells us, it shows us, those
moments where our Personality, our mental process, is moving in the right direction.
Trajectory
So, let me give you an example. Let's say that you have the 1st Color, and let‘s say
you have the 1st Color and the 1st Color is Left, it‘s on the left side. What that's
going to mean is that you're going to move from being a separatist to a communalist
in your process. In other words, whatever you are, you start on the other side, the
opposite side, and move towards what you‘re intended to be.
So for example if you‘re fear and you're on the left side so that it looks like you're
supposed to be a communalist, you're not. You're starting off as a separatist first
and moving towards being a communalist. In other words, this is your trajectory in
the way in which you conceptualize, in the way in which you form concepts. And I‘ll
give you actual concrete examples when I look at your individual designs.
Motivated by the Unknown
So let‘s start with fear. What‘s fear all about? To be motivated by fear is to be mo-
tivated by the unknown. This is the foundation of conceptual intelligence. This is
really what intelligence is about. Intelligence is, ―I don't want to be afraid. So let
me understand.‖ So this is what this fear means. Don‘t get stuck in the sense that
you're being motivated because you're afraid of something. Yes, obviously there is
some component of that, that can be in that. It‘s not really what it's about. What
you're afraid of is what you can't understand.
Remember, this is the mind. It‘s the foundation of the mind. Lift up every rock, look
and see what's underneath. Keep on digging until you have all the information. This
is the foundation of conceptualizing. So these are beings that are motivated not by
what's knowable, but by what's unknown. In other words, this is about trying to

Motivation
understand things. So these are natural learners. In other words, it comes very
natural for them to develop a concept. They‘re going to have to do their research.
They‘re going to have to dig in; all of these various things. But they're motivated to
understand, to make sense of, and to know in the language of the circuits in Design.
2nd Motivation: Hope
When you get to the 2nd you get to something really amazing. Again, I have this
thing about the 2s, not that I have very many myself, I don‘t. But they‘re fascinat-
ing to me because built into our system, built into what this mechanism is, is a way
of dealing with the surprise of mutation. The 2s are always capable by blocking off
so many things. It's like you can only look at the Sun by filtering off many other
frequencies. This is what the 2 is always doing. It‘s filtering away other frequencies
in order to see something that others can‘t see. What it can see is the motivation of
hope. The motivation of hope is a beautiful thing.
It's like the Chinese general who when asked about his enemies said ―I'm fine. I will
sit by the river and wait for the bodies of my enemies to float by.‖ In other words,
hope is knowing when not to act, when you don't need to act, when you don't need
to take responsibility, when you don't need to jump in, when you don't need to push
the river.
Now, think about what happens to somebody who is 5th Color, the guilt, and they‘re
in transference to hope. This is the dumb hope. It‘s not backed by cognition. It‘s
not correct because it's a transference. And these are the people that say, ―I don't
have to worry; I‘m going to win the lottery.‖ And they never win the lottery. They
are never correct in that false hope of theirs that it's going to be this or that. So the
distraction can be quite painful. Each and every one of these, when you see them in
transference, you get the negative side of their positive.
The 3rd Motivation: Desire
The 3rd Color is desire. One of the things to really grasp about being driven by desire
is that the mind is powerless. The whole thing about the nature of desire as a moti-
vation is that it is entirely overwhelming and it is always the desire to move every-
thing. 3rd lines, 3rd themes are always about the material plane, always about deal-
ing with the material plane. You can see the themes here of leader/follower. This is
all about organizing things, getting them organized, trying to get them to work. And
being motivated by desire is obviously something that's very, very powerful.
Its transference is innocence. So let me give you a classic example of how distorting
that can be. My Color is desire. So it's natural for me to lead. In terms of my de-
sign, I‘m an integration individual with an undefined emotional system, undefined
Sacral, undefined Root, undefined Head center. So I have an undefined emotional
system. The not-self strategy of an undefined emotional system is to avoid confron-

tation and truth. The transference in my motivation is away from the desire to lead
and becomes innocence; not me.
So one of the easiest things for me to do in my life before all of this happened to me
was say, ―I don‘t know; it‘s not about me. It has nothing to do with me.‖ And be-
cause I'm here to perceive through the personal, not only it wasn't about me, I didn‘t
even see it anyway. I didn‘t know my marriages were collapsing. I didn't know that
anything was going on. And it was so easy not to get involved. ―No, I don‘t want to
get involved.‖ The moment that I don‘t want to get involved now, boy there would
be something seriously wrong with me.
But it‘s something to understand about the power because it changes the way you
think. And when you‘re not-self and you‘re in transference, your motivation is run-
ning your life. My life was being run by the innocence theme with no intelligence
behind it, which is just simply saying, stay away from everything, and don‘t get in-
volved. Don‘t get involved; period. So I didn‘t get involved. That‘s what my mind
told me to do; that's what I did.
So, it is something really, really significant when you begin to grasp what this moti-
vation is, because if you allow it to go into the transference, everything that you're
thinking is rooted in that. And obviously, it sets you off on the whole not-self jour-
ney.
The 4th Color: Need
Okay, you get to the upper half, you get to the 4th Color and you get to need; to be
motivated by need. To be motivated by need is very specific. In other words, think
about what you have to think about. Think about what needs to be thought about.
Don't think about everything. Leave that to the 1st Color people. It‘s their job to
deal with the unknowns. It‘s their job to figure all of that out.
The 4 is here to be motivated by what‘s necessary to think about. Now, one of the
great diseases on our planet is that 70% of humanity has an undefined Head center.
70% of humanity think about things that don't matter. It‘s one of the real problems
we have on the planet is that you've got all this thinking about stuff that doesn't
matter and it really doesn't matter.
One of the things to see about being a 4th Color person, the 4th Color person is here
to think about what needs to be thought about. It‘s not here to think about all this
extraneous stuff. And remember, do without doing and everything gets done. It‘s
not like you have to try to be this. You are this if you allow it to happen. This is the
key.
Remember our program today is to be passengers. Transference is the easiest thing
to see. It‘s easier to see than distraction because it's the ultimate conceptualizing

Motivation
process. And when you see your mental transference at the conceptualizing level
you really know you've seen something. And again the question: Who‘s watching?
But understanding what you're getting to see is how distorting it is when you trans-
fer in your conceptualizing, the whole way you think. That's why if you follow your
mind and you let your mind tell you what to do, you can really see how stupid you
are. Once you understand all of this, the idea that you can trust your mind to tell
you what you need to know, you can‘t do that.
Anybody who is relying on their mind to tell them what they need to know is auto-
matically in transference. Not only that, they're distracted as well. They're not see-
ing what they're supposed to see. They‘re not where they're supposed to be.
They‘re not nourishing themselves the way they're supposed to. They're not going
to have a concept that is correct, nor is it based on what they're truly here to see.
It's not you. It's not them.
The 5th Motivation: Guilt
The 5, guilt; people don‘t like this name. This keynote is always funny to me. When
I first introduced this one I was doing the beginnings of Rave Psychology. These are
fixers. If you've got the 5th Color, you‘re motivated to fix things.
Now yes, guilt does become a part of it. I‘m a 5th line; genetic continuity through
the numbers. I'm a 5th line. I make my students feel guilty for being ignorant. I do.
It‘s part of it. You‘re privileged and you should feel real guilty that you‘re not doing
something with this privilege. It‘s built into what any 5 is going to do. It is how
universalizing works. If you don't make them feel guilty, you can‘t them to fix it.
So, these are fixers. They're the ones who are motivated to get things fixed. And
this is what they think about. ―How can I fix it?‖ The dilemma is that most of the
people that are living out this motivation are living it out in transference. They‘re
supposed to be hope people. They‘re not supposed to be thinking about how to fix
things; the idiots. They‘re supposed to be there thinking about the way in which it's
all just going to unfold; bless the miracle of life.
If you‘re designed to be motivated by guilt, you‘re designed to be that fixer. Think
about what happens to these people in transference. The 2 that is transferred to the
5. They don‘t know what to fix. They don‘t know how to fix it. They hope it gets
fixed. But it doesn't mean it's ever going to be fixed. And it doesn't mean that any-
body is going to deal with that because again outer authority is about the other.
You're seeing as a way in which you can bring your uniqueness and your perspective
to the other. You conceptualize it, package it, so you can deliver it to the other. But
if the motivation isn't there, if it‘s not correct, then the power of what it is that
you're here to reveal is lost. It‘s just lost.

So, if you're going to have a 5th Color, this is what it's all about for you. It's about
understanding that you‘re here to think about how things have to be fixed, whatever
it happens to be. And again we‘ll see it‘s always going to be related to the gates that
are involved. It‘s going to be related to the lines. There are all these sub themes.
But this is the larger framework to understand what your mind is good for. If you‘re
a 5th Color we know what your mind is good for. It‘s good for thinking about how
you fix the things that you've seen. After all, it‘s based on your perspective. The
magic is seeing the transference.
Transference is Not Bad
I remember when I first started this with the Rave Psychology students. They all
basically saw it very quickly, because you do. Once you understand this binary you
can see it very quickly. And they said, ―But I can't get rid of it, the transference.‖
That was the best joke for me, because I said to them, ―The point is not to get rid of
it. The transference is not bad.‖ Again, you have to see our binary nature. We
need a counterbalance. Not all things can be fixed. Sometimes you do have to have
faith. Sometimes you do have to hope.
None of these things can stand on their own because we're dealing with this concep-
tual maia where everything is a binary. And it‘s one of these things to really grasp
about us. The thing is to see the transference, to be aware of it, because this is
what's important. The moment you're aware of the transference, you‘ve already
stepped into another level of consciousness. It is that observer that is seeing the
transference and for the first time you're separating from the mechanics of your
Personality and actually observing it. You're watching it at work.
I see those moments almost every day, because again, mind is mind. I watch my
transference all the time. There isn't a day that doesn't go by where my mind says
to me, nah, don‘t get involved in that. How easy it is for my mind to go to the trans-
ference and say, don‘t get involved. And of course, there is an advantage for me
that the transference exists. If it wasn't for that, not everything has to be con-
fronted. In the same way as a Manifestor I don‘t have to inform everybody about
everything. So there is a balance in a sense that can come into it.
But again, I watch the transference all the time. It's always there. It never goes
away. The gift is seeing it, because every moment that I see that is another affirma-
tion of how powerless and helpless and choiceless I really am as a being. I have no
control over those mechanisms. Those students of mine who wanted to be able to
get rid of the transference, you can‘t get rid of the transference. It‘s just a mechan-
ism. All you can do is see it for what it is. And all you can do is understand what is
correct for you in the optimal sense mechanically and to watch it emerge, because
again, you truly do not have to do anything.
The worst thing you can do with this kind of mental information is to try to work with
it instead of experiencing it. Once you understand the basic binary of your transfe-

Motivation
rence, just wait, you‘ll see it. You won‘t miss it. You can't miss it. It‘s the front of
the frame. It‘s the way we conceptualize everything. And the moment you see that
you can begin a process of really liberating yourself because you‘re no longer re-
sponsible for what happens in that process. You're not responsible for what your
mind is conceptualizing. Think about that. What an incredible thing. We're not
responsible for that.
It‘s not like we‘re directing that. This is simply what existence is and how we are
interpreting the existence. But we‘re not controlling it. We‘re not deciding to think
this way or that way. It‘s just built into us. It‘s just about seeing it. To see it is
really to transcend it. This is what it‘s about.
The 6th Motivation: Innocence
When you get to the 6, the 6 is innocence. Innocence is an interesting thing. Eve-
rybody that is born with a transitional profile, that is, if your profile is a 1/4 or a 2/5
or a 3/6 or a 4/1 or a 5/2 or a 6/3, those six transitional profiles, you all have Perso-
nality Sun/Earths that are 6th Color. It‘s an interesting thing to think about. All the
transitional profiles, every single one of them have the 6th Color as their motivation.
Now, these are the bridging profiles. They‘re the links in the chain of all the profiles
coming together. And every single one of these bridges is rooted in a bridge that is
rooted in innocence. Now, I want you to think about profile as the world genetic pool
and the way in which information works in this genetic pool. In order for the infor-
mation of the 1/3 to get to the 6/3 it‘s got to go through this whole chain of profile,
this movement as we see it as it moves around the wheel.
Innocence is Not a Motivation
The thing to recognize about innocence is that it‘s not a motivation. That‘s the first
thing to understand about innocence. It's not at all a motivation. Think about what
happens if you look at the nature of the world around us. The nature of the world
around us is that innocence is supposed to be without motivation. All the people
that are born on this planet—oh, I was talking about the transitional profiles, inno-
cence, right, okay, here is the bridge. Is the bridge going to be innocent? Or is the
bridge going to be loaded with desire?
Every transitional profile has a 6th Color as its motivation. So if all the bridges are
correct, they are innocent bridges. They don't have motivation. They don't have an
agenda. That is, the 1/4 will pass the information of the 1/3 to the 2/4 innocently.
That's the way we‘re designed. We‘re designed to have this innocent chain of com-
munication, but we don't have that. We have a world that lives in transference,
which means that all of those 6th Color transitional profiles, all of them are trans-
ferred to the other side; desire.

So, the 1/4 either is going to want to give an advantage to the communication of the
1/3 or an advantage to the information of the 2/4, it's going to change the way in
which the bridge works because it's going to be motivated differently. And it's going
to be motivated to control, to lead, to decide who is going to be first and who's going
to be last. That‘s not what we‘re all about.
So the way in which the whole community of our species, the links that are there in
all of humanity, the bridges that are there, it‘s all rooted here in this 6th Color of
innocence. So innocence is something that's very special. It is without motivation.
This is the thing that makes the 6 not only special but interesting. It‘s why it has
that quality in the continuity of what 6s are about to be the role model, to be some-
thing that's trusted because there is no motivation behind it. There doesn't appear
to be a specific agenda that's pushing it. That‘s innocence.
The classic example of the fool, the innocent that can reveal the truth, that can be
the source of wisdom, this is innocence without motivation. Now what that says is
something also interesting about the mental process. In other words, thinking is not
a byproduct of a ―because.‖ It‘s just there. There is no real reason for it to be there
because there's no legitimate motivation.
What happens to these beings who are not-self, who are in transference is that
they're constantly trying to conceptualize through desire. And it's the last thing that
they're supposed to be doing in this life. And obviously the way in which they‘re
thinking, being driven by desire takes them away from the basic power that is there
in their design. Their trajectory of whether this whole thing about observation, the
whole thing about being seen, everything about the 6 is that they are innocent in
their process in the sense that they're innocent in the way in which they operate in
relationship to everything else. They‘re just in their own thing. This is the inno-
cence. Like the personal in the perspective of the 6, they‘re really just in their own
thing.
And yet at the same time, it is a frequency that draws others. It is a frequency that
draws others because of its innocence, because of the uniqueness of its perception,
because the fact that it doesn't seem to be connected to the various power forces
that want to move you in one way or another.
Tone: The Source of Our Cognitive Architecture
So we have these themes of motivation or in the sense of the 6 the lack of motiva-
tion. Behind all of that, we have Tones. Behind this construct when we look at the
way in which it works here you can see that here is somebody that‘s 3rd Color so this
is somebody that‘s here to be motivated by desire, they have transference to inno-
cence. But underneath you can see that they have a 5th Tone that is there. When
you're looking at that Tone, it's called sense in the properties and you can see that
this is about judgment.

Radical Transformations – The Four Lectures
Motivation
When you're looking at Tone please understand Tone is the source of our cognitive
architecture. It's Tone that literally gives us, within our design, the potential to be
intelligent and aware. So when we're looking at this 5th Tone, again it‘s sensory. If
we were talking about it in terms of the body we would be talking about auras and
electromagnetic frequencies and whatever. Here we‘re talking about something that
is called judgment. These are beings who have the sensory capacity to be able to
judge and to be able to judge what should be desired, what desire, what kind of
desire, but not only that but the judgment is inherent in the concept. In other
words, these are going to be very judgmental concepts. They‘re going to be rooted
in judgmentation.
Now obviously, if that person is in transference, if that person is not-self they never
get the advantage of the cognitive potential that's underneath. The other thing is
that judgment cannot be separated from auras and electromagnetic fields. In other
words, that capacity to judge that is there is taking advantage of those sensitivities
as well. But it's concretized in terms of the way the mind works what we would call
being judgmental.
So this is somebody who's going to be judgmental in the way in which their desire
motivates them and motivates them to conceptualize about two things, the gates
that are there, to conceptualize about how you manipulate people, the 44, to con-
ceptualize about how you rationalize, how you can rationalize things through the 24.
In other words, they‘re specific themes where their specialty in conceptualizing oper-
ates.

The 1st Tone: Security
So if we're looking at the Tonal information you can see that the Left Tones over
here on the left side, rather than looking at smell and taste, the teal colors, and
outer vision, we are
now looking at the
larger keynotes here
in the black, so the
1st Tone is about
security. So, the
intelligence of the
person is rooted in
security issues. If
they‘re 1st Tone,
these security issues
are important.
And remember
something about
security issues. I'm
not just talking
about keeping your
house safe. It can
be about your body.
It can be about all
kinds of things. It‘s really about—again, it‘s 1st line—it‘s getting down to dealing with
the unknown and dealing with ways to protect oneself. It‘s connected to the immune
system. It's usually health oriented. There are all of these aspects that are there.
The 2nd Tone: Uncertainty
The 2nd tone is uncertainty. Now again, my fascination with 2s, the uncertainty prin-
ciple is alive and well here. This is the intelligence that‘s there, the intelligence to
recognize in the uncertainty of things that there are things that can be found. One
of the things about the 2s is they know that if they filter well enough, they can get to
a place where they can get what other people can't. They can get access to what
they need to get access to because they‘re always waiting for some kind of call to
come.
And of course, here that uncertainty is going to be a question of taste. Now, it‘s not
going to be taste in the way we saw it in the body. It‘s going to be taste in the way
we talk about it culturally. The taste for this, the taste for that, the taste for opera
or the taste for rock or whatever the case may be.

Motivation
The 3rd Tone: Action
When we get to the 3 we saw in the body, this is outer vision. When we‘re dealing
with the mind, this is about activity. Now, this can be very difficult. This is a stra-
tegic mind whose intelligence is rooted in activity, which means that the understand-
ing of action and the conceptualizing of actions become very strong in this kind of
mind. So this is the kind of mind that says, okay we can take this step, this step and
this step and we‘ll get there. Let‘s do it. And it‘s very easy for a person to surrender
to that and think that their mind is really able to do that for them.
So, it‘s something to grasp. But it's very important that we have those that can do
strategic action analysis. And that strategic action analysis that ultimately is for the
other. When the other says to you, ―What can I do?‖ that‘s when your outer authori-
ty comes out. My standard comment, I have a delicious mind for you, I have a ridi-
culously stupid mind for myself. It‘s just the way that it works. But outer authority,
yeah, outer authority, here it is. This is what we're all here to deliver is this outer
authority.
So here this is the conceptualizing of action. This can end up being a teacher. This
can end up being all kinds of things where you show people what steps to take, how
to do things. It all becomes part of the conceptualizing and again will be routed to
the specific gates. In other words, it'll get honed in.
The Right Side
The right side is so different. Everything about the left is strategic. So everything
about the left is, ―How do I take advantage of a piece of information?‖ Everything on
the right is, ―Did I take it in? There‘s no idea, there‘s no measurement. While the
Left is looking at something it‘s measuring its intensity. ―Yeah, yeah, I got this
thing. I‘m really focused on it. I‘m really honed in. I got it. I got it.‖ The Right is
just flowing by. They‘re like my dog with its big ears in the wind, just going by.
What happens is that you get very uncomfortable. You get very uncomfortable with
proof. This is the thing that‘s so interesting. It‘s why the educational system is
disastrous for Right-minded kids because the educational system says, ―Show me
what you‘ve learned. Show it to me. Tell me what you‘ve taken in.‖ And of course,
the ways in which they do that don't necessarily work to the advantage of Right-
minded beings.
Right-minded beings are taking all of this stuff in, but they have difficulty in being
able to access it so they don't realize how much they‘ve taken in, how deep all of
that is. They‘re insecure in those situations where they're going to be tested, inse-
cure in those situations where ―do I really know that?‖ and they drive themselves
crazy. They study until the end of time. They basically die trying to be Left, to
hammer it in, to focus it, to build a track to grasp it.

I tell people every day of my life to love themselves. It‘s a very difficult thing for
people to do because if you love yourself you trust yourself. And if you trust yourself
you love yourself. Part of following Strategy and Authority is to learn to see that you
can trust. You can trust your own authority. And out of that trust really comes a
sense of love. If you're a Right-minded being, you have to trust in your depth. You
have to trust that what you need is there. The key to being Right is pay attention;
be present. This is the most important thing for Right-minded people: Be present.
It doesn't matter whether you're at the checkout counter, in the pharmacy, it doesn't
matter what's going on in your life, be present, because that's your gift. Your gift is
that in your presence you're taking everything in. The other side of that is just fun-
damentally social. With the right people in your life you will get to see your depth
come out and you get to appreciate what you've been able to take in, in your
process.
I‘m somebody who has a totally unconscious mind. So I‘ve had to learn to trust
myself as a teacher. I don't think. I don't work out what I'm going to teach. I don't
know any of these things, but I've learnt to see that the mechanism works. You've
got to trust your mechanism as a Right being. You‘ve got to trust it. And it won't
disappoint you.
Those things that you take in that you feel like I need to be able to have access to
them, don‘t worry about that. You only need to have access to it when it's neces-
sary. And when it's necessary, it will be there, so don't worry about it. Wait and see
it happen so you can get more and more relaxed with what you are. But be present,
because if you're not present you're not taking in all that data. And that's really
what it's all about. Take it all in. And then wait for it to come out. It will come out.
The 4th Tone: Meditation
So when we're going to going to the right side and we‘re going to the cognitive
things on the right side they‘re very different. They‘re about where we're going in
our future. They‘re about a new quality of sensory awareness that is developing in
us. It begins with this theme of meditation. We saw this in the body as inner vision,
closing your eyes. This is not about meditation in the sense of Hindu Brahman tradi-
tions of techniques for meditation. It has nothing to do with that.
Basically what it has to do with is that it's the opposite of action. In other words,
this is not a mind that‘s there to be busy strategically processing something. It isn't.
This is a mind that‘s just allowed to have its prana. In other words, let the mind be.
Just watch it. These are people that are here to watch their mind. They‘re the ones
that are actually designed, best designed, to actually see their minds, to see the
mind unfold in front of them, the kind of things we‘re looking, the transference, be-
ing able to see these mechanisms because this is a totally different way. This is not
about working on something. Meditation is not about thinking about a specific thing

Motivation
or being locked into a specific theme. It‘s just about allowing the movie to move
across the screen.
There isn't anything else, because in fact, you're only waiting for somebody to focus
you. This is the whole thing about being Right. You can't live without the Left. You
can't live without the focus ultimately being brought to you. It‘s not inside of you.
It‘s got to be brought to you. It‘s brought to you by the other. So it is the other
that takes advantage of your meditative frame. In other words, the fact that your
mind is open and moving, they can tap in at any level of that mind and you can de-
liver. It‘s the magic of what Right really is.
The other thing of course is that the meditative mind, and again, this is whatever the
conceptualizing theme, the motivation will be, the meditative mind is not concerned
with the outside anyway. The outside is just simply what is the food of their process.
But everything is an internal process. It‘s all going on within the world that is
created within their thinking process. It‘s why it‘s so important for them to watch
that mental movie because it's the mental movie where all of their stuff is really
being lived out.
The 5th Tone: Judgment
When you get to the 5, as I said you get to judgment. There is nothing more power-
ful. Think about what we looked at when we‘re looking here at the 5th Color. We
saw guilt. When we look at the 5th line we see universalization. What we're seeing
in these themes is that these themes are there to set things, fix things, and change
things. It's also the heretic. It‘s about setting new standards. It can be very force-
ful in that way. The judgmental minds are very powerful. And if you think about
them in the language of the number, the language of 5s, that judgmental minds are
heretical. The judgmental minds are going to have a universal impact. They can be
practical. They can create suspicions, all of the things that you get out of the 5
themes.
So, it‘s very important to understand that this kind of mind, this kind of intelligence,
is always going to create an edge. I've been doing that all my life. I‘m a 5th line
heretic. I‘m a real heretic. I‘m a living heretic. You create an edge. There are
people who always love me and there are people who can‘t stand me. And it‘s just
the way it‘s going to be. There is always going to be an edge because that's the
moment that you bring 5-ness in. The moment you've got somebody with a judg-
mental mind, they bring an edge.
Now, whether their judgment is correct or not is never the point. It‘s their judg-
ment. It‘s a matter of respect, after all. But it‘s simply something to understand
about this kind of a mind that if this is you, you're here to bring this judgmental
quality to your thinking, you can never afford to hide it. One of the things about the
mind is that the mind looks at itself and wants to re-create its story, wants to devel-
op us in the way in which it thinks we should be and all that stuff. You hide things,

you don't say things, and you bury things. This is an aspect of intelligence that with-
in the not-self doesn't come to the surface very often. The only way it comes to the
surface is as a negative, as a negative judgment in somebody who is not correct,
just simply being able to lay down a statement that says that's bad doesn't mean
that that's a legitimate outer authority.
When it‘s legitimate outer authority, people will take it. Remember this is Right.
They have to ask for it. They have to ask for your meditation. They have to ask for
your judgment, because this is the Right mind. It‘s how you‘re going to put this out.
It‘s what the other is going to get when they ask you something, when they engage
you in dialog, when they engage you in communication.
So, if you're a judgmental mind you have to see—you‘re a Right being—when the
other is pulling that out of you, let the judgment come out; otherwise, you're really
going to be unhealthy. This is deep repression if you don‘t let that out.
The 6th Tone: Acceptance
And finally we get to the 6. We saw in the body this is connected to the sense of
touch. Here the theme is called acceptance. 6s are very unusual. The whole thing
about the 6 is we‘ve already seen that if you look at the 6th Color it is innocent. If
you look at the 6th line it‘s the role model. They‘re all outside of things. They‘re not
connected to what's going on. They get outside of it.
Remember, 6s have to go through all the shit in the beginning of their process. They
spend a lot of time having problems, making mistakes, going through all kinds of
things until they can finally get themselves out of all of that and get out of the whole
thing, all the ways that people connect, all the games, all the crap, they simply get
out of it, go into their own thing, live their own unique process.
This acceptance is the key to transcendence in the way in which we come together
as a community. It‘s one of the things that we were talking about during the inter-
view. That is, the thing that makes Human Design special is that when you meet
somebody through Human Design you can only accept them for what they are.
What else can you do? You look at their design and you see what's there and that's
what's there. And it‘s one of the most beautiful things about this, because it's a way
in which we completely can respect another human being without putting any of our
stuff on it. You are what you are. This is who you are.
The Acceptance of What Is
And of course, when you're dealing with this at the level of this kind of cognitive
potential, this acceptance, this is really what it's all about. It is the acceptance of
what is. It is the acceptance that there are things you can do nothing about. It‘s
what I love when I do partnership analysis, the channel of compromise. Compro-

mise is one of the great bitches of all time. One person has half the channel; the
other person has the whole channel. The person that only has one gate are always
going to compromise to the person that has the whole channel. There is no way that
you can ever change that. There is nothing you can do about it. Not only that, even
when you know what it is, it‘s still terrible. You can never do anything about it.
And you see, the most incredible thing about that is if you can accept at that level,
boy have you made a step, because this is what it's all about. Relationships are the
most complex things in the world. It‘s my standing joke. My partner has the 17/62.
I have the 62. It‘s the channel of an organizational being, the logical mind, the
whole thing. She has her own opinions and she has her own facts. All I‘ve got is
facts. I don‘t have any opinions. Now, I‘ve known this woman 27 years and I have
never ever, ever won an argument. It's not even possible to even think about win-
ning an argument. As a matter of fact, within the context of our compromise I've
always been an idiot, a lifetime of being an idiot. There‘s nothing you can do about
it.
It's not like I could win any of those arguments, because you can‘t because it‘s just
the channel. It‘s not like there's something you can break and fix and pull apart and
yank and repair. You can‘t do anything. You look at it and go, all right, because in
the end it‘s just a weighing thing. You say okay, you have this and you have this,
and there‘s more of this than this, all right. And then you let the other human being
be what they are because there‘s nothing worse than having somebody that you're
connected to in this life saying that you should really change that. Yeah, sure, right,
I‘m going to do that for you. Let me have a heart transplant for you.
This is the whole thing about understanding what real acceptance is, that when you
get to this level it‘s about recognizing that we have to respect each other, because
there is no hierarchy in awareness. There‘s none. There‘s just unique intelligence.
There‘s no hierarchy in that. There‘s nobody better than anybody else, or less, or
this or that. There‘s nobody that has something more important to share than
somebody else, because it doesn't. It may seem that I have a lot that I can share.
But each and every one of you have the same thing in a different dimension, in a
different thing, whatever that thing happens to be.
And unless that comes out we don't all gain the advantage of it. What you gain as
an advantage from me is an advantage I can gain from each and every one of you
because this is the way it‘s supposed to be. And it begins with that acceptance. It
begins with a simple understanding that we are a fixed mechanism, at least in the
way in which we‘re constructed. So, let's let that work the way it's supposed to
work, instead of constantly trying to interfere with it and make it something else.
This technique of watching your transference or watching the distraction, it's there to
constantly remind you for now, for the rest of your life because you'll see it all the
time now, you‘ll never not see it again. And it‘ll keep on reminding you of the joke.
You don't have to be in charge of all of that. The doing truly gets done. Let it get
done. And then you take from this life whatever is truly there for you.

We all have a different road that we follow. We all have different geometries. There
are no generalizations about what it's like. I can remember when I started with my
students and I told them that it would take seven years to go through the cellular
process, they would ask me what it was like, and I‘d say, I don‘t know. How am I
supposed to know what you're going to be like in seven years when you decondition?
It‘s your thing. I don‘t know what that‘s going to look like. Nobody does.
Living Design and Enjoying the Ride
This is the magic of what it is to be involved in something that's about you and not
about ―we‖ or some kind of larger this where we all have to wear the same costumes
and do the same dance. It‘s not about that. It‘s the magic of what's possible when
each of us gets to live out the flowering of our uniqueness. That's what's really here.
It‘s not about changing anything. It‘s not about repairing anything. It‘s not about
working at anything. This is about living. This is about living Design. This is what
you do. You breathe. That‘s all.
And the breathing isn't something you're in charge of anyway. It just happens. Just
follow your breath and let your breath remind you that this is all there is. There is
just this mechanism. There‘s this prana. This prana is moving and moving and
moving. It‘s the way it goes. If you‘re going to get stuck in all the nonsense of how
all this works, what a pain. You miss the whole ride.
It‘s like being given a beautiful tour of some incredible place and you spend the
whole time reading a book. You don‘t see anything; nothing. You miss the whole
story. And the book you're reading is how to enjoy traveling. The madness of what
it is to be a human being. We‘re here for the trip. We‘re really here for the trip.
And if you throw the book away, if you throw your mind‘s whole long story about
this, you can throw it away and you can actually enjoy the ride. And the ride is the
thing
