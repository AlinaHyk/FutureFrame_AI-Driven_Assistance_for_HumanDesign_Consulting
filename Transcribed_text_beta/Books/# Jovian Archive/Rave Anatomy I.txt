INTRODUCTION TO RAVE ANATOMY I
In 1994, Ra published a collection of graphics and keynotes he created to illustrate
his writing 'From The Book of Letters'. He called this work “Rave Anatomy: Mapping
the Mechanics of the Maia.” Rave Anatomy has been graphically updated and was
released in 2008. This course is a deep exploration of the BodyGraph and features
rarely known aspects like the Gates of Gender Differentiation or the BodyGraph's
Memory Network.
This Book is a transcript of the original course taught in the Spring of 2007.

Lecture One
The Senses of the BodyGraph
Good morning to all of you. At least it’s my morning. For some of you it’s morning.
But anyway, welcome to Rave Anatomy. It’s one of those programs that I am
looking forward to. As I mentioned in the build up to the start of this program it was
really based on a series of illustrations that I developed in the early 90s in preparing
to be able to write the first books in Design and to be able to illustrate them. It was
my way, because I’m very visual, it was my way of sort of laying out all the
information and laying out all the data that I thought would be useful, in that sense,
in terms of developing analysis.
This is one of the most significant places, in a sense. It seems very, very superficial.
And as you will see as we move along in this program there are many, many things
that I’m going to deal with in the BodyGraph that have never really been publicly
taught. But when we come here to the senses of the BodyGraph, all of you with
some kind of training in Human Design should have some sense, anyway, of the
keynotes that are here in the way in which they are applied. Obviously, I’m going to
be going through all of this anyway.
Awareness Center Gates
But what I want to begin with is just a
basic visual impression here. And that
impression is that when we’re looking at
the key gates, and quite frankly the
senses and the way in which they
operate in the BodyGraph, though they
are keyed in a particular gate, they
operate through streams. That if you’re
looking at this configuration the first
thing that is obvious is the fact that all of
these gates are operating out of the so-
called awareness centers; that is, the
Spleen, the Ajna and the Solar Plexus.
In this particular illustration, because the
basic illustrations that I’m going to be
showing you, all are updated versions of

RAVE ANATOMY I

the originals, and this was the original illustration of the senses. What I did not
show anyone at that time, because it would have not been possible for me to have
explained it then, simply that the whole basis of the knowledge had to be laid out
first, is that when you see this in its proper context, this is actually the way to see it.
So, here is where we’re actually going to begin.
Perhaps the most important work that’s been done in the IHDS over the last two
years is the detailed investigation of the design and the personality crystals
themselves. And of course, in any investigation of the crystals in understanding the
way in which we are programmed, it is one of these fundamental basic
understandings necessary in order to really be able to understand the infrastructure.
It is an illustration I have drawn out many times. If you assume this is a crystal
here and you have a neutrino stream that is pouring towards it, that when that
neutrino hits the
crystal the frequency
and this is called an
entry frequency, this
is the base. When
that neutrino is
actually within the
crystal and every
crystal is different like
every snowflake is
different, that this
place in here is called
tone. And that the
moment that the
neutrino has moved
through the crystal
and exits here, we
have an exit
frequency and the
exit frequency is
called color.
And if you have this matched on the other side, that is, if you’re thinking about it in
terms of the two crystals of consciousness, what we have in the center is the
Magnetic Monopole and it’s the Magnetic Monopole that attracts these color
frequencies and pulls us together in the illusion of our separateness. This is basically
the way the programming works.
Tone
What is significant for us, of course, is the nature of tone. And tone is—it’s so easy
in Human Design to take any aspect and overstate its importance, because there are
so many things like that. But if you’re thinking about the nature of being and life
itself, that the underlying theme of this whole program is to achieve self-reflected

LECTURE ONE
The Senses of the BodyGraph
awareness. All of that is only possible through cognition. And the tone represents
our cognitive architecture.
So, when you’re thinking about tone and you’re looking at your design and you’re
looking at those themes below the line so you’re looking at color and your tone,
looking at your tone is very, very significant. That is, your tone represents what is
your cognitive potential. Now, remember, that is only a potential. And you can see
the way the cognitive potential, in a sense, sets the foundation for the design.
One of the things that I have taught my students in dealing with understanding tone
is to pay attention to the fact that it is not an accident that the graphic construct of
tone, the triangle, because in fact color is a hexagon and base is a square that tone
graphically is a triangle and this triangle mirrors, in an eerie way, it mirrors the
BodyGraph itself.
In other words, this is the underlying architecture. This is the basic plan that’s here
underneath, but by the time that basic plan, that tone is integrated holistically into
the vehicle we don’t know whether that information has actually moved across.
Because color is something that transfers and if somebody is not-self they are cut off
from their cognition, and therefore they’re cut off from their architecture underneath.
But what’s important in all of this is to let you see why when this construct was first
established what it was based on, because it’s based on exactly what is there in the
tonal architecture. In the tonal architecture we see it as Splenic binary, Ajna binary,
Solar Plexus binary. But if you look at the keynotes you will see that not precisely,
but mostly, these keynotes are the same. So you have your Splenic taste and smell
that are locked in to the Spleen on the surface. The feeling and the touch is locked
in at the surface. And the visual is locked in at the surface.
Of course, one of the things that you see in the architecture is that the central theme
of the architecture is acoustic and of course here you have in the individuality you
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY I

have this acoustic triangle. In other words, what we’re looking at in the BodyGraph
is that the BodyGraph has followed the plan of the cognitive architecture. Not only
has it followed the plan of the cognitive architecture, but thematically these
underlying themes are expressed on the surface.
A Cognitive Goal
In analytical work that is to come in both Rave Psychology and in Primary Health
System, the relationship between the tonal sensory architecture and what actually
has emerged on the surface in the illusion is that the relationship between the two
becomes very important. As an example, if you are somebody that has the 1st tone,
and again referring to this within the context of the Sun/Earth so we’re just looking
at the Personality sun/earth or the Design
sun/earth, which obviously is a 70% key to the
programming. When we are looking at sensory
potential at deeper levels we are looking at it
through the sun/earth configuration.
So you have a 1st tone and let’s say that 1st
tone is something that is a personality 1st tone,
it’s the tone underneath the line and color of
your particular sun in whatever gate it happens
to be. Now, at the same time, if you also
happen to have the 44th gate, or in fact as you
will see, not simply the 44th gate but the 32 or
the 54 or the 26 or the 21 for that matter, then
there is going to be a heightened capacity in
terms of whatever the olfactory is going to bring. In other words, whatever the
quality of smell can bring. It is going to be very different if you’re somebody that
has very strong, for example, tribal activations which tend to point to, at least on the
Splenic side, to smell and that you don’t have a 1st tone either in a personality or the
design.
In other words, the way in which that sense of the BodyGraph is going to work is
going to be less efficient and is going to work in a different way simply because that
being is going to have another sensory quality that is its focus. There are some very
deep things that are here in this relationship between the surface and what the
architecture is underneath and what is the goal of that architecture because in fact it
is a cognitive goal. It’s there to establish a certain sensory potential in that person
which is in fact what they’re here determined to be. In other words, this is what
their differentiation is all about.
But I don’t want to make this over complex because there are some of you that a lot
of this would be very new information. I want to go back first to the basic construct
and see it within the BodyGraph and understand how we see this within the
BodyGraph, because it is different not so much in that—thematically these things are
the same thing. But there is a difference between what is a programming potential

LECTURE ONE
The Senses of the BodyGraph
at the tonal level and what is a possibility of expression that is there at the
BodyGraph level. After all, by the time we get to this surface here, what we are
looking at are basic imprints. Those imprints are part of the differentiation. To
realize one’s perfection in this life, one is going to have to exalt, in that sense, be
correct in the language of Human Design in order for those sensory capacities of the
BodyGraph to be able to function. For me the BodyGraph is the great illusion. So,
the way in which these senses operate can be illusionary. We can confuse them with
the way in which they are intended to be according to the program at the tonal level.
The Progression of Evolutionary Awareness
Let’s take a look and let’s begin, because this is the evolutionary pattern, the
evolutionary pattern is from Spleen to Ajna and from Ajna to Solar Plexus, this is the
progression of evolutionary awareness. And in following that progression that means
that when we are beginning
with the Splenic Center we
are beginning with what is
our basic survival
awareness. As a matter of
fact, it is still the only
awareness that we can
trust. It is the only
awareness, in fact, that we
can trust. We have Ajna
awareness, but we well
know in terms of Human
Design the mind is not
something that is here to make decisions for us in terms of our own process. So, in
that sense, it cannot be trusted. It may be valuable as outer authority and others
may trust the outer authority they receive from somebody’s mind, but in and of itself
it is not something we can rely on for our survival.
And when we refer to the Solar Plexus, though it’s nice to speak of it as an
awareness center, and I always preface that with “so-called,” it’s so-called because
in fact that awareness is something that is emerging, it has not yet emerged on this
plane and we are still dealing with the consequences of the Solar Plexus being a
motor, where in fact, the Spleen and Ajna are not, and as a result we deal with the
wave of that motor, and of course, that makes absoluteness impossible.
It’s something to understand about emotional authority, if you look in the global
survey you’ll see that the largest authority group on the planet are emotional beings,
just over 50% of humanity has emotional authority. We know not only that
emotional authority means no truth in the now, but we know that it never means
absolute anything. You can be 80% clear, 90% clear, 95% clear; I don’t think
anybody ever gets to be 100% clear; I don’t think that’s possible.

The Splenic Binary: A Defense System
So, we have a progression here, and when we’re starting at the Root, when we’re
starting with the Spleen you can see there is also an anomaly in here, which was
part of the original illustrations, and I will get to these at the close, the presence of
the 50th gate and the 6th
gate, and they’re very, very
important in understanding
the sensory system and the
way in which it operates in
the BodyGraph.
But let’s go over for a
moment and see the
parallel. If we go over here
to this side and we’re
looking at what is this
Splenic binary, basically
what we’re looking at is a defense system. It’s a basic defense system in which the
very first tone is simply on alert all the time. This is the whole thing about
smelling—on alert all the time in order to maintain one’s security.
Theoretically, what that means is that if that architecture is moving correctly
upwards into the BodyGraph, being integrated into the holistic being, then that being
whether it is on the design side, which would mean they would simply have in the
physical sense the brain system will be focused on taking in sensory data, they will
have a heightened physical capacity to smell, or on the personality level, smelling in
the sense of being able to interpret information and to be able to have a mind that is
focused on security.
Now whether it is going to be successful in reaching here is another story. But I only
illustrate these two in order to bring us back to the surface and see that it’s not
precisely the same, it can’t be. Yet, the thematic is the same. What I mean by that
is that when you’re looking at taste and smell within the context of the BodyGraph,
when you’re seeing that within the context of the Spleen, that this is essential for
survival.
Smell
It’s not so much about how good the nose is of a 44. And in beginning with smell,
because this is the relationship to the architecture to the 1st line, let’s understand
something about it. First of all, you have to take into consideration the 21, the 26,
the 32 and the 54, this stream that is here as well as that expression of that stream,
or the potential expression of that stream in the 21st gate. All of these gates have a
relationship to smell, all of them.

LECTURE ONE
The Senses of the BodyGraph
Now of course, it’s one of the basic things about tribe. One of the things to
understand is that when I am speaking of smell I am not necessarily speaking of
anything you recognize on the surface. This is about your Splenic system; this is
about your lymphatic system with all its tiny little noses all over your body sniffing
out information that is coming in. And it is one of the gifts of smell in the BodyGraph
that rather than it simply being a tonal architecture, that it is a tonal architecture, it
isn’t. Here the by-product of the potential of smell becomes totally connected to the
material.
In so many ways this stream is about the smell of money and the smell of success
and the stink of failure and all kinds of things. Remember that within the context of
what it is to be a nine-centered being in the 21st century money is survival. And
everything about this smell, when you get it to the BodyGraph it loses all of its pure
architecture, the system of taking in information and becomes pointed. So that the
moment you bring this
sense into the BodyGraph it
is no longer simply about
the idea of a heightened
sense itself, it is about the
by-product of the sense
that the by-product of the
sense is more important.
In other words, that smell
is the basis upon which
material development takes
place. It’s very difficult for
somebody who doesn’t have anything in this stream to really have a feel for the
material plane. And when I say a feel for the material plane I mean a feel for the
material competitive plane. This is a work stream. The 54th gate, the Marrying
Maiden, that marrying maiden that wants to rise all the way up and turn her
numbers around from 54 to 45 and sit at the head of the family and at the seat of
the throne—it is all about rising up, it’s all about rising up on the physical plane.
The 32, the personnel manager, there it is, deeply concerned about who has the
talent, who has the ability in order to be able to ensure that the tribe makes more
money. And the 44, the manipulator, the controller, the one who can handle the
Ego, the one that lays the foundation for the propaganda and the transmission of the
marketing and the sales pitches and if that doesn’t work, well, make uniforms for
soldiers and conquer and force everybody to buy what you have, and so forth and so
on.
And the 26, the sales person warrior, the marketeer, this is what smell becomes
when you leave the architecture behind and you enter into the BodyGraph, it’s what
it’s for. It’s not written back there in the architecture. Again, remember that this is
a floor plan for cognition. But how it gets from this tone through the color to the line
to the gate into the design, that here it takes on a different value. It’s the same, but
it’s different.

So, here security, which at the tonal level when I talk about it, particularly when you
talk about it, for example, from PHS, this is about immune system security. It is
about the inner security of the vehicle. When you see it in the BodyGraph it
becomes making money, it becomes survival on the material plane. That’s what it’s
all about.
Taste
Let’s take the next look. We have taste, and the most interesting thing about taste
when you see taste within the BodyGraph is that of course when you look at the
stream that’s there, the 58, the 18, the 48, the 16, this deeply, deeply logical
stream, this driving need to correct and perfect talent and skills and enrich depth
and all of that stuff. But what taste really brings is judgmentation. One of the
things that it is about is being able to perfect patterns. It’s all about perfecting
patterns.
And it’s so interesting to see the difference between the tonal architecture and the
way in which it’s expressed when you take that up into the BodyGraph. Because
when you look at it in the tonal architecture, in the tonal architecture I stress how
very special this 2nd tone is, this uncertainty principle, that the 2nd tone brings a
certain magic into our potential as a being. Because the 1 and the 2 are both
Splenic, they’re both there to in essence to protect. They’re there to guarantee the
survivability of the vehicle.
When you’re looking at the 1st, this is all about the fundamental protection; it is the
ground floor of what you need to be protected. But when you look at the 2, the 2
doesn’t pay any attention to that. It doesn’t pay any attention to maintaining the
security; it’s not interested in that. It’s interested in what hasn’t happened yet. It is
interested in that thing that is going to make a difference. And in the end it leads to
the kind of mind that we well understand within the human context, the kind of mind
that looks beyond because it knows there’s more. Yet, it doesn’t know what that
more is.
But how funny it is, and here you can really, really, really get a taste of how different
it is when you go from the inner architecture and then you come to the holistic
surface, because when you get to the holistic surface everything about taste in the
BodyGraph is about establishing fixed patterns, correcting them, making sure that
they’re really good.
It’s interesting because if you have the fixed patterns so that you can really see
everything within that context, it allows you to notice anything that doesn’t fit in; the
by-product of what the architecture is all about in the first place. And yet, ironically
what happens in the BodyGraph is that this collective stream in so many ways can
become a deep controlling collective force that locks people into conformity and
challenges anyone who will not stay with the pattern. So, it’s just interesting to see
the way it moves into the BodyGraph.

The Senses of the BodyGraph
The Ajna Binary: Right and Left Eye System
Let’s move up to the Ajna binary, and again you can see I’m avoiding the acoustic
now, we’ll get to the acoustic as I move to the end of this, here we have the right
eye system and the left eye system. Clearly you can see within the context of its
relationship here in terms of the tonal architecture, within the tonal architecture this
is an enormous step, this transition between outer and inner vision, the difference
between what is called left
and right. That is, if you’re
thinking about the body,
left is active and right is
passive. If you’re thinking
about the mind left is
strategic and right is
receptive.
So, we have two different
kinds of visual architecture.
That is, we have the right
eye, and don’t be confused
here because the right eye has its root in left architecture, and the left eye has its
root in right architecture. It would take me a long time to explain how fantastic that
is, but I’m not going to do so. I’ll leave that to your imagination. But anyway, the
right eye and the left eye, the way it emerges in our bodies, the way it works in our
bodies, when you’re looking at the architecture, the left eye, which in this case would
be the left vision, so I don’t confuse you, which is our right eye, this is all about
being able to focus.
When you’re looking at the right vision and you see how it works in terms of the left
eye, that this is not about focused at all, it’s about peripheral vision. So when we
take it back to the surface and we come to this system of the right eye here and the
left eye, the way we understand this in analysis is that the right eye is the logical
eye, and it is the eye that sees in patterns, so here you see this root in the
architecture of being focused, and when we look at the left eye that the left eye is
the abstract eye and as the abstract eye, what it sees is often what it recreates from
the past. That’s what an idea is. It is a re-seen vision.
See, the whole thing about the right eye and the left eye is that the right eye is
always focusing; the left eye is always peripheral. The right eye is always focusing
so it can take action; the left eye is peripheral so it can collect information and data.
So, when we’re looking at somebody who has the 17th gate, as an example, it’s
something to understand that they don’t see everything, they only see something
specific. And of course, this is true for the stream so that the answer is an answer
backed up by a focused opinion, backed up by focused details. It’s very different
from the left eye.

You can see that in the left eye, and of course here is a way to understand my
comment about the crossing systems because in the streaming of the mind the
collective circuits cross. You can see that crossing that takes place. And of course,
the same thing is true here. That is, we have a crossing from the left to the right,
from the right to the left. It’s just interesting to see the way all of this sort of spirals
up because in the sense it’s not even crossing, it’s really just spirals.
You have to see these within the context of their streams always. Again, the
underlying architecture gives you an understanding, at least a deeper understanding
of what the potential is. And of course, the dilemma; it’s one of these things that we
have to deal with is that we are at the Ajna stage of our development. We long ago
left the Splenic stage of development. This belongs to our mammalian ancestors.
This was when the Spleen over millions of years developed its depth.
We have been living in Ajna dominated, visual dominated forms throughout the
whole existence of the seven-centered being, maybe going back, my calculations
about 85 to 95,000 years that we have had this Ajna dominance, and now we’re
about to enter into what is the final stage of that. That is, the Solar Plexus process.
So we’ve been living in this visually dominated world. And of course, the power of
the Ajna being the center of our lives has meant that our minds have become the
rulers of our lives and with that comes all the dilemmas, obviously.
The Solar Plexus
Ok, let’s go down for a moment now and take a look here at the Solar Plexus, at the
feeling and the touch in the Solar Plexus and to grasp something about this. It (the
Solar Plexus) is very different from this (Solar Plexus Binary), even though the
language appears to be the same. There is an evolutionary process that we are a
part of. Most of you know that according to the knowledge in 1781 came the advent
of the nine-centered being. We moved mutatively from being seven-centered, which
had dominated for 85 or 95,000 years and we have moved into this nine-centered
transitional BodyGraph.
If we went back a step to the pre-1781 beings, all of these beings were left-oriented
only. If we go back before the left-oriented only beings we would get back to
Neanderthal and we would get back to a right only being. We are about to move
into, again, a right being, which is going to be the rave. This is the movement of the
cognitive process.
So, we’re at a very unusual point in our development in that this transitional
BodyGraph carries with it two potential cognitive directions. That is, the traditional
cognition of the left, the strategic and active which we inherited from our seven-
centered ancestors and the emergence of the right, cognitive right consciousness
that has been a part of humans being born since 1781 in which the cognitive
potential is far beyond anything that we currently either experience, or in most cases
can understand.

LECTURE ONE
The Senses of the BodyGraph
The 5th and 6th Tonal Potential
When I talk about cognitive architecture in regards to the 5th and 6th tones, when I’m
talking about the 5th tone I am talking about a capacity to take in complex
information from auras, from the electromagnetic field, from chemistry. In talking
about the 6 I’m talking about a tactile sensitivity in which contact can lead to the
absorption of enormous amounts of discernable information. In other words, we’re
talking about a level of sensory sensitivity that is not something other than unusual
and what are, in fact, usually the mutative or the product of injuries, these
phenomena of people that display some of the qualities that I’m suggesting here in
the 5th and 6th tonal potential.
When we take it to the BodyGraph, it was one of the dilemmas for me in the
beginning understanding, because my understanding was that I was taught the
cognitive root, so my whole thing was to be able to differentiate between what is the
cognitive architecture for the eventual
emergence of rave and what is the experience
of this in the Solar Plexus that we live with,
which is a wave complex.
And of course, the moment that you’re dealing
with the Solar Plexus as a motor, and this is
what the surface is about, and it doesn’t matter
whether there are exceptions and there are
emotional beings that are correct now, and
there are, this is about the vast majority of
humanity that the way in which these senses
operate are very crude and superficial.
I don’t mean to denigrate them in that sense,
because in fact when I say that I only say that in relationship to what they could be
emotionally. In fact, emotional feeling and emotional touching in the wave context is
much more profound in terms of its impact and the way in which it is processed
within the vehicle than any thought or any Splenic spontaneity. There is a great
force, obviously, connected to feeling and touch when we think about it in
relationship to its motor value.
But what I want to stress is that we don’t really understand these things in
relationship to what is their true potential. We understand them within the depth of
what is available through the wave. So what we’re talking about is the emotional
response, for example, in touch, what is the emotional affect of that touch. And that
is an energy quality that is taken in. It’s the same thing with feeling. The only
difference is that because we are still Ajna dominated what we have done historically
as not-self is that we have created interpretations for our emotions which are
mental. There are attempts at bringing awareness to wave forms; very difficult to
do.

The Divide between the Solar Plexus Sensory Potential and the
Tonal
For me this difference between the BodyGraph Solar Plexus sensory potential and
the tonal, this is the greatest divide. You can see the connection from the
architecture to the Spleen and the Ajna without much difficulty. But here there is
this huge divide, because it’s the motor that’s standing in the way. And of course, as
long as this motor is standing in the way, the only way that these things can be
interpreted is the way in which you’re taught in Design, which is that you have to
have patience. You have to have patience so the distortion of the wave doesn’t
become the thing that you recognize, that it is the wisdom of processing the wave
over time that truly brings an understanding through whether it is the touch or the
feeling.
The interesting thing for me about the emotional senses in the BodyGraph is that
they are fundamentally social. This is the great contact awareness and it is this
movement of these energies, these wave energies that are the most distorting. It’s
why for that 50% of humanity that is
emotional, each and every one of them that
manages to find a way to come to grips with
their emotional nature, what a transformation
that is, because this is the only way to handle
the wave, is to handle the wave with
awareness.
And it’s also interesting about the mind’s
connection to it. The further mind is away from
decision making the easier it will become for
mind to accept the wave energy without a
distorted interpretation of what it is. I notice
that myself in my own process as a very
unemotional person how different it is for me in
this point in my life as I absorb emotional energy on a day-by-day basis. I have
emotional sons; there are emotional beings that I have contact with. And I notice
how I used to jump to conclusions all the time. I would feel a wave, and I’m very
sensitive to it and I would read it right away and I would interpret it right away.
And often, because of course when you’re unemotional you amplify, you get
amplified. And of course, amplification is always a risk of distortion. Being the kind
of being that I am, so spontaneous is that in that moment of just identifying that
wave in that place I actually got in the way of my potential relationship with that
being on the other side. I really didn’t see anything.
What I’ve learned is not to interpret the emotional wave, just take it in. Just to take
it in as a wave pattern, and to take it in as a wave pattern without trying to use my
mind to make it aware instead of allowing my mind to watch its effect, because it’s

The Senses of the BodyGraph
the effect that’s so fascinating. Anyway, I have too much to cover here, I get carried
away.
The Acoustic
Ok, let’s take a look at the acoustic phenomena. It’s one of the things to recognize
about the architecture is that the architecture is built on frequency. My early
illustration for you about the way this works, that is, the neutrino going through the
crystal, all of this is frequency. And when I say sound, the keynote here, I want you
to understand that this is frequency. It is the key to everything. That is, not simply
that “in the beginning was the word,” but the fact is that you and I and everybody
else and everything else is nothing but frequency at differing levels of density; we’re
just frequency. Everything is moving and everything spins and everything is
vibrating. This is what it is, this is frequency.
So, frequency is the glue. It’s the glue, it’s the bedrock. And it’s something to
understand that it is our most omniscient sense. It connects us in the most deepest
sense to the world. And when you look at the way in which the acoustic is seen
within the BodyGraph, and it’s something that I like very much because you get to
see there is this inner triangle within the larger triangle, which is also within, again,
that larger triangle. It’s like one of those dolls that they sell in Russia, one inside of
the other.
The Right Ear Now
Anyway, I like this inner right there, this
inner triangle. This is the acoustic cord, the
acoustic hub. And you can see there is the
right ear and there is the left ear and there is
the inner ear, or what I amusingly like to call
the third ear, because I don’t think there is
such a thing as a third eye. I think it’s a
third ear. But anyway, I don’t want to get
into any arguments with weirdoes.
Nonetheless, when we take a look at it, it’s
interesting to see the way in which it breaks
down. That is, three kinds of acoustics, in a
sense, three kinds of thematics. You have
this Splenic right ear in the now; I mean in
the now.
It’s so interesting to think about it, think about telephones. Everybody in this day
and age carries one in their pocket, just about. And think about where you put that
telephone when you’re going to make a call or when you’re answering a call. Think
about it. If you’re putting it to your right ear—now of course, if you’re a right-

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
handed person, the chances are that you’re going to use your telephone with your
left hand and you’re going to put it to your left ear, which is interesting to think
about.
But anyway, if you put the telephone to your right ear whatever you hear you get
everything because it is in the now, whatever is said you take in in the now. It’s
very clean hearing. And it’s very oriented to the now. It’s right there to hear. You
can notice this kind of hearing in yourself when you think back to one of those
moments where you were all alone in let’s say a big house and it was all dark and
you heard a funny sound somewhere and suddenly you become incredibly still and
you’re hearing in the now with an intensity that’s unbelievable. This is right ear now
hearing, this intense hearing in the now.
The Left Ear Wave
So, it’s one of our aspects. There is always, in that sense, a part of us that is
acoustically taking in information in the now. There’s another part, though. If you
go over to the Solar Plexus side, to the emotional side, you get the left ear and it is
the ear in the wave. So think about that right-handed person who by nature pulls
the telephone out of their left pocket with their left hand, puts it to their left ear,
they’re not going to hear everything in the now. They’re only going to hear what
attracts their attention;
they’re going to hear in a
wave.
So, that person who calls
you up and is telling you
something and while
they’re telling you that they
hit some button and you
get stuck on that button
and you really don’t hear
anything else. All you
heard was they don’t want
to or you’re fired, all you hear is that one thing, and you don’t hear the rest of it at
all. You may not even hear that what followed the thing that you got stuck on
actually is to your advantage. You can get off that telephone thinking that the world
has fallen apart when in fact you may have been offered the universe, but you only
hear what you hear.
Then you wake up the next morning and it’s, “Did they say…” because it’s a wave, it
comes back. You don’t hear it all in the moment, but you hear it later. It was one of
my things as a professional analyst. I always set up my room environment so that
when clients had a reading with me they were always sitting on my right, so that I
could talk into their left ear. In talking into their left ear I knew that they were going
to, regardless when, all the stuff that I had dealt with sooner or later was going to
pop into their head, because that’s the wave ear and it’s the way it works. It’s

The Senses of the BodyGraph
particularly important for emotional beings. It’s deeply connected to the emotional
system. It’s why there is no truth in the now. Emotional people rarely hear the
whole thing in the now. If you’re down in your wave you have no room to hear. If
you’re up on your wave, hey, who needs to?
The Inner Ear
And then of course, we have the inner ear, the third ear. Individuality is
fundamentally acoustic. It is one of the keynotes of individuality in Design. One of
the things to realize about the acoustic of the mind, that is, the 61, 24, 43, and the
23 is that this is a very, very acoustic mind. This is a talking mind, a noisy mind. Of
course, it is not real sound, is it; that sound in your head when you can hear a
conversation, when you can make one up, when you can set a dialog, all of these
things. There is no sound. But, there is a frequency. And it is this uniqueness of
this inner ear that it is able to translate into what appears to be sound, translates
this with this inner ear, this mind ear. It’s quite a thing. So, when you’re looking at
this, and you’re looking at this whole configuration, what you’re looking at is the
acoustic basis and the acoustic basis that’s there.
So now we have the presence of these various senses that we’ve looked at. It’s also
something for you to note about the nature of your own design. In other words,
what we’re looking at here, these gates that I have mentioned to you, these are
keys. But of course, it’s very important for you to understand that these various
sensory keys are also affecting the streams that they are a part of. It’s important to
see the balance that you have. And for those of you that are deeper in the
knowledge and have tonal background to be able to see comparisons between what
kind of tonal structure is there for you and its relationship to what’s actually emerged
in your BodyGraph, to see what’s actually come through in that sense and the
potential that is there, because obviously there are all kinds of different sensory
potentials in individuals.
The 50th and 6th Gates
But with the little time that I have left, I want to
touch finally here on these two gates, our little
mystery gates here, the 50 and the 6 and what do
they have to do with anything. Awareness—I’ve
done many things about these three centers, the
gates of fear for example. And every single one of
these gates that we’re looking at are gates of fear.
It is so important to understand that within the
context of this knowledge fear is the mother of
intelligence; it’s what it’s about. It is the force, in
that sense, that drives intelligence.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
When we look at the 50th gate in the Splenic Center, the 50th gate is the source of
intelligence. And in the way in which the tonal architecture was built, in that sense,
that the information of the Splenic binary was information that moved through the
50th gate, and then spread out, in that sense. In other words, to really understand
that here is the basis of the way in which the information from the cognitive
architecture is passed to the BodyGraph. And that the 50th gate is not only
responsible for the intelligence of the Spleen, but secondarily responsible for the
intelligence displayed in the Ajna Center, because the Ajna Center is the natural
progression out of the Spleen.
All of that, the intelligence that is “body intelligence” of the Spleen and the mental
intelligence of the Ajna, if we could point to a designer or a source we would go to
the 50th gate. And of course, when we talk about the Solar Plexus system and we
talk about the potential of the Solar Plexus, not simply what we see as its wave
motor function and the dilemmas of that, but understanding that it is also the source
of the potential of the awareness that’s coming. It’s not the initiator of it; that we
know is in the 55 and in the 49 in the codon Histidine. But it is the 6th gate that, in
essence, is the controller of the Solar Plexus system, as the 50 is the controller of
the Spleen.
The Senses are Tools
I have mystical names, the guardian and the builder; they really are the instruments
of bringing cognitive potential into the BodyGraph. But I also want you to grasp that
when you look at cognition at the tonal level, it is very profound. And when you look
at senses at the BodyGraph level, they’re very mundane. That’s what they’re
supposed to be; they’re mundane. These are tools and they are tools for not simply
survival, they’re tools for survival, reproduction, the cultural and physical
development and all of these things; they’re tools.
And it is the tools that the holistic form gets to use. It’s one of the most profound
studies to be able to look at the work of the Magnetic Monopole in bringing together
these two very, very different programming schemes and to bring them together into
this holistic vehicle and to provide this vehicle with the tools that it needs for its
survival and for its correctness.
Remember something about what happens to us when we’re brought together in this
illusion. It’s deeply connected to what is this inner frequency. That is, this acoustic
triangle that is in the center and its relationship here to this Magnetic Monopole. It is
the Magnetic Monopole by its very attraction frequency from the crystals of
consciousness, which in fact are here; it pulls their information together to create
this holistic form. And yet, it’s so essential to understand that the Monopole
responds to the frequency of the form at the same time that it holds it together. It
is a biofeedback, or a frequency feedback system. The Monopole is always attracting
and in its work holding together this totality.

LECTURE ONE
The Senses of the BodyGraph
Now, if this totality doesn’t operate correctly then there are problems with the
attraction frequency. When there are problems with the attraction frequency,
instead of getting the true tonal architecture coming through from either side, that
what we get is a harmonic distortion of the color. And instead of the color being a 1
it ends up being a 4 or a 2 or a 5, 3, or 6 and so forth and so on. And this whole
being ends up being not-self, because its frequency is not correct.
Strategy and Authority
In the end it doesn’t matter what I teach, I come to the same place. It’s all about
Strategy and Authority. It is only through Strategy and Authority that you can align
your vehicle to a frequency that is correct, a frequency that begins with the tonal
architecture that is there, your potential cognition at the design side, being able to
align and correct the physical frequency of the body so that the body operates
correctly, and then the process of beginning to align the mental body so that the
mental body can function correctly.
The BodyGraph is a Sensory System
But Strategy and Authority immediately aligns the vehicle to what is correct for it,
immediately brings it in touch with its cognitive resource. If you take all of these
streams and then you move them into their circuits, the first thing to recognize is
that the BodyGraph is a sensory system, period. It is nothing but a sensory system.
This is us. We are filters of consciousness. We are incredibly powerful sensory
mechanisms, everything about us. And this is what we have in our BodyGraph.
These are the tools that are there, to keep us alive, to keep us alert, and to keep us
in touch. To give us the possibility of going beyond the homogenized field and
beginning to experience the treasure, the treasure of what it is to be us.
Ok, it was nice that you were all here this morning. I enjoyed my coffee and my
morning with you. We will have some interesting things to look at as we go along in
our journey in the BodyGraph. To all of you that didn’t make it, I do understand.
It’s an odd hour for many of you, but nonetheless, I’m glad you get to download it.
So, until next week, bye for now.

Lecture Two
The Word
Ok, good morning to all of you. You can see that the subject today is a lovely one.
It is so interesting for me going back to the original Rave Anatomy text and see
where my priories were at that time. After all, it was put together in the early 90s.
In laying it out I was laying out the basic infrastructure of how I would teach people
the nature of the BodyGraph.
The Throat Center
The moment you look at that, you have to see that it is about the Throat Center.
The Throat Center is really one of these fantastic things in the BodyGraph. In the
early days I described it as Rome in the sense of the saying that all roads lead to
Rome. When you look at the Throat Center, the Throat Center is a real hub of the
BodyGraph. Manifestation, and I don’t
mean Manifestors, everything about
life is about life manifesting on this
plane. And the whole theme of
manifestation, everything we
understand about manifestation we
find here in this Throat Center. And
yet the Throat Center is so different
from all the other centers. It really is;
it’s very, very different. It’s different
in a couple of ways.
The first thing is the understanding
that we’re dealing with the most
complex of all the centers. Not only is
it the most complex of all the centers,
but if you look at the gates themselves
you’ll see that they run in a band
throughout the Quarter of Civilization.
In other words, all of these aspects are
in one quarter of the wheel itself. The
Quarter of Civilization is all about the establishment and the maintaining of the form
principle on the planet. In other words, through the thyroid, in that sense, through
the Throat we see the ability to be able to manifest form on the planet.

And not only that, but in looking at it to understand that all of these 11 gates, every
single one of them is connected to the same biological function. It’s not like the
Heart Center with four gates and four very distinct biological associations, one for
each gate. In other words, the deep complexity of a center that even though it only
has four gates as compared to the 11 here of the Throat Center, it has much more
complexity at the biological level—the stomach, the heart, the gall system, the T
cells—you look at that and you think each gate representing that kind of biological
information; and here, just one thing.
And it’s something to recognize about this unity. This unity can only be found in one
thing and one thing only. The unity of that single biological association is found in
what we call the voice, or in what we call the way in which language comes out of
us.
I was fascinated when I first began my own studies of the BodyGraph that human
beings had no idea of where their voice came from. It was the first thing that was so
clear to me. If you ask any child where their words come from, they will tell you
their words come from their mind. That’s what they’ll tell you because that’s the
way in which they’re conditioned.
Yet, when you look at the BodyGraph and you look at the potential of voice and you
see the potential of voice in its relationship to mind, only three of those eight gates

LECTURE TWO
The Word
have words, in that sense, that are derived from the mind. And it’s one of the first
things to come to grips with. Anyone who is beginning any kind of study in Human
Design that so often things are just sort of mechanically recognized. In other words,
here is the Throat, it has 11 gates, and each gate has a voice. But the thing that is
so profound in all of this is to begin to understand what it means to listen to what is
your true voice, and to understand where it comes from.
The potential of the 16th voice comes from the Spleen, not from the mind. And when
you’re a 16/48 and you are operating spontaneously on the verbal plane, it is your
Spleen that is speaking, literally. It’s one of the most difficult things for people with
complex authorities, those people who have the G connected to the Throat, the self-
reflected authority. Everybody says, “Well, how does that work? How does this
work?” Ok, it’s very simple how it works. It’s spontaneous to begin with, and it has
to do with the word.
Anything that is going to be expressed by that Throat, anything that is going to be
expressed spontaneously by that Throat is going to be language that derives directly
from the G Center. And of course, what I always recommend to these people, as an
example in a reading, is that you cannot make up your words in your mind. In other
words, don’t try to create your conversation pattern before you have it, “I’m going to
say this, they’re going say that; I’m going to say this, they’re going to say that,”
blah, blah, blah, all that stuff. Because this is the tendency, the tendency is to try to
find the words in your mind even when it’s not natural for you. This is deep, deep
conditioning.
And of course, on the other side is not trusting words that come from your Spleen or
your Ego. Think about the Ego Manifestors, the 45/21s. Think about it. When they
are speaking spontaneously it’s their Ego talking and that’s what they have to trust.
But the moment it’s their mind trying to create the words they’re going to speak,
that’s when they’re in real trouble.
It’s very important for anyone to understand where their voice comes from, where
their words come from, because they don’t just come from the mind. The other
thing is there is enormous difference in the potential of any of these 11 gates. And
we can see that they operate in themes or in patterns or in groups. That is, the
three gates that are pointed upwards to the Ajna. We have the collective gates that
point exactly downward in that sense to the emotional system, one that goes directly
to the Spleen, and one that goes directly to the Ego. You have these various
patterns that are there—the three that go down to the G Center, the complexity of
the 20 and integration and the way in which that works. They’re very different.
Some of them have manifesting potential. Some of them have emotional potential.
Some of them are projected potential. Some of them are only mental. There is
nothing more complex. And my point in entering into this discussion today about the
Throat is not simply about the obvious and the obvious being that most of you by
now should have an understanding of the different voices that come out of the
Throat, and obviously if not, it’s here. But no, it is about the quality, the binary
quality of these voices that is the subject of today, and this is what you can see that
is written in association with each of these gates. It’s this quality that is often
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

21
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
deeply overlooked in understanding the way in which the voice operates. And in
understanding it, understand the quality that that brings to the expression and the
way in which it colors the expression and gives it a quality that is either a this or a
that. And in each of them lies this potential.
Let’s begin with looking at the gates that are pointed upward to the Ajna Center.
Think about these gates. They are deeply unusual. They are metamorphic. In other
words, they are more than just receptors of mental concepts. They are translators
of mental concepts into language. Because, after all, the language is not there in the
Ajna Center. The language emerges out of the Throat.
The 62nd Gate: Reasonable/Unreasonable
So, for example, when we look at the 62nd gate as part of the logical process, when
we look at that 62nd gate we look at a voice that says: I think, or I don’t think. I
think it’s ok; I don’t think it’s ok. Think is a logical key. It’s logical. In other words,
when you’re listening to somebody in conversation and
they keep on saying, I think, I think, you’re going to find
somebody who is logical because it is the natural
frequency as an expression of the way in which the
logical voice works. It says, I think.
But think about in this context what the quality is,
because the quality is very revealing: Reasonable,
unreasonable. Now what is the 62nd gate? It is the gate
of facts. It is the gate of details. It’s the gate that gives
the foundation to the conceptual opinions of the 17, and
in working with those conceptual opinions, grounding
those opinions in language. And that language in the
way it’s expressed is that these are either going to be
reasonable beings—I think this is the way it works and what do you think—or
unreasonable. And of course, you get that a lot.
For example, 17/62s because they have their own way in which they substantiate
their opinions, that doesn’t mean if you have the definition that what you’ve logically
organized is a truth. It just means that you’ve logically organized something and
you can express it. And you can express it reasonably or you can express it
unreasonably and you begin to see character expression in a voice.
We know these people. And though every single one of them has the potential to
fluctuate between the binary—the reasonable, the unreasonable—in other words,
there is this potential always, we get to see in this life that there are those that are
much more reasonable in the way in which the communicate and those that are
much more unreasonable in the way in which they communicate. It’s a quality.
Everything about voice is something that the actor/actress has to discover, how one
can take a word and change the word through the quality of the expression. This is

LECTURE TWO
The Word
how we put out information. If somebody says to you, oh, hi (happy voice), it’s like
you get certain information. If somebody says, oh, hi (bored voice) you get another
set of information. It’s something to recognize that we all do this; we’re all cued to
the character quality of somebody’s voice; all of us.
One of the things that we learn when we study the nature of the crystals of
consciousness is that the key that binds all cognition is acoustic—sound, frequency.
When somebody is speaking to you it’s not their words that carry the greatest value.
They carry a value, obviously, but the context of the words, the quality of the words,
how comfortable are we with the unreasonable expression of fact. Some people like
it, they respect it; some people don’t. In many cases it may be utter nonsense. But
again, something to recognize about our voices is that our voices reveal our quality
and most human beings are conditioned and are conditioned to speak out of voices
that are not their own.
For years students have heard me in moments where for some reason, whatever,
the program, being in their aura, I suddenly say something like, I believe, I’ll
immediately stop and say, wait a minute, I don’t mean that. That’s not my voice;
because it isn’t. When I hear myself say, I believe, I know I’m in trouble, because
that’s not me, I don’t have that. I’m not a believer, it’s not my voice. It’s not built
into me.
Again, it’s one of those things about coming to recognize yourself and coming to
understand who you are, because who you are is expressed through the potential of
whatever voice may be for you. Now, not everybody has a defined Throat,
obviously. But there are very, very, very few examples of somebody with absolutely
no activations of the Throat. It’s a very small percentage. And obviously they
operate, have to operate in a physical way of communication. It’s very different
from the vast majority. But I don’t want to get into anomalies.
The Gates in One’s Throat are Keys
The key is to understand that whether you have a defined Throat or not, the gates in
your Throat are a key to you, because it’s something that you need to hear. You
need to hear it. You need to hear your own voice, and to know when the
conditioning forces are there. The moment that you begin to understand
somebody’s design, somebody close to you that you have contact with. And you
examine carefully their Throat, you look at what their voice is and then listen to
them speak. Just listen to them speak.
It is just so obvious when you know somebody’s design and you hear them speak,
you can always tell when they’re speaking from their voice or not. And that if you’re
somebody that has an open Throat where you’re very vulnerable to the way in which
you’re going to be conditioned verbally, to know what is your natural potential in
your Throat is very important for you, because at least you’re going to express your
quality, because it’s the quality that’s important. These are tools for us. None of us
want to be flat in the quality of our expression, this monotone, even—we don’t even

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
like dealing with acoustically people where you cannot get this movement in the
quality of their voice so you can read them, because our voices carry these things.
My 62 carries the potential of the reasonable/unreasonable expression. But I have a
complex Throat, I have many gates, so they all come together and you begin to
synthesize the nature of the voice, and out of that its character.
The 23rd Gate: Insist/Desist
Ok, so let’s move along and we move over to the 23. Here we’re dealing with a shift
out of the collective into the individual. Of course, the 23rd gate is a gate that says:
I know, I know, I know, I know. I’ve said “I know” so
much in my life; I tell you it’s weird. I know, I know, I know—
it comes out when I don’t even know what I’m saying “I know”
to, because it is just a program—I know, I know, I know.
And of course, the whole thing about the quality of this voice is
that it is either the insistent—“I know; I know and you don’t,”—
or it is the desisting “I know” that says nothing. It just holds
back. And of course, the whole thing about the 23, the whole
thing about individuality that unless it can mutate the other it
can never really be established in the world. And of course,
every single individual has its “I know” that isn’t necessarily
valuable to the totality as a mutative step forward—the
genius/freak. It is better for the freak to desist, they learn that
very quickly. They learn not to express their “I know” with a quality that is offensive
to the other because they don’t want to be picked on as a freak, and so forth and so
on. So the voice becomes a mask. It’s what you see in these qualities.
The 56th Gate: Hope/Despair
The 56th gate, and again, back to the abstract. Of course, there
is something that always has to be understood about the
abstract and that is it has a deep relationship to the Solar
Plexus system. It just does. The human experiential way
which operates through the emotional system is an abstract
stream—the 41 up to the 35—and everything about the
abstract mind is that because it’s an experiential mind rooted in
the past it is deeply influenced by the experiential way. In
other words, it is deeply influenced by the effect of the rise and
fall of the life ruled by the fates.
So, when you come to the 56th gate, this is the voice of “I
believe; or I don’t believe.” So we have “I think or I don’t think,” which is logical,
“I know or I don’t know,” which is individual, and “I believe or I don’t believe,” which

LECTURE TWO
The Word
is abstract. This is a quality of hope to despair. And of course, you see the same
thing in the wave pattern itself. In other words, the Solar Plexus wave pattern that
rises up on the hope wave only to go crashing down to the despair side, and so forth
and so on.
This is a voice that has a quality that can be deeply uplifting. This is the voice of
hope, this is the place of the spiritual story, the parable, the revelation, all of these
wonderful things, the idea that can give you hope, all of that; and of course, on the
other side, the despair. And the very same thing, this is the thing to understand
about the voice. Today is called The Word. Think about the 56. The 56 says, “I
discovered something,” just that, “I have discovered something.”
Now, the way in which that is heard by the other and the way they’re going to deal
with it, respond to it, react to it, whatever the case may be, is not in the words of “I
have discovered something today.” Their connection to that expression is the quality
of the voice. If it is that excited, hopeful “I have found something today, eureka,”
everybody is jumping around—“I want to hear it, what have you discovered.” And
on the other side—“I found something today” (quiet, serious voice), everybody gets
nervous and quite uncomfortable and are not sure they even want to hear it.
It doesn’t even matter that when you finally tell them what it is, it is the quality of
the voice that is going to be interpreted. We think it’s the words. There are so
many people that can teach Human Design in this era. And we all teach the same
thing, but we all have a different verbal quality. It’s just the way that it is. And that
verbal quality has a specific kind of impact. And obviously, verbal qualities, which is
a whole study in itself, becomes deeply complex when you begin to deal with very
complex Throats in terms of activation, whether they’re defined or not. The
complexity of what kind of quality, what kind of voice is really there, the richness, if
you will, of the potential of that particular quality of voice.
But I want you to begin to understand that when we are communicating with each
other and all of this is about understanding communication, that when we’re
communicating with each other what is really being read as the frame is the quality
of the voice, not the words. The words are secondary. It’s the quality. Are you
ready to listen to an unreasonable opinion? Do you know what I mean? Are you
ready to listen to someone’s insisting “I know,” because it carries a quality that
changes the very value of the words even if the words are always the same? How
many actors have played Hamlet. The words are always the same, but every Hamlet
is different. And it’s different because of the quality that is there in the expression.
It’s a wonderful thing to begin to grasp. It explains so much about the dilemmas in
the way in which we communicate, because remember that our communication in
terms of the not-self is in order to get information for your mind to make decisions.
And of course, you end up in a horrendous trap. And the things that you are attuned
to as not-self, you’re somebody with an open Ego and you feel like there’s been a
thumb placed on you all your life, you’re more likely to listen to somebody’s despair
than to their hope, be more tuned into the despair frequency.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
Think about the songs that we enjoy. So much of the lyrical value of music is sort of
banal, but it doesn’t interfere with a great pop song. It’s not simply about the
musicality of it. It is the quality of the voice. It’s always that. It’s what the voice
carries, because this is the magic that’s in the voice. The fact that we can code it
mechanically and see what the voice is expressing as a generic—the “I think” simply
being a logical expression—it’s only when you grasp the quality do you begin to get
what’s going on.
The 16th Gate: Approval/Disapproval
Let’s move along; we don’t have forever today. Let’s take a look at the Splenic side.
When you take a look at the Splenic side we get the 16th gate
and the 16th gate says: “I experiment.” Of course, it
should ring a Human Design bell, in that sense, this being
the great logical experiment to follow your strategy in Human
Design. This is the: “I experiment with the pattern; or I
don’t experiment with the pattern.”
You can see that the voice quality speaks to the importance
of the logical process in our lives. But it is also a voice that
can be deeply uncomfortable. The voice of disapproval is
deeply uncomfortable. The voice of approval this is
something that is very, very soothing to so many human
beings. Of course, when you understand this gate as a skill
gate, that its ability to be able to express the talent, the skill
that is inherent in it, is all about this voice carrying with it this power to challenge.
The parallel to the human experiential stream is the movement from the 58 to the
16. And this movement from the 58 to the 16 is all about challenging patterns until
they are absolutely efficient. And of course, what that means is that this is the voice
of collective approval or collective disapproval. When this person says, “I don’t like
that group,” if they say it with that deep disapproval in their voice, boy is that very
powerful—the critics.
The 31st Gate: Authority/Powerlessness
You can see that logical beings can be unreasonable in their disapproval, as an
example. We have three logical voices in the Throat. And those logical voices, if we
go to the third logical voice we have the 31, the voice of: I lead or I don’t lead,
the channel of the alpha, the voice of authority or the voice of powerlessness. You
want to follow a leader who has a powerless voice? We see them—these people who
dream of being leaders and nobody votes for them and they’re gone within a few
moments of declaring their candidacy, because they don’t have the quality. When
we think about a leader we want to hear that authority in their voice, we want to
know that they’re in charge.

LECTURE TWO
The Word
And then when you begin to look at the complexity of a logical
voice, this logical voice that can be the reasonable approving
authority, or this unreasonable indecisive powerlessness, or any
combination thereof. And then you begin to understand the way
in which logic is expressed. Some people have none of these,
some people have one. For example, I have one; I just have
the 62, so I’m not an approval/disapproval person. And I don’t
have that authority powerlessness business for the Throat. By
the way, I have the gates that point at each of them. That’s
another conversation entirely.
The 35th Gate: Encourage/Discourage
But it’s these qualities that begin to give you a real insight into the way in which
these things are communicated. And of course, it’s being communicated by a not-
self mind that’s doing it strategically in order to be able to improve its own life. The
same thing is true of the abstract. That is, the 35th gate, perhaps one of the most
powerful voices that we have, literally. It is the gate of progress, it is the expression
of the experiential way in the Throat, it is the voice of I
feel or I don’t feel, and it’s “I feel good because…” or “I
don’t feel good because…” or whatever the case may be.
But its voice, because this is the experiential way this is
one of the most important voices we have, this
encourage/discourage voice. This voice that can encourage
you to keep on dealing with the program, that life is what it
is, but keep on, to encourage you to continue in the
process; or to discourage you, to encourage you to go into
something, or to discourage you.
But the same thing is always true of quality. It’s not the
words. The words can be the same. “It’s quite an
adventure,” can be said by the 35. And it can say that
encouragingly or discouragingly and it’s just the same thing, it’s the same words.
And they will have a totally different effect. Obviously, the moment that you have a
Throat gate that’s open to the emotional system, it’s open to the volatility of the
impact of the emotional conditioning on that voice.
And of course, we know that emotional voices, when they’re connected to the Solar
Plexus Center, are voices that are going to roll through their particular binary, being
encouraging voices when the wave is sustaining it and discouraging when it’s not.
Again it’s about the same things, usually about the same person.
It’s one of the things you see sexually in terms of the difference between the 12 and
the 35, the 12 says it didn’t work between you and I because of me, and the 35 says
it didn’t work between you and I because of you. And that encouraging and
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

27
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
discouraging can be devastating or could be enormously productive. And of course,
as long as it’s tied to the emotional wave of the not-self you know what’s going to
happen. The same person will get both the encouraging and discouraging voice
depending on the situation.
The 33rd Gate: Experience/Inexperience
Then of course we have the third member of the abstract voice and that is the 33: I
remember or I don’t remember. Of course, this is the voice of experience or
inexperience. It is the voice of having the secret or not
having the secret, having the revelation or not having the
revelation, whatever the case may be.
The 33rd gate’s job is to be able to assess experience as
experience. Remember that the 35 will assess the
experiential way through its relationship to the other;
whereas, the 33 is simply looking at phenomena. In other
words, looking at the way in which events or things
unfolded. Again, this voice of experience/inexperience
distorts what you hear from the 33.
I have a 33 voice. And of course, if I’m talking to somebody
about a mystical experience of mine and I’m carrying the
inexperience voice quality, they’re not going to believe me
for a moment. And I say “believe” because it’s all within the
abstract context. If the remembrance carries that experienced quality so you know
that somebody’s really been there, you can feel it, you can sense it, you can taste it.
It’s very different the way in which you’re going to respond to the information.
So often the inexperience quality in this voice suggests to people that this is second-
hand, third-hand, fourth-hand, fifth-hand, sixth-hand information. It’s the quality,
not the words. Where does your true quality come from? It comes from you living
out your correctness. It’s not like you can select a side. Or that you’ll exclusively
only get one side of it. It simply is about the correctness of the proper balance of
your tonal quality so that people will actually listen to you.
We don’t know how to communicate with each other. Most human beings have no
idea where the words are even coming from. And they think that their words are
carrying the information that is going to make the difference in their connection to
the other, and it doesn’t. It is the quality, and the quality is a reflection of
correctness or not. Obviously, if one is not-self and not correct then the quality is
distorted. And it becomes deeply distorted and amplified when you begin to speak
out of gates under conditioning that are not yours. It’s no wonder that people have
such a dilemma in being able to communicate with each other.

LECTURE TWO
The Word
Keynoting the Three Abstract Gates Together
So if we look at these three abstracts together, we see the hope to encourage
experience, or the experience to encourage hope. That can be lovely, no? And
of course we have the despair that can discourage inexperience. Or inexperience
that is discouraged by despair, or whatever the case may be. Just the stringing of
the keynotes begins to give, obviously, all kinds of combinations of that. Again, in
my case, I have one of these, I have the 33.
We’re going to have people that will have all three, people that will have two, people
that will have none. Again, to begin to understand the dynamic that is there, the
quality that is inherent there and that’s what their communicative presence is all
about.
Individual Gates
Let’s look at the individuality. When you see individuality, individuality has the most
activations. In individuality there are four different potential expressions in the
Throat. So we see that there are three logic, there are three abstract, there are four
individual and one tribal.
The 20th Gate: Decisive/Indecisive
So when we’re looking at the individual, let’s go to the 20th gate, and of course, the
20th gate is deeply complex. It is this: I am now. But of course, this is an
existential gate that is deeply dependent on integration in
order to be able to establish its now-ness. And because it is
an existential voice, this is the only voice that truly
expresses the individual process of being in the pulse. That
is, in the now the 20th gate can only be decisive if it knows,
and cannot be decisive if it doesn’t know. And that knowing
has to be there in the moment.
So, the decisiveness comes from the mutation, whatever
that may be, the potential of the possibility of expression in
the now. So often the 20th gate is deeply indecisive. And
indecisiveness is a theme of being individual. After all,
knowing is not a pattern, and knowing is not a process. It is not collective. Knowing
is something that is mutative and spontaneous—it’s there and it’s not.
The dilemma of the individual mind when you’re a child and somebody says to you,
would you like to do this, and you say, I don’t know. And that is not satisfied
because they need an answer, they need a yes or a no. And you say, I don’t know.
And what do they say to you? They say, make up—funny way of expressing that,
isn’t it—make up your mind. Now, for collective minds that’s easy. If you’re logical

RAVE ANATOMY I

you look at the pattern, you see where it could go and based on that you say, yes or
no. If you’re abstract you look back to your experience to things that are similar and
based on that you decide yes or no. So you have ways of making up your mind.
But individuality does not. So it is inherently indecisive. It’s why the 55th gate is the
most fickle of all gates in sexuality—I love you, I don’t love you. I don’t know is
really what they’re saying; they just don’t know. They’re waiting for the pulse.
They’re waiting for that bolt of lightning. They’re waiting for that rockets blaring in
order to have that “yes, I can be decisive.” And of course, one of the dilemmas of
the 20th gate is to understand that our existential quality, that is, the voice of our
existential presence is never regularly decisive.
So, it isn’t the kind of voice that makes others particularly comfortable. That’s why
when you think about integration you have to realize that integration isn’t very good
with other people because it cannot be consistently reliable. You can’t rely on an
integration being. They are not individual in the sense of the individual circuit. They
have very, very poor, very weak social skills in that sense simply because they
cannot make necessarily a decision in the moment; they can’t.
You rush up to them and you say, I have a real problem, can you help me? I don’t
know. It pisses people off. I will do that often because it’s just me; I can’t escape
my individuality. And somebody asks me something and my answer is, I don’t know.
And it’s not at all satisfying to people. This is the inherent indecisiveness of
individuality deeply expressed in this voice.
The 8th Gate: Certain/Uncertain
Ok, we move along and we go over to the 8th gate, the
other side of the 23 in the middle dynamic here and this is
the voice of: I can, I know I can. The little train that
could—I know I can, I know I can, I know I can. This voice
can be so powerful. The whole dilemma with individuals is
that because of their dynamic they will say things. The 23
saying, “I know,” doesn’t mean they do. And the 8th gate
says, “I can,” but it doesn’t mean it can.
When it says, “I can,” if it says that with the certainty
quality, that carries a lot of power. When it says, “I can,”
and the quality is uncertain, everybody knows. Again, it
goes back to the dilemma of what it is to be individual. And
in the dilemma of what it is to be individual there is always
this indecisiveness, this `not’ that is there until there is
something that is.

The Word
The 12th Gate: Caution/Abandon
And of course, finally we have the 12th gate of: I act or I don’t. Basically, this is “I
know” because the “I know” is always there. What is
interesting about this voice is this caution, abandon. The
12th gate is a deeply, deeply mutative gate. This is one of
the most mutative voices in that it is able to be the
representative of the social potential of individuality to be
able to mutate others.
So much of this caution and abandon is about knowing
when to act or not. Everything about this voice is that
this voice expresses social potential either with an
underlying caution or that abandon. And the abandon is
often the blindness in their voice that leads them into all
kinds of emotional dilemmas.
Quality of voice, it is the quality of voice that expresses
the theme of individuality. The insisting, decisive, certain caution in dealing with the
other; but, it’s there, this power of the individual.
On the other hand, there is a complete kind of withdrawal to desist, to desist in your
uncertainty, to abandon in indecisiveness. Individuals can have voices that seem
really lost and not properly integrated, in that sense. Because unlike the logical or
the abstract voices there is a process that exists whether one’s quality is on one side
or the other. In fact, with individuality there is an emptiness to the voice, there’s an
emptiness to the words, I should say, when there isn’t that opportunity for
decisiveness which is this presence of the mutation.
Again, to understand it’s not about we have a kind of selective process here in the
way in which we’re going to go through that. It really is about understanding that it
comes naturally out of your correctness. And of course, it’s something to really
grasp that the way in which you express yourself, if you’re not expressing yourself
according to your type, then you’re not even allowing yourself the opportunity to
even begin this process of having your quality attached to your voice.
The 45th Gate: Possessive/Non-Possessive
The 45 says, I have or I don’t have, and it’s a possessive or
not voice. It is this quality that we are interested in, it is this
quality that expresses what kind of person we’re dealing with.
It’s the quality in the voice that is always giving us our keys.
It’s why we don’t understand the other, because we don’t hear
their quality.

Do the Experiment
You do the experiment. Do the experiment. Pick one person in your life that you
have a lot of contact with. Just one; don’t let them know, just look at them. Look at
their Throat. If they have a defined Throat look at the definition because it is the
definition, and if they have more than one, look at those, it is the gate in the Throat
through the definition. Obviously, it’s going to be stronger than gates in the Throat
that are not defined. Nonetheless, you have to look at all of them, but the dominant
way in which they’re intended to speak is through those defined gates. And then you
look at the quality of that. Then pay attention to them when they speak and listen to
see where their voice comes from.
If the person that you’re looking at has an undefined Throat, then look at the
activations in the Throat. Those activations in the Throat are going to be indicative
of what are the healthiest voices for those beings. When you watch and you listen,
what you will discover right away, particularly in the case of the open Throats is that
they rarely speak with their own voice, and therefore do not put out a quality that
has anything to do with them. It doesn’t.
And what you’ll notice about defined Throats is that the defined Throats get locked
into one aspect over all the others. In other words, they tend to speak only through
a certain voice, and they tend to get locked into the quality of that voice because
they’re not-self. And the very quality of that voice is something that adds to the way
in which their not-self strategy operates.
I began today before the class began with a discussion of comedy. It is deliciously
ironic, in that sense, to call today’s class “The Word” and to see how confused we
really are about what communication really is. Not simply what the voice is and
where the voice comes from, these words that we speak, to begin to really
understand that it is the quality of the expression that carries the meaning. And the
quality of the expression is like the beauty of an aura when the being is correct.
When the being is correct the aura works correctly, it has the right frequency. If it’s
a Generator aura it naturally calls others so it can have its possibility of responding.
And in response it will naturally reflect the quality of its true voice.
It doesn’t matter whether your quality is on this side or that side at any given
moment as long as it’s your voice and that it comes out naturally. Because then
what you want to communicate you can communicate. Oh, people try so hard with
the words, because they think it’s the words that are going to make a difference, the
way they phrase their request, the way they phrase their admonishment, the way
they phrase this or that. I have to use the right language, I have to say it—all that
stuff. But it isn’t.
Oh, yes, it carries importance, we know that. But how is it going to get in? How is it
going to be received? It is received through the quality of the frequency itself. I talk
a lot these days about the frequency of the holistic body, a frequency that is
maintained by the Magnetic Monopole in the way in which it attracts the exit
frequencies of the design and personality crystals at the color level, and that this is

LECTURE TWO
The Word
an energy feedback system in which the Magnetic Monopole holds together the
illusion of separateness which becomes the frequency. And if the illusion of
separateness doesn’t operate correctly, if it is not-self, then the frequency is
distorted. When the frequency is distorted, the aura is distorted. The whole way in
which the being operates is distorted because they are operating out of not-self
conditioning and they’re operating out of their mind making decisions. And you can
bet that their voices and the quality of their voices are deeply distorted.
Most human beings—I’ll never forget the experience of a woman whose design I was
doing in Berlin in the early 90s. I was doing it through translation. There was a
point—I was talking about the 12th gate—at which she stopped and she said to the
translator that I was describing her husband. I wasn’t. The thing is that you take in
voices from the other and they become your voice.
Let’s say that you have an open Throat and you have a couple of gates active. Your
partner has the 45th gate and you happen to have the 21. That’s a place where
you’re going to speak all the time. It doesn’t matter that you have these other
gates; their quality is going to disappear. Your whole language in the way in which
you operate is going to be locked into, I have or I don’t have and whether you’re
going to be possessive about it or not in the quality of your voice.
You don’t end up speaking who you are in your life process, you don’t. You don’t
express yourself. Your true essence doesn’t get across to the other person, because
it doesn’t come in the words. Most people are not very good at being able to really
communicate. What we get from most people is what we get from their frequency,
this is what we get. This is how we read them. We don’t read them according to
what they say. We read them according to the frequency.
Rave Anatomy not only takes us back to the basic infrastructure of the BodyGraph,
but it reminds us that in the very beginning the great depth of this knowledge was
there, and it’s not to be forgotten. This is an area of understanding that is very
important to grasp. To understand this business of being in the movie and how we
present ourselves in this illusion, and the way in which we are received by the other
according to this underlying quality of our expression. And that the magic of this
quality is something that can only be expressed when we are correct, and I mean
correct. There is no other way.
And as I said, I am not about believing. Human Design is about the empirical
process of judging things for yourself. See it in others, and begin to understand how
distorting this is and how people in your life do not communicate to you correctly,
nor do they express to you a quality that is in essence themselves. It’s quite
something to grasp.
Anyway, it’s been nice to share that with you; that was interesting. To all of you
take care, have yourself an enjoyable weekend and enjoy your movie. Check out
those voice qualities, you’ll find it interesting; and until next week, bye for now.

Lecture Three
The Primary Gates of Action
Good morning to all of you. Today is a very interesting one, by the way. Again, I’m
reminded over and over again, because I’ve been in such a long journey of laying out
all the aspects in this vast knowledge that going back and looking at the way in
which I organized it originally is fascinating for me in terms of the importance of
these various aspects as foundations of being able to grasp more than simply a
function within the BodyGraph, but begin to understand the dynamics of the way we
are designed, to really get a sense of it, and through that to be able to understand a
lot of other things. That is, an awful lot of other things.
We are about Taking Action
So today we’re going to look at these primary gates of action. To begin with you can
see the illustration on the right (see the next page). Obviously, we’re talking about
gates that are out of the Throat. But, in my first teachings of the BodyGraph one of
the things that I stressed was an understanding that in essence everything in the
BodyGraph is focused on the Throat. That is, manifestation, and again please don’t
confuse that with Manifestor, manifestation is something that literally what we are
about. That is, we are about ultimately taking action.
It is interesting that when you think about the nature of action that you look at these
gates. When you’re looking at them there is a certain obviousness over here. And
what I mean by that is that these are all potentially manifesting channels—the 35/36
to the emotional system; the 12/22 to the emotional system; the 45/21 to the Heart
Center. And here we have pure manifestation. We have the Ego Manifestors and we
have two versions of the emotional Manifestor.
Only Manifestors are Designed to Take Action
So, in our understanding of manifestation, that is, in our understanding of doing and
what we think of in terms of the Manifestor, here is the obvious relationship. In
other words, from this perspective only Manifestors, in that sense, are designed to
take action. And we know that in terms of understanding, for example, the nature of
the Generator. We know that the Generator is not here to take action; we know that
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

35
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
the Generator is here to respond. And in fact, they are responding to what is an
action.
But there is a dilemma and it is a very complex dilemma. And it says so much about
the difficulty of a particular aspect of Manifesting Generator, because when we’re
looking here at the 20th gate, which is one of these primary gates of action, is that
what we’re looking at is that the only way this can become an action gate is through
the integration relationship to the 34, this 20/34, this individual channel of charisma.
The 20/34
Now, of course, this is the only version of a Manifesting
Generator. All other Generators who happen to have a
motor to the Throat are Generators with a manifesting
aspect. We lump them together and call them Manifesting
Generators, but they’re not pure Manifesting Generators. In
the same way that, for example, there is only one emotional
Generator. That’s the 59/6. There is no other pure
emotional Generator. All the others are Generators with an
emotional definition, but they are not pure emotional
Generators.
So, here we’re dealing with something that is very unusual.
As a matter of fact, it’s extremely unusual. And it is a real
dilemma. There are a lot of 20/34s because of course it is
an opposition in the wheel. So particularly in the case of
profile or in the case of nodal polarities there are a lot of people that carry the
20/34.

LECTURE THREE
The Primary Gates of Action
What is interesting to note in that the two other channels that are oppositions, the
40/37, but in this case particularly the 43/23, there is an extraordinary relationship
between the 43/23 and the 20/34, and I’ll get into that as we move along. But I
want to stress to you that this 20/34 is a real anomaly. It is something that as a
primary gate of action can be very confusing, which is why, for example, pure
Manifesting Generators, that is the ones that carry the 20/34, for them the most
difficult thing in the world to do is not take action. It is very, very difficult, because
they are a primary action system, even though this is the only one that is
generative. So, in laying this out to begin with I just want to get you to see the
mechanics that are here, just the basic mechanics of this division in terms of what
action is all about.
The Human Experiential Way
The other thing is very interesting to just ponder, that is, that the human
experiential way, which is what our life process is all about,
the 41 to the 30, the 35 to the 36. This primary system
here is also the foundation of how we experience life.
When we go to the inside of that you have all the deep
mutative potential that influences humanity. The mutation
in the 12th gate that changed the larynx that opened up the
possibility for language, the mutation that is taking place in
the 55th gate that’s going to transform the Solar Plexus, all
of this is this mutative, creative process.
Again, this is something that is associated specifically with
the emotional system. It’s so interesting to note that half
of our action programming is rooted in an emotional system
in which there is no truth in the now in which the not-self
as an emotional being is therefore more likely than anyone
else to take inappropriate action, which is unfortunate for
their reputation. Nonetheless, it is something that is simply
evident.
Mind is Not Designed to Control Activity
The other right part of this Throat Center in terms of primary gates is the 45 and the
45s relationship directly to the Heart Center. Again, one of the things to recognize
about this is that this is about tribal action and if we look at these three gates you
see what you get, you get tribal action, individual action and collective action. These
are the themes that are there. It’s very specific in terms of our design. It’s one of
the things that is so interesting about looking at the gap that is here. There is no
way that any of those gates—62, 23, 56—these are not primary gates of action. And
for any student of Human Design who is beginning to understand the mechanics of
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

37
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
the BodyGraph, this is the most clear cut and obvious way to point out that the mind
was not designed to be given control over activity. It wasn’t.
As a matter of fact, the control over activity as you can see is spread between three
centers. Activity is controlled by the emotions, activity is controlled by the Ego and
activity can be controlled by the Sacral; not by the mind. It was never designed to
be the controller of action. Those gates are not action gates. And something that is
just one of those clear indicators of why the essence of the work in Human Design is
pointed towards the vehicle and the correctness of the vehicle is because the
moment that you get into the correctness of the vehicle, that’s the moment that you
enter into an inner authority that is never associated with what can never be an
action system.
The Keynotes
Let’s look at these keynotes because they have many levels of interpretation that we
can look at here. I mentioned to you briefly that when we look at the 45, the 12 and
the 35 that we are looking at this perfect alignment, and again it’s always nice to
look at the BodyGraph and see how beautifully it’s designed. I endlessly wonder
over it because after all it did come through me and it’s fascinating to look at it
sometimes and think, geez this is quite amazing. I love this sort of lineup here, the
way you see it in the BodyGraph. It’s the way it is. If you look at the streams from
the emotions to the Root or the Spleen down, you’re following this same kind of
fascinating dynamic. It’s like an onion and its layers with this inner tribal layer; it’s
surrounded by the individual layer, surrounded by the collective layer. It’s this layer
upon layer.

38
LECTURE THREE
The Primary Gates of Action
The 45th Gate
And here you see that each of these layers have a unique way in which they’re
designed to be primary gates of action. And of course, if we look at them, that is,
tribal action, we have to see that it literally is about that. In other words, this is not
a gate that is designed for individual action. That’s a good
joke. It’s why that royalty—45th gate, the
emperor/empress—when they speak of themselves never
use the singular. They say, “we,” “we are not amused, we
are not impressed,” and that we is not speaking for them,
they are speaking for their nation—their tribe. “We, the
tribe, are not impressed. And I am their spokesperson.”
So it’s something to understand about the 45th gate is that
it is intended to represent tribal action. And of course,
that actually brings conditions as to how that action can
take place. Can it take place simply through the fiat of
the 45? In other words, the 45 says, I am the nation and
fuck what the nation thinks, I am the nation and I decide
that we’re going to do this or that. Or is it the other side,
the other side where in the modern language is CEO who turns over the
responsibility of the president to work it through to the rest of the layers of the
organization until finally there is an action that can take place.
So, tribal action isn’t just simply seeing this within the individual context.
Remember, I’m not doing BodyGraph analysis here. This is rave anatomy. In other
words, we are looking at the inner structure and we’re looking at the potentials that
arise out of this inner structure. And again, to see the way it was intended to
operate. In other words, somebody who comes into the world with the 45 does not
realize that every time they open their mouth, in essence they are speaking for a
tribe. They are, whether they realize that or not because it’s built into it.
Of course, these are the kinds of beings in which taking action alone is never going
to be a comfortable thing. The same thing is true for the 35; taking action alone is
never going to be a comfortable thing, this is collective. Now of course, when we see
it in the individual we see the not-self at work. So we see 45s acting as if they are
the nation. And taking action as if they are an individual and that their actions are
only individual in their nature, which is not true. Which is often why 45/21s really
piss people off, because it is the frequency of not fulfilling what is the dynamic of
that intention in the action that is built into the design itself.
The 35th Gate
When we look at the 35, this progress, the human experiential way, and as the
human experiential way this is, in essence, the story of what we’re here to do while
we’re here. It’s the thing that keeps us doing, in a sense; it is the driving force of
the process. And of course, it is a very powerful thing. I have a course coming up I
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

39
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
think in July sometime which is about the six fates, the 30th gate and its lines, how
this stream has such an incredible power over us in terms of the way in which the
not-self is driven to live out its life.
And of course, you can see here that we have a collective action that’s possible.
We’re talking about the potential of a collective action. And that you can see that
the voice, because every single one of these four gates
not only are they a primary gate of action, but they’re
four voices of the Throat, that this is an action that is
derived from encouragement or an action that is
dissuaded through discouragement. In other words, in so
many ways this is a very powerful wave voice, a voice in
the 35/36 that when it’s up can be very encouraging to
somebody else to join them on the way, to participate
with them collectively in the way, or to discourage them.
And because it is a collective action, it is a collective
action in which the success or failure of the action is
always because of some other. Think about that. You
have two people. One of them is a 35/36, they go and do
something. And whatever it is doesn’t work. One of
them, or both, because of course there is conditioning in the presence of the 35/36,
are going to blame the other for the failure of that process. In other words, that this
is a place where the not-self really has potential confrontations with the other.
You can see the emotional expression in this in the action theme. That is, you can
see these action themes as they are listed here, this theme of “I feel like doing or
not. And if I feel like doing, I can encourage action.” But in the moment the
collective action potential feels like doing, it needs to encourage another to join it,
because it is not intended to act alone. This is a circuit of sharing. And this is not
California sharing, not to offend any Californians out there. It is the inherent nature
of this circuit. It is there to share; it is there to share experience. We wander down
the human experiential way holding hands with somebody. There is always this
other that is with us along the way.
So, it says something about the 35/36 that takes action alone. It’s the same thing
as the 45 speaking for the nation and the nation doesn’t even know it, nor is it taken
into consideration. Correctness is an interesting thing. That is, in the process of
correctness, your vehicle begins to align itself to proper action. So, for example the
35/36 in any action is always, in a sense, having to take into consideration the other,
whether they’re present or not. In other words, actions are always going to be
related to the other, whether they’re present or not. Now, that’s correctness for the
collective expression of action.
The mechanics are so interesting, the way it’s all tied together. And you can see
what life is in terms of the human experiential way, is that it either encourages us or
discourages us. And of course, we see that so clearly about the nature of life on this
planet. How many are discouraged by the process. Those beings that are

LECTURE THREE
The Primary Gates of Action
discouraged by the experiential way, they have a lot of people that they blame.
They just do; it’s a natural thing. Of course, it’s distorted in the not-self.
But it really begins to give you a sense of what collective action is about. And
collective action ideally is here to encourage progress and discourage failure. It’s
here to encourage those to appreciate and enjoy the life process, to succeed, to
move on, and all that stuff. But that gate is for collective action.
The 12th Gate
All right, let’s move to the 12. Now, of course, the moment we move into the 12 we
move into the individual. And in moving into individual action you can see that
individual action, because it is deeply connected to the
emotional system is about mood. Now, when you see it
in the 12 stripped of the 22, it is simply about the
impulse, whether the pulse is there or not. After all,
we’re talking about individuality and the only way to
understand individuality is to really understand that if
it’s not there, it’s not there and that there is no way of
predicting when it will be there.
So in that sense understanding “I am in the mood or
not,” is pretty much Lao Tzu, it is going to happen or
not. In other words, it’s just an easy way in that sense
of being able to see it. And because it is the kind of
thing that is so radically different when the shift comes,
because we’re talking about mutation, that when you
look at the quality of these actions, that is, cautious
incautious, you’re really seeing a huge difference.
Most 12’s are deeply cautious. And that the only thing that can make them
incautious is the moment there is mutation. And when the mutation comes, they
can totally abandon the structure of their caution. In other words, let’s say you have
a 12.4 in detriment, the voice in the wilderness, the prophet, and that 12.4 is
enormously cautious, they’re not going to talk to anybody. And they’re certainly not
going to talk to any strangers. As a matter of fact, talking to a stranger is something
that will just frighten them and they will simply be quiet.
Then all of the sudden they meet just the right 22. The meet the 22 that brings the
balance to the activation in the 12.4, brings out the exaltation on the other side,
balances it out, and in that moment they go from the silent, cautious, withdrawn
individual to being a social animal. All of a sudden they can’t shut up, and they have
somebody who is listening. And the deeper they go into the ramble, the more
different they become as a force and an energy because, in fact, they are expressing
a transition, a mutation in their form.

RAVE ANATOMY I

So, caution to incaution is quite something. Most of the time what you’re dealing
with in individuality is not in fact cautiousness, it’s just simply, nothing is happening.
And as long as nothing happens, nothing is going to happen. So it’s interesting to
think about the individual and the actions of the individual. That the individual, in
fact, has nothing to offer until mutation takes place. It is that mutative action that is
there to drive them, nothing else.
The 12/22
The 12/22 is a very mysterious channel. Think about social dynamics. If you think
about the tribe you have two specifically social channels for the tribe. That is, the
59/6, obviously the intimacy of the 59/6 and the 40/37, the channel of community.
These are so-called social channels. There is only one other social channel. That’s
the 22/12. Every collective channel is social.
So, when you see social capacity diminished you begin to understand something
about beings as well and the way in which the layer of
humanity is structured. The collective is social at every
possible level, so we end up with multiracial societies in
certain places where people can all exist together, and
so forth and so on. This is collective. It is social at any
level. But the moment that you step into the tribe, you
can see that the tribe is very limited in when it will be
social. It will be social in order to make more. It will
be social within its own community to maintain its
viability. But this is a closed off social environment.
You notice that any time you step into a foreign tribe’s
environment. You know it right away. You are neither
somebody who is part of the intimacy or part of the
community and you’re not going to receive any kind of
true social invitation into that, unless you happen to
sneak into the farmer’s daughter’s bedroom. That may change the story. Either
you’re shot gunned, or you get married, one or the other.
But when you come to individuality it has one and only one social dimension. I
know. This is an incredible limitation in the individual. Individuals are deeply
handicapped when it comes to establishing social bonds. Now of course, when we
come to the nature of seeing the holistic BodyGraph we know very well that people
have all kinds of mixes of aspects within their design. So, I’m speaking just
theoretically here from an absolute point of view; in other words, looking at the pure
individual. Somebody like me, as an example, that only has individual definition,
only having individual definition gives one a handicap socially.
Now, I have some advantages in that I do have the 12th gate, I do have the 40th
gate, so I have certain ways, and I have certain collective gates, in which I can learn
and connect to the tribe and the collective. But it’s not natural. So, when you’re

LECTURE THREE
The Primary Gates of Action
looking at the 12/22 you’re looking at something very unique, in a sense.
Individuality is not allowed to be social because it’s not here to be influenced. It’s
not collective. It’s not here to be influenced. Individuality is here to express
mutation. That’s the whole point of having individuality in the BodyGraph. It is the
evolutionary process in all of us.
So, it’s not here to be influenced, which means it’s difficult for individuality to form
those kinds of long-term bonds, because it’s very difficult for them to actually
embrace the social dimension. It’s against their nature. And yet, the irony in all of
that is that all of our concepts of romance come from individuality, this yearning for
the bond, because it’s so difficult to find it. And of course, where do we find that?
We find that in this stream from the 12 to the 22 to the 55 to the 39, it is here in
this stream that all of these concepts of romantic love and all of these things exist.
It’s interesting to see it in that way; and to understand the loneliness, in that sense,
of individuality, that loneliness of “why can’t I?”
So, the 12/22 becomes a mechanism not for the individual to be able to express
their romance, but for the individual to be able to seduce the collective with its
mutation, because the collective lives on social interaction. Individual action is
intended only to mutate the collective. And you can see it in the expression of the
12/22, because this is the channel of a social or an anti-social being. It is so easy
for this to be turned off, because the whole point is mutation. And the whole point is
to be able to mutate the other with this voice.
The individual takes action to try to affect the other. And that you can see that in
the 12 and in the 35, you have fundamental Manifestor themes, the impact that we
talk about in terms of a Manifestor. This impact is in both of these gates. It is what
drives us. One drives us experientially and the other mutates us as we move along.
It’s very powerful in their impact—manifesting gates. So, for the individual it is all
about this possibility in action to impact the other, to make them fall in love and not
necessarily with you as a being, but what you have to say or what you have to offer
or what you know. I know that.
The 45th Gate
All right, moving along, taking action as it were. Here we are
at the ‘gathering together’ point.
When we’re looking at the 45th gate we’re looking at one of
these incredible things. Again, I sort of touched on it as I was
beginning the introduction to this, talking about the “we” of
the royal voice. But look at this action theme. “I have to, or
not.” I have to do. It is such a driving force. Look at these
three action themes. I feel—ok, that one is kind of like, all
right, I’m in the mood. I have to—you’re looking at a very,
very specific kind of action, the action of necessity and not

personal necessity but tribal necessity. We have to act; it’s time to go to war. Here
we go; only out of necessity, and only for the benefit of the tribe.
You can see the power of the voice here, the potential of the dominant. Obviously,
on the other side is the subservient voice. But you have to think about the way in
which action was designed to operate. And you can see that it is a kind of
progression where the collective operates in relationship to the other, that the
individual operates alone hoping to impact the collective and the tribe acts as a
group.
It means that if you’re a 45/21 and you’re not acting for the benefit of a group, that
that “I have to” is going to be a problem, because that’s not the way in which the
action was intended to function. We don’t know anything about doing. The only
ones of us that have any real understanding of doing are Manifestors that are
operating according to their strategy and have had at least seven years in the
process. And then you begin to understand this power to take action that you have
no control over. It’s in your system; it’s built in, this manifesting force.
What is curious for me in terms of my own design is that I do not have a pure
manifesting channel at all. I don’t. In fact, my manifesting operates out of the 20,
but doesn’t have anything to do with the rest of integration in that sense. So, it’s
interesting for me to watch my own process relative to that because the Ego is so
deeply tied to the collective “we.”
To begin to understand what kind of action we are really here to take, relative to the
general synthesis of our design is something helpful. Not as an absolute. Again,
you’re operating out of your strategy; it’s a matter of simply watching that and being
able to see. But for example, if you’re somebody who is basically collective and you
don’t have the 35, as an example, it doesn’t mean that you don’t pay any attention

The Primary Gates of Action
to this. It’s important for you to see that action for you is something that needs to
be collective, that your healthiest action is when you’re working with another. Those
kinds of bonds are something that are extremely powerful in your life.
The same thing is true for somebody who is basically individual, to recognize the
constraints that come with individuality and its potential mutation and creativity.
And yet, to recognize that it’s only when you really have something to offer that it’s
time for you to connect to the other, that these are the best times for you to form
those bonds with the other. And the same thing for somebody who is basically
tribal; it’s important for them to act in the group. And the group doesn’t have to be
a blood tribe, after all. You need to deconstruct this; but simply to see that.
These are the ways in which these primary actions are intended to operate. And
they are the archetype. I’m about to give you a breakdown here on the anomaly,
that is, the Manifesting Generator aspect. But here above what you’re looking at are
the three archetypes for taking action. It is a key for all of us to see that this is the
great theme in life. The not-self is addicted to taking action, we know that. The not-
self mind is addicted to taking action.
And of course, the action is rooted in its openness, which means that the strategies
that are there are taking one away from essential ways in which their action is going
to be productive; in other words, the conditioning that turns the tribal into somebody
who is acting alone, in that sense. It immediately creates problems. That’s the
person that ends up being ostracized in the tribe because they’ve gone off half-
cocked and did their own thing in the delusion that they were going to impress the
tribe by doing it. But of course, the tribe doesn’t like those kinds of surprises,
doesn’t like somebody stepping out on their own, and so forth and so on.
In other words, to really see that by understanding these primary ways in which we
are intended to act, you can begin to understand the way in which you’re beginning
to operate as you watch yourself in this life. The other thing is, what do we bring
with our action, or our lack of it? The quality that is part of the influence of action is
carried by the voice. You can be a 45 and you can say, we really need to do this
together and I can’t do this by myself, this is important for all of us, let’s get
together. That’s a subservient version. And it’s carried in the voice.
The dominant goes, we have to do this, obviously I cannot do that alone, we are a
tribe, we are a family, it is time for us to act—a different voice, but the same thing.
It’s the same request for the tribe to join in to share, to be involved together in that
process, to join as a tribe and to succeed as a tribe as a “we”—we did it, we made it,
we have it. But the voices are different. And of course, they can have a totally
different impact. There may be those in the tribe that when the dominant voice
comes out says, oh geez, why do we have to. There could be those in the tribe that
when they hear the subservient voice wish they had a better leader.
But the fact is that it’s important to understand that action doesn’t come without a
personality. You can never separate action from its personality. So, wherever you
look at the collective, all action is either encouraging or discouraging in its vocal

frequency and of course, that moves through a spectrum from being super
encouraging to super discouraging.
How we can be so deeply affected by a voice. This is how the not-self manages to
get people to do things. This is all in the voice. Voices, these encouraging voices,
whenever you hear somebody with an encouraging voice you know they’re sending
you on the human experiential way. They just are. You can just feel it. It’s what
happens, this dominant voice that forces you to work with the others, and all that
stuff. Anyway, “I have to, or not,” it’s quite a thing. And of course, it’s “we have to,
or not,” that’s when it’s correct.
The 20/34
Now we come to our little side story, because it’s a fascinating side story and this is
the story of the 20/34. In the beginning—if I can be Biblical—there was integration.
And integration is a Manifesting Generator. In other words, if you want to talk about
the evolution of manifesting, not to offend any Manifestors, but the Manifestor is
something that, in a sense, was born out of a transition
from pure Generator to Manifesting Generator and
ultimately to Manifestor.
So when you’re looking at the 20/34 you’re looking at
something that is very special in that sense as an energy
system. Remember, if we go back to the beginning and
we think about the infrastructure as a design mechanism
for survival, it’s perfect. We also see that we are dealing
with a form that would not have access to a neo-cortex.
In other words, we’re talking about our historical
mammalian roots, and in those historical mammalian
roots, the ability to manifest in response was something
that allowed them to drive forward and survive.
But you’ll notice that it’s manifest in response; in other
words, to take action out of a response. That response
is what we might blindly refer to as the earliest cognitive
response awareness of the immune system; in other
words, a basic fundamental action to take an action to protect oneself. When we see
integration today integrated into the complexity of the BodyGraph it’s like the
appendix, in a sense, but not as extreme as that, but it really no longer has,
particularly in this era where we move towards the opening of the Solar Plexus
system, that it no longer has a dominant quality to it in terms of its impact on
whether or not we are going to be able to survive or not.
As a matter of fact, it is much more a creative environment through the 10/57 than
anything else. In other words, mutative creativity is something that is very much a
part of integration and it is the maturation of the same thing. That is, an ability to
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LECTURE THREE
The Primary Gates of Action
creatively respond to mutation. We can call that art and all kinds of things. But
anyway, it’s a very different function, in a sense, in this time in the BodyGraph.
But if you look at the configuration—obviously, when we talk about the 20th gate as
being a primary gate of action, and remember this is a decisive/indecisive action.
Again, this is an expression of mutation, that is, pulse. You can be decisive when
you can be decisive; and otherwise, you’re indecisive. In other words, you’re more
indecisive than decisive, as an example. This is one of the things that is always the
basis of the individual process. It doesn’t happen until it happens.
The 20/10/34/57
And in this
configuration here
listed are a
number of vari–
ations. These
variations are
basically trans–
lations of the basic
keynotes of the
four elements of
integration, that
is, the 20, the 10,
the 34 down here
and of course the
57 over here. So,
in the full load, the full potential of this primary gate of action through its three other
gates is: I know I am myself doing now, or not. In other words, this is really outside
of the structure entirely. It has nothing to do with the other.
And you’ll notice that everything about the way in which
the 12th gate is a primary gate of action is intended to
work is that it’s specifically intended to transmit mutation
to another specifically. Here there is nothing but the
narcissism of one’s own process. And this is one of the
dilemmas of integration, is its tendency towards
narcissism.
In other words, its tendency is not simply being deeply
absorbed in oneself, but simply to see everything within
one’s own context. I know I am myself doing now. In
other words, it has nothing to do with anybody else. And
unfortunately, of course, for integration that’s a dilemma,
because it’s not tied in to the rest, it’s not tied in to the
individuality; it’s not really tied in to the tribe or the
collective. It is simply there totally absorbed in its own process.

The 20/10/34
When you get to the 20/10/34, obviously there’s a
dropout here of the 57. When you get to this place you
get the “I know” being dropped. And you get: I am doing
now, or not. Now again, it’s not “I am doing now for you,
I am doing now because of this, I am doing now because
of that,” that’s why the 20th gate is described as being
essentially existential. It’s simply “I am doing now. This
is my action. I’m just doing now. I’m vibrating, I’m alive
right now,” is basically what it is saying.
The 20/57/34
When you get to the 20/57/34 and you drop the 10 you drop the behavior,
obviously. So here you have: I know I am doing now,
which means, “I know I’m in action, but I don’t know what
the action is for. It is certainly not for myself. And I
certainly don’t know what the hell it is. All I know is that I
am doing.
And of course, again you can see from the context of over
here they all look in this direction and say, “yeeee. What is
their problem?” Of course, it’s very different. These are
manifesting themes. This is not a true Manifestor, which
means that this is something that is intended to operate in
response. And when you look at the pure mechanism of
this, because this is the intrinsic design—as I said, the
20/34 is something that has enormous impact in life,
because it is an opposition, because it is so common, that the vast majority of
Manifesting Generators, a big huge chunk of them are 20/34s.
The 20/34
When you look at this 20/34 and you look at its action
theme what you see is: I am doing now. Please
understand how limited that is. That is, there is no 57, so
there is no knowing, so “I don’t know why I am doing what I
am doing now.” There is no behavior, “I am not doing this
for myself, so I don’t know what the hell I’m doing now.”
This is the 20/34. “I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.”
This is its action, which is kind of spooky.

LECTURE THREE
The Primary Gates of Action
And then you understand something about it. This is a Manifesting Generator. This
is the only true Manifesting Generator. In fact, it is the most powerful of all
Generators. It’s difficult in a way, because it is often in the 20/34 where the Sacral
voice is something that is deeply, deeply overwhelmed by having a Throat outlet, a
Throat outlet that can be so decisive. And of course, my advice for 20/34s is simply
to respond. You don’t have to hear any sounds, they just have to not initiate. They
don’t know what the hell they’re doing.
The 43/23 is a Natural Ally for the 20/34
And here comes in this interesting thing about 20/34 action and understanding the
most dynamic and special relationship that exists in type and that is the relationship
between the Generator and the Projector. You see, for the 20/34 there is only one
natural ally, that’s the 43/23. Again, the other individual polarity in the wheel, this
commonality in so many beings of having 43/23s either
through sun/earth oppositions or through the nodal
oppositions.
And of course, the 43/23 as it stands by itself, obviously,
no gate of primary action there, that this is a projected
element. It is as it stands by itself, the perfect Projector.
And it is this Projector that guides the 20/34. The 20/34
has to be guided. It is the only way that they can fulfill
their purpose on this plane. It is the only way in which
their action is going to be correct. And it doesn’t matter
whether they have the full integration, they still don’t
know what to do. They don’t. They can simply be aware
of what they are doing as they are doing it, when they
are doing it. But they don’t know what the right thing to
do is until they respond.
It doesn’t mean, by the way, that 20/34s have to find
43/23s to guide them in their life. It is simply one of
those remarkable relationships that can be deeply, deeply
valuable. But of course, the theme for the Manifesting Generator is the theme for all
Generators, despite its complexity. It’s here to respond. And it’s here to respond to
guidance. It’s why this charisma is such a joke and so wonderful at the same time.
This is the only Generator who can really look like a Manifestor. And of course, that
busy action doing is so impressive to Generators, it really is.
It’s one of the things that I’ve said many, many times that Generators are raised in
the shadow of Manifestors and so are sadly conditioned to be Manifestors when
they’re children. Quite frankly, Manifesting Generators are the ones who really make
that easy. It’s so easy to condition them to be Manifestors, because, in fact, as
20/34s they do truly have access to a primary gate of action. And because they
don’t know what to be busy about, they are just simply busy. “Can I help you?” “No

I’m busy right now.” “Can I love you?” “No, I’m busy right now.” “I don’t have
time. I’m late; I’m late for a very important date.” It’s the way they go.
The Rave Anatomy Book
Gates of action—when I went back and looked at the book Rave Anatomy, there
were many, many different things I could have selected as part of these 11 lectures.
But I realized that we need a refresher, and of course I do these classes with a long-
term intent. Ultimately, they’ll go over into self-study programs or channel 88, to be
able to give a contemporary experienced approach to original teaching in Design.
Today with the sophistication of the process and the way in which design analysis is
rooted in synthesis, I know that people are well trained, in that sense, and I know
that ABC and Rave Cartography level I and II, that they do a good job in covering
the basic infrastructure.
And yet, there is so much in the BodyGraph. I think it’s the thing that impresses me
the most about that original book was that even at that point it was so obvious to
me how much stuff would have to be looked at. There are so many things in the
BodyGraph that in terms of the development of analytical skills and simply general
appreciation of what’s there, this kind of return is very exciting.
I must say that I’m enjoying it. Looking again with new eyes at things I created 12
years ago, it’s a Jupiter cycle, after all. And Jupiter being the Hierophant and the
great teacher, a 12-year cycle is an interesting thing. Here I am 12 years later
taking the same drawings and with as many mistakes in the new version as the old,
but that’s me, it’s fascinating to see it again. And to see that not only does it retain
its importance, but I think that its value has actually grown.
I’ve learned over the last years, as I’ve gone so deeply into design that one ignores
the surface at great risk. It is the surface where everything works, because this is
where the illusion is. Human Design is an absolute of the maia. It is the only place
where one truly can see the mechanics of this illusion at work. And the mechanics
work on the surface.
It’s interesting to go underneath because you see programming. You see how things
are influenced and you see where the roots of various things are. But in the end,
this is where the game is played; this is where the movie is. This is where the story
unfolds. And it’s in this BodyGraph; this ultimate illusion is here in this BodyGraph
that the story of the life is written. So, just understanding something as basic as
action concepts is something that can be very beneficial in both understanding
oneself, but even more so in being able to be helpful towards others.
Anyway, I do enjoy my Friday mornings with you. Glad you could make it. After all
there’s 17 of us and there are 34 people registered in this class, so I appreciate the
fact that some of you get up very early in the morning for this one. But anyway, you
have yourself either a good sleep or a good morning and until next time, bye for
now. ~

Lecture Four
The Gates of Fear
Ok, one of my favorite subjects. Indeed, a subject that is deeply fascinating. I’ve
looked at it in many different ways. Rave Anatomy as I’ve mentioned to you before
was a way in which I laid down my original blueprint for the way in which I would
educate people to understand the nature of the BodyGraph and ultimately what that
meant in terms of being able to understand the nature of being.
The Value of Fear
Fear is something that isn’t just simply homogenized in the way in which it’s
understood. But its value—and it is its value that is so important, it’s something that
is so clearly revealed in the mechanics of Human Design—the value of fear is that it
literally forces us to gain intelligence, to strive to be better equipped, all the things
that move us. In other words, that if you look at the very simplest level of what it is
to be a bio-form it is imperative that one recognizes that all bio-form’s fundamental
focus is on survival. And it means that every single bio-form comes into the world
with fear genes, comes into the world with a chemistry that is rooted to what we
have, in the way we develop language and understanding, what we call fear.
It is the fear, whether we want to call that alertness, there’s all kinds of ways we
could describe it, the fact is that what it is there for is to make sure that we are
aware of the environment, the risks in the environment, all of these various things.
Obviously, that is one of the bases upon which any species is able to develop a way
in which they can survive, by being able to deal with their fears.
The Awareness Centers
When we’re looking at fear we’re actually looking at an evolutionary story. That is,
we’re looking at an evolutionary story and the development of intelligence. We’re
obviously looking at three awareness centers, or so-called awareness centers.
Obviously the Solar Plexus is a motor system and its potential for awareness is
something that is bubbling under the surface now, but nonetheless it is here that we
have the key to what is intelligence. It is also a reflection of what lies underneath at
the tonal level. That is, at the tonal level which is cognition and cognition is literally
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

51
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
the purpose of being is that the cognitive root finds its outlet in these three centers
that we call the Awareness Centers.
And each of these Awareness Centers has a different quality of fear. When we are
looking at the beginning and we are looking at the Splenic system, we are looking at
what are in fact life and death fears. In other words, we are looking at survival fears
on the physical plane. And this is entirely what the Spleen is concerned with. So it’s
a very specific kind of fear. That is, it is fundamental threat to survival that is all
captured in here.
Awareness Centers
When we move on in the evolutionary process, when we take this jump and we move
upwards and we leave behind the natural world and its dependence on Splenic
awareness and we open up the possibility of conceptual awareness, we end up with a
new fear, this fear of anxiety, which is a conceptual fear. It is not a real fear. It is a
mental fear. And mental fears only become real because we live in a world of the
not-self in which the not-self fears are turned into reactions and actions and
reactions and dilemmas.
So we have real fears and illusionary fears, or conceptual fears to be nice. And then
we have nervousness. Now, nervousness is quite a thing and nervousness is very,
very easy to understand. It is the fear of instability, because it is associated with
what is the motor system of the Solar Plexus Center. And of course because there is
a wave there is no stability. So if you’re high on the wave there is a nervousness
that it won’t last, that you’re going to sink down. And if you’re low on the wave
there’s a nervousness that you may never come back up. It is a different kind of
fear. It is an experiential fear.

LECTURE FOUR
The Gates of Fear
So we have these three very different mechanisms, all of them are pointed towards
the development of certain sensory or cognitive capacities. They’re about expanding
the ability of the being to be able not simply to survive, which is just here, but to go
beyond survival in terms of the consciousness, the extension of the intelligence
through the mind system and ultimately the extension of the sensitivity of that
system to be able to take in information in a diverse way beyond the realm of the
conceptual and the visual.
Fear Gates: Where Intelligence Grows
Fear; it’s not a little thing in the BodyGraph, is it? You’re looking at 20 of the 64
gates that are specialty gates in which the chemistry of discomfort, alertness,
uncertainty, on and on and on, all kinds of things are embedded. And that these are
the gates out of which intelligence grows. So, it’s quite interesting to see it in that
context. In other words, these 20 gates lay the foundation of what we call ultimately
human intelligence, not simply the conceptual intelligence, the body intelligence, the
sensory intelligence, the whole package. It’s born out of these gates.
And of course, because each of these gates, when we bring that down to the
construct of a BodyGraph that each of these gates carry a specific quality of fear, we
know that that quality of fear is there in the being and not only that but of course
the challenge in that sense to develop the intelligence out of that fear. If you don’t
develop intelligence out of the fear then you’re always stuck with the fear. And
you’re stuck with the fear with its full intensity.
The moment that you apply intelligence to that fear or the moment that intelligence
emerges as a by-product of that fear being the driving force, is not so much that the
fear disappears, is that it’s put in its place. We all know that there is a chance that
you can die driving your car. And it’s not a remote chance. There is a chance you
can die driving your car. But it isn’t the kind of fear that is overriding every time you
open that door and get in. It would make it very difficult for you to drive. But the
intelligence that has been developed out of that fear—your seatbelt and the air
cushions and this and that—puts the fear in its place even though it doesn’t
disappear entirely.
The Splenic System
It’s one of the things to understand about the Splenic system and its basic fears
because these are the most powerful fears in the body. And they are the most
powerful fears in the body because of the very nature of the Spleen itself, because
the Spleen is breathlessly spontaneous. And what I mean by that is it is both its
treasure and its handicap.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
The Spleen can only express itself in the moment. It’s not a motor. It is not an
empowered thing. There is this expression, an existential expression and that’s all it
is capable of. It isn’t capable of anything else. And because of that it plants as deep
a seed as it can of that fear in that moment. Now, the dilemma for most human
beings is that living on the mental plane that the nature of the mind itself is that the
mind is something that operates in a frequency over all time. It doesn’t really pay
attention to moment by moment. The most difficult thing of all for mind is to be
truly existential. There is constantly this flow in the mind over time.
But the Spleen is this (sound). It’s there and it’s gone. So these fears are fears that
can be very uncomfortable because you can’t go back and say, why are we afraid of
that, what’s wrong? There’s no answer, which is often a terrible dilemma for Splenic
beings because they go to their mind for the answer. And the mind has no idea, no
understanding, and no knowing about the Spleen. It doesn’t. They are so far apart
from each other. They really are. It’s one of the great dilemmas. And of course
mind is something that will immediately get in the way of what in those that have it,
true Splenic authority.
Gate 18: Authority
Now, think about these fears. Remember, these are real world fears.
So this is what we have to be afraid of in this life in terms of our
survival. None of the rest of this stuff has anything to do with survival
fears. It doesn’t. It’s only in the Spleen. So what do we have to be
afraid of in this life, wary of in this life, concerned about in this life—
authority; you bet. Authority over you, somebody else’s authority
over you, you’d better be afraid of that. They don’t know what the
hell they’re doing themselves, let alone that they know what to do with you.
Gate 28: Death
Death, in the guise of—is there a point; one had better be afraid of
pointlessness, the pursuit of purpose. And it is one of the most
interesting things to think about in terms of the real world fear is the
fear of purposelessness, because it is an ordeal to suffer, to work
through, to survive on the material physical plane.
Gate 32: Failure
Fear of failure, oh yes. That’s a fear that’s so deep, because it means
literally that if the cornerstone falls, everything falls. It’s a fear of the
failure of the society. It’s a fear of the failure of the group to be able
to produce what’s necessary for communal survival.

LECTURE FOUR
The Gates of Fear
Gate 50: Responsibility
The 50th gate and its fear of responsibility that the tribe will not take
responsibility, that it will not learn, that it will not obey the law, that
it will not operate the way it should.
Gate 44: Past
And the 44 is so afraid that everything will disappear; Croesus, afraid
of losing it, afraid of losing everything that has been gained.
Gate 57: Tomorrow
And the 57, one of the deepest, deepest physical fears there is, is this fear of the
unknown, what will happen. More human beings are tormented by spontaneous fear
of tomorrow than just about anything else. And then, of course, they
get lost in their mind and they get caught in the anxiety. And if
they’re not-self that anxiety will move them to action.
Oh, I remember it so well, I have a 57. I must have been 13 years
old and at the end of the school day I had gotten into trouble and was
sent to be punished. It so happened that the principal of the school
was not there, so I was told to come back in the morning to take my
punishment. In those days, the punishment was being beaten
literally over the hands with a leather strap which wasn’t exactly a nice thing. It was
very painful.
I can remember what that was like. It was a memory that has never left me, this
thing about how a coward dies a thousand times. This fear of tomorrow can be so
visceral because it’s just there and it’s gone. It’s there and it goes into the mind.
And I started to think about how uncomfortable all that was, how the fear builds up
in the mind, how it piles up and piles up and piles up until it’s a horror. It was a
horrible night for me; I couldn’t really sleep. I got up very early in the morning. I
think it’s the earliest I was ever at school in my life standing outside the door waiting
for this creature to show up so that he could beat me and I could get it over with.
And I was so relieved when it was done.
The actual fear itself, that fear of tomorrow, this is just a momentary thing. It’s just
a caution light. It doesn’t mean necessarily that one is going to face trauma. And
yet what the mind will do with that, because of course, we can deconstruct these
things. I’ve done that before, deconstructed each of these gates and talked about
how each of them works in that context. But see it holistically, we are all this. We

RAVE ANATOMY I

are fear, anxiety and nervousness, whether we have them defined or not. If you
don’t have them defined they’re just amplified. You get amplified fears and amplified
anxieties and amplified nervousness. It’s not like you avoid any of it.
And then you get to see the traps, particularly if you have hanging gates that point
at any of these 20 gates. Think about it, how you’re getting suckered into this fear
conditioning. And that you’re supposed to be the one that’s going to resolve that
fear. And most of the dilemmas that we have with fear are about what happens to
them when they become mental, when they become part of the mind system
because when they become part of the mind system they become part of this very
complex not-self operating out of its open centers, constructing the way in which it’s
going to frame, the way it thinks and acts through the way in which it’s conditioned.
And obviously, these fears are going to be dealt with or reacted to within the context
of that openness. So, the moment that you get to the mental plane and you get to
this plane of anxiety, it is this anxiety that causes all the problems on the planet; not
the fear, not the nervousness, the anxiety. This is the killer, this is the mind. And of
course, we know that mind is not-self so this is the not-self mind and what it’s afraid
of. And these fears are concretized fears not conceptual fears. They’re fears that
are turned into actions and reactions.
Gate 17: Challenge
So, the 17th gate, this anxiety over being challenged, the opinion being challenged.
What happens here is that this no longer becomes a conceptual challenge. This
becomes the 17 with the open Ego saying “I’m going to prove
that you’re wrong. I’m going to prove that I’m right. And I’ll
show you. I’m going to do it,” whatever the case may be. The
anxiety leading to not-self action driven through the open
centers and the way they condition the way the mind works.
Constantly you have to master this knowledge, truly to master
it. You always have to think about the not-self, you have to
see the not-self at work. You have to understand it because it
is humanity. And it’s who you were for most of your life. You
have to see the way it functions, the way it works, the way it
thinks. In the natural order of things, if you look very carefully
at any of these fears, the mind is the one that does not have direct access to a
motor, to action, to potential of action, to generate or manifest, it does not.
Yet, it is this fear that dominates. We’re well past the Splenic fears, in a sense. Not
that you can tell by looking at the human population and how much of it is wanting.
But in the sense that this is not the dominant direction of cognitive development.
We have been in a mental stage for about 85 or 90,000 years. This conceptualizing
zone is the place in which we have identified with life. Our minds, the way we’re
conditioned, the way in which we are designed, it appears very much that our minds

The Gates of Fear
seem to be connected to these lives. And the illusion that comes with thinking that
the mind is the source of direction in this life, the source of decision making.
This anxiety becomes something that takes on an enormous distorted value in the
not-self, because it is these mental fears that are leading to action. It is mental
fears leading to action. And leading to action not in correctness, but leading to
action in order to try to deal with the conditioning of whatever their openness
happens to be. What a mess.
Gate 47: Futility
I look at these six gates in the Ajna Center and I see the source of
all incorrect action, because that’s what you see. These fears are
fears that drive the mind to want to act. Think about the not-self
and the 47th gate, the gate of futility, anxiety over futility, and the
futility of not being able to make sense out of things. But this was
never intended to lead to action. That the futility leads to
somebody doing something outrageous. It was never intended for
that. It’s not about acting. It’s essential to understand which
concepts are futile to try to make sense of, because in fact so
many concepts are senseless.
Gate 24: Ignorance
Fear of ignorance, anxiety over ignorance; but when you see that within the not-self
it becomes so distorted, because something has to be done about it. This is the
thing that disturbs the frequency of the vehicle. One of the
things to think about, because it’s really a curious thing to just
think about mechanically, when you think about the Ajna Center,
what’s sitting in the Ajna Center is the design crystal. And the
design crystal has a special relationship with the Magnetic
Monopole. And the two of them, when they are in—I was going
to say harmony with each other, but I don’t want to confuse
terms—when they are in synch with each other, the vehicle is
operating correctly—strategy and inner authority.
But the moment that the not-self mind takes over, the capture
frequency becomes distorted and we get transference instead.
The mind has a direct influence on whether or not the frequency in that Ajna is going
to be a frequency that is correct. If these anxieties become action, wrong direction,
the frequency becomes distorted and the reception leads to transference, because
it’s all out of the mind. It’s all about the box.
If there’s a battle, if there’s a struggle that we must engage with, it is the struggle
with the mind. Wherever I go now in my work, because we’re now at a point where

RAVE ANATOMY I

we can see very deep into the mechanics. You can see the handicaps that are there
in terms of the personality, the passenger. And you can see how everything hinges
on whether mind is going to be in charge, or whether the vehicle is going to be in
charge, whether it is personality consciousness that is going to assume in vanity that
it is in charge, or whether it’s design consciousness that will just be allowed to go
along and do its business. This is the battle ground. And of course it’s the great
duality.
The fact that you see design and personality integrated in the BodyGraph doesn’t
mean they have anything to do with each other. It’s a great challenge to deal with
the mind. It is the greatest challenge. And here in these fears is really a way of
beginning to understand how the values in life have been distorted. Think about our
Splenic fears. They’re very basic. We have a right to be concerned about
inadequacy. If the patterns are inadequate then we are not protected and so forth
and so on. There are all these very basic fears we need to deal with. It is correct, in
that sense, in terms of survival, never to forget that we don’t know what tomorrow
will bring, that it is foolish to forget the past, to not learn from the lessons of history,
because they can catch up with you.
It is essential as a group, as a species if we’re going to survive that we must take
responsibility for each other within a general accepted rule somehow of bonding.
That we have to be concerned about failure, because if we don’t produce those that
are equipped to help us, provide for us, guide us, move us, then we’ll die out. And
that life has to be more than just survival. It is the promise and the pain of the 28.
And most of all fear of authority, to finally see that this is the ultimate fear that has
to be dealt with, so that one no longer has to be afraid of authority, that one truly
can stand and survive on one’s own. These are very basic fears. They’re very
straightforward.
But the fears of the mind are not intended for action, they’re not intended for
survival. They’re not. It isn’t to say, by the way, because if you follow the
streaming you see very clearly that when it comes to the past and the responsibility
and the tomorrow you have direct access to energy—two of them have direct access
to the Sacral so you have a generative capacity that is there. Even here in the
fundamentals, it’s not such an easy thing. These gates can be verbally expressed so
that the fears can be expressed in the real world. There are very few fears that are
intended to be acted on. These go through the primary gates of action, in that
sense. There are very few fears.
And what we get out of the not-self is that it is the anxiety fears that are acted on all
the time. It’s really my intent today to see these within this context. How different
it is. This fear is about survival, and the nervousness is about the quality of life. It
really is about quality of life. It is about the experiential process. The nervousness
is simply the instability of the wave, that you can’t make it sit still, that you can’t
lock it. And we know in those beings that have suffered shock that they can have a
frozen wave. And they seem to be just—there’s a sort of frightening stillness to
them, because for us the emotional system is always something that moves. And we
are nervous over the experience of life, over our fate, over the potential emptiness;

LECTURE FOUR
The Gates of Fear
our basic fears of the uncontrollableness of nature, like our own emotional systems,
a reflection of when the storms will come or not.
Gates 48 and 36: Inadequacy
All of these are about the experience of life, of intimacy, of the traditions of the tribe,
the need or the—I shouldn’t mix metaphors here, but in the silence this fear that
there isn’t that other, there isn’t the
potential of the other. Interestingly
enough there is a deep bond between
the symmetry of these two. And you
can see the symmetry expressed in the
relationship between the 48 and the 36
because they have the keynote. That is,
the keynote of inadequacy. How
threatening inadequacy can be in terms
of survival, how threatening inadequacy
can be in terms of the experiential way.
But this isn’t about life and death,
though it can be. It is very much about
the quality of life, the essence of it, the
richness of it, and the fullness of it. This
is just about the protective construct. This is about the pleasure and pain of it, the
experience of it. And in these two in their symmetry they both have their potential
for generative expression and manifested expression; but not anxiety, not this fear.
So if you challenge somebody’s opinionated authority, they’ll go to war with you.
You really have to see that everything about the way in which the mind operates, the
fear of the mind, is that these fears are going to lead to action in the not-self, and
you cannot even predict the action because you need to see their design. You need
to see what is open in them. You need to see what they’re looking for. If they’re a
split definition what are the bridges and do they connect, how is it going to be
expressed?
The Importance of Earth
We’re nothing but fear creatures as not-self, because we are constantly being
conditioned. And in constantly being conditioned, there is no true inner stability;
cannot be. It’s one of the least understood things about the imprints, and that is the
earth. There is a lot of literature about the sun and the planets. There is very little
that expresses the importance of earth. And it is the earth that brings us this
grounding and this stability. And it’s something to understand about the nature of
transference and how dysfunctional transference is and where the dysfunction is, is

59
RAVE ANATOMY I

that it has its deepest effect in the transference as it affects the grounding in the
being, whether you’re going to be stable or not.
Everybody loses their stability in transference because your earth is not properly
motivated any more, or differentiated any more or determined in a way that is
correct for it in terms of its PHS. So there is no stability in the vehicle. There is no
stability in the frequency. And it’s all a result of anxiety leading to action; these
fears.
Gate 43: Rejection
The 43, the fear is the fear of rejection. I know—no you don’t. It is the fear of
rejection. And yet, individuals who by their very nature are designed not to be
influenced have no guarantee that their “I know” has the potential to be collective.
In other words, that it is a truly mutative knowing, and that for
most individuals who have the capacity to express “I know”
most of the time that “I know” may be very empty of true
knowing.
In other words, there is this fear of the rejection of the knowing
and one has to deal with that from the point of view of mind.
Here is a concept that it does not move, it is a knowing that has
no place to go. But it is one thing to grasp that as an
intellectual thing cut off from anything else; it’s another thing to see what happens
to that fear in someone who is not-self. The fact is that the individual in their
knowing is helpless. It doesn’t mean that it makes it right, but still they are
helpless. It takes quite something to go through the process of accepting that it may
not be true or right or correct.
But in the not-self that simply becomes a determination to simply keep on keeping
on, insisting—the voice of the 23, insist, desist. Because it takes action, and why
does it take action, because it has open centers. Let’s say it has an open Spleen. It
means it holds on to things that aren’t good for it, so it’s going to hold on to a
knowing despite its fear of rejection and it will lash out at rejection in action.
So we have people that can’t handle rejection. So we have a world that reacts to
rejection, we have a world that reacts to challenge. These are conceptual. They’re
about outer authority. They’re about the cognitive potential that’s in an individual to
be able to express concepts that can be a value to the other.
Gate 11: Darkness
The 11th gate, this fear of darkness, it’s not really a fear of
darkness—it’s interesting because the 11th gate is a white magic
gate. It’s about trying to put light on things. It’s trying to eliminate

LECTURE FOUR
The Gates of Fear
those places where you were blinded. After all, it is a visual gate; it wants to be able
to see. And of course, this anxiety of not being able to see what you want to be able
to see. Well, what that leads to in action, it leads to all kinds of things, very
destructive things.
Gate 4: Chaos
The 4 is afraid of chaos. If you’re afraid of chaos and you’re driven by your not-self
mind and you see chaos around you, you deal with it. You turn chaotic thought into
chaotic action. You turn the realm of concepts into concretized
activity. None of this was ever intended to be acted on, only
expressed. The mind is here to provide us with an outer authority
guideline. And here are the six areas where it’s intended to guide
us. That’s the thing that’s so interesting.
We are intended to be informed or communicated with by those
that can offer us opinions, insights, ideas, formulas. This is the
great resource of outer authority. Here is the well of outer
authority, but not personal authority. That 43rd gate, how is it
going to get its knowing to a place where it will not be rejected?
This is an intellectual exercise. And that intellectual exercise is that either the
knowing is flawed, which is rarely the case because it’s a natural phenomena.
Ultimately it’s the expression that’s flawed. And the anxiety is only going to
disappear when the expression is correct.
The potential of mind is to be able to find its expression. And when the expression is
correct, then there is no longer a fear. But more than that, the exercise is about
finding the intelligence necessary to be able to ameliorate the anxiety. You don’t
just say, I know; you say, I know and here is why. And the moment that you go,
here is why, you begin a process in which your intelligence is ameliorating the basic
anxiety and makes it much easier to avoid the rejection. And the information was
not for you to act on, this is not about, I know what I should do, this is just about, I
know something. And it is about getting across, in this case, in the individual way,
to empower someone else with this outer authority. But it’s not intended for
personal action.
Where human beings are so deeply sensitive is they’re deeply sensitive at the mental
plane. This is where they’re sensitive. You start scratching around at the mental
plane and you get these incredible reactions from people on the physical level, the
basic and fundamental insecurity of the not-self. It’s not secure, how can it be? And
in order to understand your own decision history, it’s one of those things to look at.
Look at the gates of anxiety that you have, or the gates of anxiety that you have a
gate hanging at. And then look at your openness. This is when you begin the
synthesis of bringing these things together to begin to understand how you made
decisions, and how you turn these mental things, these mental molehills into giant
mountains.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
You end up—it’s like the 4. It’s a wonderful name, Youthful Folly, I rather like that;
but anyway, this gate of formulas. There is a fear of anything that doesn’t fit into
the formula. That’s the fear, because if it doesn’t fit into the formula then there’s
something wrong with the formula. It’s a horror of every physicist. It’s a fear and it
drives one to develop better and better and better and smarter formulas.
But you see, what happens in the not-self is that this anxiety takes over, it just takes
over. And instead of trying to figure out a better formula, there is this visceral
reaction, because of course there’s insecurity. And that deep insecurity is operating
through the openness. And it all comes out in one’s life; that you don’t really have
the formula and you act on it, and chaos happens for you.
The fear blinds us. It’s one of those endless clichés about the nature of fear, it blinds
us. It’s like the 24, this fear that there is no input. After all, it is an acoustic
individual mutative pulse gate. It gets this repetitive cycle of beeps and blimps. And
every once in awhile there is something. And of course, this waiting, which is part of
the return, in the very name of the gate, leads to anxiety. It leads to this anxiety
that I’m stuck; there’s this stuckness, that there is no breakthrough in it.
But this is simply a mind thing. It’s about the acceptance of one’s own process.
That it can only be there when it’s there, and when it’s not there it’s not there. And
there is no point fearing that it won’t show up because it always does; inevitably it
does. But in the not-self this anxiety leads to making things happen. And that
making things happen is disastrous, trying to push the river, trying to force the
mutation, trying to insist there is mutation when there is none, because of the fear.
Because of the way the fear moves through the not-self.
Expressing the Resolution of Fears as Outer Authority
I love mind. It can be so beautiful. But here you can really catch a glimpse of how
distorted it becomes in the not-self life. How its very magic is taken away, because
these anxieties are the intellectual themes that we are here to resolve in this life.
We’re here to resolve them intellectually. And we are here in this sense to express
the resolution of these fears as outer authority, that these are concepts to be
mastered. This is not the Spleen and the physical ability to survive. It’s not the
Solar Plexus and the intensity and spectrum of the experience of being alive. No,
this is the conceptual challenge. It’s not about anything that we within ourselves are
here to act on. And it’s not like you can just say, ok, I’ve learned that and now it’s
all going to stop. Yeah. It’s doesn’t work that way.
Human Design is Strategy and Authority, it isn’t anything else. It is Strategy and
Authority. It is making sure that you strip the mind of that control over your life,
that you take away from your life the false fears, the false actions, all misguided, all
taken in the name of the openness that’s there in your design, and none of it having
anything to do with you. And in that sense, you’re also losing as a by-product the
inherent possibilities that are there in the Splenic and Solar Plexus systems, because
when you are operating correctly these are important aspects of your process. We

The Gates of Fear
are each given a different recipe upon which we develop our unique intelligence. A
recipe that is made up of these various intelligent challenges, this challenge to
survive, this challenge to grasp, sense, understand, know the nature of existence,
this quality of experiential depth, the challenge of that. That’s what’s there for us.
But the moment you’re operating out of the not-self, the moment that the mind is
making the decisions is the moment that this anxiety turns into the action theme of
the planet and your action theme. You know how we always talk about defense
systems and people are defensive—I don’t mean we, I mean in the popular culture—
there is nothing more defensive, sensitive, and touchy than mental anxiety gates
being confronted in one way or another.
Here is where the mind so distorts. It takes the human away from anything
remotely like what is their potential. It’s so incredible. And yet, to simply see them
as intellectual challenges, because that’s what they are. Every pattern that humans
must rely on needs to be observed, tested and challenged. That out of the fear of
any pattern comes the ability to be able to assess it, to be able to establish clearly
whether it is a viable pattern or not, whether it is beneficial or not. That is valuable
knowledge for the collective as outer authority that can be expressed by this
particular aspect of mind.
These are things that we are here to grasp. And we are here to grasp them with
mind. To toss them back and forth, not simply to use them as guides for others, but
in the ability to be able to share the nature of what it is to be here. We want to hear
what great minds think about chaos and order and its place in the totality. We do.
We would like to be clear that there is some way of making sense out of the human
process. We would like to hear that.
All of these areas of anxiety, if you look in the history of poetry, philosophy, thought,
this is the core. It isn’t about all those other things. Oh, yeah, they’re interesting.
We know the fear of nervousness themes. But those are the kinds of things that we
romanticize and turn into our stories and mythologies and our tales, our old wives
tales and our hero’s tales. There are all kinds of thought, the realm, and the
potential. The spectacular reach of mind is all here in these six fears.
It is through them that we are here to grasp intellectually the nature of being, share
it, and guide others who do not get it when it is correct, but not to act on it. And
this is the driving force. When we were primitive our Spleen could move us so
easily, and now it’s our minds. So easily how they can move us, how these fears
turn into a deep threat, how that threat needs to be dealt with, how we immediately
start plotting how we’re going to work it through, make our point, hammer it in, hold
the line. How sad.
I gave up on philosophers a long time ago. As a matter of fact, the only place that
you get to see the six themes of anxiety reasonably expressed on a day-to-day basis
is in the daily cartoons in the newspaper. I guess that’s about as close as we have
today to that. I don’t mean to denigrate that, by the way, I enjoy it, and they do a
good job. But this is what it’s about.

Most of all, when I first laid this out and I realized that—because I took my time in
expressing all of these things, I began only with the Spleen because it was
fundamental for people to begin to understand the mechanics in this way, how these
things work—the villain was always so clear to me, the villain in green. The longer
I’ve worked at it, the deeper I go, the more fascinated I am by how incredibly
powerful and at the same time remarkably unprotected the mind is. I see the
density of the not-self, I see it so deeply. I see the way the mind through taking
action out of its fears, through the underlying frame of its openness, locks the being
into a not-self that in essence could never get out of. And yet, it’s so easy to break
the spell. You just follow your Strategy and Authority.
I say it so much, I guess it is blasé, this and that, but I’m still in wonder about that,
because it is the key. It’s the only way to separate your mind from its delusional
path and to begin the exercise, the deep exercise, the intellectual exercise, of
beginning to see.

Lecture Five
The Nine Fuels
We come to one of my favorite subjects, and one that I think has been traditionally,
always in that sense, not really been paid attention to. It’s one of the things about
what we look at when we look at the BodyGraph and in so many ways the way
people are trained to look at the BodyGraph. We look at the Sacral and we look at
awareness centers and we look at the Ego, the emotional system, the sexy centers,
the ones that carry all the really juicy stuff.
One of the things we pay very, very little attention to is the Root. Everything about
what we’re going to look at today is looking at what is in fact one of the keys in
understanding what it is to be a human being. Everything about the nature of
Human Design and the work of Human Design is to establish an understanding of the
form principle. In understanding the form principle, understanding the way in which
we are intended to operate and hopefully out of that the possibility that some can
operate correctly.
When you think about the nature of the vehicle, the performance of the vehicle,
because after all it is the performance of this vehicle that is a key to its survival, it’s
a key to its longevity. Everything about this vehicle is that it’s an illusion. That is, it
is a quantum phenomenon that is the by-product of the design and personality being
held together in this illusion of separateness by the Monopole.
Within this illusion of separateness there has to be a way in which the fundamental
demands of the vehicle are met. And not simply the fundamental demands of the
vehicle, but in fact, what is the source of just about everything you can imagine to
what it is to be a physical human being in one of these vehicles.
All of it is there in the Root Center. The thing that makes the Root Center so
extraordinary is that it carries information that establishes an energetic direction for
the whole process of the vehicle. Most people don’t really pay much attention to the
Root. I can remember at an earlier Ibiza event spending days and days and days
doing the formats. I think it’s something that is available in Channel 88, one of
those incredible mechanical journeys that I have taken in my career looking at
aspects. Formats are absolutely extraordinary. And yet, it’s only a third of the
dynamism that is there in the Root Center and what that pressure of the Root leads
to.
We have two pressure centers. That is, there is a relationship of the Root Center to
the Head Center. And it’s an interesting thing to ponder in itself. But anyway, we

are caught in what I call a pressure sandwich. We’re caught in this pressure
sandwich between this mental pressure that is there and the physical pressure that
is literally driving the whole mechanism.
So, when we’re looking at the Root Center, the next time you look at a chart or
you’re looking at your own or somebody else’s take a look at the Root because it’s
really talking to you about what is—and I don’t mean to be redundant—the root of
what it is to be you in the physical sense. Obviously, in this kind of an examination
I’m simply going to deconstruct these things. We’re not going to see them within
the context of a design, and in doing so we have a generic. That is, we have a
general way in which we can look at these values.
The Relationship between the Root and the Spleen
So, let’s begin this process by looking at the relationship between the Root Center
and the Spleen. When you think of the Spleen and you think of how important it is,
just think about you having to sit down and design a BodyGraph. You think about
the Spleen because you have to think about it first. You have to think about it first
because it is the essential mechanism for maintaining the life.

The Nine Fuels
So you think about the Spleen and the first thing that as a designer you might think,
because it would seem to be logical is that the Spleen is something that needs to be
empowered because if it’s not empowered it isn’t going to be able to do the job it’s
intended to do. And yet, the Spleen is not a motor. So, so much for my
presumptions about designing a BodyGraph. It’s a good thing it wasn’t my job.
The Spleen has no motor. What that means is that aside from the three possibilities
that can come from the Sacral and come from the Ego, the thrust, the main theme of
development in the Spleen is a by-product of the pressure out of the Root. And of
course, this connection between the Root and the Spleen becomes one of the most
fundamental and basic connections.
The 58th Gate: The Pressure to Perfect
Let’s start with the 58. And when we start with the 58th gate, and I’m just going to
go in line here, when we start with the 58th gate we start with the pressure to
perfect. Think about it just as a term. And of course, we’re not just talking about
the 58th gate, and we’re not just talking about the
18, and not just the 48 and the 16. In other
words, what we are looking at is a whole
movement that is going to influence the whole
logical process, because everything about what
becomes conceptualized intelligence is rooted in
its source streams in the Spleen.
Here we have this stream of judgmentation that
in the mind leads to logical thinking. But the
logical thinking is rooted here and begins with
this fuel and this pressure to perfect. So, this is
why we have dissatisfaction so that satisfaction
can be the goal, the perfection of the pattern. And this is why this channel 16/48 is
called talent, because talent is never perfect. It can always be perfected. There is
not a single great artist that has ever lived that retired from being an artist. The
pressure is always there; that pressure to perfect.
And whenever you look at any of the logical gates that are under the pressure of this
58th gate, understand that’s what it’s about. The 18th gate challenges to find
perfection; the 48 is looking for the perfect depth; the 16, the perfect skills; the 62,
the perfect facts, the perfect opinions, the perfect formulas, the perfect question.
And always for one thing and one thing only, to perfect the form, to perfect what it is
to be the illusion in the life. And this is the essential energy for that.
Think about the way in which we are elements in a vast jigsaw puzzle in which we all
have bits of this and that. What it means not to have a pressure in your Root, what
it means to be conditioned by it. Think of what it is to be an 18 and have no 58.
Think about it. It’s quite something. Because there is no perfecting without the
energy, because it is in the Root that that pressure to perfect exists. And it’s in its
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

A Digital Book for Students
ability to flow through its stream that everything gets impacted by that. The 18
yearns for that 58.
And obviously, as not-self it becomes a deep conditioning factor. The fuel, after all
we’re looking at fuels, is vitality. What is vitality for? Vitality is the only thing that
overcomes boredom. One of the dilemmas of the logical process is repetition. If you
are going to challenge a problem it is quite a long involved process. Repetitions,
repeating, going through over and over, like the way in which we learn mathematics
and formulas; talent, repetition, over and over and over and over again, the same
thing over and over and over and over again, this is a very special energy.
Think about the vitality inherent in what we think of as an opinionated person. It
seems like they will never run out of the juice to push their agenda. This is the
vitality. And they will repeat it over and over and over and over and over again, like
the 62 repeating the facts over and over and over again—follow your Strategy and
Authority, says Mr. 62 Earth—over and over and over again.
One of the banes of being a teacher is that your intellectual life is loaded with
redundancies, repetitions, endless repetitions over and over and over again. This is
the pathway to perfection. And you cannot do it without the vitality. So this is quite
a fuel. And then you can begin to deduce certain things; the dilemma of the 16/48
that has no access to what is its true fuel. As I said, we are a hodgepodge. Not
everybody has a defined Root. An awful lot of people don’t. And you can imagine
then what the conditioning impact is.
The Root creates the deepest discomfort possible in a human. In fact, in many ways
to have an open Root is more uncomfortable than having an open emotional system
or an open Ego. Because the whole thing about the open Root is that it leads to this
high frequency, almost desperate level of activity. And of course, it is a false fuel in
the sense that it’s a conditioned fuel. And of course, it leads to enormous problems;
so, the pressure to perfect.
The 38th Gate: Pressure to Struggle
If we move along to the individual process, we get to
the 38th gate, Opposition, and we get to the pressure to
struggle. To be an individual is to recognize that you
have to fight for your individuality. You have to
struggle for your individuality. You have to struggle to
maintain your uniqueness. And it means that the very
fuel of individuality in this context is a fuel that in
essence blocks out the other, because it is a fuel that is
pointed at the struggle to emerge as an individual. And
you can see that the fuel is the fuel to fight. To fight
for one’s purpose, to fight for one’s existential
presence, to fight for one’s knowing, to fight for one’s thoughts. It’s a struggle. It’s
a struggle to hold them together as individual. It is a struggle to maintain unique

The Nine Fuels
insights. It is a struggle to maintain a unique perception in the now, individual
perception in the now, individual awareness in the now. So, everything about this
stream is fueled to fight.
Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is violent. But it also means that it
certainly can be, and certainly within the context of the not-self it is more than likely.
And it is something to grasp about individuality that everyone who carries
individuality struggles for their presence in this life as a unique being. And it doesn’t
matter whether they’re not-self; they just struggle blindly with what they cannot
escape. It’s a struggle. And you cannot handle it without the fuel.
The focus for most human beings is looking at themselves in the sense that this
knowledge about transforming the way in which you operate in the world,
discovering your inner authority, beginning to operate and make decisions according
to that inner authority. This is all about you. And it’s wonderful. But it does not
exist in isolation and never will. None of us do. The fact that you can overcome
conditioning through your openness does not mean that your openness does not
serve you, it will always serve you.
It is through the receptors that we have in our openness that we are connected to
rest of the life force. It is how we integrate with the other. It is our connection, in
essence, to the other. And everything about understanding the nature of the vehicle
and the way in which it is fueled and pressured is that it is fueled and pressured to
live in the world with the other. This is not necessarily a struggle within oneself or a
fight within oneself. It is a struggle in the face of the forces of the collective and the
tribe. They try to move you, force you, and pull you away from your stand, your
place so that you can be absorbed into what is theirs.
It’s at that mundane level that it exists in the world, this struggle to maintain your
identity. Just about every child that carries individual activations, they don’t even
have to have definitions, it is part of that force that you see in them where they want
to establish who they are. This is the fight. To be able to find your way and make
your stand so that you can be seen as something unique and different—look at me,
here I am.
The 54th Gate: The Pressure to Transform
We come to the tribe and we move away from logical judgmentation and the
intuition of the struggle and we get to the land of instinct, we get to the heart of the
power of instinct. This is the pressure to transform.
What’s interesting about this pressure to transform is that it’s tribal, it’s not
personal. It’s like understanding the pressure to perfect, it’s not personal, it’s
collective. You want everybody to be perfect. Just live with an 18/58 and you know
that right away, that they expect everybody and everything to be perfect. It’s built
into them and they cannot escape it because they are living with the pressure which
can make them deeply irritating to others. This pressure to transform is sticky. It

means if I change, you change with me because you’re my brother, my sister, my
cousin, my uncle, my aunt, you’re part of my clan, you’re part of my tribe, you’re
part of my culture.
In other words, this is the pressure to tribally transform and it means it’s a kind of
glue. In other words, you do it together. This is the kind of thing where you can
smell the 54 in recruitment advertising for
militaries. Where you get a new family in which
you transform together and you become
something else together, but you don’t do it
alone. And of course, within the tribal context,
the 54 is the pressure to make money, because in
the end, if the tribe does not have appropriate
resources, the tribe will be wiped out or
swallowed up or disappear. The fuel of drive, the
tribal drive—we’re going to do it together.
These fuels carry with them ingredients that
impact the way in which the whole process of the
stream is going to operate. It just will. There is a glue in the fuel of the 54 that
binds the marrying maiden to the one that discovers her, that binds them as a team.
This is the deepest relationship between the 32 and the 54. The 32 looks at the 54
and says I see that you have what it takes and I’m going to help you. Just
remember that when you get past me on the ladder of success that you always
remember me. That is the relationship.
Of course, this is the way the tribe operates; this is the way that it works. So, the
moment that you have a fuel like this—think about somebody who is deeply
individual. No other definitions, just a couple of individual definitions and they have
an open Root and sitting in that open Root is that 54. You think about the
conditioning that is going to impact that person the moment that Root is defined.
They’re going to amply this drive to tribally glue. And you have this enormous
pressure on somebody that is fundamentally individual to bond to some tribal
activity, to try to fit in. That will be the conditioning, because it carries that glue.
One can never overlook the fuel. And to understand that we all get all of these nine
gates just about all the time. Other than if you’re living a deeply reclusive life and
you have very little aura contact and only are caught in the transit field, then there
can be a limitation to the cycle upon which you get activations there. But in the
general sense of what it is to be in the world, we are all picking up these fuels.
Always.
I live with two Root people who have Root definition. I have no lack of picking up
Root information and Root fuels that are necessary for the operation of those
streams. Now, they don’t have to condition them because again remember this is
something that is at the core of this knowledge is that what protects you is the
decision you make. It doesn’t matter whether you’re getting a fuel by being in
somebody’s aura—Projectors do it all the time. It’s not about that. It’s about
understanding that it is an essential energy. But it also means that you cannot be

The Nine Fuels
driven by the energy, you have to operate according to whatever your strategy is.
It’s the only thing in the end that ever protects you.
But I want you to understand that we all have a need for access to these fuels. At
least relative to the way in which we are individually designed. Now, if you’re
operating according to Strategy and Authority, which means that your vehicle is
aligned to what is its geometry, you’re going to get precisely the fuel interaction that
you need. The fuel is an essential thing.
The Relationship between the Root and the Emotional System
I’m going to shift over to the other side now, to the emotional side and this
relationship between the Root and the emotional system. I think it’s one of the most
fascinating areas of investigation. Aside from the fact that two of the gates on the
other side, that is the 49 and the 55, and specifically the 55, these are the center of
what is the Solar Plexus mutation that’s taking place. The 49, 55 together are the
codon histidine. The 41st gate in its relationship to the 30, as an example, the
Clinging Fire is the gate of the fates. This is all about our experiential life.
So, these three areas are areas that are deeply significant. On top of that we’re not
dealing with the potential of a connection in which you have a non-motor center that
is being motorized, as in the case of the Spleen, we already have a very powerful
motor, that is, the emotional system. And this connection means we have an
adrenalized, because that’s the biological association to the Root, emotional system.
Now, one of the interesting things about adrenalin is to think about it in terms of the
state that they call stage fright, something I’ve witnessed. I can remember in my
early years of being a singer in New York City I used to audition in what were open
evenings. You’d get a lot of people, some who were very good professionals and
some who were utter terrible amateurs. I remember watching somebody go up on
stage, as a matter of fact, the person who was ahead of me, and totally freeze. He
literally had to be taken off the stage. And it was something to see the power of
adrenalin to lock somebody. It was an absolute lock, this freezing in that moment.
Just that adrenalin rush pouring in.
Particularly when I was young, having an open Root Center and three open motors, I
was an adrenalin junkie. I could take any kind of rush, any kind of adrenalin buzz.
Whereas, somebody else with an open Root could be very different in the way in
which they’re going to respond. And it was the first time that I had seen anybody
frozen by fear. Which it wasn’t, by the way, it was pure adrenalin that froze him.
The reason I bring this up is to get an understanding of the relationship between the
Root and the emotional system because the only thing that controls the emotional
system, the only thing that has power to impact the emotional system is the Root.
That’s quite something to say. In other words, that these Root gates have a very
peculiar impact on the emotional side. And what they do is they, in essence, try to
lock the wave.

Now, they don’t succeed entirely. But they do succeed in, freezing is a funny word,
but they do succeed in a kind of semi-lock, let’s put it that way. In other words,
take the 55th gate as an example. The 55th gate is the archetype of indecisiveness.
The 55th gate is the child with a daisy pulling out petals saying, she loves me, she
loves not or I love her, I love her not, because in fact there is no knowing here.
There is no knowing because it is a pure, pure, pure individual spirit. And that pure
individual spirit knows absolutely nothing until it knows, and in that case absolutely
nothing until it knows through its feeling. Nothing.
The 39th Gate: The Pressure to Emote
So, there it is—I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. Now what is the 39th gate?
The 39th gate is a deeply, deeply powerful gate. It is the pressure to emote. But
what we see here is this is the fuel to provoke. And it is the fuel to provoke the 55
out of its “this” or “that” and lock it into a mutation. And one of the things that you’ll
notice about the individual emotional being, particularly you see that in the 12/22,
but you can also see it in the 55/39 is that
they have a wave that is a planing wave. In
other words, they can get to a certain point
where it seems like there’s very little
differentiation in the nature of their
moodiness. Now, this is a by-product of the
provocation, the stronger the provocation the
smoother the plane.
Remember that from the 39 to the 12 in terms
of sexuality it’s all about romance. And
everything about the nature of romance is
that you slowly build a fire until it is an overwhelming passion. And it is at that point
of passion that there can be consummation. This is the nature of this provocation.
This is a provocation that sets the fire burning. And this is an essential ingredient in
order for the individual to be able to fulfill its purpose in this stream, this emote.
And of course, so much of it is connected to the creative process. Then you have to
see that within the very language of this fuel—provocation—to provoke the spirit of
the 55 so that it can decide that there can be this moment of the pulse being there,
that there is this provocation in the 22, the provocation of the listener. Do you know
how dangerous it is to be with somebody who is ready to listen to you? And if you
don’t, you should be. It is a provocation.
This fuel is in the whole process. It’s why the 12—someone like me—speaks with so
much drama in their voice. It’s not an artifice. It’s simply that’s the emoting. This
is the drama, and the drama provokes. You know my voice goes up and suddenly
there’s a different quality than when it gets very quiet. This is the emotional drama
wave, it is the emoting wave, but it’s in the individual process. It’s locked on this

The Nine Fuels
little plane with little spikes to give it impact to provoke. And because it’s individual
it’s deeply acoustic. It is the destiny of the 12 to provoke acoustically.
But it needs its source. My ability to do what I do today, which is to teach every day
at a deep level, which I never did before, is something that began to emerge when
my youngest son was born. He’s a 39/55 and he has the 22nd gate to my 12. I have
never had such consistent power in my voice as I’ve had in this era with this kind of
availability, shall I say, of the essential fuels.
The 41st Gate: The Pressure to Feel
This is one of my favorites. The 41 to the 35 deserves a semester all to itself. It’s
really fantastic. I do a touch of it when I do the Six Fates in the summer program.
It is the whole story of human life. It is the human experiential way. And it is the
most deeply abstract way. The fuel in and of itself, in that sense, is something that
drives the life force, it drives our experiential movement. It’s why everything begins
with the 41. I’m not playing with numbers when I
start the rave year when the sun enters into the 41st
gate. This is where everything begins. This is the
initiating codon in our genetics; this is the beginning
of things.
So, here we’re dealing with a fuel that in many
respects is the—the only equivalent to it, in a sense,
is its mirror on the other side, this drive to perfect a
process, this drive to perfect the patterns. And on
this side this incredible pressure to get to the
experience. It’s interesting when you think about it as a fuel because the theme is
often not well understood, this fuel of contraction. Contraction is an interesting
word. That is, pulling inward, or the kind of thing we associate with pre-birth and
contractions that the mother goes through.
In fact, this term is rooted to the original meaning of the 41st gate of decrease. After
all, it’s called Decrease. The illusion is the gardener that in the fall is going to cut
back the plant, the contraction, the decrease, in order for it to bloom. One of the
things to realize about the pressure here in the 41, and what I alluded to earlier
about how these pressures impact so profoundly the emotional system, is that in the
41st gate, what ultimately is going to be expressed as desire in the 30 comes from
the 41. In other words, it cuts back all other possible experiences to fuel the goal of
one experience only.
This is the whole thing about understanding the experiential way. The experiential
way should ultimately end with the 35 saying, been there, done that. I’m not going
to do it again. It all starts with the pressure of the 41, this pressure to contract.
And you can see how much of a problem it can be. In other words, that it is
eliminating everything else and creating this kind of singular focus so that in the 30th
gate we also get the gate of obsession.
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

73
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
It seems like obsession, this pressure to feel the importance of needing to have this
experience; a driving force. And all the way down the line until you get to the 35,
the 35 says, it’s all been reduced down to this one thing, and only that one thing can
be measured. It’s either a success or not. That’s the measurement. And then it’s
done. And if it’s a failure, it’s somebody else’s fault. And then there is the
movement again in the cycle, next experience to move through.
This is the same thing when you see it as it is expressed through the abstract stream
of the mind, that singular idea, that one thing that you’re obsessed with making
sense of, that singular confusion that’s there. It’s always that one nagging thing that
drives the abstract mind rattling. Here’s where it comes from; how else to build up
experiential knowledge without the total involvement in one experience at a time.
We’ll see that when we get to the format and its expressions because when you get
to the 46 and the 29, you see that ultimately the abstract is intended to be the most
existential of all processes, even more existential in that sense than the individual
process, to be in the experience in the now totally absorbed. One thing, everything
else contracted, and one thing less to ever have to do again—the abstract ideal.
The 19th Gate: The Pressure to be Sensitive
We have a phenomena going on now, we have Neptune in the 49th gate. It is deeply
significant. It is masking, veiling an ongoing process that is taking place in the 49th
gate in which the connection between the 49
and the 19 is being disturbed. That connection
is ultimately being contracted. It is slowly
falling apart, is the most mundane way to say
that.
So, it’s very difficult, for me anyway, to look at
this in just a traditional sense. But nonetheless,
obviously here in the 19th gate we have one of
the most profound fuels in the sense that the
19th gate itself is a deeply, deeply mysterious
gate. It carries our needs for territory, our
needs for partners, our needs for God, our needs for shelter, our needs for
communal bonding, our needs for rituals and traditions. It is very, very profound the
impact of this 19th gate and its pressure.
This is the fuel for support. In other words, if you thought that the 54 was sticky in
that if I’m going to be a success, you’re going to be a success with me, we’re going
to do it together, this is even stickier, because this is the pure fuel for support. It’s
not a fuel for tribal drive; that the drive is the primary direction and the glue is part
of it. This is: the glue is everything. We live and die together.

The Nine Fuels
And this is the pressure not to be sensitive in the sense that oh, my dear he’s over
sensitive. I don’t mean it in that way. I mean sensitive in the sense that one can
easily be drawn into the demands of the support of others. The 49 may be the
butcher, the divorcer and the polarities of that, but when the 19 hooks into the 49,
the 49 has a commitment to them regardless. They automatically have to support
them, because you cannot escape it.
So funny enough the 49 gets divorced and is supposed to—does not in all cases—pay
support. That was a divorce joke. But anyway, the tribe isn’t funny, I guess. This
19th gate, this support, you can see what happens to it when it moves to the 40/37
and again you have a very different way in which that is going to be expressed
because it is going to the Ego, it is not going to the Throat, it’s going to the Heart
Center so it’s a very different process.
Yet, at the same time to understand something about the power of this fuel is its
glue. And of course, this is one of the things that’s so interesting about the
phenomena we’re going through now with Neptune being in the 49. I don’t mean
that after Neptune leaves that suddenly this is all over, it won’t be. But there is
definitely going to be a major recognizable shift in tribal continuity. Basically, the
way in which we’ll see that is that we’ll see a deepening of on the surface anyway
things like fundamentalist backlash.
In other words, when the 19th gate and the 49 begin to lose their ability to
communicate with each other properly, at least as they have in the past before the
onset of this mutative process, it means that these themes that have held the tribe
together and the glue to hold the tribe together is not there. And of course, that
always brings a backlash. And it also means that the pressure, in that sense, to feel
the presence of God, for example, is something that is also going to be sidetracked.
And obviously, that is going to lead to its own backlash.
I think in Channel 88 there are a number of courses, and one particularly that I
remember doing on the 19 for any of you that are interested in the detail of that, but
the 19th gate is really an extraordinary pressure and it’s going to be very interesting
to watch this phenomena of understanding that this basic glue that holds the tribe
together, remember we are living in a cycle that began in the early 1600s, the cycle
of the Cross of Planning, which has in it the 40/37 as part of its configuration, also
the 9,16. We are going leave behind that cycle in 2027.
We enter into a new cycle which is fundamentally individual in its nature. That is the
55, 59, 20, 34, the Sleeping Phoenix; we enter into a totally different era. We enter
into an individual cycle that will profoundly change our relationships with the other,
at least in terms of the group; that is, in terms of the tribe.
The collective and the individual will still maintain its integrity, but the tribe, other
than on the business side, the Splenic side, is going to lose its glue. And obviously,
there is going to be a backlash to all of that. And it’s not like it’s something that you
can’t see now, because obviously this mutation has been going on since 1781. It’s
only since 1961, when we entered into the 6th line phase of the cycle that the tempo
has really picked up. So, we’re beginning to see these impacts.

But as I said, Neptune being here, it is very significant. It is something to watch.
We won’t be able to see the results of this until 2010. In 2010 Neptune leaves the
49th gate permanently. There’s a slight retrograde in between, and then it moves
on. And then we will have that opportunity to see it. Interestingly enough after it
leaves the 49 it’s going to go to the 30th gate. So, Neptune is very much involved in
this process but in a way that makes it very difficult for us to see what’s going on.
This is the power of Neptune, after all. Anyway, I don’t want to do too long a
Neptunian digression here.
The 53rd Gate: The Pressure to Complete
Let’s get to the center. And as I said there is fabulous material, really some of the
best material I ever did on the formats, that are available in Channel 88; to really
understand them from both the mechanical and the mystical
point of view because they are deeply mystical. Here I just
want to keep it to the context we have been looking at.
Let’s look, for example, at the abstract process first. If we
look at the abstract process, everything about this is about
being able to complete things, the pressure to complete.
Now, think about that pressure to complete with the
contraction and understand that the contraction leads to the
movement towards a singular experience that can be
completed. This is the whole thing. And you can see that
built in, because again we’re deconstructing, so the format
is the key to any of these streams, that here in the format
everything is about the fuel to begin a process, but to begin
a process that is going to be an experience that is going to be pinpointed to a
singular experience to go through.
Abstract people, for example, who multitask, are really doing themselves a deep
disadvantage because that’s not what they’re here for. They really are here to go
through each experience completely. Only then do they collect all of the information.
Again, if you follow the theme of that, you go from the process of being able to do
something completely, this format of being able to bring things to their maturation,
in doing so you can be a success and the success is rooted in being in the process so
you can have the information as a witness to be able to share with others what that
process was all about.
And that process is going to be stored as a story in the abstract as the explanation of
how to make sense out of something. Because you went through the singular
experience from beginning to end existentially so that you could see, understand, get
the secrets from the story, reveal the story and store it as a traditional story, stored
as a collective abstract experiential story, this is how you do this or that. Every “how
to” book that’s ever been written follows this program.

LECTURE FIVE
The Nine Fuels
It’s just a program. The BodyGraph is just another program, after all. It’s delightful,
but you can see the way things operate, and you can see the processes and
understand how important these fuels are. On the other side, when you go to the
logical process, here you are with that pressure to concentrate. What we know that
in the logical process is this incredible vitality to perfect. And in order to perfect you
have to be able to be concentrated. And that concentration has to lead to a flow so
you develop a pattern of challenging, you develop a pattern of perfecting, you
develop a pattern of repetition so that you can become a leader who can then relate
the facts and opinions that are based on true formulas that come from a question
that has now been successfully answered. And the focus is there through that whole
process.
The 52nd Gate: The Pressure to Concentrate
And you can see the way in which we are designed. And you can begin to see in this
an understanding that fuels that people carry are very important. How wonderful it
is to sit in a classroom at exam time, my son has his final exams
starting today, you go into a classroom and you have somebody
who has a 52/9 sitting beside you. Oh, very nice, thank you
very much, perfect fuel. The fuel to concentrate, to focus, to sit
still in the chair, the fuel is there.
These fuels are essential ingredients in life, after all. It’s like
that kid who studies so hard and they just can’t focus and three
rows over there’s that 9/52 and the dummy sitting beside them
is totally locked in. Ah, life it’s so cute and it’s so unfair. There
are so many disadvantages and ignorance. How wonderful it
would be to be able to create a classroom seating arrangement
where everybody gets access to what they need so that the level
of the digestion of the information is something that is fair in terms of everybody
having the same opportunity to grasp what is going on.
After all, for me part of the battle is to get human beings to understand what
conditioning is, and then to see clearly that there is a way to get out of it. But then
to come back and reexamine your openness because it is your potential of wisdom, it
is where you connect to the world. And it’s so important to understand the impact.
We all have Roots that can be impacted with different pressures; we all have a
system that demands pressures that we may not have ourselves.
And it’s so interesting to understand how that works. To be a 16/48 and you only
work at your talent some time because you don’t always have the vitality. And it’s
not always the right energy. You can get energy, so you can be a talent person that
let’s say is an Ego Manifestor, you can have somebody like this and there they are
and they’re working on their talent, but it doesn’t carry the same thing. The Ego is
very different. If the Ego doesn’t get rewards it’s not very good at staying with
things, and the Ego always needs to take a rest and there is no consistency and

there is no “oh, I practised that yesterday, I don’t want to do that today.” There’s
this kind of thing that is not the same energy. It is not the vitality energy.
One of my pleasures in doing this course is to go back to the basics and to remind
people, not just you as the live students present here and the ones who are
listening, by the way, I think there are 38 people in this class, but for the future, for
those people that will have a chance to listen to this. We cannot ignore—if you really
want to have a holistic understanding of the vehicle, the BodyGraph is full of
mysteries and it’s very profound. The deeper you go the more extraordinary it is.
And yet, in this phase of my career where I’m teaching substructure of the line at
such a deep level, that there is a tendency for people to think that that’s where all
the depth is. And in essence it’s only a lot of depth in the sense that it is below the
line. But above the line is this enormous playground. It’s a fantastic zone. And this
BodyGraph is full of incredible information.
Slowly, as you grasp the minutiae of the BodyGraph, you begin to see the miracle of
life, the miracle of this holistic vehicle, how perfect it is. Just for me to be able to
describe the way in which these pressures and fuels run through these streams,
come on, it is such a perfect thing. It’s all there. Anyway, I have 10 first lines; I
never get over my wonder about these things.
The 60th Gate: The Pressure to Mutate
The 60th gate says a great deal about what it says to be a human that we are under
constant pressure to mutate. You think about the single cell. If you look at the
design of a single cell it is the 15/5 as a potential and the 3 as
a potential. Of course, we know that the great danger to cells
is mutation. We also know that the great potential in cells is
mutation. So, mutation is there and it is open to this
pressure, this incredible pressure.
And again, it’s so interesting to understand the fuel of
individuality. It’s like when I first tried to get people to
understand how type is aura. If you can understand circuitry
themes by their fuel you’ll get a very deep understanding of
them. In order for the individual to be individual, they have
to be free of most influence. One of the most difficult things
for individuality to handle is the attempt of influence by the
other. Not because they’re not open to what the other may
have to say, individuals who struggle with somebody telling the truth to their face,
it’s very, very difficult for them.
And it’s not because they don’t hear the truth, their whole chemistry demands that
they not be influenced. And of course, you can see that when you look at the way in
which it is designed. In other words, this struggle that is locked into the individuality
itself, this emoting that is so much about being able to establish one’s power to alter
the other, provoke the other, lock the other in, fix their wave, change them, and

mutate them; and here this fuel of restraint. And it’s not restraint in the sense of
holding one back. It is restraint in the sense of not allowing individuality to be
influenced in any way.
Individuals are very difficult, in a sense, to condition. They are not-self simply
because that is the way they understand the nature of being. You grow up and you
think your mind runs your life. But individuals fight so hard not to be pulled in. And
by the way, they don’t do that consciously. Like those kids that are freaks that can’t
stand being freaks and want to be tribal or collective and the fuel that drives them
will simply not permit it.
The other thing is that everything at the very source of mutation is that there is no
mutation until there is mutation. And here lies the great story. We are not creative.
We are reactive. We are not in charge.

Lecture Six
The Third Gate
The Power of Mutation
Good morning or night or whatever your local time is. I guess this is a historic
lecture in the sense there are a number of things that I laid out in the early years,
the material that was part of the book Rave Anatomy. There were only certain
aspects of the material that I never really covered. That is I never really integrated
into what would become my general approach to teaching people Human Design and
the kind of infrastructure information that they would need.
I was always concerned at the very beginning when I was laying all of this out that
to deal with the 3rd gate within the context that I’m going to show you today, simply
would not be viable. That is, there was no practical way of interpreting the
information. I had yet to teach the ten stages from the point of conception, the first
88 degrees of life which is an essential ingredient to be able to incorporate this.
It was simply a level of material that I realized was significant, but would wait
another time. And of course, as things rolled along in my process in Design, it was
one of those things that sort of was just ignored. Every once in a while I would refer
to it. Even in the original book, the Rave Anatomy, the illustrations are chock-full of
errors, which was obvious to me when I had to prepare all these Rave Anatomy
lectures. So, in fact, it’s something that nobody has really ever looked at. So, let’s
look.
The 3rd Gate
As I said, it was complex material 20 years ago and it is complex material today.
Part of one of the underlying themes that I have been following all of my years in my
involvement in teaching the knowledge is trying to understand, from the perspective
of the knowledge, genetics, trying to understand the way things work within the
biological construct and its relationship to the dynamics that you can actually see in
the BodyGraph.
One of the things we have to keep in mind is the nature of the 3rd gate and how
unique this gate is, how fascinating it is as such, because without it, in a sense and
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

81
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
only in a sense because there is no without it, but without it there is no change,
there is no mutation, there is no possibility for what life can be.
You can see it in the single cell. The 3rd gate is in control of everything. It is in
control of the mutative process, this Difficulty at the Beginning. Well, this difficulty
at the beginning is that this is a gate of ordering. And it is a gate of ordering
confusion, literally. You can see that in terms of the cell itself. Always, every cell,
the 15/5 with the 3, within its design is constantly ready for the mutative process
and it’s the 3 that governs it.
We’re also looking at a format energy. That is, in looking at the 3/60 we’re looking
at the format energy of the individual process. It means it is the source of our
creative, mutative transformation in this life. So obviously something that is, in that
sense, deeply significant.
But one of the mysteries of the 3rd gate that was given to me was that it is within the
context of it being the format of mutation, that it is out of this format that the
movement of genetic information is controlled. In other words, how do you control
the confusion of all the input and organize it into specific stringing of aspects in order
to end up with a certain by-product. In other words, this whole movement of
information that is derived from the mother, the father, the grandparents, all of this
information that crystallizes in the being. All of this is within the context of the 3rd
gate.

LECTURE SIX
The Third Gate
Continuity
Now, as I said, this is the first time I’ve ever even attempted to really look at this
material with students. My approach here is entirely theoretical. In other words,
what fascinates me about this is what has driven my deeper understandings in
Human Design and that is continuity. In other words, in a number itself is this layers
and layers and layers of value whether it is tonal or color or line. For me it is
fascinating to see the way in which these themes operate in the continuity. The fact
that the 3rd gate orders mutation means that in the lines of the 3rd gate and in the
roles of the 3rd gate one can find the continuity thematically that operates in other
lines in the BodyGraph and in effect affects them. In other words, moves the
mutation through the whole body, regardless of circuit or stream or type or this or
that, it is passing along the very continuity.
One of the ways that analysis was developed Human Design is that by understanding
continuity you can begin to get depth. In other words, if you understand how 1st
lines operate you don’t need to be dependent on the I’Ching to describe the 1st line
of a gate. It’s nice that it’s there. It’s a nice bit of haiku kind of poetry. But in
terms of practical interpretation any gate and its line can be interpreted simply by a
mechanical understanding of what the line is. A 1st line is insecure and needs to find
a foundation and is introspective and investigative and all of the things you can come
up with that are keynotes of it. And it is true. And if it happens to be the 1st line in
the 64th gate you know what they’re insecure about. They’re insecure about their
confusions, they’re insecure about that.
And this is what they’re looking for. And ultimately they end up looking for it
through the other side of the channel, trying to make sense out of things and so
forth and so on. In other words, understanding the continuity in line value this is
something that I find fascinating in this context because it says some interesting
things about the hexagram through its binary structure.
Most students are trained to think of the hexagram as two trigrams. That is, that is
the traditional view of the hexagram. And obviously the trigrams are significant and
are certainly incorporated as a mechanical
phenomenon in Design. Yet, at the same
time a hexagram can and should always be
seen through its binaries, because these
binaries are deeply significant. For example,
the lower binary always represents the
quarter that the hexagram is in. And the
middle binary always represents what
quadruplicity or what quarter of what quarter it is in. And the top is the unique
expression of the particular gate in that particular quarter of that particular quarter.
Each of the binaries carries different information. This is carrying much more
generalized information. This is beginning to hone in on certain specifics and this is
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

83
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
very much individual. So, understanding the binaries of the hexagram is something
that is very important. Any of you, regardless of your involvement or your level in
Human Design, one of the best meditations of all is simply to look at the hexagrams
in relationship to the wheel and to begin to look at the mathematical movement and
progression of the mutation of these hexagrams as they move, and to begin to
understand the continuity that lies there and to begin to appreciate the importance
of binaries in looking in Design.
When we study tone, which is in essence the deepest level in terms of really
understanding the being, because we look at the cognitive source, tone itself is
rooted in a 6 that is divided into very specific binaries. And it is tone that in fact lays
out the architecture for the life itself. So, it is important not to ignore binaries when
you see them in the BodyGraph. And for me in analysis we use specific gates as
keys to being able to understand continuity. So for example, you can have the gates
of identity, the 7th gate and the 1st gate and the 13th gate and the 10th gate and you
take all of their 1st lines and you have a key to analyzing any 1st line. The 13 is
empathic, and the 7 is an authoritarian, and the 1 is an investigator and you
suddenly have literally what is the basis of all 1st lines.
So, this continuity here, in being able to see continuity through binaries is something
that in the same way we can use the 59th gate and the 27th gate to talk about
genetic imperative and out of that, out of those line values, to see generalized sexual
values in the being, that we can look at the line values of the 30th gate and project
from that literally what is the best way for that particular profile to operate on the
material plane, and operate in terms of the experiential way.
Three Different Views
So here in the 3rd gate we understand something else. We understand something
very interesting about our conditioning. Remember the moment you talk about
genes you have to talk about the fact that genes set us up because they set us up to
be attracted to something. And it is this base of attraction to that something else
that is so interesting in this application. In other words, there is a certain mother-
ness, if I can put it that way, to 1st and 2nd lines that are very different from the
“father-ness” of 5th and 6th lines, and the remoteness, in a sense, of the
grandparental 3rd and 4th lines.
When we think about the way the mother looks at the other, the way the father
looks at the other and the way the grandparents look at the other we have three
very different views. But by saying different views, we have something else. There
are certain behavioral models that are there because we’re not just talking about an
abstract here, we’re talking about that in 1st and 2nd line continuity they have their
genetic Root derived from the mother. In other words, it is an aspect from the
mother that is actually participating, in that sense. So, its approach, the way in
which it’s going to operate, there’s going to be a difference.

LECTURE SIX
The Third Gate
The 1st Line: Synthesis
Let’s take a little journey here, because I’m only going to do and only will be able to
do an overview of this. Remember we’re looking at an evolutionary pattern. It’s a
priority pattern. You are always, wherever you are—tone, color, base—you are
starting from a thematic continuity of the need for foundation. And the need for
foundation, the 1st line, is synthesis. That is, synthesis is being able to order the
confusion. This is the very basis of everything.
In other words, this naturally says that human beings in a sense are not designed to
clone, that’s what it says, basically. It says that the foundation is the synthesis.
That is, it is the ordering of genetic information taken from different sources and
synthesized or the quantum of that is the by-product. This is the foundation for
mutation. And of course, it is absolutely so. That is, the foundation of mutation is
the bonding of differences with the result of something coming out that is unique.
And everything about the genetic imperative is this genetic imperative towards being
attracted to what is different, what is conditioning. And then the by-product of that
is a resulting synthesis. And this synthesis out of this emerges a new force, a new
force that contains the vitality of the genetic inheritance, and at the same time, a
new force that is going to be capable, ultimately, of being reproductive itself.
But the ongoing process that is the very foundation of mutation is that mutation is all
about this synthesis of the binary. It is a synthesis of the binary. It is bringing the
“this and that” together, but not truly together. It’s something else that emerges. I
have children and they are neither like me nor their mothers. They are something
else. Oh, yes, one can see traits and similarities and odd combinations. One can
also see things that you don’t know where they come from, literally. There are all
these keys in recognizing that this is something different. This is the by-product.
This is the synthesis; this is what the movie is all about.
So when we’re dealing with the 1st line we can also see something else about
foundation. Again, my interest is in being able to understand things about
continuity. See, when I see something like ‘derived from the Mother,’ for me what
this means is that this is form principle. And when you get to the very basis of the
form principle, the whole basis of the form principle is that you can only create a
foundation by finding a way to bring balance, to bring order to opposites or order to
a binary. It’s the quantum that makes things work. How many relationships are
held together by the presence of children? It is the quantum that makes things
work.
This is just one of the things to understand about foundation, that the foundation is a
way in which you can bring duality together. You can find some kind of solid ground,
not something that teeters on the “this or that,” but something that has a basis to it.
Biology seems to be the only way that we get evidence of its viability. That is, that
biological synthesis is very successful. It’s obvious how successful it is. It is the
very basis upon which the form principle exists on this planet, that ordering of
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

inheritance. And it’s here in the 3rd gate; it’s here in this 1st line. This 1st line just
courses through all of the other 1st lines, all of them.
The 2nd Line: Immaturity
When we move to the 2nd, I love this one; this is the male sex mutation. I’ve been
at the birth of two of my children. It is obvious that there is something odd about a
male coming out of a female body that doesn’t carry the oddness of a female coming
out of a female body. The male is a mutation of the female. It is in that sense this
quality of immaturity.
Yet, at the same time it brings with it this yang spark, that spark that we see in the
hidden talent that lies within any 2nd line. That is, the gift that is hidden inside that
demands that the other see it and pull that gift out. It’s just interesting to note that
this male sex mutation is something that comes out of the form principle in order to
create the viable binary, because this is the viable binary.
This is the way in which the entire process is set up. It’s also interesting to see that
this theme of immaturity is one to really grasp, because when you see it within the
continuity, and of course the continuity to take it through every 2nd line, take it
through the 2nd lines in the profiles and to begin to understand why there is a need
for others to project on that 2, because what lies within them is not something that
on its own can emerge. That in fact it cannot emerge because it is immature. It
needs to be worked on, it needs to be refined.

LECTURE SIX
The Third Gate
There isn’t a woman born who doesn’t have the quality in her to try to save a male,
to bring them out of their immaturity. Nothing is more immature than a male. Most
males are boys until they’re at least 40. That immaturity is something that is part
and parcel of being a mutation out of a much more mature form.
The Middle Binary
Anyway, the continuity carries through the lines. Let’s change binary; let’s go to the
middle binary. Remember again, when we were looking here at the bottom binary
we were looking at the influence of the quarter, the Quarter of Initiation. This is the
deep initiation of a whole process that is experienced not simply through all 16 gates
of the quarter, but in fact the crosses that they are a part of which literally covers
the wheel. In other words, this is not something that is individualized, it is highly
generalized. What you gather from this or what I gather from this is certain basic
racial and long historical bloodlines that emerge out of, in essence, the way in which
this will be translated through the quarters themselves.
But when you’re looking at the quarter information, you’re looking at an imprint that
is very, very broad, in that sense. In other words, this is the universal principle, the
universal principle that mutation is only possible through the ordering of inheritance
through synthesis which means the
demand for bonding, and that the
potential for bonding is established by
creating the male out of the female with
the enduring dilemma that the male is
always more immature and all the
consequences that come with that.
In other words, the potential that we see
in any 2nd line in which there is always
this potential for them to fulfill whatever
happens to be their particular purpose
and function in this life. Yet, at the same
time, not necessarily that that’s what it’s
about.
If we go to the center, understand that
this is an aspect of a quarter. Every
quarter has 16 gates, so every 4 gates is represented by the shifting of the binary
chop. And here you can see that it is strongly yin, these two yin lines, the 3rd line
and the 4th line. When we look at this we see that this grandparental. It’s one of
those old jokes, grandparents and grandchildren love each other because they have
an enemy in common. This is bypassing information, this is grandparental
information.

RAVE ANATOMY I

And you can see that the very foundation of this is the survival of the species is
dependent on the maintaining of the female sex mutation. In other words, this
keeps the balance. By the way, the balance is generally, other than in places in
certain parts of Asia where females are aborted or killed at birth, unfortunately in
enormous numbers, generally speaking there are more females born than males.
Statistically it is a slight advantage.
The 3rd Line: Survival
But this is about the very survival of the species, because the very survival of the
species is dependent on the fertility of the female. The fertility of the female is much
more important than the fertility of the male. The fertility of the female is of
enormous importance and this is the most material of all lines. To understand for
example the foundation of my teaching of what the 3rd line is about, the orientation
of the 3rd line to its trial and error, its vitality in the face of having things bang into
it. It’s tenacity at being able to deal with the trial and error of being on this plane.
But you can see that the underlying theme is a survival theme, how profound that
survival is. And you never want to deal with a threatened female. The power for
survival in the female is much more than it is in the male because they carry the
potential survival of the continuation of the species. They never, in that sense,
whether they have children or not, they never just will defend themselves, they
defend the future of their species. So they have a survival mechanism in them that
is deeply, deeply profound.
Because I don’t know how many of these details I’ll be able to discuss, you can see
this theme of fertility, how important that is. This is the underlying story in that
sense about the 3rd line, this absolute need to survive and out of that you get in the
3rd line continuity you get this tremendous drive to keep on dealing with things,
banging into things. But you also get the martyr. You also get a life of suffering.
You get a lot of things that come with the baggage of this survival mechanism. It
means that the material becomes essential. Without the material there is no way
that the female can be ready to be able to reproduce because there will be no
security for the offspring and survival is the theme.
It’s also interesting to note that in the 59th gate the 3rd line is the most promiscuous.
And promiscuous only in the sense that it will shatter traditional bonding lines. In
other words, the white northern European that goes for a vacation in the tropics and
ends up after a one-night stand being impregnated with what turns out to be rather
an interesting bloodline mix. This is one of the themes that is there.
Remember that survival isn’t simply a matter of just a resource in terms of the
support resources for survival, but survival also has to do with the quality of the
genetic material. Females are deeply, deeply more selective than males. They
simply are. They have a different criteria that is necessary in any potential partner.
It’s very different from the male psyche. You can see that the whole male thing is
very generalized. It’s the chop of the quarter, it points simply to a necessity.

The Third Gate
I’m a great male apostate; I serve the Mother. It is just so obvious that the male
was just something necessary for the equation to be able to work out. And of
course, that is not something that is not an equal in that sense. So, in that sense
there is always a struggle. There is always this profound struggle that exists
between the male and the female. And of course, because the game is the bonding
game, the survival for the female ends up with this dilemma in terms of how to deal
with the male.
The 4th Line: Charisma
It’s fun doing this, I get to think about all kinds of things while I’m rattling along.
It’s very interesting, if I say so myself. Anyway, the 4th line, the line of charisma.
It’s interesting, this karmic inheritance. You can see if you look at the grandparental
4th line theme you can see that literally it derives from the ancestors. It isn’t even
necessarily grandparental.
It’s one of the things that perhaps is so interesting about the power of the 4 to
influence those it knows. It carries unusual aspects. And it carries unusual aspects
that in a sense contain much older information after all. The genetic material, what
we inherit carries with it a certain amount of information. It does. We know that
within the context of Human Design and we look to the body as the life because
that’s precisely what it is. This form is what dictates the nature of the life.
The information of our parents, our grandparents, our ancestors, deeper recessive
genes, that information within us is information that is significant, let’s put it that
way. It brings the unusualness out. When I think about the program and family, my
link isn’t to the 20 and the 21st century perception, because I think it’s very
distorted. I look first to the WA; that is, the trans-auric entity that is made up of
three pentas and an alpha. This was the original family. And if you bring five of
these together you get the basis of a gene pool.
This information that is coming from further back from the ancestors, as an example,
that this gives in essence the power ultimately in 4th lines to be able to externalize,
to be able to have a quality of familiarity that’s different. One of the things about
that is, the further back you go with an ancestor gene, the more chance there is that
it has a relationship to more people in the world. It seems obvious, right? If you’re
carrying the genetic information that is six generations old, that similar information
has penetrated through six generations and the way in which they develop, and so
forth and so on. In other words, there is this huge movement of information.
Those begins that carry this ancestor, they are the ones that were able to emerge
when we had these vast families—the WA—when two people had 15 children, or
whatever. My father was one of 16 of which 11 or 12 survived. There were huge
families. And it is only through this straining of the genetic possibility—after all it’s a
constant shuffling of the genetic recombination—that in these vast families this is

where you got these unusual strains that began to emerge rather than dominant
strains.
And of course, the ancestor is one of them, and it carries with it a kind of extended
chemical network that ultimately carries in the 4th line in its continuity this power to
be able to befriend, network, and create extended lines. In other words, it’s like
they’re already networked genetically, in a sense, because they go back further, so
when it gets externalized they can extend the network outwards. In other words,
the power of a 4 is its network which is rooted in generational function.
What I mean is you make friends with somebody who is a 4. They introduce you to
their friends, second generation. That friend introduces you to another friend, third
generation. They all become part of your network. They are different generations.
And the ability to be able to maintain the relationship the further the generations are
is a gift in the 4. This is how they maintain their network. This is their charisma.
It’s hidden underneath in the genetic mystery of what the 3rd gate, 4th line brings.
It’s a lovely little story.
The 5th Line: Victimization
When we get to the 5-6 we get to the Father. These themes, for example the 5th line,
to understand the 5th line is to understand paranoia. This is one of its most
dominant themes. That is, what does the other want from it, why is there this
projection and are they aware of it, are they ready to deal with it and can they, and
so forth and so on.
It is this theme underneath, because one doesn’t normally associate the 5th line,
which is exalted, with such a theme as we find here keynoted as victimization. Yet,
it is something to grasp about dysfunction in the not-self. That 5s, whether they be
3/5s, which in fact have a more difficult time, or whether they are 5/1’s or 5/2’s that
there is an enormous psychological dysfunction in them as a population. That
dysfunction arises from being a disappointment to others and being victimized as a
result of it. In other words, the 5 that is projected on that they can be trusted, and
in fact they cannot. And it’s not their fault, but nonetheless, they pay the price
because the moment that it’s discovered they cannot be trusted, oh, boy does
everybody turn against them.
And what is so interesting here, you see this—I love the symmetry in all these
things. You see it so beautifully here in this movement in harmony from the 2 to the
5 where you have this male sex mutation. And then you get to its harmony and
what you get is this yin recessive and it’s this yin recessive—again it’s a recessive
gene and it’s this yin recessive that is coming in there that is going to create that
dilemma. What is a heretic? The heretic is totally absorbed in trying to change the
form. That’s what heretics do, that’s what heretics have always done.
The power to do so is from the yin recessive. The victimization is the Father. This is
one of the most difficult lines if you’re male, like I am who’s a 5/1, your relationship
with your father can always be something that is really a trip, because there is this

The Third Gate
projection on you, you have to deal with the projection. If you fail the projection,
boy are you ever punished. You’re made a victim, in that sense.
You can see that if you look at
it in terms of it thematically
you can see that what these
recessives bring is inherently
vulnerable. That’s why the 5
is paranoid. It is vulnerable. I
can only tolerate certain
people for certain amounts of
time. It is just the way that it
is. Part of being a 5 is a
certain vulnerability; the
vulnerability is having to deal
with the ongoing projection,
having to fit into somebody
else’s projection, which once
you operate as yourself is
impossible.
So there is this inherent
vulnerability. And the not-self
5s suffer deeply from this, this
sense of vulnerability because
in fact they are placed under pressure to be able to perform in a way they may not
be able to perform. It also is an underlying key to understanding the practicality of
5; again, the yin quality here to deal with things that within the form principle are
reliable, because this is the only thing that can assuage that kind of projection.
The 6th Line: Surrender
When you get to the 6, I think the 6, as always, is both mystery and exciting. We
know that we have a dilemma within the context of the 6th line as it operates in this
transitional BodyGraph, this rave BodyGraph that we are living in a time of deep
mutation, so obviously, this whole theme of mutation is something that is important
to grasp.
In this mutation the 6th line represents transition. But it represents transition to
something that has to be understood. To understand the 6th line you need to
understand selfishness as a theme. The 55.6 is its expression. And of course, the
55.6 is where the great mutation in 2027 is going to take hold. The role model is
always seen from the perspective of those who want one. The role model is always
something that is seen from the outside, and the label is attached from the outside.
And it is the process of the 6th line being to go through two stages of that. That is,
the observer/observed; to be both artificially involved, the 3rd line phase of the first
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

91
RAVE ANATOMY I

28, 29 years, and then to be artificially aloof, that is, the roof stage. All of that leads
to this coming off the roof which is really about becoming yourself, not becoming the
effect of this and that on you. And becoming yourself and not being the effect of this
and that on you requires that you are totally absorbed in that sense in your own
unity, in your oneness, in your selfness.
The understanding of the 6 is something that is understood through Human Design.
There is no other understanding in that sense for this value, and in understanding
that this is the mutative transformation that the transformation is the transition to
the establishment of unique authority. As a heretic, as a 5th line being I represent
what is the past, or at least the soon-to-be emerging past. That is, the work of
trying to seduce and coerce the homogenized into becoming abnormal.
It is a heretical role, this role of trying to transform the form of the stranger. But the
6 isn’t about that, and that’s the future. The future isn’t about wolves and sheep.
It’s about the absence of wolves and sheep; they’re no longer the point. What you
will need to know in life if you do not know it yourself you’re going to have problems.
Here is the harmony to the deep theme of survival, the survival of the species, this
deep, deep theme that is there.
This is its harmony. And its harmony is this personal survival, this complete
surrender to the personal survival. It does not mean the other is not there. It does
not mean that one cannot interact with them. You can see them coming. But this is
a pure yang mutation. The yin establishes the potential of the bond. It is the yang
in its harmony to the 3 that goes beyond it, doesn’t break it, it goes beyond it.
The Ending of Fertility
Of course, it says something about the ending of fertility, one of the themes I talk
about in terms of the transition in 2027, what happens to us when the exact opposite
of the 55.6 which is the 59.6, what happens to that in that moment of transition and
the beginning of mutation of the rave. What we have is a diminishing of the fertility
potential that is going to be in humanity.
Of course, everything about the potential of reproduction, its root is here in this 3rd
gate in its expression. And that this is another point. This is the ending, in that
sense, of the bonding system. Now, it doesn’t mean it isn’t going to end and it
certainly doesn’t mean it’s going to end in this round, it is not. But it’s never going
to exist again, this bonding, not in this way. Those numbers are no longer
important.
You can see the basic struggle of the form principle, the basic struggle of the form
principle is that first you have to be able to handle the duality, because the duality is
the source of the life force. So you have to find a way to create a solution in duality.
The solution that it creates is the artificial singularity, the child that is born of the
male and the female, this singularity that emerges out of this duality to become a
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

92
LECTURE SIX
The Third Gate
duality to create a singularity to become a duality—that’s the movie. This is the
chain of life as we know it.
And yet, that is not the future. The rave is the future. That is, the penta is it. All
life is rooted in the penta. And for all of the cognitive existence that we have had so
far that the penta has been inaccessible to our self-reflected consciousness. We do
not have the ability. I know better than anyone else, I have been working with it
consistently now for seven years, I have deeply looked at penta. I live in a penta. I
watch the penta movie all the time. And though I understand its impact, and can
recognize it at work, I cannot sense the thing itself. I cannot, because it is not in me
genetically to have such a possibility.
That’s a possibility that is going to emerge in the rave. But our dilemma, our
process through synthesis we create singularities that create synthesis that create
singularities in this ongoing movie, that all of that is rooted in identification with self,
because it’s the only way it can work. You look at the BodyGraph and you look at
human beings and you see very clearly that everything about their potential is about
to fulfill their selfhood, to fulfill their purpose, all of these things. We are oriented to
self.
The fact of the matter is that Human Design teaches, and I radically teach, that we
are here to establish our unique authority which means we are not here to be
subservient to any other authority. And that means that we establish our identity as
the only identity, the only true identity. But this is not the future. The future isn’t
about bonding. It isn’t about the genetic manipulation of the difference in gender
and openness.
The Raves
As a matter of fact, the way in which raves ultimately, and this is not something that
I can even know because it’s not what I was given. I was given that the true rave
which would have been an 11-centered being will not emerge, that all we get is this
transitional BodyGraph until the end of the round and the coexistence of what is both
human and what is rave. So we will never see true rave reproduction. And they will
not bond reproductively, at least not in our understanding of it. And they will not be
self, they will be non-self, they will be a-self, because the only expression of identity
would be the expression of identity that one gets from the penta because they
genetically will be connected to it.
And herein lies my point, which is that here in the 6th line carries this rave genetic
material. It is the total opposite of personal survival. It is not personal survival for
the sake of the species. It is personal survival as surrender, period, nothing else.
It’s very different. And here carries in every 6th line the potential of the rave, not the
human. Here it is.
So, it’s interesting to think about when you’re looking at the 6th line theme, the 6th
line profiles, to really grasp what is there, that here is the genetic information that
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

93
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
leads the way towards the arrival of the rave. And that it is clear that these 6th lines
are going to be very significant in the makeup of what is going to be the parents of
raves that will be born after 2027. It is evidence of the existence of the mutation in
their system.
Relationship Dilemma between the Male and Female
Archetypes
One last thing, and obviously there is so much that one can discuss with all of this.
I’m sure that you’re going to enjoy just contemplating it. But it’s this one that’s
really so interesting. This is the thing to understand about this whole dilemma of the
relationship between the male and the female archetypes. This is the yin that
creates this maleness. In a sense, they suffer for it. I guess it’s something to really
see. It also is a way of understanding why there is this deep insecurity in males and
their relationship with the female principle.
It begins with the fact that they came out of a female. I don’t think that any male
ever shakes that. I don’t think you can. We are not carriers of life. We are seed
carriers, but we are not carriers of life. We do not have that relationship. There is a
deep insecurity that comes with this being a mutation and being immature in that
sense.
The Powerful Mutation
So when you see it as it progresses, when you finally get to the 6th line, I want you
to think about 6/2’s in this context and to really understand how powerful this
mutation is to develop this selfish role model, this perfected role model. Literally all
that means is somebody that—I make it sound like it’s ordinary—is correct in their
Strategy and Authority, and someone who no longer makes decisions with their
mind.
If you’re a 6th line being in terms of profile and that’s the world that you live in, then
you’re going to see the obvious correctness of it. That is, it is not the detachment of
the aloofness of the roof. It is not the involvement of the 3rd line stage. It is simply
surrender to finally finding one’s maturity, because that’s really what it is. The yang
can only fulfill its maturity in aloneness. And of course, as long as it’s in the
construct of being human, it cannot have that. But as a rave, or at least
archetypally as a rave it can. So it’s a very interesting theme to look at.
The 3rd gate, this Difficulty at the Beginning, a great name isn’t it? What a thing to
be able to be the source and the ordering agent of all of that. And to understand
what kind of pressure it deals with in the sense of what it is open to itself; whenever
you look at it now you can see it very differently.

LECTURE SIX
The Third Gate
Look at the Lines in Your Design
But one of the things that I suggest to you from what you can glean from today is
that you take this little mapping here that I’ve encircled and you begin to think about
lines in your design in this context. It is really an interesting exercise. Again,
deconstruction is a very dangerous thing. It is dangerous to break things down to
their base values and there is always the risk of trying to extrapolate that into a
huge story. It’s very important with all the knowledge that you receive in detail in
Human Design that you try to see it in a synthetic perspective because in fact it’s the
only way to see it.
But what is interesting to recognize is that because you are going to carry variations
of all of these lines, and not everybody has every line, but most people have a
selection, that you’ll be able to see certain themes arise, certain themes that are
arising out of that quality that you can begin to sense in the way it operates through
you, through your particular line, through your particular gate. And it adds another
dimension to the richness of what you can bring to the understanding of a line.
Read All the 1st Lines
If you’ve never done it, then try it one time, just read only all the 1st lines, nothing
else, just read them all. Or just read all the 2nd lines, whatever it happens to be,
whatever your profile is, as an example, and begin to get a sense of what connects
them. And then look at your line itself and begin to understand that in the continuity
to one degree or another it carries all the information of those lines. We are a
holistic illusion. And in that continuity aspects of that are there.
Here we’re looking at something very profound and something that is very, very
deep in us. It is the foundation of how we are aligned in our form principle and how
we have been outlined, or imprinted by the contribution of our parents and our
grandparents and beyond.
It’s fascinating to take it into your mix of your understanding of the genetic
continuity. Enjoy putting the numbers together. When you’ve looked at all the 1st
lines in this context, look at the 1st colors and then look at the 1st tones and begin to
see the magic that is there in these frequencies, that we can see at different levels
and how they progress and merge and become ultimately a construct that you can
taste literally as an understanding. I hope, in that sense, rather than the obscure
parts that are here that will take many, many years and different people to
investigate that you take the essential ingredient of the continuity and you begin to
integrate that into your understanding, I think it will enrich your process. Anyway, I
did enjoy that, I always love doing things the first time, glad you were a part of it.
Do take care and until next time.

The Gates of Gender Differentiation
Well, good morning. We come to one of those delicious places in Rave Anatomy, one
of those subjects that has never really, really been looked at, because in fact it
doesn’t make much of a difference. But of course, in the illusion and on the surface
it certainly does. I can remember my experience when I first began introducing
Human Design and there were these questions that would arise every once in awhile,
it didn’t happen very often, but they were there, what’s the difference between a
man and a woman.
My response to that is that in terms of mechanics, in essence there is no difference.
There are obviously the differences that appear in the illusion, but in terms of
analysis, for example, when you’re talking about a specific channel and the way the
channel works, or the gate works or the line works or the profile works or whatever
the case may be, as we have all discovered it doesn’t matter whether you are
looking at a male chart, a female chart, a kid’s chart, an adult’s chart, a dead chart,
it doesn’t really make any difference. Mechanics is mechanics.
However, it is obvious in the illusion that there are differences. Not simply
differences in the sense that male and female appear different in terms of their basic
biology that there are obvious differences to them. But there are other things.
There are things that have been charted over the years, scientifically investigated,
differences between inner intelligence, outer intelligence, introvert, extrovert, all of
these various ways of looking at comparisons that have been done forever between
male and female.
For me the gender differentiation gates are fascinating at many, many different
levels. Not so much in terms of what I am going to share with you today, because
what I am going to share with you is what’s possible, that is, give you a sort of
outline of it and take a look at it. For me the values and the interest is deeper. That
is, it all originates with exactly the same chemistry. I think that’s what’s most
fascinating. So, as they say, without further ado, let’s take a look.
Leucin
First thing that I really want you to pay attention to is that we are talking about one
chemistry and one chemistry only. So it is something that is very, very specific. It
is the codon that is known as Leucin, it is very, very complex. There are only two
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

97
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
codons that have six different gates that are a part of their chemical structure. For
those of you that take Quarter by Quarter with me you may or may not remember or
recognize that this Leucin is the 8th face and this is the face of Janus, the two-headed
God.
Basically what we’re looking at here is the foundation for what will emerge as, in the
illusion, the differentiation between the male and the female. There are also some
practical things to keep in mind about this. The fact that you may not have any of
these gates does not mean anything, because this is not what this is about. It
operates at a much greater level. In other words, we all have receptors to Leucin;
we could not survive without it. It’s like any of the other codons in the mix. If you
don’t have it specifically, you have been conditioned by it, in that sense, not simply
in your life, but in your pre-life, in the womb. All of this is a part of an ongoing
programming mechanism in terms of the chemistry.
The other thing is what Quarter by Quarter students learn is that this particular face,
this grouping, this codon represents a deep personality programming. In other
words, the differentiation between male and female is something that is deeply
imprinted into our consciousness and imprinted in our consciousness through the
work of these gates.
In terms of the practicality of the gates you cannot look at these gates without
looking at their harmonics. In other words, you cannot look at these gates without
looking at the gates that are at the other end. In other words, you begin to see a
construct in which a great many things, in essence, are clearly conditioned by this
basic differentiation. And you can see from the ordering of the gates, that is, the
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

98
LECTURE SEVEN
The Gates of Gender Differentiation
ordering that I have at the top, that what you can see is that we have in essence six
different primary foundations for this differentiation between the male and the
female.
The 3rd Gate
Of course, the only place we can begin, obviously, is we need to begin with the 3rd
gate. We saw last week in looking at the uniqueness of the 3rd gate, its
responsibility for being in charge of the way in which the whole genetic process
operates in terms of what we inherit from parents,
grandparents, and ancestors. It is responsible for the actual
determination of gender. And as the source of the
determination of gender, you can see here that it’s listed as
differentiation at source.
What I mean by that or what is meant by this is that this is
physical differentiation. In other words, this is the basic
physical difference between the male and the female, and it
obviously is an obvious differentiation. That is, this is the
physical evidence of difference. It’s what you look at the
moment a baby comes out of the womb, or when you get a kitten, it’s one of those
things you check to see because you check the obvious, that is, the biological
difference.
So what you’re looking at here in the 3rd gate is a differentiation that in essence
doesn’t need much interpretation. In other words, we’re going back to the womb
and we’re going back into that process through the agency of the 3rd gate; again it
doesn’t have to be present. We all have receptors. It is the 3rd gate that in that
process will determine biologically whether or not the shell, because it’s a shell—I
have to be very honest with you. None of this was ever interesting to me, truly, it
was never very interesting to me because in fact the fact that there is this
differentiation within the shell itself, doesn’t mean anything about being able to help
somebody to find the well-being in their life, to be able to operate correctly, to find
their inner authority, to awaken the mind. It has nothing to do with any of that.
It has nothing to do with being correct. It has nothing to do with being conditioned.
In other words, it is a shell game. It is just interesting from the point of view of the
shell game because obviously we are all caught up in the duality dynamic. It’s
interesting from this point of view to see where, in fact, we are differentiated in
terms of the illusion. That’s all.
Again, it’s why in the intervening years—I laid down this information when I first
began my career—I have never taught this at any level. I don’t think it’s ever been
included in any publication other than the original Rave Anatomy. So, I added this to
this program because I think it’s an interesting curiosity and it’s something to look at
in a sense of just having a broader understanding of the illusion.

The 42nd Gate
So when we start with the 3rd gate we start with this
source. In other words, we start with the obvious of the
physical, of the very physical difference. Let’s get to the
more interesting ones, because that is such an obvious.
Let’s go here to the 42nd gate. This is one that I
particularly find interesting. You do a population
mortality survey—insurance companies that provide life
insurance do incredible research into potential longevity.
After all, they gamble, they make money based on how
long people live. It really doesn’t matter where you look.
In the vast majority of societies women live longer than
men. Now, there are enormous amounts of material
explaining this, or trying to. It has been going on for a
very long time. That is, if you go right now to any place
in Europe or in North America and you look at the
statistics you will see that women live longer than men. So there is a difference in
our cycles. And of course, that difference in the cycles, the 42nd gate is a fascinating
gate. All the format energies are interesting and obviously here in these gates of
differentiation we have two format gates of the Sacral. Again, we’re looking at three
gates in the Sacral that are a part of this and very, very powerful in the sense of
understanding that it’s part of the basic life force, the basic generative life force of
the planet.
Powerful Forces of Differentiation
In essence when we’re looking at the first three, because there is a real difference
between the first three and the second three, when we’re looking at these first three
and we’re looking at these Sacral gates, in fact what we’re looking at are the most
powerful forces of differentiation. They are very, very powerful forces of
differentiation. They, in the shell, when we look in the shell we see the distinct
difference. The fact that the female lives longer than the male, if you look at what
the 42nd gate is about, the 42nd gate is about the completion process. It is about
being able to bring things to fruition so one cycle can end and a new cycle can begin.
There’s something fascinating about the process of the female cycle. If the program
intends for the female to survive longer than the male, and it is obvious that it does,
then there are different responsibilities within the context of the cycle. In other
words, it is clear to me for example that the wisdom of the grandmother who tends
to survive longer than the grandfather carries a great deal of cultural and
generational weight. In other words, the whole responsibility for the success of
humanity is about the ability to be able to maintain and carry on the civilizing
process that allows for the creation of life and its maintenance and its well-being and
its continuation.

LECTURE SEVEN
The Gates of Gender Differentiation
Something else you need to note here as well in terms of looking at this
configuration you can see that there is a marker here and that marker separates
what is the Quarter of Initiation from the Quarter of Civilization. In other words, that
on one side we have this, in essence, the incarnating yang spirit and here we have
this civilizing yin form. It’s important to see that these two, in that sense, both sides
of this barrier, this Janus face that deals with this, that these differentiations serve a
larger purpose within the program.
The maintenance and security of life in the program is something that is handed over
to the female. They are given, literally, the responsibility. And it’s interesting to
note that the female in its process never gets free time. Maybe, that’s not the best
way of putting it. That is, the male is much more quickly used up, I guess is the
best way to say that. In other words, for the yang the cycle is often longer than it
wants it to be. That is, the yang power diminishes long before the yin power
diminishes.
The other thing is that the yin has always been the key to the continuity of the
family. So for the program the survival of the yin beyond the yang turns out to be
an advantage. The thing about the 42nd gate is if you have a 42nd gate and you don’t
have a 53rd gate, it’s hard to let go of anything. It’s very difficult to bring things to
an end. It is something to think about in that for the male and the female how they
handle the cycle of life is different. That’s important psychologically.
In other words, how they are going to experience the life cycle, how they are going
to experience their old age, as an example, is going to be very different. There is
going to be less discomfort in the end in terms of the spirit of the yin than for the
yang. It’s quite a deep subject to get into, but nonetheless it’s the beginning of sort
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
of putting a label on it. It’s really something to understand that we are different in
the way in which we go through our cycle of life and our approach to the cycle of life.
The next differentiation that is there within the Sacral Center, I guess in a sense is
one that we could naturally assume, in the same way we can see that there is an
obvious difference that is rooted in the 3 differentiation, the biological differentiation
between the male and the female, where the 42 is much more subtle because I can’t
really describe it because the fact is that we don’t have a true reflection of the way in
which the male and female ideally go through their process. We don’t, we just have
the not-self homogenized version of it. And in that sense it’s very difficult to point to
what is the true difference, because I think there is a hidden difference in all of that
that has yet to reveal itself.
The 27th Gate
Again, I think it goes back to the traditional understanding of the power of the crone.
That is, the final stage of the female journey. I think that the wisdom of the crone is
something that is deeply missing on this plane. The true outer authority of the yin
consciousness, that differentiation is very subtle where the 3 is very obvious and so
is the 27, this differentiation in caring. It is an obvious to see there is a
differentiation in the way in which the male and the female nurture.
Again, if we try to deconstruct that, the thing that impresses me most about the 27th
gate is that you have to see it as a gate of deep drive. It means that that drive is all
pointed towards the nurturing and the well-being of the tribe. It is often personal in
the sense of the nurturing and well-being of one’s children. And certainly in the way
that through the 27th gate we can see,
because it is the gate of the love of the
father and mother that we can see the
differentiation in the way in which they
are driven to provide that nurturing.
Obviously, when we go and combine the
27 with the 3 remember that the biology
is going to bring the basic difference
between, for example just the obvious
of let’s say muscle development where
there is going to be the reproductive requirements in the biology for the female
which is not required in the male, the male is going to be given other physical
attributes. In the end what that looked like from the earliest emergence of hominids
and early humans was that the males were going out and using their muscles and
the females were reproducing and providing the nurturing. We end up with this
very, very deep conditioning of the way in which we fulfill the potential of our
responsibilities and I think that’s the interesting thing that is here.
Again, as I mentioned at the very beginning it’s very difficult to look at these gates
and isolate them, because again I’m just deconstructing for you, to isolate them

The Gates of Gender Differentiation
from what is their relationship in the illusion to the other side of the channel,
because again we are looking at the mask here, we are looking at the differences
that are there in the illusion when it emerges. It is clear that these two variations of
caring, the way in which the male cares and the way in which the female cares that’s
rooted here in this 27 has a deep impact in the way in which we live out our roles.
I was asked earlier in the question period about role gates and I was talking about
the role gates of the self, which is the 1, 10, 7 and 13 and the genetic role gates—
that is, the 59 and the 27. So here we’re dealing not just simply with a gate of
gender differentiation, but this is a gate of a role imperative. In other words, this is
a gate of the differentiation, the gender differentiation in the way in which one lives
out one’s role. Again, within the genetic continuity of the whole, the way in which
the role of the being is lived out.
So, it has a great impact, as a matter of fact, it has an overwhelming impact and it’s
created one of the great distortions in the tensions that exist between the male and
the female. We cannot escape this programming, this very, very early
programming, after all. It goes back to the very, very basis of the way in which the
human community was able to develop a system of survival. And you can see that
because it’s generative and because it’s a role gate, it has a deep, deep impact. So,
for example, with women’s liberation as it was arising out of the counterculture
movements of the 60s the equal pay for equal work and all of these various things
that have arisen, there has been an enormous amount of resistance to them. And
that resistance is something interesting to watch. That is, it is not intellectual. It is
visceral and physical. And the great harp against women that work is that they don’t
fulfill their caring role as the nurturing mother.
There was this wonderful cartoon in the Spanish newspaper the other day. There
was this couple sitting on the beach and the line underneath was: we used to have
children to insure our retirement, and now we don’t. And there is this couple without
any kids very happy sitting on the beach. It is something to understand that there is
this enormous stress that is involved in the impact of this gate.
Now, obviously, we’re talking about approximately 500 million people in the world
who are living in advantaged democratic societies where such a thing is emerging;
that’s 500 million people. That’s, by the way, all the people that are living in
successful democracies on this planet right now. We have 7 billion. The 27th gate
has more to do with the subjugation of the female than just about anything you can
point your finger at. And not simply because it orients the female towards its
nurturing function, but it orients the male towards its dominant function. And of
course, this has led to the deep subjugation of the female and there is nothing,
unfortunately, that one can do about that in terms of the larger homogenized field
because in fact this is in our genes. This is what you get on the surface. This is a
genetic imperative. There is no escaping it. It doesn’t matter whether you have it or
not, there’s absolutely no escaping it. So we end up, in a sense, being railroaded
into these very, very specific sexually oriented roles, that is, gender oriented roles,
when in fact most of it is a myth; but then again, what to do.

This is the power of the chemistry. Remember there is only differentiation for one
reason. This is the only way to be able to establish a system in which cloning is not
the reproductive way because cloning is death. That is, ultimate death and sterility.
In other words, females simply spontaneously reproducing; virgin births. Of course,
we know that frankly every female potentially, theoretically, has the potential to
reproduce, magically. It’s like this shark they had in captivity in some zoo
somewhere, some female all alone reproduced. We do have examples of this.
But it is a flawed process. It is not successful. And it is not successful because the
traits of the mother become the absolute traits of the offspring. In order for us to
have a mutative evolutionary biology it was essential for us to have a polarity, a
duality. It is out of this duality that we constantly produce through the quantum of
this duality something new. Of course, this is the whole program.
So when you see a genetic role gate like this, that is a gate of the differentiation in
caring, you can extrapolate that outwards into basically a description of the limitation
of what it is to be male and female, a deep limitation, one that is locked to this old,
very old biological distinction and that one that we cannot do without, after all. You
can’t take it out, you can’t remove it. It’s there.
The 27th Gate in Relationship to the 50th Gate
Again, to see it in relationship to the 50th gate because the 50th gate is very special,
that is, it is the source of what we call intelligence, the streams of the Spleen. That
is, the judgmentation, intuition, instinct, all of this is sourced out of the 50th gate.
But we well know that the Spleen is a motor. In
other words, in order for the potential of intelligence
to emerge in the life its natural source is that 27th
gate. Then we end up with something entirely
different, we end up with something that says that
the way in which the intelligence of the male and the
intelligence of the female is going to develop is going
to be different because it is going to be nurtured
differently. And that the responsibilities of the male and the responsibilities of
female in terms of the development of their intelligence is going to differ.
Why do you think we live in a world in which there are hundreds of millions of girls
that will never receive an education? That is, not the education that the male will
receive, not the education that will permit the male to use its brain muscles to be
able to help deal with the outside world, oh no. You don’t need to learn all of that,
you need to learn how to collect firewood, you need to learn how to cook, clean,
raise the children.
So there is built into this not just simply the limitation on the female that it must
accept its biological role and nurture the way in which its biological role demands,
but it also has to accept that it has no right to the larger world and the education

The Gates of Gender Differentiation
necessary for dealing with it because it is not its domain. I know to any modern
women raised amongst those 500 million all of that is deeply offensive as a concept.
The Potential of a Human Lies in the Mechanics Underneath
Because the moment you begin to really develop your own consciousness you also
begin to see something what I have always seen which is why none of this has been
particularly important to me, is the potential of a human being has nothing to do
with the illusion. It doesn’t have to do with the mask on the surface. The potential
of a human being lies in the mechanics underneath, lies in their potential to simply
operate correctly. And in operating correctly if you have the 27th gate or not how
you are going to care, the way in which you are going to care, who you are going to
care with is not a matter that is controlled by the genetics. It isn’t.
It’s not controlled by the illusion on the surface; it is controlled by a cognition that
lies underneath that has no direct connection to the surface—tone. At the tonal level
we are all cognitives. We are all equal in that sense because we are all equal in that
we are all potentially unique. And in uniqueness gender doesn’t make any difference
whatsoever. But as long as we are in these forms and as long as we are in the world
of the not-self then we are in a conditioning field that these roles are never truly
going to be altered, and they won’t and they’re not being altered.
Despite the relative transformation in terms of respect for womankind that has
arisen in these democratic environments over the last 50 years, 50 years doesn’t
mean very much. Isn’t there still a canton in Switzerland where women can’t vote?
This is nothing, 50 years, it doesn’t mean anything. It is a particular enlightened
moment in that context that is struggling, literally, against the power of this 27th
gate.
If you take these three Sacral gates together, the differentiation here is
overwhelming, it really is because it’s the life force, it’s the generative force, and it
envelops every living being on the planet, it is dense within us. We are constantly
held within it. The moment that we are overwhelmed by the conditioning of these
differentiation gates we lose perspective. We stop seeing. We see the surface and
we don’t see the potential underneath.
One of the things that I have so enjoyed about my career is that when a chart was
put down in front of me it made no difference to me what the package looked like
that was sitting beside me because the package isn’t the story. It’s not. It’s the
same thing with race and all of these things. This is just the program at work. This
is just the way in which the construct is built. This is the way in which we are
manipulated within that construct.
And obviously, if you are not-self and if you are not fortunate enough to live in one
of those places on this planet where you have the privilege of food and shelter and
education and security, then these forces are so powerful. You are marked at birth.
And you are marked at birth by your gender and there is absolutely nothing you can

do about it. It is horrific what is going on in India and China with the butchering of
unborn girls.
Ninety-eight or ninety-seven percent of all abortions in that part of the world are the
abortion of a female fetus. That’s how deep this malaise is that arises out of these
themes of differentiation. Yes, there is no question that the vehicles are different.
It’s obvious to all of us, isn’t it? Yet, at the same time it is so clear that the point is
not the surface; never has been, never can be. Anyway, let me continue my little
journey here.
The Driving Force and the Only Motor
In this grouping we have one gate in the Ajna and we have two gates in the Throat
Center, this basic divide here between what is, in fact, the driving force and the only
motor. So again, when you’re thinking about the dilemmas of male/female as we
understand them on the planet you can see the source in the Sacral Centers.
One of the things about—again, I don’t mean to digress, but it just brings it up, my
thing about Generators. I have been endlessly pointing out to Generators all the
years that I have been working that the responsibility for the way in which the world
works is theirs. They are the life force, they put out the frequency. And when you
get to see that these three gates which in so many ways determine the great
dilemmas of man and woman in this life that these are gates out of the Sacral. If
the Sacral is operating correctly, then there is going to be a difference in the way in
which this differentiation operates.
We’re already going to see that, because in fact as we move towards 2027 and we
enter into what will be a deep mutative phase, a mutative phase that is going to
change the form and it’s deeply going to impact our fertility that there are going to
be openings, if you will, to changes in the way in which differentiation can be
expressed.
The other thing is we are entering into an age in which the fertility of humanity is
something that is in decline, that the program is no longer concerned with the rigid
maintaining of this role cycle source system that has been the bedrock of being able
to create a viable evolutionary species. So there is less pressure here. One of the
things that happens as you become more correct is that what you’re interested in the
other is you’re interested in meeting them, if you know what I mean. You’re more
interested in the correctness of the relationship. It is not the surface that is
something that is going to define it. It just isn’t.
The 24th Gate
Anyway, digressions aside, first of all we need to look at the 24th gate. And the 24th
gate is one of these things where the way in which we think is different. And this is

LECTURE SEVEN
The Gates of Gender Differentiation
one of the things that has been well documented in terms of the not-self
homogenized world examining itself. And the differentiation in this rationalizing
which in fact is we’re looking at the potential of the thinker,
we’re looking at the gate of the return, the way in which the
mind processes, the return is going over things again and again
and again and the way in which the mind processes things is
different.
A lot of this has to do with understanding that because of the 3-
42-27 configuration, in other words, the establishment of the
unique vehicle and the unique cycle that the caring, which has
to do with the direction of the intellectual development that this
becomes totally different. In other words, that here in the 24
the by-product of that is that the female mind is working in one
direction and the male mind is working in another direction. So, we end up with
these concepts about the female and its inner capacity, the male with its external
viewing, all of this kind of stuff that is integrated in the way in which we look at that,
the dilemma of girls and mathematics, all these kinds of things that are inherent in
these kinds of discussions.
Something to grasp is that the mind is always distorted by the way in which it sees
itself. The not-self sees itself in a certain way which is incorrect. It sees itself
through its openness, through the conditioning and out of that it assumes what it can
be or should be or has to be. Again, out of the continuity of all of this what you end
up with are minds that operate in totally different ways, but operate in ways that are
recognizable as gender processes. Again, if you’re dealing with this shifting that has
taken place over the last 50, 60 years amongst half a billion people in democracies,
you can see that this is something that actually is the place where it can break down
quickest. That is, the differentiation.
The fact of the matter is that knowledge, the ability to be able to challenge any
knowledge base is obviously something that is a possibility whether one is male or
female. It has been restricted because of the impact of the 27th gate. The moment
you pulled away that restriction you began to get the display of thinking at the
female expression of thinking that rivaled the male. Yet, if you look at the history of
Nobel prizes in science other than the rare Madame Curie, you’re really not going to
find that many women. It is going to be deeply limited. It’s not because they’re not
intelligent, not because they don’t have revolutionary minds. We don’t talk about
Alberta Einstein, whatever.
The fact of the matter is the way the mind is used is distorted by the way in which
the intelligence is developed out of the 27 and its orientation. The moment you give
females the same educational privileges as males, they not only compete they can
be deeply superior because in fact they are much more responsible as beings than
males. And then it goes back to the 27 and it goes back to that if you’re going to
have to nourish a life you’re designed to be more responsible. So again, when we’re
looking at these differentiations particularly when you leave the Sacral power behind
you have to understand that the Sacral determines everything else. It determines
literally everything else.

The 23rd Gate
The 23 is interesting. The 23 is interesting because this is differentiation in
assimilating. In other words, the way in which bonds are established, the way in
which one finds a way to fit in. Remember this is an individual gate. It usually is
seen as a gate of explanation; in other words, the demand
that is there in individuality that one explains themselves.
And what you see here is a differentiation between the male
and the female in their ability to explain themselves to the
other. And oh boy, is that a big difference. Males are terrible
at that; whereas, females are superb at that.
Again, I’m generalizing. I’m generalizing out of what is this
basic construct that the moment that you’re operating out of
this Sacral imperative everything gets distorted in relationship
to it. So the fact that the very responsibilities, the very role that one has to
establish in life is locked so deeply to your gender, that all of the conditioning that
has emerged over the ages is just layered deeper and deeper on you. That’s why we
have such crisis in people that feel uncomfortable in their maleness or their
femaleness. It’s why we have such a revolution today in terms of the homosexual
movement.
A vast level of that is not about sex or sexual differentiation in that sense; it is a
rebellion against, in a sense, the way in which differentiation works. The most
profound victims of gender confusion are males. The yin male has a lot of problems
with their yinness, they just do. The fact is that again this is because it is emerging
in a time in which that kind of heresy, because it is a heresy to the biology, is even
possible. And it’s limited, because the fact is that if it weren’t for this little doorway
of sunshine where the wheel is turning and the fertility is closing down, and
producing more human beings is not such a big deal, that there is some space given
to this particular attitude in terms of the way in which the not-self looks at it.
But it’s clear to me that this is one of the great dilemmas of the way in which we are
conditioned through differentiation, that we get locked into these archetypes of “I’m
male and I have to be this way; I’m female and I have to be this way. And I can’t be
any other way.” The difficulty that women have faced at any attempt to step into
the male world whether it is at the head of corporations, in politics, in sport,
whatever the case may be there are just simply these barriers that are there. They
are constantly meeting the not-self biological resistance. It’s biological resistance.
It’s built into us, this genetic differentiation. You shall not be anything other than
what we demand of you as male and female. You’re Tarzan and she’s Jane. And
that’s it.
And of course, most of world, that’s exactly what it is. It’s hard to believe, isn’t it?
We get blasé about our way of life. Human beings—you’d think that the peace of the

The Gates of Gender Differentiation
last 50 years is going to last forever, in a sense. We get caught up in thinking that
everything is just so.
Look at the world. Look at what differentiation brings. It’s awful. One of my
deepest concerns for most of my adult life has been about the education of children
and particularly girls. If you don’t educate girls, you continue ignorance. They will
never educate their children. It’s a horror. The bright people on the planet know
these things. They know that there are hundreds and hundreds of millions of
children that are denied education because of gender prejudice.
And yes, every once in awhile there is an attempt to do this or that or provide this or
that which is minimal. And there are very, very few that actually participate in
programs relative to the percentage in their society. There are places where they
will allow their children to be educated if a foreigner will pay for it. They won’t pay
for it. It isn’t important to them. It is rare. I’ve seen all these things because I’ve
participated in programs like this. And you have one tiny little village where you
manage to give a chance to a half dozen or two dozen girls. But in the larger society
all of that is frowned upon. We live in a world in which gender differentiation has
limited our potential. The male dominance has led to a continuation of ignorance.
Endless ignorance and it binds in that sense the female to such a difficult role in this
life.
The 20th Gate
And the final joke, I guess it’s a sad joke, is how we end all this today with the 20th
gate. And of course, when you’re looking at the 20th gate
you have to see that you’re dealing with integration, you’re
dealing with an impact that is on the very basic survival of
us. And it’s the 20th gate. It is the expression of oneself in
the now. It is the differentiation in identification. I am a
male and I think differently from you, I assimilate
differently with others, I came out different. I have a
different role in this life and I am going to live my life in my
way, because it’s all locked together.
One codon, it’s just one codon—Leucin. It’s quite a thing.
And you end up with just about every form that you ever
will have to fill out for any municipality, regional
government, government, to get a driver’s license, to get
anything; the first thing on the form is: male or female. And that’s where it begins.
We are locked in this identification.
I’m not saying that it isn’t part of the movie; it is. There are aspects of being
biologically different that are delicious, we all know that. The movie is interesting.
But I do not identify in that way, in that sense, at least at the level of being a
witness. You can only be what you are first. You can’t be anything else. And then

after that comes all the accouterment. I’m a clarion that happens to have a male
body. It’s the way it is, it’s how it looks in the illusion.
My passenger has no body. My passenger has no sex. This is also obvious in the
mechanics. I am a visitor in a form. I have been female, I have been male. This is
just the incarnative movie. My personality is not male, it is not female. It doesn’t
operate at this level. My personality crystal is rooted in its tone. It is simply a
cognitive filter. And it so happens that in this life I am filtering inside of a male
form. That’s what it looks like in the illusion.
It’s only when you can step back from the conditioning of your mind, because you
have to see. These six gates are part of the whole conditioning matrix. And your
mind is absorbed with all of that. You see yourself in those terms, we all do. It is
the way the program works. But the moment that you step back from your mind, is
the moment that you give up your gender. You’re just a being, a sentient life form.
You’re watching this movie, because our potential as beings, the possibility for us to
transcend, to awaken, to live what is correct, has nothing to do with gender. That
who we are here to love has nothing to do with gender, nothing.
Breaking the Covenant
It’s something deeply to grasp. This is just a movie. And yes, we’re deeply
absorbed in our movies—not self, wow are they absorbed in the movie, are they
absorbed in their maleness, femaleness, all that stuff—from Botox to pornography,
males and females, play the movie. But it’s the movie, it’s the illusion, it’s the
conditioning. It’s the programming getting what it needs. For us, it is about
breaking the covenant, not just the covenant with the program, but the covenant
with the clichés of the program, to live from the place of passenger, to allow the
vehicle to have its life, this male or female vehicle, for it to go through its process,
and for it to go through its process on a line and trajectory that is correct, and for
the mind to stand back and watch; nothing else.
It’s the mind and the not-self that takes these differences and turns them into the
meat of their lives, that they live out the suffering from the perspective of this or
that, that they’re totally engrossed in it. That there is a barrier that is created that
cannot be crossed, they just can’t. There is very little true acceptance in the
bonding of male and female, there is always suspicion, there is always uncertainty
because we are caught in the differences.
It’s one of the things that I talk about in terms of outer authority that the true
emergence of outer authority will mean that we can communicate with each other as
beings, not as an illusionary construct of this or that with all the strategic
manipulating that goes in trying to deal with that. You can see that. Watch two
women meet, watch two men meet and then watch a man and a woman meet, boy,
is that all different.

The Gates of Gender Differentiation
I know that this is a plane without love because you can only have love when you
love yourself first. And to love yourself is quite an ordeal; it’s quite a place to get to.
And the moment that you get to that place is the moment that the power of all this
differentiation begins to fall away, because it’s not the point. It’s only the program.
It’s the one thing to remember.
We are ancient incarnating personalities that have never, within the nature of what
they are, have ever had any sex and any difference. The personality crystal in a
female in this classroom and a personality crystal in a male in this classroom, there
is no difference. What I mean by that is that there is no gender difference. It
doesn’t exist. There is no difference in that crystal that says it’s going to be this or
that, that it’s going to be male or female. It doesn’t exist. These are filters.
You can have your next life or your last life and be in a totally different vehicle. It’s
not what we’re about. And the moment we get caught in it we get locked into the
homogenized world. Anyway, it’s interesting after all of these years to pay some
attention to this. It’s nice that you’re all here this morning and share my coffee with
me. Do take care, have an entertaining weekend and until next time, bye for now.

Lecture Eight
The Memory Network
Well, we get to one of those areas of the BodyGraph work that I’ve always enjoyed
which is that the BodyGraph is made up of so many different kinds of circuits. One
of the things that was very much part of my early teaching in Design was really to
get students to grasp that the different ways that the energy can move in the
BodyGraph are basically different kinds of formulas at work.
The circuits themselves are actually fascinating because you cannot really
understand aspects of design concepts like the collective abstract or logic or
individuality or the tribe, whatever the case may be without really understanding
those concepts within the context of the circuits, you don’t really get the whole
picture.
I can remember the delight I had in the early years when I would do just movement
through the circuits. Just going from one gate to the next to show how all of these
things are integrated together into a much larger structure. So, circuitry for me
within the BodyGraph is something that’s always been particularly interesting.
Here this is one of those illustrations that I get to put together every once in awhile
that you can spend a long time thinking about from many, many different levels.
Again, you can see that I’ve integrated this with the chemistry itself because I think
ultimately that is something that deserves its own particular attention. I’m not going
to give too much of it in this kind of overview. Just so that for deeper speculation
there is as much information on the surface that we can put together here.
How We are Designed on the Surface to be Controlled by
Memory
The first thing is to just look at the circuit itself. To look at the circuit itself is to see
there are two ends to it. It isn’t really a matter because in the human BodyGraph
everything is multi-directional, or bi-directional to be more precise. For example, we
only see uni-direction in an aura when we’re looking at something like a penta. Here
we’re always looking at the possibility that energy can move in any direction. So we
have two ends, in that sense. We have an end that is the 11th gate and we have the
other that is the 26th gate and you can see that there is this, in a sense, spiraling
that goes on here in the way in which this circuit is constructed.

It’s something to grasp, because I don’t want you to
see this as the complete story of memory, because it
is not. The fact is that every single living cell, and we
see that in the sense that in the memory circuit itself
we have the 5/15 and in having the 5/15 this is the
basic construct of the cell. Now, you can see that the
cellular 3 isn’t there, in that sense. So, one of the
things to grasp is that every single cell carries within it
a memory. So, what we’re looking at together is
we’re looking at what is the way in which we are
designed on the surface to be controlled, I think is
probably the best word, by memory.
Memory Holds Us Together
Let’s talk about memory for a moment. The thing that distinguishes us as a creature
is the depth of our memory potential. It is our capacity to remember that is the
bedrock of our self-reflected consciousness. Obviously, there are other attributes
involved in all of that. But it is something to grasp that without memory there is no
potential for humanity to transform. There isn’t. That is, memory is an absolutely
essential ingredient.
I want you to look very carefully at this circuit. And I want you to see something in
the circuit that should stand out and scream at you, is that there is absolutely no
individuality in this circuit. None. Individuality is mutative. It is specifically
mutative, like the illustration that I just gave you where I showed you the cellular
construct of the 15/5 and I said that the 3 is missing, the individuality, the potential
of mutation is missing.

The Splenic Streams
In other words, one of the things to really grasp about memory is that memory is the
way in which we handle the status quo. I’ve often talked about collective circuitry as
being Solomon’s circuitry—nothing new under the sun. When you’re dealing with the
collective, whether it is logical or abstract, it is only operating on what is not
anything else. It deals with what is there in the maia. Memory is a way of holding
on to the maia.
After all, this is the construct that matters for our personalities, that we can make
sense out of the maia. It would be difficult to imagine what it would be like if you
were stripped of all of your memory and you were suddenly to awaken in a world
that you did not recognize, because you would not recognize it. You would not
recognize, in a sense, what objects are. You would not be able to communicate.
You would have enormous problems in terms of just your basic orientation.
And in order to survive you would be driven by the deepest and most uncomfortable,
the survival drive, and just survival drive. Memory is what it’s all about. We know
the tragedy, that is, we know it in modern times, the tragedy of Alzheimer’s disease.
It is a frightening thing for most human beings to watch a parent that has been vital
and mentally active suddenly not be able to recognize them or to know where they
are, and on and on and on. And we see this incredible breakdown in their
humanness, they lose their humanness.
And of course, it is our memory that holds us together. My mother who is going to
be 96 next month, the way in which she describes her life is that basically it is
nothing but memory. This is what we collect in our lives. This is what gives us a
sense of our existence, our continuity, our connections, everything. And in that
sense, it is memory that holds us deepest into the construct itself of the maia. It is
how the maia is held together.
The 26/44: The Power to Control Memory and Cellular Memory
So, let’s take a little journey and see where it leads. And let’s begin where, in
essence, it all begins. If you look at rave conception mechanics, the stage of the
development of the channel of the 26/44 is one of
the essential ingredients in life. It is the
establishment of the fundamental immune system.
It is the ability to be able to remember, in a sense,
that you are this or that and that you need to
survive. And there are the tools that are there.
When we’re looking at the 26th gate, we see that this
is a gate that is given the name: The power to
control memory. This power to control memory is, in fact, a power to establish the
presence of memory as a necessary tool for the immune system. What is the
immune system without memory? The immune system would not be a very good
defense system if every time that something approached, it had to learn all over
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

again whether it was safe or not. The immune system has its memory and its
memory is essential for the fundamental survival of the being. And the very source
of what we call memory within the context of the 26th gate, we wouldn’t think of it
that way.
This is the very basis of the memory system. We need memory to stay alive. And
without that memory we cannot stay alive. Of course, the irony is that the 26 on the
surface is capable of great lies, great manipulation of the truth. This can be the lack
of cognition sales person. This is the fisherman bragging that the fish was so big
they couldn’t see its tail. In other words, the manipulation of memory is something
that can always be done by the Ego.
The Ego, as a matter of fact, has enormous power over memory. It’s just something
that’s interesting to think about when you’re dealing with Ego beings and you’re
dealing with not-self Ego beings you’re going to end up in situations where memory
is something that is going to be manipulated for the benefit of survival. And of
course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the reasoning is just, or whatever, in any
comparative sense. It is simply that the Ego, because it is the source of the memory
drive and it really is, in that sense it is much more the format than the 52/9 is the
format in the regular sense of looking at format energies.
Of course, the 26 and its movement and we’re going to cross here, these particular
gates are simply organized according to their chemistry, these four gates are all
Threonin and these gates below here are all Serin and so forth and so on. That’s
why they’re organized in this way not in terms of the way in which they are in the
circuit itself.
You can see that there is this relationship between the 26 and the 44, that is, the
first step into this, and here we have this theme of cellular memory. This is a
collection place, if you will, of what is stored instinctive, we would call it, memory.
In other words, this is the kind of memories that are, for example, physical

LECTURE EIGHT
The Splenic Streams
memories—muscles remembering how to move and things like that. I don’t want
you just to think about memory within the mental context. To recognize that in
order for us, the density of our maia to construct or reconstruct out of memory a
visualization or an expression that is accurate we actually have to have a great deal
of different kinds of memory that work in layers to build up the density of the maia
we try to share.
We get that, for example, I guess the novel is the way to really see that. How many
layers of memory can we sense in the telling of a story? The more effective a story,
the truer the sense of the maia. And the quality of the maia, like somebody telling
you a story, the believability of the story is not the content. It isn’t the content.
That’s the most interesting thing about believability. It’s not about the content. It’s
not about saying I found a four leaf clover. It’s not about the content. It is about
the context of that content.
In other words, it’s the way in which the maia is elaborated through memory around
that in order to give it its sense of reality. That’s why when the average child is
going to make an excuse they go to great lengths to tell a vast story, their attempt
to sort of lock it into a legitimate density of maia that is rooted in if there are all
these details, if there is all this background, it must be true. Memory—layers and
layers and layers and layers of memory.
And of course, we know that the moment we get to the 44th gate and we get to the
Spleen, and we only have two Splenic gates, we are dealing with the two primary
fears that are driving forces for memory. The fear of the past is the 44th gate. And
of course, obviously within this context, the
memory of the past from the basic level of the
immune system and being able to store the
memory of what it knows, it doesn’t have to pay
attention to, and so forth and so on. But a
memory ultimately that is translated into our
being protected by remembering the past.
If you don’t remember the past you’re really in
trouble. It is the going into the forest and
leaving breadcrumbs behind and suddenly the breadcrumbs are gone. You’re going
to be in great danger in that particular situation, really big danger. It is one of these
things to see that what keeps the personality locked into its dysfunction is the
distortion that’s possible in its memory.
And one of the things that is so clear about memory is that it is locked in, based on
the fact that this is the Ego that is its source, it is locked into a primary function
which is memory ensures survival, which also means that what you tell somebody
else and how much of memory you reveal may be a threat to you. So we decide not
to share certain memories with others. And everybody does that. And whatever
rationale they put on top of that doesn’t really matter.

The 32/54: Memory Discernment and the Drive to Expand
Memory
So, as we move along in this circuit, otherwise I’ll never get through it, let’s go to
the 32, and we get to memory discernment. Now, it’s interesting because when
we’re looking at normal circuitry, for example when we are looking at what appears
to be an aspect of tribal circuitry normally we’re looking in a direction in which we
are pointed this way. That is, we’re pointed upwards towards the Ego and ultimately
the expression through the 21/45. Here you can see that this circuit is operating in
a sense in reverse. That is, it is operating from the memory discernment and what
we see as the 54, that is, the Marrying Maiden, this is the drive to expand memory.
Now, it’s an interesting thing. There is clearly the potential of the 54 to be a key in
the development of memory technique. It’s also something to understand about of
course the nature of the 54. That is, the expansion of
memory is an ambition that leads not simply to survival,
but the ability to move itself up the ladder in terms of its
success, its material success. To expand the memory is
also a driving force in enriching what is the possibility of
human awareness.
The average person, for example, who speaks the English
language, uses a vocabulary of less than 250 words.
That’s a very limited maia. One’s ability to be able to
describe the maia in layers requires nuances of language, requires descriptive skills
of being able to bring that memory to the surface. Expansion of memory leads to
greater survivability, greater wealth, all of these various things that we can associate
with the demands of the material plane.
The 32 is the discernment. It is that, the other Splenic fear. And of course, this is
the fear of failure. And it means that we are not here to remember everything. That
is, within the strategic sense of the tradition of memory, because again as you can
see there is no Head Center here. And of course, the Head Center is the ultimate
storage unit for all experience. But this is not about the storage system. This is
about the conceptualizing of memory. It isn’t about its storage.
And of course, the moment that we get to storage we get to the phenomena of the
emergence of the right mind and the understanding that memory discernment isn’t
necessarily something that is universal. That is, for the right minded the
discernment is literally to be completely peripheral, if we can put it that way, which
is sort of anti-discernment, the discernment itself is the by-product of its
interrelationship with the other. And it’s only through that interrelationship with the
other, in essence, the other becomes the discerning agent in order to be able to pull
out the specific piece of memory information.
But within the general context of how the personality operates, we all get to see that
there are only certain things that we naturally remember, and only within certain
contexts. Obviously, there are things that are related to work. The more

The Splenic Streams
sophisticated a career, the more things have to be remembered in order to maintain
the viability of one’s career. But we all have this natural memory discernment and it
is these things that are essential for us to remember that are literally the things that
protect us against failure.
Now of course, when you think about the open Head Center, which is thinking about
things that don’t matter, and we put this all in the context of the not-self we can see
that so many things that people try to remember, in the sense that they try to store
in their system and bring back out, that of course, they end up being side tracked in
their process and are involved in information that ultimately has no impact for them.
A Memory Technique
In 1985 here on the island I ran an experimental school. One of the things I taught
the children was a very old memory technique. That memory technique was simply
a way of getting them to have keys to accessing memory and things that I was
teaching them. I was teaching them the history of the universe. It was basically a
four-month journey.
Obviously I was teaching them an enormous amount of information, or at least
sharing with them an enormous amount of information, and to go along with that, I
was giving them the memory techniques to be able to store this information. But the
memory technique is absolutely useless without expression.
My recommendation to anybody who wants to expand their memory is the moment
you hear something interesting or read something interesting the next opportunity
you have to share it with somebody, do so. This is actually what mind is about. It’s
about outer authority. But you cannot burn the pathway for consistent access to
anything unless you take it through the process of being conceptualized and
expressed.
The things you remember the best are the things that you talk about. So it’s one of
those things, if you’re somebody that wants to develop your trivia base every time
you hear something trivial repeat it to somebody; you’ll remember it. If you want to
do well in an exam all you have to do is be orally questioned in order to prepare.
This is the way in which you burn memory into the system.
It isn’t about just collection. That’s why in this context there is no Head Center. It
isn’t about just collection. It is not about that at all, in essence. It really is about
ultimately expression. Everything about memory is that memory is something that
becomes deeply, deeply, deeply powerful if it is the ongoing process of your outer
authority. That’s what we’re here for. It’s not, unfortunately the way we
communicate. The way we communicate is that we don’t share that memory. In
other words, we don’t bring things out. And what we do bring out we bring out in
certain ways in order to protect whatever our not-self is looking to protect.

The 9/52: Power to Concentrate and the Fuel to Focus
Let’s continue our little journey here. We have what traditionally we
know as the format energy of the logical process and there’s no
question that when we are looking here that in terms of the lower part
of this system it is evenly split. You have the logic from the Root to the
G, and then you have the abstract from the G to the Ajna. So you have
this basic binary of the collective process. And of course, over here you
have the tribe. And you can see it’s a very balanced system in that
sense.
So here we’re looking at the foundation in the way in which memory is going to be
generated. Of course, here is the source of memory. Again, the classic joke that
memory is something that occurs in response. You’re not going to remember
something before it happens. Memory is
rooted in response. This is the
generative process. So, this movement
into the Generator and particularly the
Generator or the Sacral gates are going
to be significant in that sense because
this is the most dynamic theme of the
way in which memory envelops our life
form. After all, Generators with their
enveloping aura impact everyone with
this foundation of the way in which
memory is designed to operate.
So, we have the beginning of this process
with the power to concentrate; and of
course, this power of concentration with
the fuel to focus; not language that is
unfamiliar to us. It is clear that this isn’t specifically and exclusively about memory.
After all, the 9/52 is a format energy and format energies are profound in and of
themselves, and there is a great density to the many, many things that the format is
involved with.
But here within this context, the very core of the format, that is, the fuel to focus,
the power to concentrate, without it you’re not going to be able to develop ultimately
the skills that you need in life. One of the things about memory is that as I try to
express in terms of repeating things that are of interest to you is that the key is in
the repeating, repeating and repeating and repeating.
I am a traditionalist when it comes to the education of children, traditionalist in the
sense that if you go back to students of teachers 2,000 years ago you would see that
the main work was memory work. Now, I don’t mean to say that memory work is
something that should be the whole thing about education. It isn’t about that. It’s
that if you don’t develop memory at an early age, if you don’t exercise memory at an
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LECTURE EIGHT
The Splenic Streams
early age you never really develop one. I was very fortunate. I’m old enough that
when I went to school there was still an enormous emphasis on memory work.
It was a great benefit. For me it turned out to be something that was very
comfortable. I think it was deeply beneficial. In this day and age where children
don’t really have to remember anything other than a song that they might have to
learn for a school event, and then they’re expected to remember things in terms of
exams, but they’re not really given the memory training that they need. That
memory training is repetition. It’s like trying to learn a musical instrument. Your
memory can tell you where your finger should go, but without that practising it
doesn’t become something that is pure and automatic and something that enhances
your process.
So, everywhere we look within the context of memory we come to this need to be
able to focus and concentrate on repetition. It is repetition. You learn that as a
professional in Human Design. By the time you’ve done 400 or 500 charts you really
remember what you’re doing. You have the depth that’s there. You don’t have to
desperately grab a book or click the program to see what something is, because the
fact is that just using it over and over and over again it simply becomes part of you.
This is the key to memory. Of course, it does take this power to be focused and
concentrated and not distracted. This is one of those keys. Those things that you
don’t repeat, those are the kinds of things that when they get stuck on the tip of
your tongue they drive you crazy because the practise is simply not there; the
repetition.
The 15/5: The Power to Repeat and Memory Flow
As we move along, we get to what is in essence the core of this. That is, the
moment that you see the 15/5 you see humanity. You see the general patterns of
humanity. And in the 5th gate we have the key to memory. That is,
the power to repeat. And you can see that, for example, in cellular
reproduction, the cellular memory in that sense to keep on repeating
and to keep on producing. Without this power to repeat it is just
simply not there.
It is clear, for example, that all the major studies that they’ve done
on deterioration of memory and Alzheimer’s and all of these various
things, one of the things that’s clear is that minds that are active and
stay active, minds that are remembering and expressing because the
expressing is everything, they have a much richer mental future.
Of course, again, this is all about this power. I talk a lot through the many courses
that I’m doing about the essence of what mind is for. That is, as long as mind is
both inner authority and outer authority, human beings are fundamentally liars.
They cannot be truthful. They cannot be truthful because as long as the inner and
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

121
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
outer authority is the mind then you know that every expression as outer authority is
being determined by the agenda of the false inner authority in the not-self.
The moment that one can step away from mind being the inner authority and leave
mind with its true purpose, which is to fulfill its potential of outer authority, one
begins to see that it is expression that is the way in which we can measure
awareness. It seems like an obvious. But the fact is that most human beings when
they’re trying to express awareness are expressing manipulated intelligence. And of
course, the purity of one’s memory, that is, purity in the sense of it being individual,
each of us have a unique memory collection that is possible when we operate as
ourselves that leads to a unique way in which the mind looks at things; of course,
the beauty of what’s possible in that mind being able to share that.
Minds don’t get very good at sharing outer authority unless they are absolutely
secure in their inner authority. Rooted here in the 5 is this basic power and it’s not
simply that repeating, it’s not just about the memory work of repeating things. I
want you to understand it is about discussing what is there in you cognitively. One
thing that is lacking on this plane is the potential to be able to communicate to the
other without an agenda. And as long as the mind is both inner and outer authority,
that’s not possible.
On the other side of the 5 is the 15. Here in essence is where the 15 can be very
beautiful, because it can be a very difficult gate, particularly when it’s a hanging gate
because of the potentials of its extremes and the discomfort that it can bring,
particularly to the not-self, obviously. But within this context it’s something very
special. That is, the power to repeat leads to a flow. That flow is very beautiful
because it’s something to grasp—the deeper your ability to clearly remember, the
more you are open to the quantum of seeing and remembering that memory. That
is, interacting with your own memory leads to new thoughts. It does.
If you have a not-self memory your not-self memory remembers something based
on whatever your trip is. Let’s say you’re open emotionally. Your not-self memory is
going to be based on avoiding confrontation and truth which means that your
memory is not going to carry the things that would bring discomfort based on that.
And then, in remembering and remembering something that has been edited, your
interaction, the quantum interaction of your mind looking at the memory leads to a
new thought. That new thought can be totally out of context with reality, literally.
It’s not based on something that is stored correctly. It can’t be, because it’s stored
according to the not-self and it’s going to be framed in that way and you’re not going
to want to have in your memory something that you don’t want to go to.
Memory is not you. It’s what you’ve stored; it’s what you’ve taken in. And what you
take in, the moment that you ponder it, something else happens. It’s quite
something.
Written comment: Channel 5-15 is the only channel also present in the

The Splenic Streams
Ra: Well, that is a different subject though. The 5/15, if it’s not somewhere then we
don’t have life, at least not bio-form life. I don’t want to mix classes here, but
obviously this is going to lead to people where their weakness is going to be here.
And of course, they’re going to be driven to make mistakes in terms of what patterns
they follow in their life.
Again, this 15/5, wherever you look, this is the key to understanding the bio-form.
So this being in the flow, being in the memory flow leads to many things. It leads to
the organization of humanity. So you end up with cultures that have a myth about
the nature of their culture that they teach children to remember. And then you have
a collective memory flow that is constantly repeated as those children repeat the
same myths over and over again every day of their lives until they become adults
who believe in those myths. That’s also part of the memory flow.
The 33/13: Memory Expression and Memory Collection
But again here in this, I’m just looking theoretically at this movement that we have.
It brings us to the other expression out of the G Center. And in that other
expression—it’s interesting, by the way, two
Splenic, two Root, two Sacral, two G, two
Throat, but the one Ajna and the one Ego. It’s
just interesting again to look at the dynamics
of the way that the circuit is structured.
So here we have what is in fact the first view
of what is expression. In other words, to
understand that built into the memory circuit
is that memory includes expression. In other
words, you cannot separate memory from
expression.
Again, this goes back to one of the reasons
why communities have always developed
around unique knowledge because a language emerges. A language emerges that
allows those beings to be able to communicate with each other
within the context of that, that can be deeply satisfying in that
sense.
Here, what we see in the 33/13 is we see the mythic quality of
this. That is, here is the prodigal. This tells us about the
expansion of our cultures and civilizations that they are done
through the revelation and the remembering of experience. We
have left behind the pattern, the systematic way in which we
can ingrain information for easy retrieval. And here we’re
looking at the experiential memory. That is, the memory of the
life process and how essential that is, it is collective after all, it
is here to be shared.

RAVE ANATOMY I

It’s the thing to understand about there is no individuality in here. There is none.
This is collective. Every collective channel is social. Every collective gate, every
collective aspect is social. And the keynote of all collective circuitry is: share.
Memory is to be shared. It is the shared memory that establishes the maia. This is
the way our world is built. When you think about your families, your background,
your race, your culture, your civilization, whatever the case may be it is layers and
layers and layers of memories collected, shared.
The 13th gate, interesting in this grouping, is memory collection. The gate of secrets,
the fellowship of man, here is where memory can be collected for expression. It’s
different than the memory collection for the benefit of the immune system or
survival. Here is identity memory collection. It is the memory of the self. And it is
that collected memory rooted in experience; again, no memory without the
experience.
In this memory collection when we get to the other side and we look at the 33 is that
we come to—these are terminators, these are stop codons—we come to: memory
expression; memory collection and memory expression. Here is what it’s all about.
This is what we get to understand, in that sense, about the way memory is used.
We collect it, we express it. And of course, the whole story of humanity is this way.
And of course, this is one of the ways in which we are allowed to correct our general
movement. It is these shared memories, these shared experiential memories that
allow us to align ourselves to what can be a better or more enriching process in our
lives. And we are dependent on it.
The fact is that given human beings are unique, despite the gloss of homogenization,
the fact is that most human beings never have the opportunity to be able to break
through the congestion of homogenization to produce something that is different and
of value to the collective. And the moment that those things emerge, the collective
snaps it up because it moves through the system.
Today you can see the 33/13 and in that context the 11/56 as what we call modern
media, whether that is television, radio, the web, all of these various ways, mobile
phones, you name it, all of these various ways in which we share experience that we
share memory and we express it. And we are deeply impacted by this. Nothing
impacts us more. One of the most successful categories in the world for literature is
the autobiography or the biography. Human beings are absolutely fascinated.
It’s like these reality television shows that get—it astonishes me. And yet, when you
understand the 33/13 you can see that human beings are desperate for memory
expression. This is what we want. And what we really want is we want memory
expression that somehow, perhaps, may benefit us. So you want to do well in
business and you read that story of the great person who rose from rags to riches.
And of course, we find those things inspiring. We may even find little tips in it or
hints in it. We’re desperate for that memory.

The Splenic Streams
The Maia Has to be Maintained Every Day
Most human beings think of memory only within the personal context of
remembering their past. Yes, obviously, it is a part of it. It is not something to be
dismissed. It is just simply something to recognize that this is what drives our
personality consciousness integration to the maia. The maia has to be maintained
every day. You wake up in the morning and all you’re doing the moment you open
your eyes is reaffirming and remembering who you are, where you are and what
things are. It’s the first thing you do the moment you come to consciousness is that
you’re remembering.
In relationship to DreamRave, one of the things that I have been telling DreamRave
students when you wake up in the morning you start all over again in the struggle to
be yourself. Every, every morning is a challenge in that struggle to be yourself,
because what you wake up with, the way in which you remember, all of that
remembering is rooted in your life. There is all that remembering. Most of it, the
great density of it has been not-self and you have been programmed while you’re
sleeping on top of it.
It is what you remember that is so important for yourself. But for the other, they
are dependent on your outer authority. Without outer authority what would
humanity be? Where would he be without, even in the not-self, even in the
homogenized world, what is the homogenized world without those outer authorities
that have shaped it? Can you imagine a not-self world without the memory of
Einstein or Darwin or Mohammad or Jesus or Buddha or Newton or Galileo? It’s not
possible.
Then what you have is the shrinking of the maia. And you might as well go back and
live in the jungle and eat berries. You see, the great distortion of the plane that we
live on is the collective memory that we are all shrouded in is not-self. It’s just not-
self. It’s like those biographies that people love to read. It’s not about the person.
It’s their not-self story.
We lack a great deal of honest communication on this plane. And you can only have
honest communication when you don’t have an agenda. And you’re going to have an
agenda as long as your mind is your inner authority. It screws everything up. And it
means that those beings on your fractal line that are there for you don’t get what
they need. They don’t get your true memory expression. And within the nature of
this circuit this is one of the main goals of this circuit.
The 11/56: Visual Memory and Memory Projection
Finally we come to the 11/56. In many ways, it has much more to do with the 11 as
really a key here, than it does with the 56. Many of you know that in terms of the
mutative history of humanity the most important mutation of the seven-centered
being was the mutation of the larynx, what took place in the 12th gate and of course
the 11th gate is its polarity. Through the 12th gate within the Throat came the

potential or the ability to be able to vary sound nuances. And obviously that opened
up the potential to be able to articulate in many, many different ways in order to be
able to develop a language, to develop a way of interpreting and
transmitting a concept or an impression of the maia.
The 11th gate, being part of that mutational transition is literally
what opened up the beginnings of what we call the human mind,
or this quality of human mind that we are familiar with. It is
about the 11th gate. We know the gate, Peace, is the gate of
ideas. Here, of course, it is visual memory. But it’s much more
about how memory is the source of ideas, and how important it
is to understand that.
The more distorted your memory, the more distorted the idea
that derives from it. And of course, human beings being not-self
and operating out of mental inner authority, the ideas that they have about what
they should do and shouldn’t do is based on a memory that is simply deficient. That
is, a memory that is not rooted in who they actually are.
And of course, it is one of the great dilemmas that we have. The other side of this,
the 56th gate is memory projection, visual memory projected. And it is very
powerful. Again, the 56th gate is a stop codon. Stop codons are like the period at
the end of a sentence. And that we can see that no matter which way you look at
this circuit that in essence it is two circuits, one large, one small; the 11/56 in a
sense standing on its own, the visual memory stopping at memory projection and
then the whole system underneath stopping at memory expression, these two sides
of the coin.
The one that is most powerful is the visual memory. And it is not the most powerful
in the context of the way it operates within a human being, it’s about what happens

to this in the context of our evolution. The most powerful impact on human
consciousness has been the ability for human beings to be able to see things taking
place in real time anywhere in the world, or beyond, for that matter.
I can remember watching real time human beings walking on the moon, which I still
think is an incredible thing, as a memory. This memory projection is the most
powerful force. And of course, it’s been taken over by governments, institutions. It
is a methodology that is used in order to manipulate us, the world of advertising and
all of these things. It is this visual memory projected that is the most powerful force
in shaping our world.
Memory is Personal
Think about all that. Think about it within the context of the not-self, because that’s
what the world is. The world is not-self. Memory is personal. You only share your
memories if it’s to your advantage. You’ll share a memory with a lover. You’ll share
a memory with a friend. But your memories are personal. But that isn’t what it’s
about. Memory is something that is only personal when the mind needs to hide
things, when the mind is uncertain and insecure about the life. Then all these things
are not only kept inside but they’re distorted. And when they do come out, they add
to the general homogenization of the way in which we communicate with each other.
It’s something that is deeply missing on this plane. The lack of personality dignity is
so obvious and so pervasive. Again, it is not something that you can just try to fix
from the point of view of mind. It isn’t. You cannot decide that you’re going to have
correct communication with the other. It really doesn’t work that way. It begins in
the form.
Everything about life and its potential beauty begins in the form. And it means that
in order for the personality to have access to the memory that is correct and a
memory that will lay the foundation for its potential for expression and projection
that it has to be correct. That it can no longer have a mind that is absorbed in its
whole authority trip. It’s a very, very difficult thing to achieve.
It is so easy for the mind to be in transference. And the moment that you’re in
transference, all of this is distorted. Your motivation is not correct, you don’t see
correctly. How is that memory going to be something that is legitimate? How is that
memory going to lay the foundation for the unique potential of your cognitive
expression? It can’t, it’s all distorted.
And what we end up with is that through this cabal that is expressed through this
basic binary here that the personality consciousness of humanity is manipulated and
maintained within the homogenized not-self world. It’s how it all gets locked in. And
everybody is inculcated with memories that chain them to specific positions,
philosophies, moralities and whatever.

There are people that whole groups in societies that remember certain events only in
the way in which myth has established them, and they accept them as truths. This
is our planet. It’s the world that we live in. It’s a world of an enormous focus on our
ability to retain and express information only to have it flow through what is
fundamentally homogenized not-self beings. Well, best thing one can do is stop
letting the mind make decisions. Get to a point where the personality can actually
communicate its perspective innocently.
Well, to all of you, another interesting Rave Anatomy. It’s always nice to look at this
old material; it’s not so old. You take care. Until next time, bye for now.

Lecture Nine
The Splenic Streams
Well, hello and welcome, and it’s nice to have my voice back. Yesterday, I didn’t;
but anyway, it’s here. We come to perhaps my earliest love affair in mechanics. In
these remaining three classes we’re going to take a look at streams. It really is the
bedrock of mastering an understanding of the BodyGraph and energy. It was the
first real taste of the magic that was there in the BodyGraph that I got to see from
the very beginning. That is, my own investigations of the BodyGraph.
Individual, Collective/Logic and Tribal Circuitry
When I first began doing readings I did a lot of readings in the late 80s and very
early 90s, ’89, ’90, and ’91 before I had written the black book, before I was even
clear what all this actually meant or what it meant to me. It was what I understood
in terms of looking at the BodyGraph and seeing that it was something holistic, that
aspects had values, but had values that were contingent on other values, that this
was a genetic matrix and as a genetic matrix it was locked into the imperative. And
being locked into the imperative it wasn’t simply a matter that a gate hanging was
interested in a gate at the other end of it.
It wasn’t just interested in it, in fact, it had a destiny for it. That is, it could not fulfill
its own process without that other and that it wasn’t that simple, that it went beyond
that, that it went into what I would call streams. That is, circuits are built on their
streams. And here we’re looking at examples of three different circuitry. That is,
individual circuitry and collective logical circuitry and tribal circuitry.
These circuits which again to really grasp the BodyGraph you need to start from the
very top in a sense. It’s the opposite of the depth of the knowledge where you begin
from the base. And one of the things to understand about the nature of any gate or
any channel is that it’s always has to be remembered within the context of its
circuitry.
It’s a primary thing, and yet it’s something that students are aware of. You say,
what circuit is that a part of. But the actual value of the circuitry is something that
needs to be grasped, because they are very, very different in the way in which they
operate. And that the very simple keynote of a circuit itself is so deeply expressive
of anything that is in that circuit.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
Logical Circuitry: Stream of Taste
You take the stream of taste, the logical circuitry, what we know about logical
circuitry is that its keynote is very straightforward, it’s very simple. The keynote is:
share. Though that is something that you sort of take in on the surface and say ok
that’s the keynote, but go into that and begin to understand something about that.
Begin to understand something about the collective. The collective is very, very
unusual. It is totally different from individuality and the tribe. And it’s different in
its relationship to the other. That is, when you’re looking at collectivity you are
looking at the shared process. It means that any process is not complete without
the other; any process is not complete without the other. This is the whole thing
about the shared process.
The 48th Gate: Shared Depth
When you think about the 48th gate, depth, this has to be shared
depth. It cannot be personal depth. That’s why it has the tradition
of being the black magician because this is when you see the horror
of holding back knowledge from the collective in order to have
power over the collective. It’s about sharing depth.
It’s like understanding the 36th gate and the gate of crisis, it’s about
sharing an experience, and the process of moving through
something based on one’s inexperience, and the consequences of
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LECTURE NINE
The Memory Network
that. It’s shared, because alone it’s pointless. And at the moment that you look at
the collective not only is the other so absolutely essential to the process, but it is the
other that ultimately is going to provide the ingredients that enhance the shared
process.
If you’re a 48 and you’re carrying within you a depth, that is only of value if you
share it, it is of no value if you hold it to yourself. And yet sitting there in that 48th
gate, if it’s just hanging there and there is no place to go, this is a pressure that
builds up, this is a depth that is held that has no outlet and genetically one is pining
for that 16 at the other end. And then suddenly the collective potential emerges to
be able to share the depth. And it’s in that ability to be able to share the depth with
the other that the sense of potential satisfaction emerges.
It’s so interesting about the collective logic, this theme that is inherent in the 18/58,
this channel of potential dissatisfaction. And of course, the dissatisfaction is deeply
abundant in a not-self world; there is no question about that. But there’s something
to grasp always in Design, again, on the surface always basic, always to the point,
always revealing, that this is a binary system. You cannot look at a channel and look
at the way in which it’s expressed without thinking about that channel in the
opposite. The channel of never being satisfied is a channel that can always be
satisfied.
We Cannot Fulfill Ourselves without the Other
It is only the logic process that has a potential at relative perfection, the perfection
of a pattern and the perfection of a pattern that becomes a deep security. But it is
the sharing of that pattern with the other that is the process. It is not intended to
stand alone, which means that every collective gate that you have is always looking
for the other as a way to fulfill itself, always. And you can see that the collective in
its own way is more deeply conditioned by the other than individuality, for example.
We’ll see the tribe because its theme is support, is an even deeper connection but
different in its intensity.
The collective immediately says that we cannot fulfill ourselves without the other, so
what we want is the completion of what we don’t have and so you look for it. And of
course, the great dilemma is that given the nature of the not-self, instead of actually
looking for it you try to become it yourself. You’re the 48 who tries to develop the
skills but you cannot do that because it has to be done collectively. And you’re
always going to be uncomfortable in trying to find them on your own because it’s
going to turn out that they are of no value to you.
The Stream of Taste: Judgmentation
So let’s take a look at this stream of taste. Now, taste isn’t always something people
grasp and it is a keynote that hangs around in Design because it covers so many
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

131
RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
ways of interpreting frequency. You’re really looking at a stream of judgmentation,
logical judgmentation, pattern judgmentation. You either fit in the pattern or you
don’t. The pattern either works or it doesn’t. It is right or it is wrong.
When you’re dealing with the stream of taste there are no gray areas per se. If you
compared all of the streams of taste you would see that there are indeed gray areas
but not from the specifics of anyone who carries this. These are black and white
people. This is what judgmentation is about. Judgmentation is not, well, maybe.
That’s individuality because it doesn’t know when it doesn’t know. The moment that
you get to collectivity it is always ready to step on one side of the teeter-totter.
All right, so where does it start? It starts in the Root. Again, one of the basics of
Design that is sort of just taken in mechanically and never really contemplated
because it needs to be contemplated are these basic descriptive themes of the way
in which a stream flows. And you will see that the natural flow is always towards
expression. Again, there is the anomaly of the tribe, but again, the tribe itself
ultimately will have its own way of finding its expression, but it is going to gather its
power in focusing on the Ego. But the theme is to get to expression. So even
though energy moves in any way in channels and streams, the natural flow of every
stream is towards its expression. And when we look at their root, we are looking at
a common description: fuel. This is the pressure; this is the energy resource for the
process.
The 58th Gate: The Vitality to Challenge
And again, as I mentioned earlier in this program the Root Center is not something
that people pay a lot of attention to and it deserves enormous attention. It is the
instrument that physically drives, literally,
everything. So, here you’re looking at the fuel
of these streams. You are looking at where
they begin. You are looking at where their
source is. And when you’re looking at this
stream of taste and judgmentation, the source
is the 58th gate. And it is a gate that carries
the fuel of vitality.
Now, you’ll notice that all of these keynotes are
accompanied by “or not.” And of course, this is
something to always understand that this is
something that doesn’t necessarily have a
natural outlet. You can have the 58th gate, it carries the fuel potential of vitality, but
it doesn’t necessarily get it out. It may be sitting in an undefined center, it may not
bring consistent vitality to the process, it may not be able to find the right others in
order that that vitality and aliveness is something that comes to life.
Once you have that vitality it’s sitting there. It means that there is this enormous
energy to collectively approach patterns. It’s not an energy to do it alone. If you

know any 18/58’s they complain to the other or they correct the other or they point
out to the other, but they’re uncomfortable when they’re holding it inside themselves
and they can’t get it out. I know how helpless they are in that, even when they
know that it’s going to lead to annoyance, trouble, all those things. This is the
vitality to challenge. It’s the vitality for that. It’s the power. And it is the power to
do so in relationship to the other. If there is no other there is no vitality.
The 18th Gate: Awareness Potential
If you’re an 18/58 and you’re a monk and you’re living in a cave you’re going to go
nuts. Maybe you’ll start talking to the spiders and telling them that their webs have
a problem. But you need to have the other. And if you’re a 58 and you’re just
sitting there, you’re looking for that 18. What does the 18 carry? It carries
awareness potential. It can only be a potential. This is, after
all, an isolated element. It is simply the Root to the Spleen.
There is no outlet to the Sacral, to the Throat, whatever the
case may be. You’re simply looking at what is a fueled potential
and that is the potential of correction and it is awareness of
what is vital or not.
Now, this is a play on the word “vitality.” I hope you enjoy my
word games, but it’s a play on it and it’s a good one. Vital, in
that sense, means what is important, what is absolutely
necessary to correct. Again, judgment; judgmentation is so
much a part of how the pattern process works. In other words, where do we put this
vitality energy? Where do we put this fuel, where do we focus its power?
One of the most pathetic things to see is an 18/58 that is scattered in the way in
which it’s trying to impact others without a focus, because the focus is necessary.
Remember that everything about the logic process is that ultimately you get to a
point of a perfected pattern. That is the goal. And of course, any logic being who is
well-grounded in a viable pattern is going to be very, very effective, but they’re
going to be effective specifically. What is vital to challenge or not.
And of course, we know that in the context of analysis of the 18th gate, the mother
and father, the Oedipus/Electra, all of these things is the bedrock of the development
of our collective process because here is where we learn to challenge the other. We
learn to challenge the mother, we learn to challenge the father, and we learn to work
at our relationships with others. It isn’t always easy—the child that has an 18/58
parent, or the parent that has an 18/58 child, and so forth and so on.
They need each other. If you’re an 18 and you’re just hanging there you don’t have
the right fuel. You can have the awareness of what should be dealt with and never
end up with the energy you need to deal with it. Even though your 18 may find its
way to expression in your design it doesn’t have the natural fuel. These are
streams, after all. And even though we are not born with necessarily having full
streams and whatever, when you take humanity as a totality the way in which the

A Digital Book for Students
logic process works in all of humanity is stage by stage through all of these streams.
It’s the way it goes.
The Possibility
And then what happens? You get to the possibility. This is where there is an itch.
You can see that itch in the 37 and the 22 and the 36 and the 44 and the 50 and the
57, it’s this itch because it’s pointed towards getting it out. It’s close; it knows it’s
close. It looks across the channel and it says, aha, I’m here; it’s this one little step.
And what is this awareness, because we’re dealing in an awareness center so it’s an
awareness possibility. It’s the awareness resource of vital information as a pattern
or not; resource. It’s a well, after all. It’s just a well. And there is no bucket. It’s
just a well. And it fills up as a resource with vital information that’s derived from the
awareness to know what is necessary to challenge, rooted in the correct fuel, the
vitality, the strength to be able to do that.
Three steps: the energy to be able to correct; the potential to recognize what needs
to be corrected, the collecting of things that need to be corrected; and then finally
the manifestation, the skills. The manifestation of the pattern and a voice that says:
I think; I think this is the pattern. I think this is the way it can go. And in the end it
is: I think this will work for us.
It’s so interesting that it is this perfection of pattern, what we see in masters of art
and music, all kinds of creative endeavors, how impressive that is to humanity. This
expression ultimately of taste, this delightful ability in us to be able to establish,
challenge and maintain patterns that allow us socially to be able to fulfill our
judgmental potential and to end up, in that sense, with a pattern that is good for us.
I’m somebody, for example, who has the 48th gate. I’m not an 18/58. I don’t have
the 16. I have no collective definition. I have my share of hanging logical gates.
And the fact is that I always assumed that my depth, that is as not-self, was for me.
I spent a lot of time chasing the holy 16, because that’s what happens. It wasn’t
until I understood the nature of this that I realized why I did not have the intellectual
power or the potential to express it when I was not-self. I was not a collective,
social being. I am as lone wolf as one can be in one’s design. Any social interaction
for me is always a challenge to my basic nature; it just is.
Without the completion and the completion comes in many ways, I have people who
are very close to me in my life who are 18/58s. I know a lot of 16s. It is a way,
ultimately, in which my depth, that is, a depth that is available for the collective
process has actually emerged. And so I end up in, for example the work that I do, it
is not necessary for me to study Design, think about it. I live a life that is correct
and I live by own authority. But I am trapped by my 48. It’s like, well, yes, but if
you’re correct then your 48 has to be shared collectively and this is what you’re
going to do; no choice, said the Voice. So it goes. We are all looking for those
completions. We are all looking for those aspects that will complete our particular
processes. It’s part of the deep, deep attraction that is there genetically in us.

The Memory Network
The 18/58 and the 16/48
Let us say you’re somebody who has the 18/58, you’re
going to be attracted to people who have the 16/48.
It’s almost, and please note the “almost,” like an
electro-magnetic connection, almost. It’s very
satisfying. It can also be very, very, very conditioning.
Remember that the moment you’re operating in a
stream, either alone or with somebody you meet, that
the fuel, the stream’s process is going to operate
according to the diagram, like this.
So, let’s say that you’re a 16/48 and you meet that
18/58, that 18/58 is going to drive the process of the
two of you together. It is going to produce all kinds of
new collective information for your 48 that you will
share as an expression. It will be the force that is
driving that. Now, it’s not like it is conditioning in the
sense that we understand it. It is about a change in
role. Any time you fit into somebody with your stream, you begin to fit into a
system, an energy flow system that may change the way you naturally operate.
Individuality: Empower
Individuality obviously is the mutative central skeleton of the BodyGraph. It runs
through the middle, it is the joker in the deck; it’s always the joker in the deck. The
fact is that no matter how productive the collective can be at establishing the logic
collective, at establishing patterns and no matter how much they would like to
convince you that the pattern is going to stay there forever, the fact is that at any
moment, mutation is going to take place and the rules are going to be changed
immediately. It has happened historically in our intellectual thought. It is just the
way things are.
This is the kind of joker in the deck; it’s always there, this intuition. And the
dilemma of it is that because it is individual and because it is being governed by the
nature of its format, as all streams are, that the nature of the format is a pulse
energy. It’s a pulse. It is there or it is not. And here when you’re looking at the
“there and not,” to realize that this is one of the inherent dilemmas, if you will, of not
only the individual life, but the way in which the individual is perceived. We do not
have a theme of share. The stream of taste is from California. We don’t have that.
Individuals do not have that. Individuality is: empower. Now, that’s very different.
It is very, very different. There is no inherent social connection in empowerment.
There isn’t.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
As a matter of fact, in all of the gates and channels of individuality there is only one
channel that has a social dimension and that’s the 12/22. But of course, again when
you read that channel and it says, the design of a social being, please understand
something, that it is also a design of an anti-social being. And if you think you know
what a cold shoulder is, the cold shoulder that you can get from a 12/22 is one of
the most surprising, because there is that complete other side to them. And it is a
social mechanism with an agenda to literally pass along mutation.
The 38th Gate: The Energy to Struggle
So where do we begin? We being with the fuel and the
fuel is the fighter. Here lies the energy to struggle.
Why? You look at the collective and you see aliveness,
vitality; cool. You have a 38, you have individuality and
there you get the fighter, just the fighter. This is the
energy to struggle. And it is the energy to struggle to
find one’s individual purpose. The others be damned,
which is why it ends up being a fighter, because the
individual is always fighting with the collective. The
collective says, here are the rules, you have to be this. And the individual struggles
against that “this,” I’m going to be “that.”
The 28th Gate: Awareness to Struggle
It’s a struggle. It’s a struggle to define itself as separate from the other. “I’m not
like you. I don’t want to correct my mother and father; I want to get the hell out of
the house. I’m not like you.” This is the fighter. And this is the essential energy to
fight for one’s place. The 28th gate is one of those
incredible gates. It really is. It has so much power. It is
the 28th gate that can turn integration into a sort of
individual process. It is the 28th gate that is at the core
of the demand in us in our intelligence that there is more
to life than a secure pattern.
It’s like those bizarre science fiction movies where you
see everybody organized into a perfect pattern;
everybody. It’s horrendous, it’s stale and boring and
repetitive. Yes, it’s secure, yes it’s reliable, but boy is it
boring. Individuality is bored with it. You want to stand alone and they will take
chances, because when you struggle there is no guarantee of victory, none. It’s why
you end up with the channel of stubbornness. And this is the awareness to struggle;
not what to struggle about. This is not logic. “I’m going to challenge this because
this isn’t right.” This is the awareness to struggle for anything as long as it has to do
with defining who you are. “I am not you. I am not the other. I will fight to be
me.”

The Memory Network
And it doesn’t matter whether that’s not-self or not. The only difference the not-self
makes is that they end up meeting resistance and they suffer terribly in all of that.
How painful it is. And how deeply misunderstood they can be by the collective.
They say, “What’s the matter with you; we’ve worked so hard at this pattern, why
don’t you just accept this pattern. Why are you struggling?” “It’s because I’m not
like you.”
This is the potential, the potential to struggle, to be separate from the other. This is
not a social channel, this is not a marriage bond, this is not sexy. You’re in my way,
get out of my way. You’re trying to get me to do things that I don’t want to do. And
of course, it becomes misunderstood. Nothing can make the collective more angry
than a 28/38. Boy does it piss them off. They don’t like it. It’s like all those people
standing in line in a movie and somebody is struggling to get in there—“I don’t have
to stand in line.” Yeah, yeah, boy the collective gets upset; they don’t like it. Know
your place. The 28/38 says, well, the hell with you.
Imagine what it’s like to be a 38 and you have no 28 or a 28 with no 38, how
attractive that is, how powerful that is, how important it becomes, how deeply one
can be conditioned. And it’s not like once you have the awareness to struggle that
you struggle all the time, because sometimes you just can’t, because you’re an
individual and in a pulse and it’s not always there.
The 57th Gate: The Awareness to Struggle for Knowing
Then you cross the Spleen and you get to the 57th gate and of course, I don’t want
to go into the complexity of the 20 and the 57 in terms of integration, the 57 in
terms of the various things it feeds, in that sense, as an
awareness gate, how important it is as an awareness gate,
just to see it in the context here of the individual stream.
This is the awareness to struggle for knowing or not. Here’s
there is a real change.
We notice from the 18 to the 48 that the only difference is
that the 48 collects. I’ve often described the 18 as a leaky
faucet, one correction at a time being recognized. And the
well fills up from those drops. It is very, very passive, in
that sense. But the 57 is different. It’s different in that it is
much more complex than the 48th gate. Here we have a
transition. We saw that the awareness in the 28 is simply
the awareness that you have to fight for yourself, you have
to fight for what’s you. The 57 takes it to the next stage. It
says, yeah, well, but then again, the only thing worth struggling for is knowing. It’s
the only thing worth struggling for, is knowing.
The history of the Spleen is the history of our intelligence. It is where our
intelligence began. It began out of the mutation of what were basically immune

system defenses. The root of our intellectual knowing is here. It’s this struggle to
know. And it is the awareness to struggle to know. It’s so important, because in the
end the individuality is different in its approach to the nature of survival. The 57,
because it is connected to integration is deeply, deeply aware of its capacity to
survive. That is not enough. It’s not enough to have a successful survival pattern.
It’s not enough. It’s not enough to just simply have enough to eat. It is not enough.
There is something else. There has to be something else.
This is the force that says, I am mutation, therefore I express always its possibility,
because knowing brings shattering, all knowing at any level. It’s just that the
shatterings can be rather minuscule at times. And this possibility, what it yearns for,
what they all yearn for, is that expression in the moment, the now. That knowing
that I am, I’m not like you, I am. I am right here now. This is me, alone. This is its
perfect expression.
And of course, it differentiates it deeply from the collective. When you see things
deconstructed in this way, when you just see them through the mechanics, you see
the purity of their movement, you see the way the energy is intended to move and
then you get into somebody’s design. And they have a little bit of this and they have
a little bit of that and they have a little bit of the other thing, and you begin to see
the dilemma in them, that there are all of these conflicting processes at work. I
know beings that are 18/58s and 28/38s at the same time, or other combinations
like that where there is a fundamental deep profound struggle within them.
Operating Correctly Allows for Correct Interactions
Intellectually we cannot deal with those things. You cannot handle them simply
because you think you understand them. It’s why mechanics are so wonderful,
because they can bring you to the techniques of operating mechanically correctly. It
is only when you are operating through your authority that you end up in a geometry
that allows you to have the kinds of interactions that are going to be productive for
you, regardless of what your configuration is.
And to also understand that like me, if you’re a 48 and you don’t have the other
three gates in the stream of taste, the moment that you’re operating correctly you
start to become wise about where the vitality is and who has it. Who knows what is
vital and who doesn’t, what skills are actually worthwhile and what aren’t. You begin
to develop wisdom, because that’s what it’s about.
I can tell an 18/58’s quality within moments of talking to them. You can tell at what
level of consciousness they’re at, because everything about them is knowing what is
vital. And you can simply just tell by the correction in their language with you at
what level they’re operating. You get wise in the way by understanding the stream,
and not by focusing on what you have, but on realizing what you do not have and
what you do not have in that stream has always been attractive to you, has often
been a deep conditioning force. And now is your opportunity to look it and see it for
what it is and begin to develop a deeper understanding of the other.

Look at the Streams in Your Chart
These streams, you have a key in a stream. If you have a key in a stream look to
the rest of the stream. It says so much about your life process. It says so much
about the drives that were there when you were not-self. And particularly look at
streams where you have a channel. Look around and see where you meet somebody
who has another channel in that stream. It’s quite something to meet. It’s like I
don’t have the 39/55, I am very, very individual. And it’s an individual channel
where I have no activations. So, it is something that I can really be aware of,
because I have individual activations every place else, or definition.
It’s so interesting how comfortable I am with them and how easy it is for me. Even
though I am unemotional and they crank up my emotional system and it’s the
moodiest of channels and all that stuff, it is so familiar to me. It’s the same thing
with the 28/38. These are the two individual channels that I have no activation in.
Interestingly enough, by the way, when I had my experience with the Voice, I think
for the first four or five days there was both the 28/38 and the 39/55 defined, which
was rather interesting. And the musician that I’ve played with for years, somebody I
started making music with in Ibiza after my experience, was a 28/38, 39/55
Projector. I thought that was an interesting connection.
But you have a relationship to those beings that have those channels that are there
in your stream. It’s something to notice and look at, particularly if you’re just
scanning. It’s one of those fun things to do, lay out a whole bunch of charts and just
look and see who fills a stream for you. You’ll have a very interesting insight into
the way they operate, and the way you deal with them.
The Tribal: Support
Let’s take a look at the inside story, it’s always the inside story—the stream of
instinct. And of course, here we’re dealing with the tribe, and when you’re dealing
with a tribal keynote it gets sticky. You’re dealing with support. Now, sharing is
really broad and collective. It is potentially promiscuous. It can be all over the
place. Support is not.
Support is very, very personal, in a way. That is, when you have a tribal connection
to somebody and you pull away your support, oh boy, you’re going to have to deal
with quite a reaction because, in fact, that support is very, very personal. And
because the 19/49, which is part of the tribal circuitry on the emotional side, carries
with it all of this emotionalized tribal motor theme of need that this support system
is something that is at the bedrock of it. So, it ties you very deeply to your
community.

The 54th Gate: The Drive to Transform
When we start with the fuel, the first thing to see clearly is that when we’re dealing
with the tribe on the Splenic side, we are dealing with materialism. There is nothing
in the entire BodyGraph more material than the movement from the 54 to the 26.
And I mean that in so many ways. That is, I mean it in the sense of that this is an
instinct of how to function in groups in the world, how to
be able to maintain the gene pool to keep the gene pool
viable, to be able to maintain the viability of reproduction
in order to be able to produce income or resources or
whatever is necessary.
It is very, very material. And it is constantly about we
can’t do it unless we stand together. The tribal motto of
divided we fall and united we stand, or however that goes,
this is the theme. The theme is we are doing this together. I’m supporting you;
you’re supporting me, this is how it works.
And of course, here is the way in which the tribe locks the other into their process.
They get locked in so that if you go up it’s because of them, if you fall down it’s
because of them, you’re all in that, in that sense, together. And when we’re looking
at the fuel, the fuel is the drive to transform. And it is the drive to transform the
material plane. It’s the drive to transform the potential ultimately of the tribe itself
and it’s all rooted in the material talent. In other words, it’s the ability to be able to
recognize what we get in the 32nd gate. You can see the 18 and the 28 and the 32
are the beginnings of awareness processes. And ultimately they’re about recognizing
something.
The 32nd Gate: Awareness of What Can be Transformed
What the 32 recognizes is what can or cannot be transformed. Think about
traditional tribes. You think about the way in which the children in the tribe, because
they’re all raised together and they’re raised communally, how those children are
examined communally by the tribe. Now, the tribe needs to have certain things.
They need to have fertility.
They need to have potential talent and whether that talent is primitive like hunters
that are necessary or farmers that are necessary, crafts that are necessary, it goes
on and on and on. And all of that development of that potential talent is already
there as the children are being raised and as the children are being conditioned.
Here there is support for the direction of certain children, because there is an
awareness that here is where transformation can take place. This one can learn how
to be this. This one isn’t very clever; we put this one over here; and on and on.

The Memory Network
In the same way that as far as marriage is concerned, the tradition of marriage is
rooted in the arranged marriage arranged through the 32. Not what we have seen
as a development basically over the last couple of thousand years, and again,
sporadically where there is no arrangement, there is simply a bargain that is struck
between two beings. The kind of what happened with the emotions and its powerful
sexuality and the pleasure principle became more
powerful than the rule of the tribal fathers or mothers—
the girl from one tribe who falls in love with the boy from
the other tribe and pisses everybody off.
In Iraq not too long ago, I think it was in northern Iraq, a
girl from one tribe fell in love with a boy from another
tribe, they got caught and they were both stoned to
death. And this is 2007. One of the things about the 32
was that the 32 arranged all those things. It was aware of
who could be a good partner for whom, and who could do what, and whatever the
case may be. So, it is something to be clear about in terms of the relationship of the
32 to the 54, this whole channel of transformation, is that in its own way it is tribally
judgmental. The only thing is it will not abandon what it cannot use. And logic will.
And the tribe won’t.
So the tribe will allow the low intelligence child or the deformed child, whatever the
case may be. I’ve seen examples of that in my travels where you go into certain
primitive villages and you see there is a whole part of the village that is there for the
crazy ones and the retarded ones because there has been too much inbreeding.
They’re simply looked after and that’s it, and the tribe will care for them, the tribe
will support them. The tribe will support its own kind.
The 44th Gate: Transformation Stored as Memory
Yet, at the same time, the only way it can support its own kind is if it finds those that
can be transformed. Those that can be transformed that in their development will
dedicate what they do to the tribe itself. This is the whole control mechanism that’s
there when you get to the 44th gate and you get to
this gate of manipulation. And again, from the Latin
root, for hand, this is about being able to control
others.
Obviously, it’s an alertness possibility, an awareness
possibility. But you’ll notice it’s like the 48th gate.
It’s very similar. Only the 57 is different in this
position of possibility. It is a storage place. Transformation stored as memory, or
not. It’s a memory place. And it is a memory place that allows this being to be able
to control the other because they know so much about them. It’s one of the things
about the support mechanism is that they know everything about you. You know
how uncomfortable that is after you’ve been away for a few years and you go back
into your family’s home and they all remember the stupid idiotic and ridiculous

things that you did, and not only that they will remind you of it. And even though it
was 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago, it is still there and it is still a powerful force.
This is part of the manipulation that is there in the 44.
But again, it is not an active principle in the way the 57 is. The 57 is an awareness
that develops for knowing, a struggle for knowing. It’s a very different process.
Whereas, the 48 and the 44 just collect. They pile it up because that’s what they
use, that’s where their power comes from. You don’t want to go to a well and get
one drop. The deeper the well, the more valuable it is to the collective. And the
same thing is true for the manager that is going to be able to have to deal with the
Ego.
Remember the 44 has to deal with the Ego, not the Throat; that the power that it
has over the Ego is its memory and how it uses that memory. That’s why the tribe
rarely brings in strangers into their business enterprises, because they don’t have
the same advantage and they don’t have the same built in sense of the potential of
loyalty. They don’t know the person since they were a child. They don’t have all of
the hooks that they need.
The 26th Gate: The Will to Apply Energy
And then you get to the 26 and boy do I know this story because I’m a 26 and I
don’t have the 44 and I don’t have the 32 and I don’t have a 54. This is the will or
not to apply energy, nothing else. This is where the Egoism comes from. The
Egoism comes from the fact that the Ego can
express will or not; whereas, nobody else can do
that. And of course, this is where the whole theme
of Egoism comes from.
And it’s so interesting to see that the only way that
will can be controlled for the benefit of the tribe is
through memory. In other words, in order to
control the willful being you have to know a lot
about them. And when you see the whole channel, that is, the 44/26, this
surrender, this design of the transmitter you can see what is transmitted. It is the
will or not to transmit the memory. And of course, that memory can be
manipulated. Often it is. “We’re not telling you for your own good.” You protect the
tribe from things it doesn’t need to hear. Or you get the tribe to get involved by
telling it what it wants to hear, all carefully managed through the energy and the
memory.
But this Egoist, to understand what that means, this is the first place and the only
place in the Splenic streams in all the ways that it can go, that it gets to a place of
willpower. Oh, and the will of the tribe, this is something that is constantly being
manipulated, constantly. You will do God’s will; you will not do your own will. And
then in comes the memory with the manipulation—you know what happens to you
when you, blah, blah, blah—you get punished, you get ostracized, we stone you, you

go to hell, you work for us because we are yours. You work only for us. You really
get to see the power of that in the 40th gate, which is the gate of the love of work.
The tribe really digs into that, you work for us, your will is for us.
And all the power of the streams from the Root to the Ego, that is whether it is on
the left side or the right side, is all about getting the Ego to give up any, any
possibility of individual will. It is the using of the power for the will of the tribe. It is
the display of the power for the will of the tribe. It is personal energy dedicated
based on the will of the tribe.
Basically there is nothing more manipulative than the tribe. And I don’t mean that in
a negative way, I really don’t. It’s simply that because the keynote is to support,
when you’re in a tribal hookup you’re very exposed. And in being very exposed
there are all kinds of things about you that are gathered in by the other because the
tribe lives on this.
Think about the gossip, rumors, all the backstabbing chit chatting, this and that,
blah, blah, blah, I get it all the time. There’s always this. It’s tribe; it’s the way
tribe works. It’s the way they try to control your will by reminding you of something
that you did, that you didn’t do, that you could have done, that you did to the other,
that you shouldn’t have done.
There’s nothing more exposed than being in the tribe and being exposed means, and
again, I’m talking about not-self, how easily you are manipulated. It’s so easy. The
most manipulated tribal beings are those with undefined Egos. The tribe has
enormous power over them because they end up with this not-self strategy of
wanting to prove themselves, that I’m really here to support you and I’m really here
for you and I will do whatever you want me to do, your will is my will, blah, blah,
blah. It can be devastating.

All Aspects of What it is to be Human is on the Surface
The streams are really magical. Going up and down, wandering around the streams,
seeing what’s there, beginning to understand that every single aspect of the nature
of what it is to grasp a human being is always on the surface. No matter how deep
you study in Human Design it’s so important to come back and understand that
everything underneath is holistically present on the surface. It can’t be otherwise.
In this or any image of a BodyGraph is the story of that being. It’s all there.
Again, to be familiar with these things is the way people are trained in Human
Design. And I must say that I personally am very, very pleased with the way in
which modern education in Human Design takes place. My concern about any
learning process, because these are the kinds of things that you meet in ABC and
Rave Cartography where you go through and you begin to see the graph and the
aspects of it, is that it’s something you learn so you can get onto something else that
you can learn. And it isn’t something necessarily where you stop and you really
process it and you really digest it.
It was so interesting for me over the years to look at the difference between the
students that I trained in the earliest years and the students that were trained later
through the whole system, though holistically the modern student is much better
equipped to do a professional analysis, if you scratch the surface of the analyst of 10
or 12 years ago they weren’t as good as the modern analyst at delivering the
surface, but they knew an awful lot more about the BodyGraph.
In this age where we have so many sophisticated tools now in the way we develop
professional work in design it’s why I’m doing this course again mostly because it will
be available as a self-study course so that ultimately anybody can take advantage of
this, is to just make sure that you see that you can go back now to the basics that
you learned at the beginning of your process and take them to another level, re-see
them. And with the distance that you’ve had and the movement that you’ve had in
your education that will add an enormous depth to your appreciation of what’s there
in a design and your ability to be able to see more for the benefit of others.
Anyway, a pleasure to be with you; I’m glad I had my audio repaired. You have
yourselves an entertaining weekend; until next time, bye for now.

The Ajna Streams
Ok, let’s enter into the second of our stream journeys. It is one of those areas of
investigation that is so fascinating in my work, that is, the workings of the mind.
When we think about the workings of the mind we have to see it from two different
perspectives. That is, the whole construct of the not-self is based on the inner
authority of mind, and that inner authority of mind is rooted in many things. It’s
rooted in the underlying motivation which is not only in transference and that lays
the foundation for the way in which the mind is going to be pressured or driven. And
then the construct itself is rooted in the openness, whatever the openness is going to
be is going to lead to the frameworks upon which that mind is going to be driven,
literally, to pursue its agenda.
And yet, all of that is something that we understand through the nature of the
personality crystal. But of course, the personality crystal doesn’t stand alone. That
is, the attributes of both the personality and the design are something that is
quantumized in the chart. That is, the illusion is created and in the creation of the
illusion, which is the life itself we have the mental construct established in the
BodyGraph. In other words, we have the way in which the personality potential of
mind, its underlying drives or motivations, its underlying not-self strategies, that
those are only going to be able to operate within the framework of the BodyGraph.
That is, within the framework of the way in which the mental system is displayed in
the BodyGraph as a way in which energy or information moves.
Mind is Limited to the Individual and Collective Processes
One of the things one gets to see immediately about the nature of mind is that
within the context of the holistic vehicle, the holistic life, that mind is something that
is limited to the individual and collective processes. That is, it carries with it no
unique tribal thought. An interesting thing to consider when one considers the way
in which we look at the tribe is to be very clear that it is very, very separate, in that
sense. We’ll get to see that particularly when we arrive at the emotional system and
we get to see that it is the emotional streams that regardless of their circuitry are all
dominated by a tribal mechanism.
Here the tribe doesn’t exist. And what we have here is the limitation, if you will, of
the way in which personality can display regardless of whether it’s not-self or not,
the way in which personality can display its mental potential, its mental
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

manifestation. It means that in any study of mind that no study of mind can be
complete simply by understanding the underlying mechanisms that frame the way in
which that mind might operate, because that “might” is going to be relative to what
happens with what you see in their BodyGraph. Obviously, if you see somebody that
is particularly fixed in a specific way, let’s say they are strictly logical in the way in
which their mind operates then it’s clear to understand that whatever their not-self
process is, whatever their transferred motivation is, is that it’s all going to be
displayed logically.
Again, to understand that whatever is there underneath, it’s why the whole truth of
Human Design is found on the surface. Everything is expressed on the surface
because it’s the surface that is where the interplay is and where the movie actually
exists. This is the life in the holistic sense. So, in looking at the Ajna streams I want
you to grasp that this is not simply a way of looking at somebody’s mind when you’re
looking at the Ajna streams; you’re looking at the way in which their mind is going to
operate. And it’s quite a different thing.
In other words, the nature of that mind, again to understand that the nature of that
mind is either the by-product, and this is the case for most human beings, of an
underlying foundation of a transferred motivation, and that transferred motivation,
what is built upon that is the various openness or in the case of a split definition, the
hanging gates, whatever becomes the main conditioning forces that are going to
define the way in which that mind is going to operate.
It’s something, for example, in Rave Psychology that we see in both the sun/earth
combination and in the nodal combination so that we have the framework upon
which this mind will work. But its expression is limited to what is there or not in the
Ajna. And the way in which it’s going to operate is limited to what is there or not in
the Ajna, because it’s in the holistic vehicle that the way in which mind can operate
gets its opportunity to be displayed.
The Ajna Streams
Ok, so with that as a preamble, let’s begin our process. And you’ll remember last
time that when we were looking at the Splenic streams that we could see that the
fuel was coming from the Root. And of course, here we have the upside-down of it.
That is the BodyGraph is basically a pressure sandwich—the Root below and the
Head Center above—so here is the fuel of this process. And it’s going to be the fuel
of these streams. Of course, what you see out of that is that you have an Ajna
Center that in fact is divided up, like the Spleen was, into two separate processes.
That is, the potential and the possibility, and then of course, finally the expression
that is there in the Throat.
Now, you’ll notice the terminology here, this expression is something that is very
important to keep in mind about the nature of the way in which the brain/mind
construct is established in the holistic BodyGraph is that it’s a long way from a

The Ajna Streams
motor. It’s important to recognize that the primary function of mind is verbal
expression, that is, the expression of outer authority.
So, in having the basic construct, the other thing is to notice that we have something
here that is different from what we have seen in the Spleen and something that we
don’t see other than in the Sacral Center and that is the crossing, that is, graphically
speaking, of the energy systems. This is something that creates a vortex here, this
meeting point between these forces. And for those of you that like this kind of stuff,
this is where the magical tradition of the third eye comes from. That is, this is an
energy convergence point. I could go along and talk about that for awhile, but that
isn’t the purpose of this. I’m going to avoid it altogether.
The Understanding Stream
All right, let’s go over here and let’s begin with the understanding stream and let’s
begin with the collective process. Remember that two of the processes that is the
limitation of the way in which mind can be expressed are going to be collective,
which means that the majority of what takes place in the mind is intended to be
shared. It says something interesting about individuality, that is, the individual
mind, that the individual mind has to be very, very careful that it isn’t being
conditioned by the mental process to share, because individuality is not about
sharing. That is, the individual mind is not about sharing. It is about empowering,
but it is not about sharing. Sharing is fundamentally social and collective.

RAVE ANATOMY I

And of course, our interest in the future and the past, our interest in the basic things
that are part of everyday mundane not-self human communication is rooted in these
two collective streams. This is the world of Solomon where there is nothing new
under the sun. This is the regurgitation or reformation of information over and over
again that is expressed as collective conversation. And obviously there is a mundane
and banal level of this, and there is a very, very exalted level of this and everything
that lies in between.
Again, that has so much to do with the dilemma of mind in the first place. The most
difficult thing to heal is a human mind. You can heal their bodies, you can transform
their physical system, you can align them correctly to their geometry, you can put
them on the right track, but it doesn’t mean you can heal their mind. The mind is
the most deeply conditioned aspect of our nature. And the healing of mind is
something that is an extraordinary journey of attention and awareness.
So we have a dilemma. That is, the vast majority of these collective shared
communications are communications in which the not-self mind, which is the world
itself, being both inner and outer authority just simply does not tell the truth. It
cannot tell the truth. It cannot expose itself to danger for the kinds of things that it
wants. It bites its tongue, blah, blah, blah, and all the various things that arise in
the distortion that happens when the mind is playing that dual role.
The 63rd Gate: Doubt
These are things that you need to keep in mind when speculating about the
limitation itself. Let’s start, for example, here in the understanding and start with
the 63rd gate which is the gate of doubt. Now, of course, the moment you start with
that gate of doubt, here is a pressure of suspicious patterns
or not. In other words, patterns that don’t click naturally for
this being, there is a pressure that immediately arises. It’s a
form of recognition, or not, by the way. Doubt isn’t
something that is about everything. It is rooted in the
suspicious pattern.
Now, when you think about that you have to understand
something that that doubt and that suspicion that sounds
cool, if you know what I mean. It’s like, all right, if there is a
suspicious pattern there’s nothing wrong with a pressure that points it out to us.
After all, patterns are the most important thing for a human being because it is the
only thing that is actually reliable and it is one way in which the future can be
guaranteed, so doubts are something that are important. When you have a doubt it
means there is an uncertainty that arises within you and there is a fear that goes
along with that, or in the case of mind, an anxiety.
Now think about the mind that has to operate within this limitation. This is the step
for you to grasp. The mind that has to operate with that has to deal with, for
example, its transferred motivation. So the first thing is that the way in which it
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

The Ajna Streams
approaches anything mentally—that suspicious pattern or the way it deals with the
pressure or where the doubt comes from—is going to originate in what it’s motivated
to think about. And what it’s motivated to think about is controlled by its openness,
by the not-self mind itself.
So that you have somebody with their undefined Ego and they don’t feel worthy and
they want to prove themselves. So they’re only going to be suspicious about
patterns that indicate a problem with them being able to prove themselves, which
may have nothing to do with something that is a legitimate doubt. After all, it’s not
connected to them as a true being. It’s their not-self after all. And I am being very
superficial because it is much more complex than that.
I want you to get the point. I don’t want you to look at your 63rd gate, if you have
that, and say, ok, this is what my mind is about. I am somebody that often doubts—
and again, it’s a gate of questioning—and I feel that pressure and the moment I see
something that doesn’t sort of really fit that’s the moment I am under this pressure,
that’s me. Well, yes; but, no. That’s the limitation, that’s the frame through which
your mind has to work.
So, for example, if you have an open Spleen and you hold on to things that are bad
for you you’re not going to be suspicious about the very thing that you should be
suspicious about. You’ll be suspicious about those who want you to break the
pattern with the bad thing that you’re holding on to. And you will doubt those very
beings who are trying to tell you something that is really important for you. “You
should leave him; he beats you all the time.” And you will doubt them, be suspicious
about what are they after. Are they trying to ruin my life?
This is just a limitation. It’s a stream. It’s the way that the mind gets streamed
through the infrastructure. So it has to work this way. But it’s the underlying
quality that is something that needs to be grasped. And oh yes, because I do speak
only of the not-self, yes if you have an awakened mind, then its doubt is going to
operate according to its cognition, it’s going to operate correctly. It is going to be
suspicious about patterns not because they are driven to be suspicious about them,
but because they have this capacity, this inspiration about what may not quite be
right. And as outer authority the potential to be able to express it without agenda,
without having to compromise to the demands of a mind that is also inner authority.
And frankly, we don’t really know what these minds are like. I can only postulate. It
can only be at this point in the development of awareness, can only be something
that is theoretical.
I’ve just spent two years probing mind. And that process of probing mind, it is so
obvious that the whole framework of the way in which mind operates is established
long before it gets to move down a gate or a stream or not. And when you pull the
whole thing together what you get simply is the mechanical limitation of the way it
can work. You think about the being with an open mind, open Head Center, open
Ajna Center, their mind is already established. But the dilemma for them then
becomes the fact that there is no consistency in the way in which it gets streamed;
that in fact that their mind process can become quite chaotic.

Really Understanding the BodyGraph
You don’t understand a human being in terms of this knowledge until you can see
the whole thing, and see the whole thing there in the BodyGraph, because in the end
this is where you put it altogether. It’s one of the most exciting parts of my process
is that next year the first new BodyGraph, in a sense, that is, not that there is a
change in the construct, but there is a change in the tools of analysis. That the
views have expanded. It means an advanced imaging analysis, a way of upgrading
how to look at the BodyGraph. When I taught the BodyGraph the first time around,
when I first laid out this rave anatomy, this was simply the mental construct. I had
not come to the point where I was teaching the not-self. I avoided that because I
didn’t want to scare people off in the beginning. I did not and had not gone through
this long, very deep, intellectual process of exploring the nature of all of this down to
its little minutiae.
And after all these years to come back to this place, I come back with a real smile; I
do. Because I finally really understand what the BodyGraph is. The BodyGraph is
the limitation. It’s the limitation that leads to differentiation. Without that this is all
pointless. And by recognizing that the limitation is something that is infused with
potential that has to move through the limitation of streams and circuits and gates
you have to come to a place of quantum analysis where you go from just simply
seeing the surface streaming and you couple that with a deep understanding of
what’s there as a potential and you begin to get it.
The 4th Gate: Formulization
It’s like the 4th gate of formulization, the answer gate. It’s an awareness, it’s in the
Ajna Center, the awareness to judge what pattern is suspicious or not. Well, that’s
quite a thing, to judge what pattern is really suspicious or not.
Now, what’s doing the judging? This is my point. The judging
is the construct of mind itself. And if this is a distorted mind,
if it’s a mind of somebody with an open emotional system,
somebody who is not-self and driven by the avoidance of
confrontation and truth.
And that avoidance of confrontation and truth is driven by a
motivation that is in transference that lacks cognition, that
you have somebody who is a 1st color that should really be
looking into things and they end up with a 4th color and
they’re needy as hell and they have no cognitive source
behind that so they don’t know what they need. And what that need is coupled with
is avoiding confrontation and truth. Where do you think that’s going to lead in terms
of how they judge what is suspicious or not? I used to tell people that because you
have an answer doesn’t mean it’s the truth. Well, it doesn’t. It’s a not-self answer.
It’s rooted in the way in which the mind operates through this.

The Ajna Streams
The 17th Gate: Opinions
And then you have the cross over, this cross over to the 17th gate from the 4, these
opinions, visualization of what pattern is correct or not. So one of the key
ingredients to the way in which the mechanism operates is that
the mechanism operates through in the collective a visual
process. Both the 17th gate, the gate of the right eye and the
11th gate, the gate of the left eye, are deeply, deeply visual.
Now, we’re talking about the way in which the mind is going to
visualize. One of the most profound areas of understanding the
nature of mind is to understand the impact of personality nodes.
And personality nodes establish the view. That is, the specific
perspective upon which mind builds its layer-by-layer
dimension. And yet, human beings are not-self, which means
that they are in transference, which means that the view is in
transference, which means that they don’t see not simply what
they’re not supposed to see, but even that, they do not see
well. And what they are looking at and what they see—and
when I say “what they’re looking at,” what the mind looks at,
not simply the eyes, I’m talking about the mind’s perspective, that that is distorted.
What kind of opinion do you think you’re going to get of that visualization of what
pattern is correct or not?
Go into one of these countries where you have 8,000 political parties on the ballot.
They all have a pattern that they’re going to say is correct and they’re going tell you
that the other pattern is wrong. I use politicians because of course they present us
with options for the future which is all about the logical process. And they try to get
you to visualise that pattern is correct. But this is just a mechanism. It does not
speak of the substance that is there or not. It does not point out the distortion.
The BodyGraph is a generic. It’s a generic matrix, it’s a common matrix. It is the
layer on the cake. It’s the way it all gets organized. But it is still a surface
mechanism. And deep, deep within us is this already established mental approach
ready, waiting for its outlet in the limitation, its outlet through the gates or the
streams, or not.
So, be careful in the way in which you look at these themes. See them for what they
are. But understand that you cannot accept them at face value. When somebody
presents you with their doubt, their answer, their opinion, their detail this is their
limitation. It does not mean it’s the truth. We are fooled by this day in and day out
over and over all our lives. You meet somebody who is a 59.6 and you think in the
moment that you meet them that this person is somebody you’re going to care about
because they broke into your aura. But that’s just a mechanism. Like the
mechanism of somebody putting their aura into your aura and you amplify it; it’s just
a mechanism. What is the substance underneath that that has to function through
it? It’s why there is no commonality in these things.

The 62nd Gate: Detail
The detail of the 62, the gates in the Throat that point upward are perhaps the most
fantastic as instruments, because they have this incredible task of translating the
visual into the acoustic. This translation is quite a thing, to go from the mind’s eye
to be able to describe what you grasp in essence visually on
the mental plane. And this is a metamorphic process, this
transformation that can take place in the 62nd gate, this
manifestation as verbal expression of pattern or not.
This is the laying out of the detail. This is the voice that says, I
think. Well, it displays thought, but the underlying quality of
that is not there. It’s in the way in which the mind is going to
operate. Is the mind an inner authority, or is it an outer
authority? If the mind is inner and outer authority then the
not-self rules, if the not-self rules what can you trust in this
detail? Just because somebody says, I think, I think this is the pattern; but they
think that is the pattern because it is a solution to their not-self fears. It doesn’t
mean it is. It doesn’t mean that this is true detail. It’s just a process.
We have all kinds of human beings that have all kinds of definitions. And we can see
in those definitions specific patterns. You can tell this person would be a very logical
person, you can hear the logic in their voice, the way in which they organize their
thoughts, the way they express them. But that doesn’t tell you who this being is
because they speak logically. It doesn’t tell you anything about the quality of what is
behind all of that, why they speak in that way. It doesn’t. It just gives you a
relative insight. Yeah, there are nuances, you can read the lines. But all it is doing
is refining what is the surface mechanism because we are dealing with mind and
mind is not formed here in these gates and channels. It is expressed here.
The Sensing Stream
The 64th Gate: Confusion
Let’s go to the other side of the story to the nice
abstract side, the sensing stream—confusion. Oh, I like
that misspelling, isn’t that cute—mental—the pressure of
mental activity or not. Mental activity—now, it’s
something to grasp about confusion. Most people think
about confusion as you have a difficult time trying to
grasp something. But one of the things that is often
misunderstood, again, this is the source of a stream, it’s
a fuel, it’s a pressure. It is a pressure of a lot of things
crossing the mind. It’s mental activity.

LECTURE TEN
The Ajna Streams
It isn’t necessarily the mind doing a lot of processing. Obviously, it will depend on
the definition, the way the mechanism works. But somebody that has the 64th gate
all that’s really saying there’s a lot of stuff going on. The confusion is does any of it
matter. That’s where the confusion is. The confusion isn’t about coming to grips
with it. This is as good a mind as any mind. And when you get to the 47 you do get
to making sense, sort of. That isn’t the point.
So, basically what you’re looking at is you’re looking at a lot of activity. That means
that there are a lot of things that are going by the mind. And what mind is taking
that in, that not-self mind, that transferred motivation, that not-self strategy of the
open centers of the hanging gates, the way in which it does not see the way it’s
supposed to see, so all of that becomes its mental activity. And of course, that’s
really a dilemma considering that it’s not-self. Let alone that you’re thinking about
things that don’t matter. You’re thinking about things that don’t matter to you, but
that’s another story.
The 47th Gate: Realization
Then you go across to the awareness to the 47th gate, this
awareness to recognize what makes sense or not. Again,
this is judgment. This is a decision between a “this” and a
“that.” And how you get to that decision isn’t the point,
that you go from confusion to realization. Your mind,
whatever your mind may be, the construct of it, the basic
construct out of the personality crystal, the way in which
it’s intended to operate, its cognitive source, its motivation,
that all of that could operate through any of these and
often does.
After all, people with open minds, even if you have
definition in your mind, you have other things that are
open as receptors, your mind can work with any of it. It’s
not limited by what is there in the BodyGraph in terms of the way in which the
potential of this mechanical streaming works. It’s there anyway.
If you’re really going to understand the mind of a human being you have to go far
beneath this surface, which is just a style mechanism. It’s a style. There isn’t much
difference between doubt formulization and confusion realization. It’s why the 63
and the 64 are such funny gates. It’s a matter of style, it’s a different style. And it’s
a different style for the same thing underneath. The same potential of what mind
can be or is not. And in most cases is not. So confusion realization can seem to be
an incredible burden for the not-self mind. It can. The not-self mind is driven by its
anxieties.

The 11th Gate: Ideas
And when you get to the possibility, to the 11th gate, to the left eye, to ideas, again
this awareness to visualize a realization or not; but, a visualization based on what?
That’s the point. In order to master the cartography of the rave you need to see
that all of these ways in which information can move in the
BodyGraph allows you to begin to grasp the way in which a
being is going to function. It’s going to give you its surface
mechanics.
It’s going to show you that when it comes to trying to express
themselves verbally that they’re going to have this kind of
style or that kind of style. They may have a logical style or an
abstract style or an individual style, that you can tell the
refinement of the style. You can look at the lines and the
planets and see it all. But what you’re looking at is simply the style limitation for
what is the potential of mind. We are not looking at mind itself. We’re looking at
the Ajna streams. We’re not looking at mind. Mind is going to express itself through
the Ajna streams. It’s going to take on the style that is dictated by these streams.
It does not mean that the mind underneath is actually logical, abstract or individual.
That’s something to chew on. It doesn’t. It operates through the mechanism, the
limitation that is there. And again, this extraordinary transition that takes place
when you move from possibility to expression in this stream system. You get this
metamorphic process, this translation, because it’s a translation of the visual, the
inner visual, the inner sight to the acoustic or the verbal.
Inner Vision
Again, remember something about this inner vision. Inner vision is something that is
very, very powerful. Anyone with strong collective activations in these streams or
the opposite, very open in these streams, that there is tremendous potential for
internal visualization. By the way, internal visualization doesn’t mean that you have
to see things crystal clear; it is the perspective of mind, of looking on things, of
seeing things.
Remember where this comes from. This is not something that is built here in the
streams. It’s in the nodes. It is under the control of the Monopole and the way in
which we are moved in this life, that we are designed to see specifically an
environment that is there to nurture our uniqueness. And that it is this view that we
have that establishes the potential of visualization of mind. The fact that it may be
expressed in different styles, that the visualization of the 17 becomes the 62s “I
think,” or the visualization of the ideas becomes the 56 “I believe” it is simply the
limitation of the way in which that mind can be expressed and those minds are in
transference and they are not-self and they do not see correctly. You think about
the information that comes out of all that, that has always come out of all that. This
is the way in which the maia is established, particularly, for example, the 62nd gate.

LECTURE TEN
The Ajna Streams
The 62nd gate along with the 56th gate is the continuity of the maia. That the maia is
built on shared details, on shared patterns.
The 56th Gate: Stimulation
When you get to the 56th gate you get this manifestation of verbal description of
realization, the realization that is rooted in the experience of
the past. This realization of what it’s been and this
expression of what it can be, this is the maia, deeply
established here in the collective, shared with the other. And
they are mechanisms.
If you take anything away from this class today, this is what I
want you to take away. I want you to understand that these
are mechanisms. Yes, it’s important if you’re going to be a
professional to understand how these mechanisms work
because it gives you the style of the being. It also aligns
them to what is correct for them, their style. And yet, at the same time, the
perfection of what can move through the limitation is something else.
It means the liberating of the mind from being inner authority to begin with. It
means the alignment of the mind to its correct motivation. And only then, whatever
the potential is or not, whether defined or activated or open or closed within the
mental system, there is going to be a correct expression through that limitation.
We’re all models in the sense of Fords and Mercedes Benzes, we are all models. It’s
who the passenger is in the vehicle that makes a difference. If the passenger is
ready then there is something extraordinary that takes place. Most passengers are
asleep. It’s the way it goes.
The Knowing Stream
The 61st Gate: Mystery
All right let’s close this off with the knowing. My story, the 61,
the collective is ‘his story’ and the individual is ‘my story.’ The
pressure of the unknown or the unknowable; the pressure of the
unknowable is madness, or the potential of madness. That’s a
rather odd thing when you think about it, that the potential of
madness is built into the individual process. Again, the pressure
of this—the unknown and the unknowable—how that will be
handled is something that directly goes back to the nature of the
mind itself and how that mind is going to operate. A mind that is
full of anxiety, a mind that is deeply, deeply fearful is a mind that
under the pressure of the unknowable can fall apart, can become mentally obsessed,
and can go mad. It’s just something to think about.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
It’s one of the things about the pressure of the unknown. That is, within the context
of the program everything is present, but not everything is experienced. This is the
way we live. We do not experience directly electromagnetic fields and we don’t see
neutrinos, we don’t see microwaves, there are all kinds of things we don’t see, we
don’t hear, we don’t feel, we don’t know anything about and yet they are present.
Of course, this is this pressure that is there, the pressure that there are things that
are present that have not been grasped.
Again, what the 61 is going to be as a style it carries like any style its own particular
sexiness. These styles really mark minds—the doubtful mind, the mysterious mind,
and the confused mind. We have all these clichés about all of these things. Again,
to understand that the clichés about the way in which these processes operate is also
rooted in the fact that they have always been expressed by the not-self. The
dilemma of the 61 is that it does not work with the consistency of either the logic or
the collective. In other words, it is not constantly in the pattern and aware of it. It
is not constantly driven by the mental activity.
Everything about individuality is that it operates in a pulse. It is the pulse that, in
fact, creates the tension or the pressure dynamic of the 61. Everything is fine
because there is nothing and all of a sudden there is something; there is
uncomfortableness. And an uncomfortableness that is not connected to anything, it
isn’t connected to anything.
And of course, the way in which that is going to be expressed is going to be related
to the being. Let’s say that they have an open G Center. The open G Center in the
61 together can be a real trap, because suddenly the mystery is all about “I have to
find the right direction,” or the mystery is all about love and “I don’t know if I’ll ever
know that, and I don’t know if it’s ever knowable,” and they can get really, really lost
in all of that. To really understand the mind of somebody is not the same as being
able to read their chart and see how they act out style wise from the mental plane as
it’s configured in a BodyGraph. It’s just a way of saying that there is this kind of this
way of this sort of being.
The 24th Gate: Rationalization
When you go to the 24, the rationalization, the beginning of the
awareness process the potential, the potential is to struggle for
knowing. There is no judgment; immediately a differentiation.
You look at the 4 and the 47 and both of them judge, or not,
obviously. There is always the “or not.” But here the awareness
is not about what the knowing is. It’s the awareness to struggle.
Now, of course, the 24th gate in the not-self is usually very
uncomfortable to experience. I know it deeply because I have the
43/23 and I have the 61, I don’t have the 24. So I am very, very
aware of 24 energy.

LECTURE TEN
The Ajna Streams
One of the things that is so interesting about it is how obsessive it can become. The
gate is the return; over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
over again, struggling with what is not yet knowing, which is almost absurd. But
again, what that struggle will be over has nothing to do with the limitation and its
style. What that struggle is going to be about is going to be dependent on the way
in which that mind is constructed. That is, what is its transferred motivation, what is
its openness, what are the not-self strategies, what are the deep conditioning forces
that establish their mind and then you can see where it comes out and how.
The 43/23
One thing that is interesting here as we close out this stream is the 43/23 is the only
aspect here that we have that is a natural definition in the
BodyGraph. That is, being oppositions, people have this
nodally, people have this sun/earth, it is like the other
oppositions, the 40/37 or the 20/34, very prevalent in
Human Design.
So in looking at the 43/23 and understanding that they
are channel it’s very difficult, in a sense, to separate
them. It’s something to keep in mind. Because I’m one
myself, I tend to look at the 43/23 from the keynote of
the channel. That is, for me this channel is always about
structuring. And that structuring is always about success is efficiency. Everything
about the 43/23 is to try to structure something to be efficient. That’s the mundane
of it.
The 43rd Gate: Insight
If you look at it here style wise, this 43, the insight, you can
see what it is. It is spontaneous individual knowing or not.
In other words, it is not a direct process. The 4 judges the
pattern, what pattern is suspicious or not. And the 17
visualizes it.
The 47 recognizes what makes sense and the 11 visualizes
it. But here you have the awareness to struggle for
knowing, but no resolution because there is no direct line.
It may never come. It’s a pulse, after all, and it is about
the mutative style. This is where the new gets introduced instead of the ‘nothing
new under the sun’ Solomon systems. This is where the new can come. So you get
this spontaneous knowing or not.

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
The 23rd Gate: Assimilation
And then finally, of course, you have the expression in the Throat. And here you
have a very, very different way of metamorphosis. That is,
rather than what we see in the 17 and the 11, that is,
visualization that gets turned into descriptive language, so
somebody lays out descriptively the details so that you can see
it, somebody lays out the description of the realization for you
so you can believe them so they give you images to see. In
other words, that the acoustic gates translate the visualization
into language. One of those things in English that you can say
to somebody—do you see it, do you see what I mean, do you
see what I’m getting at. In other words, you can actually hear
in the language this movement of the visualization into words
themselves.
When you get to the 43/23 this is acoustic. This spontaneous individual knowing is
always acoustic. It is not visual. It’s my joke; I like to call the 43 the inner ear. It’s
this acoustic. So what you get from the 43 to the 23 is translation. Now, translation
is one of the most difficult things to do. I don’t think, because I’ve had experience
with it—I know many people and there are some in this classroom who have worked
at translating the material of Human Design, nobody more than Alok, and translation
is not what we think it is. It is the re-writing of something. It can’t be anything
else.
It’s very interesting to realize the dilemma in the 43/23, the genius to freak
dilemma, that the freak aspect of it, which is of course the most common aspect of it
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

LECTURE TEN
The Ajna Streams
is that you know what it is in your head, but you can’t translate it into words. You
don’t know how to express it. And you can see this is a mechanical impulse to
impart the knowing or not. In other words, “I know” is its voice; “I know” or “I don’t
know.” But to grasp how difficult it is to express it, this is where the problem is.
Most individuals, despite the fact that they are designed to know something,
whatever it may be, that most of them have enormous problems in trying to get that
across to another human being.
Despite the fact that I’m deeply individual I’m blessed with having a lot of logical
gates. It gives me an opportunity to find another kind of language, an easier
language, and of course I’m dealing with logical knowledge so I had to depend on
logic as a way of trying to get the information across. To do so as an individual is
very difficult. Somebody says to you, how do you know this, and you say, I know.
Yeah, ok, you know; how do you know? Yeah, well, I just know, they say. It’s the
kind of thing you hear over and over and over again.
We All Have a Style Configuration
Remember again, that what we’re looking at here is a style. It’s a style that is
imposed by the limitation of the BodyGraph. It is the Monopole game that pulls
together this very different personality and this very different design and locks them
together into a cycle of maia bio-form life. And the way in which they’re pulled
together, the way in which the matrix is established is the limitation on the way as a
being that they can express themselves. We all have a style configuration, if you
will. That’s our BodyGraph. What do you think type is? These are all style
expressions. They really are; behavioral modes, if you will, whether they are
physical modes or mental modes, it’s inherent in what we look at in the BodyGraph.
But I want you to see there is a much deeper perspective and particularly when it
comes to mind, to really grasp that this is the final frontier of being able to
technically provide people with a pathway to awareness and mental awakening. And
you cannot see that potential in a human being by simply looking at their BodyGraph
and looking at the way in which the Ajna streams are active or not. It’s only going
to give you their style. It isn’t going to give you anything else.
By the way, that’s quite remarkable that it does that, but nonetheless, that’s what
you’re going to get. You’re just going to get the style. To understand what the
substance is underneath, because there is incredible substance, you need to
understand the framework. That is the basis. And the framework is underneath.
In this work, when I look out at the world of Human Design and I see people and
their process of experimenting with inner authority, that what they’re really looking
for, what they want isn’t the peace that the body gives them; they want that for
their minds. That’s where the real dilemma is, is the mind. And it’s not about the
style. It’s about the substance that is there. The substance that is there is rooted
on whether or not the passenger is correct. It is a behavioral thing, will the
passenger behave according to what is correct, because if the passenger cannot be

correct, then the style is filled with a distorted substance, a distorted root, a
distorted source.
And I don’t care about what that means to the other, this is the world we live in. But
as an individual, as a being, to come to grips with the fact that you’ve never really
lived the full potential of your style, never, and just because you have an activation
doesn’t mean that you live out its potential. You glide along in the style limitation
that is given. And it is fueled by your not-self and all its dilemmas and all of its
problems and all of its nonsense, that in transference you lose the very ability to be
able to align yourself to a proper mental behavior.
When I first started and I looked at the BodyGraph I thought everybody is not-self,
how the hell am I going to do this. Everybody is not-self. And they are so caught up
in their styles. And your style isn’t simply what’s active. It’s the receptors. We
know what the style is of people with an open Ego or an open this or an open that,
we know. It’s a certain style. We see it; a certain way of operating. Because for me
it was clear that the BodyGraph isn’t the answer. The BodyGraph gives you a
technique to begin to find the answer. Strategy and Authority opens the door for
you to begin the journey towards the answer.
So, don’t get fooled. See it for what it is. It’s a style. We all have our styles. And
then look for the substance underneath. And look at your own design. And see very
clearly the way in which your mind is expressed, is expressed through these venues,
but the venues don’t control the quality of expression. They just provide an outlet.
That quality, that’s up to you. And it begins with letting go. If you don’t let go of
your mind being your inner authority you will never be anything other than an empty
shell, because that’s what style ultimately ends up being when there is no substance,
it’s just a shell.
Ok, nice to have my morning coffee with you; all of you take care, and until next
time; bye for now.

Lecture Eleven
The Solar Plexus Streams
All right, we come to our third selection of streams from the original rave anatomy.
It’s one of those areas that brings the deepest complexity into our lives. It is the
authority of 51% of humanity. And as such defines, in essence, the authority in a
sense of the planet. Of course, I’m talking about the Solar Plexus system. We are
also dealing with something that is mysterious in its own way. It is mysterious in the
sense that it is not simply what it appears to be, that our understanding of
emotionality and the consequences of emotionality, the processes of emotionality are
rooted in a single function of the Solar Plexus, which is its activity as a motor.
It’s one of the things you notice immediately when you’re looking at the streams is
that the streams that we have looked at have all been rooted in centers that are not
motors, not motors at all. As a matter of fact, the Ajna system has no direct
connection to a motor. The Splenic system does, but the Ajna system does not. So,
there is something deeply complex in that sense about the dynamic of the Solar
Plexus.

We know that even as a brief and surface understanding of the nature of being never
frees one from the coloring of this planet by the emotionality of our kind. And
everything about the emotional system is the distortion that it brings into life. Being
somebody who is very unemotional, that is, I only have one unconscious gate out of
the Solar Plexus system that my not-self life was a life that was filled with emotional
distortion. Something that you learn about as a musician in the electronic age is
that amplifiers are interesting in that they increase the potential of people further
and further away from you being able to hear what you’re doing. And yet, at the
same time there’s a fine line.
At a certain point all amplifiers can simply become distortion fields and distortion is
always hanging there in the shadow. Anybody that has an open center, that open
center takes in and amplifies what it receives. It is something to grasp about
somebody who has an open emotional system to understand that they are making
not-self decisions based on the distortion of what they’ve taken in. Let’s say that
you’re open emotionally and you meet somebody who is emotional and they’re sort
of in a lower edge of their wave, not very deep, but just sort of downish. Not so
much that that emotional person would even notice it, quite frankly, because they
are emotional and it’s different.
But for the unemotional being they’re going to take in that slightly down and in that
amplification they are going to relate to it in a distorted fashion. In other words,
they are going to project on it relative to their own state what that is and of course,
it’s going to be very far from what the source was, which makes amplification and
distortion so dangerous, in that sense. There’s not much that any being can do
other than to be themselves, after all. The awareness of the mechanics of things is
an intellectual delight, but it doesn’t change your life. Your life is changed through
decision making and how you make those decisions, nothing more, nothing less.
Nonetheless, it’s important to understand what emotionality brings to the world.
That is, if 51% plus of humanity are emotionally defined then it means the majority,
the simple majority of humanity has no truth in the now. There is no truth in the
now for humanity, period, whether it is through the activation of this as a field
through all those beings that are defined emotionally or the amplification and
distortion that is processed by the unemotional. We live in a densely distorted
emotional field.
I had two concerns when I began my journey. One was to see if I could awaken the
Sacral and return it to its rightful place as the primary authority on the planet. And
when I say primary authority I simply mean in terms of the life force to literally
regenerate the life force on the planet, to awaken Generators to take them out of
their slavery. The other was emotionality, to try to bring awareness into the lives of
emotional beings, and to be able to do so by seeing the emotional system
mechanically rather than “emotionally.” And in seeing the emotional system
mechanically one can begin to grasp the beauty of it. It is something that I had to
learn. It is, after all, our pleasure principle, it is the center of our sexual drive, it is
the place where food is a dominant key.

The Solar Plexus Streams
The Solar Plexus: Source of the Human Experiential Way
It’s very important to us. It is the source of the human experiential way. It is the
nature of what life is to be human. No other form has an emotional system. It
defines our difference from the rest of the life force of the planet. So, it is something
that is very profound in that sense. It is one of the things that I understand as a
Splenic being when I look at the counterpoint to the emotional being is that the
understanding that an emotional being in clarity, which is simply a matter of
patience and awareness that an emotional being in clarity has much more depth than
any Splenic being in its given moment.
And it is not about a comparison about which is better, because it isn’t about that. It
is about design; it is about the fact that we are different frequencies that we
accumulate data in different ways, that we interpret data in different ways, that we
experience phenomena in different ways. The emotional way is to savor. The
emotional way is to go through the wave, to go through the agony and the ecstasy,
to go through the high and the low, to go through the pain and the pleasure, to go
through it. And of course, that’s not always extremes from the far end of this and to
the far end of that. It can be a very narrow band, somewhere in the middle,
somewhere in the middle of this or that, whatever it happens to be. We are all
unique.
Emotional Beings: Waiting and Savoring the Wave
But it is the savoring of it. And of course, for those that are emotional it is the
authority, after all. This is the only thing that they’re ever going to be able to trust
in their life. So if they do not savor it, if they just take a quick bite and jump, then
they’re going to pay the price for it. It’s meant to be savored. And everybody has to
wait. It’s the thing about emotional beings; they want to be in a hurry. They want
to make that nasty comment when they’re annoyed. They want to make that
confession of love when they’re high on their wave. They want to do it right away.
They don’t want to savor it.
It’s like feeding a dog. The not-self emotional person is like feeding a dog. I can
give my dog the best food that you can make. It doesn’t make any difference to my
dog. That is, yeah, they like being fed, all creatures do. But they inhale food. It’s
gone, instantaneously, whoosh, no savor. This is about savoring. This is what it is
to be an emotional being. It’s not about enjoying. That’s different. Because there is
nothing about being emotional in which the consistency can be enjoying. It’s not
what it’s about. It’s the experiential process. It is the up and down. There is no
stillness in that. No, it’s to savor it. When you’re not afraid you can savor. When
you’re not afraid you can wait. When you’re not afraid you can make others wait,
what’s the rush.

The Stream of Sensitivity
The 19/49
Anyway, let’s take a look at our streams and let’s begin with the tribe. We’ve been
away from the tribe for awhile. We come back to the tribe here; we come to the
stream of sensitivity. And it starts, of course, with the fuel. That fuel is the 19th
gate and the 19th gate is one of those key
instruments. Of course, we are going through a
very strange time. Right now there is Neptune
sitting there in the 49th gate. Neptune is masking
what is going on beneath the surface here.
The 19/49 is a pathway that is under stress. The
49th gate, the 55th gate are the codon histidine.
This is where the mutation of the Solar Plexus is
taking place. And the 19/49 forms the foundation
of the tribal experiential way. That is, the tribal
process. It is the glue that holds the tribe together and the 19th gate is one of the
most profound gates that we have in the BodyGraph. That is, it has been
instrumental in determining our way of life throughout almost all of our history and
certainly all of the history of the seven-centered being. The 19th gate is the energy
to need and the energy to need food, territory, sex, protection, education, all kinds
of things. This is a deep, deep, deep pressure, a pressure to need, a pressure to
fulfill these needs.

The Solar Plexus Streams
And of course, on the other end of it is the 49th gate, the gate of rejection, the gate
of the butcher, the gate of the sacrificer and the sacrificed. It is the 49th gate that
has the awareness. And again, read in that clarity or potential clarity to recognize
what is needed or not, how much you will get to eat, because this is the tribe. It’s
interesting that the 19/49 is the root of what we call husbandry, that is, the control
of animals in order to preserve a food resource. And you have all those sheep in the
field that you raise. And every once in a while the 49 goes into the field and selects
one of the sheep for slaughter. And of course, for the tribe this is a major event
because everybody likes the taste of the meat, I suppose.
Anyway, it is here that the 49 will decide who needs what, who gets the best piece
and who gets the gristle. This is the tribe. This is the way that they work. And this
is something that is disappearing. It is here in the 19th gate that we have the need
for something that would make Francis Crick just grin and smile, because here you
have the chemistry for the need of God.
This is not a personality trait. It’s built into us, into our chemistry. It’s a kind of
glue. It’s a glue that holds tribes together. They need something that they can
worship. They need something that they can bow down to. They need it. They
need it to make sure that they return to source when they leave this plane. They
need it to pull everyone together into moral laws to control the gene pool.
The 37/40
And then we move to the possibility and the possibility and the expression are
different here, as they were when we were looking at the Splenic side. That is, that
the expression is in the Ego. It’s all about the Ego. And of course, the 37/40 is—
you’re going to miss it when it’s gone, some kind of song like that, because you’re
going to miss it when it’s gone. You really are. I don’t
know how many of you will be alive, so I don’t know, but
you’re going to miss it when it’s gone. We’ve been living
with a 37/40 background frequency since the time of
Shakespeare.
We have benefited deeply from it, this awareness of who
will or will not provide what is needed. Think about
friendship in the context of the tribe—awareness of who
will or will not provide what is needed. Yeah. And of
course, on the other side, the 40th gate, the expression,
the aloneness, the will or lack of will to provide for the needy. And you can see how
sticky the tribe is, how sticky this theme of support is because everything that you
see here, everything that you see in this entire stream is about one thing and one
thing only. It’s about need.

The Ratchet Wave
Need isn’t in and of itself a problem. That is, to know what is necessary can be an
extraordinary gift. But then again, to know what is necessary requires cognitive
acuity. That’s something that the not-self does not have. It does not. And so these
needs or the lack of provision for these needs creates quite a wave. And this stream
has a wave. It’s called the ratchet. You know what a ratchet is. It’s sort of a way
you crank things up by going two steps forward and one step back, and two steps
forward and one step back. It’s like the way you pull a car out of a ditch with a
ratcheting chain, yanking back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth and
slowly ratcheting it up until you can finally pull that thing out.
Now, think about the tribe. Think about this stream of sensitivity and slowly but
surely if you push these buttons you get the oddest kind of display, because you get
to see a kind of incongruity that is so strange. Think about it. You’re living with
somebody and you’ve been living with them for quite awhile. And one day you say
something to them that disturbs them. And of course, one of the things that you
notice about the tribe is that it doesn’t automatically have an expression in the
Throat. As a matter of fact, it is the most poorly represented aspect of circuitry in
the Throat. There is only one tribal voice, which is the 45. And here you see that
the stream does not end there. It doesn’t.
So, this thing is said to you. It doesn’t even have to be something that’s said. It’s
somebody who does something that they know that you don’t like and you know that
they shouldn’t do and they do it anyway. And in that moment nothing happens.
There is no release of emotional wave energy. There isn’t. It starts ratcheting. The
40th gate is the stomach, it sits in the bottom of the stomach and it doesn’t go away.
And the 40/37 is this bargain. You will provide what is needed. And it gnaws on
that stomach. It just does. And it ratchets up and it ratchets up.
Then one day, weeks later, it could be months later the same two people and one of
them does something that really is innocuous. It’s nothing; just them being them.
And suddenly there is this incredible explosion. What did I do, you say. Of course, it
has nothing to do with that particular moment. It’s when that ratchet has finally
worked its way all the way through until it’s built up to a pressure that has to be
released. That’s the ratcheting wave and that’s what happens every time somebody
tribal perceives that they’re not getting what they need.
The Stream of Emoting
Individuality is really an odd thing. It just is. And it’s an odd thing because it has no
grip. It has nothing to hold onto. If you’re tribal you have a lot to hold onto, you
hold onto everything. And you have it all around you. That is, your bargains and
your friendships and the support, there’s all these things to hold onto. If you’re
abstract you have your memories. You have a trail, you have continuity, you have
something. But individuality has nothing, because it is a pulse, an impulse, a thing
in the moment or not, in the moment or not, in the moment or not. And of course,

The Solar Plexus Streams
at the emotional level this becomes a dilemma. Most people who are, for example,
either 39/55s or 12/22s if you know them over a long period of time you do not
notice a lot of shifting in their emotional plane. You don’t.
And this is the by-product of not knowing which way to go wave wise, because of
course everything about the knower is not knowing. That is, the mechanics don’t
know whether to attach themselves to the down or the up, so we end up with
individuals who spike. And you can know an individual—12-22s are classic in this—
you can know them for many years and suddenly in an instant they turn absolutely
cold. They’ve spiked.
It’s much more dramatic in the 39/55, dramatic in the sense that if it’s not properly
integrated into the life it can be deeply melancholic, it can be potentially deeply
depressive and these can be spikes that are very volatile. That is, the kinds of
things in which one descends into dark domains that one doesn’t seem to be ever
able to get out of. Again, the tendency in the individuality is simply to plane. And of
course the plane is always waiting for a mutation. The moment the mutation comes
there is going to be some kind of transformation. But it again waits for the
mutation.
The 39/55
When we’re looking at this particularly stream we are looking at the most significant
stream in terms of the mutation of our species, anywhere in the BodyGraph. That is
the 12th gate is the gate that was the source of
the mutation that opened up the larynx about
85,000 years ago that led to the development in
the seven-centered being of what we understand
as the basic skills of reading and writing and
mathematics and all of these things. It opened
up the potential for the development of
language.
So, it was a key in terms of the evolutionary
development of our species, at least in terms of
our self-reflected potential. Now we are facing
the next major mutation, the final mutation, in fact, in this stream which is going to
take place in the 55th gate, which in fact, is a mutation that for all intents and
purposes began in 1781. It’s not like it’s going to start in 2027. It is going to
materialize in 2027.
So, we’re dealing in the 39/55, particularly, we’re dealing with something that is in a
state of transition. Everything about the 39/55 that is rooted in the 39 is its
provocation; that is, the energy to provoke or not. Again, to really understand the
39 is to understand that it is the pressure to mutate. It is a pressure to mutate. It
is one of the things that it wants most of all. And of course, what it tries to do, like
all the gates in the Root pointed at the Solar Plexus, what they try to do is they try
Rave Anatomy I is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

RAVE ANATOMY I
A Digital Book for Students
to fix the wave. The 19 says to the 49, I’m it, so you look after me. And the 39
says to the 55, I’m it, don’t you see that. The 39 tries to provoke the spirit of the
55. The 55 says, I don’t know. And the 39 tries to provoke it into saying “I know.”
It tries to provoke the mutation, to get out of the planing space.
So, whenever we’re thinking about the emotionality of an individual, again don’t be
deceived by that plane. That plane is not an indicator. It really isn’t. That plane is
simply the last time there was a mutation, because that’s basically what it is. And in
some people that’s years and years apart where they plane along on the same plane
until they meet the next impulse, the next mutative shift.
When I deal with the emotionality of the 39/55—one of my children is a 39/55,
watching that process from the moment that he came into the world it is so clear to
me how the plane that he is on at any given moment is something that can be
directly traced back to the last mutative event, whenever that was. It could be days,
it could even be hours, but normally it’s days or week previous. And there is a plane
that comes out of that.
So, it’s an interesting thing to recognize the tension that is there in this stream. The
tension is that the pressure is constantly a pressure to mutate when in fact the
mutation cannot be constructed. And that brings us to the 55, spirit/moods, its
awareness of provocation or not. And of course, in the case of the 55, your guess is
probably as good as mine as to what’s really going on in terms of the impact of this.
These streams as an example are rooted in the acknowledgement of the motor
function of the Solar Plexus system. It’s what I’m describing to you, the planing, all
of these things. And yet, at the same time, the beginning of the elimination of the
motor function as an impact on the way in which a gate operates begins with the
55th gate. And in evolutionary terms we are a few breaths away from a transforming
time. So, it’s something to keep in mind.
The other thing is where the stream of sensitivity is what we’ve lived as a
background frequency for these three or four centuries, the stream of emoting,
obviously including the 55th gate is an aspect of the phoenix that we’re going to have
to deal with as a background frequency beginning in a couple of decades. So this is
very much attuned to that, very much attuned to the potential for mutation.
The 12/22
When we get to the 12/22 we get to one of these interesting
channels. It is specifically social. That is, it is the only social
channel of individuality. And as the only social channel of
individuality it has a purpose. That is, its purpose is mutation.
Its purpose is to communicate mutation, which is why it’s the
design of a social being, or not, by the way. 12/22s can be
extraordinarily anti-social. It’s simply a matter of where they
plane. They can go through anti-social phases despite the fact

The Solar Plexus Streams
that they are 12/22 and have that—there are three kinds of smiles. I should do a
course on that one day. There are three kinds of smiles. There’s the 59/6 smile,
there’s the 40/37 smile and there’s the 12/22 smile. They are the smiles, by the
way; but anyway, some other time.
That 12/22 despite that smile can be deeply, deeply, deeply anti-social. The thing
about this unique sociability is again a by-product of this deep pressure, this
pressure to provoke, and this openness that’s there in the 22, awareness to provoke
social openness or not, to provoke the openness in order to establish the potential
for the mutation. In other words, in order to get them to be ready for mutation.
And the 12th gate, this stop codon, is manifestation of openness or not, the voice of
“maybe, maybe not.”
When I look at this streams, these movements out of the Solar Plexus, they’re about
life. If you want to really understand the life movie you look at these three streams.
The Solar Plexus is the center of what it is to be human. So we have the abstract
experiential way, which we’ll look at in a moment, which is the general outline, if you
will, of the treadmill of our movement around the wheel. You have the bonded life,
the communal life, the life of what is a fundamentally communal species written in
the stream of sensitivity. The potential for evolution, the potential for real change,
the potential for the difference in life is rooted in this stream of emoting. This is
what brings the higher and higher dimensions of the possibility of what it is to be in
this form. It carries the mutation. And without it we would have stasis.
The abstract runs along the ground. It does all the hard work, it really does. And
for all the hard work it does and for all the memories that it has, mutation can leave
it as naked and unprepared in just a moment, just like that. Mutation changes

everything; it’s about to change our world. It’s changed our world before. It will
change our world again.
One of the real dilemmas here is food and love. The 39/55 goes from anorexia to
bulimia. If you’re not-self and you do not understand what it means to be emotional
and individual, which is no easy thing to swallow, all individual definition produces
the chemistry of melancholy. To be emotional means to be emotionally melancholic.
For the not-self this is practically—it’s very, very difficult to deal with. And so, there
is a real dilemma in these beings until they comes to grips with what it is to be
emotional, until they can begin to see the beauty of savoring, the beauty of their
depth, how elegant life is when they take their time, how it loses it chaotic-ness and
becomes ballet, becomes grace. It’s such a different thing.
And again, this is not something that you can accomplish intellectually. It is a
decision process. It is a regimen, a discipline of awareness, this inner authority of
the emotional system, what it means to come to grips with it, what it means to really
be able to savor it.
The Stream of Feeling
The 41/30
Ok, finally we come to the human experiential way and the stream of feeling and the
41st gate. Here is our pressure and it’s the energy to feel, be alive, baby, you feel it,
the energy to feel. Not simply the energy to feel,
but the fact that it is the initiating codon, this is a
new kind of feeling. It is a focused thing. We
know the 41/30 is a channel that brings
recognition and you can see this in the 30th gate,
the clinging fire, this gate of feeling, awareness to
recognize a feeling or not.
Now, what is a feeling? A feeling is something that
can only be recognized in a wave. And when
you’re dealing with a wave of the emotional
system there’s nothing quite like it. What you’re
doing with the tribe is you have this ratcheting effect, you ratchet and you ratchet,
that’s the tribe. And the individual goes along and peaks and they settle on a new
plane and then they peak, and they settle on a plane, whatever the case may be,
mostly planing.
But when you have an abstract emotional being, they just climb and climb and climb
and climb and boom, they crash like a stone. So, this recognizing a feeling is the
beginning of a process of intensity. This is the whole thing about the abstract, how
intense it is. And this awareness to recognize a feeling or not, remember that this is
a potential, that the possibility is the awareness and power to release a feeling or
not, to be ready for inexperience.

The Solar Plexus Streams
The 35/36
Ah, the 36th gate is a beautiful thing. It can be a pain in the whatever, but it is a
penetrator. Symmetry is always beautiful in Human Design. The 48 on the other
side, same kind of mechanism, the logical stream on the outside, the 48th gate is the
well, collecting these drops and drops and drops of potential
solutions that turn into the possibility of depth. And here on
the other side in the symmetry is the 36th gate. And it isn’t
the result of a fuel that produces many things. It is the
honing in intensely on to a single thing, a single feeling and
being ready to deal with that single surface.
Everything about the 35/36 you can get that in the name of
the channel, that is, the experiential way, this whole process
of going through experience. And here is where the
inexperience is. This is the 36th gate. And despite its
inexperience it has the awareness and power to release that
feeling, it is ready to lunge into, dive into an experience that
it does not, cannot know necessarily how to make it through. This is the
penetration. This is why it leads to crisis. The first time you do anything chances
are that things will go wrong. They do.
This is the power of the 35 and the 36 together, these many, many different ways in
which life can be experienced, the way in which human beings all get to enter into
experiences. You have that in the way tribes raise their young, the way there are
these certain rituals that have to take place on the experiential plane, things that
they have to do in the outside world, steps that they have to take.
And of course, we know here in that in the 30th gate lies the mystery of the fates and
the interference in the best laid plans of these mice and men that we end up with all
of this variety on the experiential plane, all of which leads to a 35 which is THE gate
of expectation. The great sorrow of the individual being that is not-self is that life is
never satisfying. It’s just not satisfying. And it’s not satisfying because they cannot
rid themselves of the expectation, the failed expectation. And not that the
expectation in and of itself was incorrect, but that somehow someone else was to
blame.
The Collective Wave
Ah, the collective. The tribe, when they are most upset with somebody still see them
as family and that somehow protects that union. But the collective isn’t like that.
The collective doesn’t have support as its keynote; it is ‘share.’ And when there is a
crisis and the expectation fails, there’s always somebody to blame. You can blame
the fates, you can blame the gods, you can blame your friends, you can blame your

lovers, you can blame your dog, you can blame and blame and blame and blame and
blame.
And here is one of the crank-ups of the emotional system, the way the wave can get
so ugly because remember this is a crash wave. And you build up all of that
intensity of feeling. You have that thing that starts down here, this deep pressure of
the 41 that launches everything, pushing and pushing until it becomes this burning
fire of desire that is there in the 30 and the sneaky fates laying out obstacles as one
approaches the threshold of its possibility. Oh, you want that so bad you can taste
it. And then it happens. Oh, the wave just goes whoosh, because it can never live
up to the expectation, the fire that was burning. It can’t. Never for the not-self;
there is no awareness here. There’s no potential for awareness here. It is the
driving mechanism. It moves us on this plane. It moves us into our diversity of
experience, the expansion of the maia, blindly.
We Live in a Dense Distorted Field
Solar Plexus beings on this planet are unaware. It’s their frequency that we live
with. A world that is driven by expectations, lost in expectations. Where is the
freedom, the food, the health care, the kindness, the humanity, where is all that?
Human beings coming into the world, what can they dream now, the billions of them
that don’t have internet. We live in a dense distorted field. It is the emotional
system that brings this; no blame, no fault, because there is no blame or fault, there
is ignorance. Nothing one can do.
But for those emotional beings that have a fractal to meet the mechanics of this, to
understand what it is for them to be such a being, what it means for them to be
correct. Well, every other person they meet they can transform their relationship
with them. For every person who is emotional there’s somebody who is not. And
the beings that are unemotional create the greatest distortion on the planet because
they are distorting the amplified emotional field of the not-self. It is no mystery why
we have such an ugly planet. It is no mystery why human beings can descend to the
lowest possible levels. It’s no mystery at all, it’s very straightforward.
The Emotional System is Changing
The emotional system is changing. And for me that means that we are finally
shedding our links to animal-ness. Not that I think that that’s going to be realized in
a way that has anything to do with you and I. But there’s a mystery in the 19/49.
That mystery is that not simply there, but also in the 12/22. Mammals, every lower
form or the forms other than human, no sense calling them lower, they’re just
different, and they all have cross-speciel potentials. That is, gates that will open up
out of a center but do not go to the other end, the way in which all life integrates
together is through these cross-speciel connections.

LECTURE ELEVEN
The Solar Plexus Streams
And between humanity and mammals there are three, two of which are rooted in the
emotional system. The primary, which is the 19/49, followed by the 12/22, it’s
through the 12/22 that human beings make friends with mammals, this social
mutation. It’s the way in which these archetypal relationships like human and wolf,
the way these relationships opened up is along this line. There is another
connection, the 17/62, but this is basically Pavlov’s dogs. This is about training
animals, training their behavior.
But the 19/49 is primary because this is about food. It is the deepest connection
between human and mammal. And obviously, this is something that is also about to
come to an end. That disconnection from the Root pressure, need, these deeply,
deeply human tribal needs will no longer be impacting the 49th gate, nor will they be
impacting this stream of sensitivity. It is bringing out another quality, not for us, but
something that is clear that the tension and hostility, the violence, the aggression
that is present on the planet that that’s something in a sense that’s being bred out of
us. It is one of the by-products of removing the motor function from the Solar
Plexus.
By the way, it isn’t to state, and I want this to be very clear that the Solar Plexus is
in and of itself violent, like anything else we are a life form, there are always aspects
within us about being able to maintain our viability. No, it is because of the very
power of the emotional system and the very incompetence of the not-self that
because this is connected to the way of our being that distortion leads to all of those
things, the distortion of ratcheting up your anger because somebody has been
disloyal to you in your bargain, you ratchet that up enough and you have the French
Revolution, or whatever you want to point your finger at. No, it’s in the not-self and
its deep distortion.
It has been very, very enjoyable for me to come back and go through these original
constructs in Rave Anatomy. I’m even considering somewhere down the road doing
another selection of them. I think the book had 160 or 170 pages. It’s just an
interesting thing. It reminds me of how all the components that were necessary for
the knowledge were always there, that is, to grasp the knowledge. And how
beautiful it is to look back on these themes that I first laid out nearly 20 years later,
both to appreciate them for what they were but also to see how far or how deep the
knowledge has become since then. Not that it changes any values, but how much
more depth, how much more I could or could not say.
Looking at these streams I could do a different morning on the same streams for a
semester because in fact that is where we are now in the nature of the knowledge.
That is, as a science of differentiation, the bedrock of this knowledge is detail. And it
is detail as we go through layer upon layer upon layer until we’ve exposed the
complete mechanical nature of our maia. It’s a great journey. And it’s a wonderful
one to be able to share, and to be able to share with all of you.
So, I’m going to maintain this process of doing these kinds of general programs. I
think it’s enjoyable for newcomers as well as professionals and the like. It’s fun for
me to go back and do these things. So, we’ll see what comes up. There are some

interesting things coming up in the new year which will start September 17th. I’m
going to be having an open house next week on Wednesday in the JAM Player in the
IHDS reception room, the free access classroom. By the way, if you can’t get in or
you can’t make it, there will be a download of the description. August 1st to the 10th
is the early bird discount, so if you want to take advantage of the savings on the
discounts, that’s the time to do it.
Other than that, I want to thank all of you for participating in this program, it’s been
great. I hope you’ve enjoyed it. Enjoy your summer, enjoy the movie; take care,
bye for now.
