Introduction to “Partnership Analysis”
This is a transcript of the Four-Part Partnership Analysis Certification training that
was held online in June of 2005 for Human Design analysts. This course included
for the first time three classrooms and multiple translations.
Ra teaches the basis of all readings: All analysis is a motivational tool to introduce
human beings to the need to operate correctly. He trains analysts to understand
what their responsibilities are as professionals. Celebrity charts are used to illu-
strate and synthesize the elements needed for a practical analysis. A summary of
these elements are in the Appendix on the last page.

Lecture One
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
I want to welcome you all. We have quite a gathering in a number of classrooms
and we have a very sophisticated simultaneous process going on. We also have a
number of people who are in the extremities of our time zones who, though they're
not necessarily here live all the time, will be picking up the audios and our part of
the process. It's actually the largest partnership gathering. I think there are 25
analysts worldwide who are registered for this course. So, it's something that is
very encouraging in what I think of as a win-win situation for everyone in doing
these certificate courses virtually.
Partnership Readings without the Partner
We're going to go through a very interesting process over the next four days. But I
do want to begin at the very beginning and make sure about a number of things. I
was a professional analyst, I still work as a professional analyst, in a sense, and
I've been doing it longer than anybody else so it's quite a load
of experience. I did hundreds of live partnership readings for
partners. That's why I call it a “Partnership Reading.”
The vast majority of Partnership Analysis requests that you
get are not from partners. It's very rare. One of the rarest
things for me in my experience in working in Human Design
was to have a couple interested in Design at the same time, a
couple who wanted to investigate, were interested in their de-
signs and wanted to know more about the nature of their rela-
tionship. Or couples who ended up looking for information about themselves be-
cause they were having dilemmas in their relationship.
It was always, for me, a very exciting experience. I had a technique where I had
them sit them down on either side of me and the three of us would face their
charts. I would have the chart of each partner in front of them and the composite
in front of me. It would be quite a journey to go through this process in the flesh,
in the aura and to deal with the often sharp edges of what mechanics reveal.
The real dilemma, and a dilemma I dealt with all the years I've worked as a profes-
sional analyst, I never wanted and rarely ever bothered with giving somebody a
Partnership Analysis if they came alone. And this is usually the case. When some-

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
body gets involved in Human Design, one of the most exciting things in Human De-
sign is to see the way we connect to each other. The real principle of our process is
this connection process.
And obviously, it's fascinating for many people, not everyone, to be able to look at
these kinds of connections. It is a natural thing for somebody who is in a partner-
ship to be interested in seeing how their partner connects to them, how they im-
pact and so on. But a natural partnership reading, when there is only one person
and the other partner isn't participating, I have a privacy problem. I really do.
Perhaps that's me. I mean, I'm not good at Ra's laws. This is not really my trip.
But it is something that always made me uncomfortable.
Human Design is enormously revealing. I've had the experience of years of dealing
with very straight people. What I mean by “straight people” is people who have
rarely had a chance to step out of the box in any way in this life. It's enough of a
shock for them to even get to the point where they're desperate enough to want to
seek knowledge about themselves. But the moment they are looking at their rela-
tionship and they're only looking at it from their perspective of their dilemma, it's
so revealing. They go through such a shock.
The revealing of all of that information the way you can in a partnership, about
somebody's partner when the partner isn't present, for me, it's a kind of aiding and
abetting of black magic. Now, I don't like power trips. I don't like empowering the
not-self with the power to power trip. I'm deeply uncomfortable with that. I really
believe that partnership is something that is a mutual analysis process. In other
words, what I originally hoped for in offering partnership certification is that I would
have analysts who were really a specialist in dealing with partners live, not dealing
with one and dealing with the dilemmas of the perspective of one, but really being
able to do Partnership Analysis.
Unfortunately—there is an old Chinese saying about good news, bad news, who
knows—it may, in fact, have turned out to be just one of those oddities of me. I
look at it now and I see very clearly that somebody who has the ability to look at
partnership and do analysis, it's essential for them to have varying levels of how
they approach offering analysis information. In other words, one's approach in
dealing with a partner who is coming alone and is curious about the other is very
different than one's approach when you're dealing with both of the partners and
they are present. In other words, there are different levels to it.
Projector Readings
There's also something else, and again it has to do with my own maturing process
as not so much as the logical, experimental being, but what I've learned from the
abstract, the experiential process and to see that so much of my inner depth in the
knowledge of Human Design has come from experience. One of the things that ex-
perience has taught me is that Projectors have to be dealt with in a very different
way.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
It's something I've noticed. Recently, I've been involved with a number of Projec-
tors and I've been introducing a new kind of reading. It's my experiment with
them. What basically I'm doing is that I touch only on the surface of their design,
but I really focus on the people around them. In that sense, it's a kind of Partner-
ship Analysis, but the partners aren't present.
The Need for Differentiation by Type for Readings
But after all of these years of experience and dealing with the Projector conscious-
ness, it's so obvious to me that this is the only way in which they themselves can
learn and master the system and be comfortable in their own skin. So, what is
Partnership Analysis? Is it just one sort of carte blanche for everything, or is it very
differentiated? For me, I'm beginning to see the need for the differentiation.
For example, the way in which one presents connections to a Projector is something
that's very important. I would never give a Generator a partnership reading alone.
Now of course, that may annoy Generators, but what to do. I don't mind. I'm a
Manifestor. The other thing is that Manifestors, if they ever show up, are beings
who can be given a certain level of Partnership Analysis alone because it's essential
for the adult Manifestor to understand their impact. And there‟s no easier way to
demonstrate a Manifestor's impact than to show the way in which their aura, the
way their configuration impacts those people around them, the people they are
connected to.
Introduce Projectors to Human Design through Connection Analysis
So, what I've learned over the years and what I hope to give you in this certifica-
tion process is the benefits of this experience: To begin to open up the way in
which we look at doing Partnership Analysis, to see that there are various levels of
it, and begin to recognize the importance of the replacement of the individual anal-
ysis for the connection analysis for the Projector.
I think this is going to be one of the real revolutions in being able to awaken Pro-
jectors and I think this is something that is essential: Introducing Projectors to
Human Design through connection. Nobody is going to be better equipped for that
than those of you who go through this process of understanding how to look at
charts and how to deal with the impact of mutual conditioning.
I think as we move forward it certainly is something that I will recommend to na-
tional organizations. It's national organizations that have the responsibility of
training analysts, to recommend to national organizations that the way analysts are
trained to be able to do a Projector analysis the first time is something that really
has to go through a transformation in which the connection concept really has to
dominate.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Again, we really have to see that when it comes to any level of analysis, we really
have to pay attention to Type and the nuances that Type brings. But also to be
clear that doing an analysis for someone is a way of—the knowledge is nice, it's al-
ways nice, it's always interesting to give people a glimpse, an insight. But for me
all analysis is a motivational tool to introduce human beings to the need to operate
correctly. For me every reading, and it doesn't matter what level the reading is
and it doesn't matter how long the student is involved in whatever, my emphasis
always remains the same. It's the dilemma of characteristics.
Dealing with the Not-Self
It's interesting for you to understand about any kind of Partnership Analysis that
you're dealing with the not-self. You're dealing with a not-self that has a problem
with somebody else who is not-self who is coming for some kind of hope, solution,
whatever the case may be. We have to see right from the beginning that the first
thing in dealing with a partnership is that you do not know how anyone is going to
be able to deal with their relationship because the fact is that what you're offering
them is a possibility to act correctly as themselves.
It's where it all begins. Over and over again, whenever I deal with human beings
and their relationship problems, it's always the same. They rarely got in correctly.
It doesn't mean they never get in correctly, by the way. These things happen all
the time. There are these potentials out there that a Generator is asked and they
go "uh-huh." But the vast majority of relationships do not begin correctly. If they
don't begin correctly, then you're certainly not going to be the person who you
could be with the person you could be with. It's your homogenized, conditioned
not-self being with another homogenized, conditioned not-self.
The Bedrock of a Partnership Analysis: Act Correctly as Yourself
You have to see that if everybody was awake and knew their design, Partnership
Analysis would be a delight. It would be a delight because it's very straightforward.
It's right to the point and it's very straightforward. It's not like that. You're dealing
with the not-self. The thing that I have to return to over and over again is that
when somebody comes to you for a partnership reading, don't assume that your
responsibility is simply giving them the analysis of how they connect to somebody
else, because it really isn't the point.
The bedrock of anything you're going to do in a Partnership Analysis is talk about
them being themselves and how they need to operate correctly. Most relation-
ships, despite the fact that they do not start correctly, have a potential the moment
you add real understanding. You add a way to grasp the way in which beings inte-
ract. But only through the experimentation of a couple willing to act correctly as
themselves can there be any advantage to that Partnership Analysis.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
What's the advantage to one person who knows that they have to be asked and
they have a partner who doesn't ask? And then they tell their partner that their
partner has to ask them and the partner doesn't want to ask them. Then what do
you do? Why should I, because you're interested in that stuff? You have to deal
with the fact that you're dealing with the not-self. It's the first thing for any pro-
fessional to understand. Just because somebody has a gleam in their eye that they
want to know something doesn't mean that that gleam is anything other than their
fractal line dragging them along to you.
Realigning a Relationship through Agreement to Experiment
But the real work is not saying, ah you have this and you have that. The real work
is saying that the only thing that's going to work for you is if you, as a being, are
operating correctly as yourself. Everything begins there. And the only realignment
in a relationship—which is why I've always had this feeling about how important it
is for a couple to be present—is a mutual agreement to experiment. Out of that
mutual agreement to experiment, it is remarkable what can happen. It really is.
Couples who have been together for many, many years suddenly discover that not
only have they not really known each other, but they're interested in who each oth-
er is becoming. There are all these geometries out there, but awareness is the
thing that makes the difference.
So, I want you to see very clearly that when you're doing the job mechanically, of
illustrating how the mechanics of a relationship work, you have to understand what
your real role is in that. Your real role is to reinforce the experiment in that person
to honor their Authority. If you're going to say, “Look Joan, John is defining your
emotional system and you have that open,” Joan has to realize that her reaction to
that has always been to try to avoid confrontation and truth. And just saying that
John makes her emotional isn't going to surprise Joan.
The only thing that can really lead to a surprise is for Joan to understand what that
has done to her relationship and how important it is for her to begin to operate dif-
ferently, to deal with the other, to not avoid the confrontation, to find the truth and
not to do that as a conscious task, but to do that as somebody who is operating
correctly as themselves.
One of the dilemmas with the not-self is when you say you have to compromise
with your partner and you always have to do this thing because your partner has
the whole thing. You give that to the not-self and the not-self will feed on that.
Not only is it going to feed on that, but ultimately it's going to fulfill the destiny of
what compromise always brings. Compromise always brings a tension that can de-
stroy a relationship; always.
By telling the not-self that they're in a position where they are helpless and there is
nothing they can do about it, either love it or leave it, the not-self when it's unhap-
py will just leave it, not deal with it, not understand it, not operate correctly as

themselves. The information that you can bring to somebody—I love these
rhymes, I don't know where the hell they came out of me. It was in Austria in the
early '90s and I was trying to illustrate in a kind of childlike way the way in which
human beings come together. When you say to the not-self, “You're a 6 and 3,
better to be free,” well, if they don't have a deeper understanding of themselves,
that can be a very heavy trip for them, because it's about them.
Most relationships are based on the fact that the moment somebody is interested in
you, there's a part of you that's relieved. That's all; relieved. There's a part of you
that's so happy that somebody values you, so happy that somebody thinks you are
something special. It's why one of the most common questions in all relationships
is, "Why me?" “Why do you love me?” “Why do you care about me?” These are
questions that honestly nobody can ever answer.
It's so simple underneath. There is this deep, deep, deep insecurity in human be-
ings. It's a deep insecurity. The not-self is a frightened, frightened thing always
trying to work out through a strategy, always trying to be in control of its life, al-
ways, always, always. The not-self is so deep, so dense. You have to see that be-
cause you know it as a theoretical construct and you've experienced the not-self in
yourself and because you work with this professionally, there is an assumption that
the other can grasp it, too. It's not so easy.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
Begin with Yourself
Until you begin with yourself, the relationships you have with others are always re-
lationships that are always a dilemma. Each day that I do the daily transits, I have
this very strange feeling, this recognition that as I speak, the description of the im-
print is being lived out in the world blindly. It's almost frightening to think about
how homogenized and controlled humanity is. It's spooky.
Most human beings have not in any way come close to mastering their relationship
with the whole, with the vast program that is constantly feeding and transforming
our consciousness, let alone their capacity to recognize, truly, their relationship
with the other and to be able to enter into those relationships correctly. I don't
mean to start all this off with a lot of heavy, depressing blah, blah, blah. But I do
want to make my point. And I want to make sure that you grasp it.
I have clients all the time who say to me, “Ra, I want an Incarnation Cross read-
ing.” Well, good. I'll give you an Incarnation Cross reading. I'll give you five or six
minutes of real Incarnation Cross and I will give you 40 minutes of "here's your di-
lemma." And when somebody comes to me for a Partnership Analysis, yeah, ok, I'll
give you your five or six minutes, unless they're a Projector, but I'm going to tell
you your dilemma because that's the point.
Everybody thinks that if they know something about something, they can fix it.
This is the vanity of will. It's just not so. All you can do about the nature of your
relationships is to begin anew. You begin as yourself. And of course, we know in
the reality of the maia this is often deeply difficult. Over the years, the majority of
my clients have been women. What do you do with a woman who has some dense
male that she has two or three children with and all of that becomes enormously
complex, very difficult and often very painful?
It's not so easy for human beings to begin anew. All of this stuff; you have to see
that the people who are coming to you are at the bottom rung of the knowledge
chain in terms of mechanics. They don't know how things work. They don't know
how they work. So when somebody comes to you for a reading, I don't care what
reading it is, when they come to you for a reading, it's always the same in the
sense that the accent you bring has to be about them. If you're operating correct-
ly, ok, this is what this means and this is what this means and this is what this
means. And if you're operating correctly you're going to see. You're going to be
able to see it.
Human Design Brings Relief
I said I was going to start at the beginning, for me that's really the beginning. The
beginning is to understand who's coming in the door and what the responsibility is
as a professional. After all, we are here to really relieve human beings. If Human
Design does anything to the general grouping of beings that come to this know-
ledge is that it brings relief. It brings an ability to be able to be more comfortable

with oneself. This is what we're here to do when anyone comes for any reason,
but, particularly when they come for partnership.
They have to see that regardless of how they meet the other, they themselves can
only transform their relationship through themselves, through operating correctly,
and in operating correctly, being able to make decisions as themselves to begin to
transform their relationship, at least to the point that they can be comfortable with
themselves within a relationship.
We are All Designed to Connect
When we're talking about connection, when Asi and I were working on the devel-
opment of MMI, I really wanted a different name for this kind of software and “con-
nection” is really what it's all about. Everything about partnership—and by the
way, I'm going to look at different kinds of partnerships, siblings and parents and
children. Today we're going to begin with some star-crossed strange lovers, but
nonetheless we'll take a look at all the examples.
I want you to see that the thematics, regardless of what appears to be the dilem-
ma, whether this is the lover drama, or the mother/son, father/daughter, broth-
er/sister, sibling rivalry, whatever the drama happens to be, the themes are the
same. They operate in the same way. It's just about connection. We are all de-
signed to connect.
I think one of the real epiphanies for me in the very, very beginning, I mean at the
very beginning, days after I received the knowledge, was this sense of babies, little
ones coming into the world and suddenly being able to see that the little ones com-
ing into the world are just as powerful as the big ones who are going out. It was
extraordinary to look under the skin, to break through the sky of the illusion of the
vehicle to see this incredible dynamic and to recognize that this dynamic comes
whole into the world with birth. It's not just the conditioning of the mother to the
child, but the incredible conditioning of the child to the mother. How powerful
these beings are.
Yet we look at the surface and see something else. One of my credos about being
a good analyst is that what when somebody sits down beside you, see them in their
crib. See them when they were a baby, understand what happened to their design
when they were a baby and then you can understand the conditioning that trans-
formed their life. And you can see where the power of their not-self is. You can
see it immediately.
In order to be able to do any kind of partnership, you have to be able to truly grasp
the charts and you have to be able to understand what the deep conditioning of
that chart is. Remember something about all connection: All connection operates
through a genetic receptor system. We are open in certain ways. And it doesn‟t
matter whether that openness is in relationship to a parent or a child or a relative
or a worker, whatever the case may be, we all have these built in receptors.

John Lennon: Emotional Generator
I've put up the chart there of John Lennon. [Lennon‟s birth data for this course:
October 9, 1940 at 18:30 in Liverpool, UK.] If you take a look at this chart, the
first thing you're going to notice is that here is somebody who is a single definition.
It is a very simple single definition. And here you have somebody who is the true
example of an emotional Generator. There are certain things to understand about
types of Generators. There are archetypes.
For example, there is only one, real Manifesting Generator and that's somebody
who has the channel 20/34. This is a pure Manifesting Generator. All the others
are Generators who have manifesting potential. But the only pure, true Manifesting
Generator is the 20/34. The only true emotional Generator is the 59/6. After all,
like the 20/34 being the only direct connection between the Sacral and the Throat,
the 59/6 is the only direct connection between the Sacral and the emotional sys-
tem. All other emotional Generators are Generators who have emotional Authority.
But this is the pure emotional Generator.
When you're dealing with a pure emotional Generator, you're dealing with some-
body who can only make decisions in response over time. This is a sampler. You
can see right away that this is somebody who is under enormous conditioning pres-

sure. He has seven open Centers. When you have seven open Centers, you begin,
if you start calculating it gets kind of frightening, to see that there are levels and
levels and levels of not-self strategies that are built into all those open Centers.
Hanging Gates
If you look at all the gates that are sticking out all over the place, if you look at the
Ego with its hanging 51 and 21, if you look at each and every one of these gates,
these are the receptors and they're looking for connection. They're looking for it on
their own. And when I say "looking for it," I'm anthropomorphizing, but the fact of
the matter is that those hanging gates are always waiting for the potential that
comes when there is a connection at the other end.
This is our genetics. What it is saying is, you have all these receptors, you have to
meet something. The moment you meet it, there is a basic genetic attraction that
is there. It's fundamental. When you're looking at that person and you see they
have an undefined
Spleen, they hold on to
things that aren't good
for them. They have an
open Root Center and in
that open Root Center
they're always impatient;
they're always trying to
get rid of pressure. They
hate pressure.
They have an open Ego,
so they're always trying
to prove they're worthy;
they're always trying to
prove they are of value.
You have an undefined G
Center so they're always
looking for love; they're
always looking for the
right direction. An undefined Throat, always trying to attract attention. An unde-
fined Ajna Center, always pretending they're certain about things. And an open
Head Center is thinking about things that don't matter.
Well, my goodness. You end up with somebody who is conditioned through all of
that openness. All of those not-self strategies make up the way in which this not-
self makes its decisions. Not the difficult-being-patient, playing hard-to-get Strate-
gy that's in that Sacral/emotional connection.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
Yoko Ono: Triple-Split Manifesting Generator
Now, if you take a look at Yoko Ono, you're looking at another Generator. [Ono‟s
birth data for this course: February 18, 1933 at 20:30 in Tokyo, Japan.] And inte-
restingly enough, here is somebody who is a true Manifesting Generator. That is,
this is a 20/34, but you see that this is a triple-split definition. There's a 40/37, the
emotional connection to the
Ego that's split off. And you
can see the 64/47 that is
the Head to the Ajna split
off. So here's somebody
who is a triple-split defini-
tion.
Remember something about
triple-split definitions. Splits
are something that are very
important to understand in
their dynamics. For exam-
ple, if you're doing the part-
ner analysis for somebody
who is a simple-split, that
is two areas of definition,
then you know that their
partnership is something
that is exceedingly important for them, because for every split definition partner-
ship that is something that is very important for them. The bridges they need be-
come the deepest conditioning forces in their life and they're all looking for that
bridging so they can have the illusion of being whole. Their wholeness becomes a
kind of clinging to whoever is providing the bridging.
But when you're dealing with a triple-split definition, they're very different. The
moment you have these three different areas, in fact, you do not have an interest
in being whole. Triple-splits and splits are very different from each other in the
way in which they meet the other. The way in which the triple-split finds its whole-
ness is simply through the mundane movement of its life.
In other words, as it moves through life and through the public aura, this is the way
in which the zones find a continuity in their process. But triple-splits do not like
being locked into a relationship that locks them into what is an artificial wholeness
that they're very conscious of the fact is coming from the other person. In other
words, they're conscious of being—I was going to say something harsh like
trapped, imprisoned—they're limited. They can feel very limited by somebody who
is hooking up all those aspects.
So here you have two distinctly different kinds of forces. Of course, these are the
obvious laws of our genetics. We're always attracted to what we're not. We're al-

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

ways attracted to what appears to be, even if you don't see it on the surface, the
opposite underneath the surface. So here you have somebody who has seven Cen-
ters defined who is attracted to somebody who has seven Centers that are unde-
fined. This is just basic dynamics in that.
Where is the Vulnerability?
So, the first thing you really need to grasp is where the vulnerability is. In the
simple-split definition, the keys to understanding the not-self are in the bridging
gates, the gates that will bridge their simple-split. But when you're dealing with a
triple-split definition, it's like dealing with a single definition. In other words, the
most dynamic aspects of their not-self are going to come out of their open Centers.
So here is somebody, who like John, has an open Spleen, is insecure, holds on to
things that aren't good for her. At the same time, the open Root Center, this dis-
taste for pressure and whenever pressure is around to try to unload the pressure.
One of the things you have to see about relationships and Centers is that some of
them are so revealing that you don't even need to look anywhere else in a relation-
ship. In other words, if you have a couple where you have one partner having an
open Root Center and the other partner has a defined Root Center, without aware-
ness, this is going to be a very, very uncomfortable situation because the defined
Root is placing pressure on the undefined Root. And of course, the open Center is
always amplifying. The open Root Center is always trying to get rid of the pres-
sure. Eventually they can get to a point where they feel they can no longer get rid
of the pressure; they will get rid of the pressure riser. This can lead to all kinds of
dilemmas.
How Do the Centers Mix with Each Other?
There's also something very important to see: How the Centers mix with each oth-
er. In other words, you have Centers that are open. For example, he has an open
G Center; she has a defined G Center. What does it mean to amplify that G, to
John Yoko

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
take on somebody else's conditioned identity? And to take on somebody else's Ego
power, as an example, with his open Ego and her defined Ego. In other words, one
of the first areas to look at is the basic conditioning areas.
Remember, if somebody had their individual design, they've been introduced to the
fact that they have these open Centers that are open to being conditioned and
here's the by-product of that conditioning. So the moment you're looking at them
within a relationship, it's something to remind them of. It's something for them to
understand, that here is where the pressure is coming.
The advantage with partners if you're doing them together is that you can show
how each is impacting the other, this sense that it's a fair game in that way. Eve-
rybody gets to impact everybody else. In the not-self, the attractions are always
mutual. They're mutual in the sense that these are basic connections, which at the
not-self level having somebody define it, at least initially it‟s something that feels
good.
So, we're looking at two things. First, you have to know the vulnerability of the
being. You have to know their design. You have to know what their dilemma is.
You have to know what their configuration brings. For somebody like Yoko with her
configuration as a triple-split, and here is somebody who, without guidance, there
are going to be real problems in the life. Here's somebody who can so easily feel
trapped by another human being. At the moment you go into a reading with
somebody and you see just the basic configurations, you begin to understand
where the dilemmas are going to be.
Stay on the Surface
Most Partnership Analysis is what you can bring to your view of the surface. It's
the surface. I don't know how many times I have said this, but I know I have said
this a lot: Everybody is on the surface. The vast, vast, vast majority of humanity is
stuck right there on the surface with their open Centers and their limitations.
You're dealing with two Generators who are emotional. You have a potential of a
frustrating, emotionalized relationship. There are just basic things that are there.
The more you look at the basics—one of the things about being well educated in
Human Design is the tendency to want to go deep. Let me dig underneath, let me
look at their Colors and all of these line variations and let me get this and this, and
how this and this comes together. Please give me a break and
give them one. Save that kind of stuff for advanced analysis
of God knows what. Working as a professional analyst is
working at the very surface. It's working at the surface with
people. It's reminding them about the surface because the
surface is the most difficult thing to get past. It's like trying to
break through the sky. It is very, very difficult.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Everything about what we do is that our work is geared towards breaking through
the surface for people. And you can only do that by constantly seeing what the
surface does to them. The nuance that you think you've discovered in a line,
they're stuck with the brute surface of whatever the inflated conditioning brings.
They're stuck at the very surface of it. When you say to a triple-split who comes
into the room, “You don't like to get locked in,” they think you're a genius, but it's
just being a triple-split.
You can begin to understand the language necessary, the focus you need to bring
in your descriptions to them by staying on the surface. Don't go deep. If they re-
ally want, later on after they've experimented with what they've learned, then
there is always the possibility you can go deeper with people. Most of them don't
care. If you can give them basic mechanics that will help them deal with their rela-
tionship and their responsibilities to each other as beings, you've done a great job.
And most of them will just be satisfied with that. But you have to stay on the sur-
face.
If you go too deep below the surface, you will lose them. You will lose them be-
cause it becomes too technical. I want you to be very clear. It's like the little
rhythms. Well, 9 and 0 nowhere to go; and so on. But it really works because it's
true. You have to see that a Partnership Analysis is a surface analysis. You're
there to touch the hot buttons of whatever it is.
You're there to remind the beings of what they can be within a relationship. But
you have to be able to see first of all what their surface is. You have to see the
way they‟re interacting with their characteristics in the maia as not-self. And when
you understand them as not-self, it's very easy to understand the dilemmas of their
relationships.
John Lennon/Yoko Ono Connection Chart
9 and 0: Nowhere to Go
The first thing I want to look at is just
basic configuration and just staying
with the surface. It begins with my
delightful little childhood poetry. One
of the things for me that is so really
wonderful is that these very, very
simple formulas provide such a clear
framework. So, when you're dealing
with 9 and 0 relationships, together
you have nine Centers that are de-
fined. Remember that she had sev-
en, he had two, and together they
have nine Centers defined.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
9 and 0: Nowhere to go. Well, nowhere to go is just that: Nowhere to go. No-
where to go literally means that there is no room for anybody else. It‟s very, very
difficult for anybody else to get in. This is one of the basic dilemmas of the 9 and
0. When you see 9 and 0 relationships of the not-self, you have to be concerned
because there is no outlet for them. They can't get out. They're locked in. And
they're locked in with whatever the dilemmas are of the conditioning that is taking
place in their relationship.
The Phenomena of Splits
So 9 and 0 is always something to be aware of. You'll notice in this chart we're
dealing with another phenomenon. We're dealing with the phenomena of splits. If
somebody comes to me and they have a split definition in their relationship, it's ob-
vious to me that there are always going to be problems; always. It doesn't mean
they can't survive each other. It astonishes me the kind configurations of not-self
that can truly survive each other. They're always trying to homogenize. They're
always trying to find a way.
But the reality is that the moment you have a split, you have a dilemma. Here you
see the obvious split. That is, you have the defining of the Ajna to the Head Center
and of course, this is her definition and it is a Dominance of hers. So here's this
definition. So you have this mind that is cut off from the rest. If you have a part-
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

15
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
nership and the mind is cut off from the rest, you can imagine what that's going to
bring.
Whatever the physical bond is between the beings, the physical bond and the way
in which the mind interprets the experience of being the other, these are things
that just don't match. They just don't fit together. There is always going to be dif-
ficulty, particularly in situations where one partner is bringing the split. The mo-
ment that one part-
ner brings the split,
you know right
away that her mind
was never in that
relationship. It's
just that simple.
Her mind was never
really in that rela-
tionship and her
mind is where her
not-self operates.
The moment you're
dealing with a split
configuration, here
is a 9 and 0 with a
split. So here they
are locked in and
there's this problem. And of course, 9 and 0s are really locked in. They can be
very confining. They can be very hermetical. There are real dilemmas that come
out of that. For example, this is the kind of couple that when they're together day
after day after day, what is really going on, particularly in her mind—but what's
manifesting in his mind, what's being amplified in his mind because he's getting the
same thing—is all this confusion, there are these doubts, there is always the mind
trying to make sense out of things and yet no real consistent capacity to be able to
articulate it.
It's always one of those jokes for me, couples who have splits from the mind to the
Throat, or have a split from the Throat to the rest down below, these are the kind
of people who end up going to friends for dinner and end up fighting. And it's not
because they really have serious problems. It's just because they rarely have a
chance for the flow to be there between what they're processing on the mental
plane and what they're living through physically. The moment they step into the
aura with others, all of a sudden all of those connections are there and that's the
moment that these things start to come out.
There is the old mechanical way of saying to a couple that if they have children,
there is always a possibility that the children will bring the split together. But then
again, the dilemma of having your children hold you together is that there is a pos-
sessiveness and there is a difficulty, a dilemma in the way in which you actually re-
late to each other because it's literally being controlled by the children.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
This is a simple-split and when you have a simple-split it's always looking for its
wholeness, so this is always going to be a relationship where there is this sense
that it's not really whole, that there is really something missing. There is always
going to be this attempt to try to find out or fill up what's missing. And you can bet
your bottom dollar that they have a lot of opinions about it because the 17th gate is
the bridging gate. And of course, one of the things that's always going to be the
difficulty for them is to try to find a way in which they can bring their relationship
together.
8 and 1: Have Some Fun
So when you're dealing with the numbers, the numbers are very simple. 8 and 1:
Have some fun. The reason for this is that if you have a relationship in which you
have eight Centers defined and there is only one open, it gives them an out. When
I look at the relationship bodygraph, I always look at open Centers as windows, or
doors, if you want to be less dramatic; sometimes it's a window.
When you have a 7 and a 2, you have a door and window, somebody sneaking out
the window while the other one is sneaking out the door. The beauty of being an 8
and 1 is that you have the possibility of going out the same door or the same win-
dow together. In other words, that single openness you share can become a way
in which you integrate on the outside.
The Nodal Line Themes
There is a real problem in relationships. This is a problem that we're going to look
at as we move away from the surface, which we're doing today, as we look at dee-
per themes, and particularly
looking into the Nodal themes.
One of the things to under-
stand is that basically Nodes
set the scenario of the kind of
beings you're going to meet in
your life because it gives you
the background scene or land-
scape you're going to live
through.
A lot of the quality of those be-
ings who are going to be
around in your life can be seen
through the lines of the Nodes.
One of the things that you no-
tice a lot in relationships is that there are Nodal conflicts. So, for example, if you
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

17
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
look at John Lennon with his 2-1 configuration and you look at Ono with her 3-3
you can see that basically their worlds are different. And it means that their friends
and who they're interested in are going to be different. Their milieu is different.
Now, this is often a real dilemma in relationships. You have Nodal differentiation;
you have different kinds of people who are there to populate the landscape for the
development of your process. In your geometry to meet somebody who has a to-
tally different set—remember the genetics of it, which are very cruel: You're always
attracted to what you're not. Then what you have is an 8 and 1 and the way of
getting out of your relationship.
If you have only one way to get out, maybe you do it together, maybe you try to
integrate both streams, both landscapes. Sometimes you go into her world and
sometimes she goes into your world, but the reality is for most beings and for most
relationships, it doesn't happen. The moment you get to the 7 and 2 is the mo-
ment they can go their separate ways. I'm going out with the girls. I'm going out
with boys. Or I have this work and this interest over here, and I have this work
and this interest over there and the people I meet through my work are different
than the people that you meet through yours and so forth and so on.
One of the real dilemmas of not operating correctly is that you're not meeting
somebody who has a geometry that is one that you can attune to. This again is
something you're able to see immediately with the Nodes and it's a way in which
you can bring an immediate level of relief to people. There is often a great deal of
pressure. For example, the male executive who expects his wife to entertain his
business associates. The woman who does her job and she expects her husband to
take the kids to whatever. There are all of these things.
One of the things that is so interesting is that, given the not-self and given the lack
of awareness of the not-self, the Nodal themes are actually one of the deepest con-
flict areas that not-self couples have. It's one of the things that really bothers
them. So again, you'll see that there are many levels of this, but when you're look-
ing at the surface and just the way they come together, you have to see that
whenever you have a door or a window opening up, you have this opening up to
somebody's Nodal path. In other words, that's where they go, or that's where they
want to go to get away.
The 8 and 1 with Different Nodal Lines
Think about it. You have a relationship with somebody and you're an 8 and 1.
That means both of you don't have that 1, whatever it is, whatever that Center
happens to be. The fact of the matter is that both of you in your lives meet those
who bring that conditioning, but they can be very different people in a very differ-
ent way. Yet, the moment you're together and it's not there, you need to get away
from each other. Again, you're going to follow that track to your Nodal line. You're
not necessarily going to go together.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
The Language of Communication
Again, this comes back to one of the most basic things about what we can offer
mechanically to people in a relationship. That begins with the language of commu-
nication. Oh, what an ordeal to learn how to speak to somebody you're connected
to because you never get to speak as yourself. Have you ever thought about that?
You don't. The whole thing about any connection with another human being is that
you surrender who you are, as they surrender who they are. You're becoming
something else. You're becoming the quantum of the two of you, and the quantum
of the two of you is very different.
This connection chart is very, very different from the charts of either of the partici-
pants. If this were just an individual design of somebody, this would be the inter-
pretation of this in-
dividual design; this
is somebody who is
totally different
than the analysis of
those individuals.
This is another be-
ing, and it's another
being that has
another way of
communicating. It
has another way of
working.
After all, you can
see that in this be-
ing there is a con-
sistent connection
to the Throat
through the 20/34. You can see that within the context of this aura, John Lennon
has a voice. That is, he has a very, very specific voice that comes out in a very
specific way and this voice is not his natural voice. This is one of many options
that's possible for him, but in this case it's always fixed; it's always fixed into the
now. It's always fixed by that 20th gate. And the way in which this speaking
works, the very quality of the tone of the voice is being conditioned. But he's not
somebody who has a consistent, conditioned voice.
The Compromise Channels: 59/6 and the 46/29
These are beings who become something else. Of course, because you become
something else, there are forces at work that can make it uncomfortable. We'll
take a look at the obvious of that. All you have to do is go to Compromise. That's
all you have to do. If you go to the Compromise in this situation, you have two
Compromise channels. He has the 59/6, his only definition and she has the 59.

19
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Then the 46/29, she has the whole channel and he only has the 46. So here you
have this very, very powerful compromise.
Now, Compromise is something that is very difficult. Any time you look at a rela-
tionship and you see Compromise, you see the place where you're always going to
go, you see the place where you're always going to end up the moment there are
any kinds of problems. It's the place that, when you lie down at night and you
cannot go to sleep, what you're thinking about is the difficulty of dealing with that
Compromise in one way or another. All not-self relationships burn on the cross of
Compromise, all of them, all the time. It‟s always there. It's not like being yourself
and operating correctly as yourself gets rid of Compromise; it does not. It cannot.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
The Petty Tyrant
I've been impressed by sound bytes from teachers over the years. Every once in a
while there is something I really recognize as a real truth. Carlos Castaneda had
this concept of the petty tyrant. It's a wonderful concept.
The petty tyrant is if you're awake and you're here to operate correctly, then noth-
ing in this life should be able to pull you away from that. But then again, if you're
not constantly tested, how do you know? It's the petty tyrant that reaffirms our
correctness. And Compromise is the petty tyrant. Oh, you can never get rid of it.
Can you image never? You can't, it's just not possible. You can't make it better.
You can't change them. It's their definition. This is precisely the way in which they
are wired. There is nothing you can do. It's the petty tyrant. It's always there.
If you're operating correctly and you say "yes" to enter into a relationship with
somebody, well, then watch the movie. You're going to see that regardless of the
correctness, it can be correct to be in a relationship with a petty tyrant. It's won-
derful after all. But it's not pleasant. The maia is an interesting place, this illusion
that correctness is paradise. It isn't. Life is life. Relationships, connections with
other human beings are very, very complex and difficult things. Take a look at
what a composite looks like. It's incredible what's going on. You can't even begin
to imagine analyzing all of that. You can't. There is so much there.
No Cure for the Compromise
There's so much there that's not there because it's just a quantum field. You have
people who are going in and out of their auras, in and out, in and out. It's some-
thing that magically appears. When it magically appears, it magically appears with
its conditions and if there is Compromise, there's that petty tyrant always there.
There is nothing you can do.
Then you sit with the not-self and you say to the not-self, “You have a Compromise
here. Every time you want to do this, you really can't get it done because it's being
blocked because your partner is the one who's always making that decision.” "Oh
yes, that's true. Oh I hate that, blah, blah, blah." And then you say, “You're never
going to get rid of it; you can't get rid of it.”
It's a thorn in your side, because that's what it is for most human beings—
Compromises are these thorns. They're always there, they're always annoying,
and they always hurt. Whether they were going to succeed as a relationship—
46/29, Succeeding Where Others Fail, Failing Where Others Succeed, an abstract,
experiential, collective, sharing gate—it's up to her whether they're going to suc-
ceed or not. It's up to him whether he is in any way open to her intimately or not;
it's always up to him. There is this very, very solid immovable wiring that's there.
Mechanics provide you a way to look carefully at something to see it for what it is.
But only awareness can live with it. This is about awareness. It's about living with

it. When you have beings who are coming into a relationship and they want to
have an analysis of that relationship, what they really want to know is, “We have a
problem. Do you see it?” Yes, we see it. It's right there in that Compromise.
The moment you go to that Compromise, you get to the heart and core of it, but
there's no direct cure. The knowledge provides no cure. It doesn't provide any-
thing. You can't get rid of it. When we lock in with the other, we really lock in.
When you're in a geometry with somebody and you have to deal with that Com-
promise breath by breath, day by day by day, the only thing that helps is aware-
ness, nothing else.
Oh, you can say nice things. They have five Electromagnetic connections—the
26/44, the 30/41, the 20/57, the 34/57 and the 32/54—they have all these Elec-
tromagnetics. Well, sparks are flying; good, that's nice. I'm always surprised by
the excitement people have by counting up the number of Electromagnetics. It's
sparks flying; it's very nice. You don't need them all, by the way.
The Surface: The Center, Nodes and Compromise
When I look at a composite, my focus, because I'm interested in the surface, I look
at the basic dynamic. What's the configuration? Is it an 8 and 1? Is it a 7 and
2? and so on. I look immediately at the Nodes. Do they deal with the same kind
of people? Do they have the same kind of track? And then I look at the Compro-
mise. Everything I need to know about their dilemma is just in that quick view;
everything. It's not so much how deep you have to go, it's how well you can ex-
plain just that much, because that's the trick. It's just that much. At the moment
you can go to where the dilemma is, they don't care about most of the rest of it.
They don't. What they care about is: We have problems. We would like to know
what we can do about it. And you can go right to it.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
In the end, when you're dealing with a Partnership Analysis, what you really come
to is that the partners have to have an agreement with each other. It's a basic
agreement that you seek in this surface. And the agreement is to experiment with
treating each other with respect. The mechanics fix it. We're not therapists. This
is mechanical work. You can identify the dilemmas. The dilemmas are there. But
the moment you identify the dilemmas, what's the solution? What can you offer
these people? They don't just come for insight into how it works. What do I do?
Communication with the Other: Understanding Type and Profile
You cannot cure the Compromise. So what do you tell them? You cannot cure a 9
and 0. You cannot cure the fact that they're going to have Nodes that don't work
with each other, that they integrate with different beings in their lives. You can't
do anything about that. So what can you do? It's all about the way they begin to
communicate with each other. Couples have an enormous difficulty in really being
able to talk to each other.
One of the dilemmas is that they don't know how to speak to each other. And
speaking to each other is two things: Its understanding somebody's Type and un-
derstanding their Profile. That combination, because that combination is also a
combination of Angle, is a way of understanding how to begin to speak to the oth-
er. The dilemma is that most relationships are emotional generating relationships.
After all, 50% of humanity is emotional and nearly 70% of humanity is Generators.
When human beings come together, the vast majority of partnerships are going to
be emotional Generators.
Right away you're dealing with relationships that live under a quantum law that
says: There is no truth for these couples in the now. There is only the potential of
clarity about the nature of their relationship arising over time. The way in which
they begin to communicate with each other, the way they begin to make decisions
together, there is an Authority to this design. It's an emotional Sacral Authority.
This is the design. They're actually quite comfortable with that kind of Authority
because they are both emotional Generators.
For them as a couple to understand that they need to reach a point where they
can, as a couple, make decisions is very difficult. What tends to happen is that
couples tend to force decisions down the line of their Compromise to guarantee that
they're going to get what they want to do. In other words, the basic competition
between “I'm not really an us, I'm still an I. And as long as I'm still an I, I would
like to do this.” As a relationship, they need to be able to come to a point where
they can make decisions together through their relationship Authority.
Now, in order to be able to do that, they have to be able to communicate with each
other. They have to be able to communicate with each other in a way that is cor-
rect so they can finally begin to get the answers that are legitimate, that they can

begin to question each other, and that they can begin to trust the integrity of each
other's response. After all, these are two Generators.
We all well know that Generators are not designed to be particularly interested in
the other. They're designed to be interested in themselves. They're here to know
themselves. The moment you have these two Generators together in this relation-
ship, the solution is how they deal with each other and how they communicate with
each other. You can see laying that out you return them to who they are as them-
selves outside of the relationship because this is where the dilemmas are.
They're about being outside of the relationship. It's obvious that the relationship is
going to have its dilemmas because it's a not-self relationship. So, everything
about the work we're going to do is what we illustrate, because remember, part-
nership is an interesting thing. The moment you show the wiring of a partnership,
you are exposing it. You're exposing what cannot be within itself transformed.
There's nothing you can do.
The only thing you can do is begin to operate correctly as a couple. That's why I
have this resistance to just giving a Partnership Analysis to one partner because
that partner is in crisis in their relationship and they want to know what's going on.
It's very difficult because it doesn't help to be able to say, “Here is the area of
Compromise.” Ok, if I can't get rid of this, I don‟t want this; I'm out.
The Petty Tyrant Keeps You Aware
For most people, Compromise is like that. You really do have to be aware to be
able to accept that it is your trajectory, your geometry, your destiny or your karma,
whatever it is, to be a petty tyrant in your life. This is the stick that keeps you
aware. After all, there are all kinds of benefits in having Compromise in a relation-
ship, but the benefits are only spiritual and only have to do with awareness. You
have to be able to transcend the mundane difficulty of it.
You're dealing with somebody's awareness. You're not dealing with the dilemma
that it's his fault or her fault, because the moment you can operate with aware-
ness, it's not about fault and it's not about blame. It's simply about the dilemma;
here's the dilemma. You got into something and you're in it and you suddenly real-
ize that who got into it wasn't you. And so you have this dilemma of wanting to
begin anew.
Not-Self Relationships Need Mutual Work
The only way you can do that is by communicating with your partner or leaving
them. My concern for so many people who are not-self, for most of the people who
will come to a Partnership Analysis—because they're in crisis in their relationship—
that so often just pointing out the irreversible fact of the wiring is enough to con-

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
vince them that the relationship isn't for them. I don't know if that's true. The fact
that you enter into a relationship incorrectly doesn't mean that it's doomed; it
doesn't mean it should be doomed. But it does mean that if the relationship is
going to transform into one that is of value and is aware, then that has to be mu-
tual work.
I know the dilemma of the male and the male psyche. It's very difficult for men.
They're not comfortable, particularly not comfortable when their women know more
than they do. It's a threat to the immature psyche of the yang force anyway.
There is a discomfort, generally speaking, with introspection and self-analysis, or
the taking of responsibility for negatives within a relationship. It's a real ordeal. I
understand all of that.
Transforming Awareness & Experimenting with Communication
But then again, we're in the business of transforming awareness. We're in the
business of being able to educate human beings to the possibilities of correctness.
I think that one of the most important things to do with the not-self who comes and
seems to be reinforced by the evidence of things like Compromise, is the real chal-
lenge is to reenter the relationship with this new awareness and experiment with
communication.
It's the communication. All right, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. But that is
something that really must be the bedrock of the advice for anyone who is in a di-
lemma in your relationship. Only when they can begin to operate correctly as
themselves and communicate to the other in the way in which it's correct, then
there is a possibility. I've seen it. I've been surprised, actually more often than I
thought, by women who had both the intelligence and the determination to open up
the eyes of their men and it's really a pleasure to see all of that. But that's the real
work. It is what it's all about.
When you're dealing with somebody's individual chart and you talk about their wir-
ing, you're talking about something that they have to do. It's their individual chart.
But when you're looking at a partnership chart, that wiring is temporary, is momen-
tary. It's only there when the aura is there. It's not the same thing.
Connectivity and Respect
So you have to see that there's nothing we can do with a connection chart. It's not
that you can say, “All right, if you follow the Authority of this chart and you operate
correctly, you're going to operate correctly as a couple.” Well, yes, it's nice to say
that, but the fact is that it's the individuals who have to make it work because
they're going to bring this same potential into that same configuration as they lock
and link together. It's what they bring to the mix that can be the transformation

agent. They have to operate correctly. And they both have to agree to experiment
with treating each other correctly.
My thing about Human Design and connectivity is all about respect. It's the respect
for a parent to a child and the way you communicate with your child, to communi-
cate with your child according to its nature. This is what respect is all about. To
communicate to anyone according to their nature is what respect is all about. Not
demanding of somebody the obvious that they're not here to be demanded of, be-
ing able to ask somebody instead of telling them, and surrendering to the fact that
you may not get the answer you want.
It's all about the way in which we communicate. At the very basis of Human De-
sign is a recognition that each and every one of us is differentiated and unique and
deserves a differentiated and unique respect for what we are, to be treated accord-
ing to our nature.
Q & A
The Nodes
Written Question: (about Nodes)
Ra: First of all, I will talk in detail tomorrow because tomorrow I'm going to look at
the basic themes of Profile and Nodes that go along with it and other things in con-
figuration. But what I was referring to is the fact that everybody has their unique
Nodal configuration that really lays out the landscape of the world they're going to
live in throughout their life.
It's very natural to have children who, for example, will have very different Nodal
line configurations than their parents. This is always a sign that they're really
going to take a different track in life. In other words, they're really going to meet
different kinds of people in a different kind of evolving landscape. So when human
beings are meeting each other, one of the things that gives us a very deep insight
into their lives and where their lives are going is that we can see that through their
Nodes.
So, if we have basic Nodal conflicts—if we don't have harmony or if we don't have
resonance—then there is an indication that it's difficult for these people to get into
each other's lives. Now of course, there are some relationships in which that's
ideal. There are other relationships where that would be very painful and one could
feel quite excluded. Again, this goes back to whether one is going to operate cor-
rectly as themselves.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
Connection Chart Analysis Replaces Therapy?
Written Question: Ra, It seems to me that the fundamentals of the Connection
chart analysis more or less replaces therapy, with the emphasis on respect and on
the mutual responsibility of a couple taking their current dilemmas into their own
control, with the addition of remembering that here is a higher aim in life than just
one's own satisfaction on the material plane/maia. I am so glad that there is this
special emphasis for us to bear in mind doing these charts, as I did not like the
immediate notion of people just stuck.
Ra: I think this is something very important. I understand the place for what
people call “therapy” and I recognize that there are all kinds of beings, particularly
in the not-self world, where this is something that has almost become institutiona-
lized, that is, the way in which couples work out their problems together.
I'm somebody who has an enormous and very deep respect for what mechanics
and operating correctly can bring to relationships. I've gone through my own life
process in this and to be somebody who is so rigidly integration and very much de-
signed to be insular and in retreat, it's taken me a long time to understand the na-
ture of connectivity and what it's all about. What it comes down to is the recogni-
tion and acceptance of the other for what they are. I think this is the deepest level
we come to in Human Design in regards to our relationship to the other.
We can never truly know the other and we can never truly be one with the other.
That's not the way it works in the maia. However, we can truly accept the other.
This is the real beauty. Acceptance for another human being is not something that
you can just do. It really isn't, because you can see that in the complexity of any
interaction between human beings, there can always be things that are very diffi-
cult to deal with.
But the moment you can see somebody and see that they are not responsible, it's
not their fault. For me, the first realization I had at the very, very beginning of my
process was to let go of thinking that somehow my mother and my father were re-
sponsible in some way for something that should have been different. To let go of
the blame and fault and all of those things that connect so deeply to us. I saw
their helplessness. I saw their helplessness as I see the helplessness of all beings.
That with their design, with their not-self, with the conditioning of their culture,
there was nothing else they could have been. They did what they could with what
they had. They struggled along as everyone in the not-self realm does.
The moment you can see the helplessness of another human being and can accept
their helplessness, then you can accept their helplessness with real dignity and
hopefully the respect will be returned. This is the bedrock for me. The bedrock is
the integrity of a human being to recognize how important it is that you're correct,
that love is not something you need or you want or you desire, but love is a natural
companion in this life. And it begins within yourself.

The 6th Line and the On the Roof Phase
Question: Ra, I had two charts that I was looking at recently and they were a
couple planning to get married and they're both 22. One's a 4/6 Generator, one's a
6/2 Manifesting Generator, emotional Solar Plexus inner Authority. Just because I
was coming off the Cycle course, I decided to look up the Saturn Return, knowing
that they were both 6th line beings, wondering what would a quality of the „on the
roof‟ experience be. I noticed that one was moving to the Cross of Defiance. In
the Incarnation Cross book it says this is when you move into a divorce.
Now, if their Nodes are identical, because they are born within a month of each
other, very close in proximity, and if they're 7 and 2, does that factor into this on
the roof phase that this one person is going to be imprinted with?
Ra: Yes, it's an interesting configuration. Again, I think there are many things you
describe that show me, one way or another, they're going to have a connection to
each other. I think that‟s fairly obvious. Whether or not their relationship is going
to be a success really goes back to who they are and their relationship to each oth-
er in terms of how they deal with each other and how they communicate with each
other, because it is very basic.
This is not the kind of configuration where, for example, the thematic of Defiance—
the Cross of Defiance people are interesting beings. My youngest child is six years
old and in Grade One and he's the Cross of the Laws. His best friend is a Cross of
Defiance. It's fascinating to watch the way in which this plays out.
One of the interesting things about a 6th line being who will enter into a Cross of
Defiance stage on the roof is that they may have a real opportunity to separate
themselves from the dilemmas of the first part of their process. It also may mean
a radical change in the way they‟ve been operating. This is the kind of person
where marriage can really bring a different kind of life entirely in which they really
deny or are defiant of things that were very much a standard for them in the first
part of their life. These are the kind of people who can change their political affilia-
tion overnight, this kind of thing.
But the real thing, if I understand your question at its core about whether or not
despite whatever is there, they can work out their relationship, I think that is an
obvious. I think when they're young and you really have some access to them, if
you can help them understand how to communicate to each other, you can make
an enormous difference in their life.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
The Curse of the Bedroom
The other thing is the bed. Ah, the curse of the bedroom. As long as I've been a
professional analyst I have never had a reading in which I didn't say to somebody,
“Don't sleep in the same bed as your partner. When the honeymoon is over, it
never has to end if you have separate bedrooms. You can always have a romance.
You can always enjoy your love, your sex life, whatever, but you're "contaminating"
each other's auras while you're unconscious.” I think it's one of the most essential
ingredients and a tremendous piece of advice.
It's a funny thing about the way culture works. I can remember when I was a
young boy, about 8 or 9 years old, my mother had family friends. I can remember
my mother and father discussing the ominous sign that they had built a new house
and they had built each other separate bedrooms. That separate bedroom con-
sciousness, which is part of the old Saturn cycle and the possessiveness of the Sa-
turn cycle, this has left a kind of propaganda thing that hovers over any kind of re-
lationship in which separate bedrooms is part of the layout. I think it's essential.
I don't think any couple can really have a healthy relationship if they're sleeping
with each other. I think in terms of the logic of what Human Design offers, it's just
so clear. The basic recommendations to a young couple: Have their own space,
treat each other with respect, and then let the forces do their work. If they operate
correctly, they can have a very empowering relationship with each other.
Question: Thank you Ra, so that would mean that if a couple comes to you, you
would bring that in, you would bring the bedroom in because that would be a pro-
found service to them in terms of the continuity of the relationship. Otherwise,
they're dealing with energies that are beyond their "ability" to control mentally.
Ra: Oh, it's deeply confusing. Just think about any Center you don't have and
you're sleeping with somebody who has it. Think about the pressure that's being
applied and think about all of that pressure operating inside of you when you're not
conscious. It is a basic recommendation in Human Design.
The most fascinating thing is that, again, the problem is not women. There has
never been a woman that I've spoken to—well, actually that's not true. There has
been the very, very rare exception. But just about every woman I've ever said in a
reading that you should have a space of your own, you see the dreamy look in their
eye "If only, if only."
What I do want to finish with is that it is a key. I think it's a key for everyone to
understand that it's one of the basic recommendations in any kind of pair bonding
where you have men and women who are living together. Have them experiment
with it. They'll see that it's wonderful. It's a wonderful thing to go to sleep in your
own bed and wake up in your own aura.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
The other thing about it is that it's a benefit to the relationship. When you come
out of your room in the morning and you see your partner, you know precisely
what you're connecting to. You really do. It's one of these ways of demonstrating
respect. The other thing is that when you have your own space, your own space is
much more naturally respected. It's a funny thing about human beings. This is my
room. You enter into that room with respect because it's not your room and it's not
your space and it's a very, very different kind of process.
So, yes, I think it's something as a basic recommendation that has to be made to
anyone who comes, regardless of what kind of reading that they come for, that this
is something that is recommended to them.
Commonality with Parent's Charts
Question: Ra, a question I have is that now looking in my own family and looking
at my siblings and looking at some very close friends, almost all of us, including our
children always pick someone who has a lot in common with one of their parent's
charts or very significant someone in their childhood. And I know you talk about
that and you say it's just us living our conditioning field, but any more when it
seems like there‟s almost no choice and people respond to that, is there any way
to—I mean so far I just haven't seen any charts where it doesn't happen that way.
Ra: It's part of the joke of the maia. The not-self and the not-self get together
and they produce not-self that is conditioned as not-self that gets together with
not-self and the conditioning just keeps on reinforcing itself. The conditioning be-
comes wiring.
One of my earliest jokes about the way in which we connect to other people, in the
'80s here in Ibiza I hung out with a musician friend of mine and he was one of
these rock 'n' rollers. He was very much into being a rock 'n' roller and he had all
kinds of lovers all the time. I got to know him well over the years and at some
point I ended up in the house of his mother and we got into a conversation. She
was interested in what I was doing.
So I got her data and I ran her chart. It was this classic joke. He was a split defi-
nition and there were two or three ways his split could hook up. His mother had
one way in which he hooked his split definition. And all of these women, the ma-
jority of them, I think I had charts of around a dozen of them and I think nine or
ten of them all had this same bridging element that his mother had. I showed it to
him and I tried to explain to him that this is what was happening to him and that
he had to get out of that. You have to break these things.
When I say that, what I really mean is if you operate correctly, you do, you will
see. But again, it's so difficult when we're dealing with these kinds of concepts be-
cause we are dealing in the world of a not-self and we're dealing in a world in which
it is culturally transferred, genetically transferred. You end up accepting the im-

print, reproducing according to the imprint which has nothing to do with what is
truly your nature or with whom you are to have a child with and so forth.
So, yes, you end up with enormous similarities that end up in certain groupings of
families. Not all of them, by the way. But you do. It begins to be inbred because
it's a genetic trait that gets inbred stronger and stronger and stronger over the
generations through the continuation of the conditioning until you get to a point
where there's something wrong. Because at some point, you need new blood and
you need new genetic information, in different places within the family strain it will
simply break up.
Integration People
Question: Another further question is that I have thought about that and I have
just a tremendous amount of people with integration channels, maybe all of them,
at least one of them, and it seems almost like it's a fractal thing also. So it gets a
little confusing to see what's fractal and what's not because in the last three years
I've tried not to initiate with anything with anyone and to let whatever comes to me
come to me, and it still looks more of my family.
Ra: Yes, well, you just have to wait and see and watch that. Integration is inter-
esting. Integration beings are survival mechanisms. There are so many ways in
which we connect to each other. You're somebody who has a lot of information
from a lot of different areas in Design and this is where some of the most difficult
problems come in trying to establish what I want to establish. That is—and I don't
mean to insult anyone who ultimately gets one of these readings—but the idiot lev-
el of approach, because I think if you get into all of that and I could start talking
about all the various geometries, the fractals, the angles, all of these things, it gets
very, very complex.
The work we have to do is very much the surface work because that's where it all
starts. We have to break the cycle of entering into relationships incorrectly. What
you're describing, in so many ways, is that picture regardless of how correct you
can be, may not change for generations. We're dealing with the endless continua-
tion of what has been the not-self phenomena. The way in which the world we live
in, the way it's structured, the way our civilization works, the way we are condi-
tioned, the way we're educated, the way the laws work, what's dictated, all of that
becomes an ongoing process of accepting the same kind of conditioning over and
over and over again.
So, you do end up with these kinds of warps, because they're warps. It shouldn't
look like that. If you consider that we are differentiated and not homogenized,
then you would see that each being would simply have on its fractal those connec-
tions with those beings who are truly there for them to meet along the way, wheth-
er it's the moment or it's the eternity. I think the ongoing process is that we have
to change the weight, if you will. If we ever get to a point where, in a community,
the majority operates correctly, slowly but surely the way in which the relationships

are formed in the next generation in that community will be different than what
was formed before.
After all, in most societies, the way in which you bond with the other is deeply con-
ditioned by your local culture, the religion you were raised in, the way in which the
habits of your particular society work according to bonding, all of those pressures
are there. All of that is part of the not-self construct. So, real changes in the kinds
of beings you're going to meet are going to take time because they're not chang-
ing, they're just homogenized.
Open Centers: Going Out the Window Based on Not-Self Strategies
Question: Just a quick question. The open Centers in relationships, those areas
where there they have windows to go out from, when we‟re dealing with open Cen-
ters in a relationship, does it also take on the flavor of the not-self theme or the
kinds of things they'll be looking for outside of the relationship?
Ra: Those open Centers, because they‟re open in a partnership, means they‟re
open in the individual, so the not-self strategies are always active in them. But in
terms of the quantum, in terms of the partnership aura that is created, no, there
they really become the windows. The difficulty is that the way in which the beings
want to go out those windows is going to be based on the not-self strategy. So,
the open emotional Center will say, “I‟m going to go out this window over here be-
cause I want to get away from confrontation.” In other words, the way in which a
decision will be made through the not-self will still operate through that open Cen-
ter strategy.
But within the context of the aura, no, these are places that are hatches. They‟re
places to get out. It makes the 9 and 0 very difficult all by itself because right
away you‟re given a configuration in which it‟s very, very difficult to be able to go
back into your own aura. It‟s much more difficult to tell a 9 and 0 couple to have
separate bedrooms than it is to tell one that is an 8 and 1 or a 7 and 2. The 8 and
1 and 7 and 2 will think, ok, there‟s the possibility. Here is a way to get away from
each other and still be in harmony with each other. There‟s no out in that 9 and 0.
So, those open windows are very important. They provide an outlet. The ideal, the
„have some fun‟ 8 and 1, is in many ways an ideal. In other words, it really is a
release value that‟s built into the relationship and if they‟re operating correctly,
they‟ll see that this is a window they go out of. So, for example, if it‟s an open
emotional Center, they can actually go out and confront others together. They can
go and seek the truth together. They can find an outlet through that open Center.

LESSON 1
The Hierarchy of Partnership Analysis
„Opposites Attract‟ and 'Like Likes Like‟
Question: I‟ve been wondering, when I first met Design I found myself turning
more to the phrase „opposites attract‟ in terms of understanding the genetic strate-
gy and especially having a hanging gate that is attracted to the gate at the other
end. However, there is also the phrase „like likes like.‟ So, I‟m wondering since
these appear to be potentially contradictory, is there is something you can say
about those two in the context of not-self and living one‟s Authority?
Ra: That‟s a very good question and it is the basic binary of what we are. It‟s the
basic duality of what we are. So for example, I‟m somebody who has a defined
Ego. I like being with defined Ego people. It‟s a lot easier to be with somebody
who is a defined Ego than with an undefined Ego: „Like likes like.‟ I like Ego beings.
I like beings who have strong identities. It feels comfortable to me.
To Bond According to “Like” is the Ideal
The moment any Center I have defined, in an aura with somebody else, when I en-
ter into their aura and it‟s open, it‟s very obvious to me because I can feel the ma-
nifesting coming back. One of the things that I have talked about, and I will talk
about at the end of this course, is the ideal. The thing about ideals is that it will
take a long time for the gene pool to have enough selection that operates correctly
in order for that ideal to function. But the real ideal is „like likes like.‟ In other
words, to be a Right Angle Ego person with a Right Angle Ego person, to really be
with what is similar rather than what is different.
Remember, the pull of the difference is only the genetics and it‟s only for reproduc-
tion. Opposites do attract. That is the essence of what is our not-self, or potential-
ly what could be our wisdom. After all, it‟s essential for us to meet what we are not
in order to learn what “it” is, whatever the “it” happens to be. But at the same
time, we‟re not here to become that “it.” We‟re here to live our lives correctly
through what is hardwired, what is defined in us because that is our essence.
The moment you meet in the other the same essence you have, obviously there is
a sense of comfort. But there is no sexual dynamic. All of this awaits mutation. In
2027, we have a change that‟s going to take place. The polarity to the 55th gate
when mutation is taking place is the 59th gate. We‟re going to have a change, ulti-
mately, in the way in which our sexuality operates. As long as sexuality and the
reproductive mechanism of our biology remains dominate in humanity, then it‟s
going to be very difficult to enjoy the „like likes like.‟ We‟re going to be stuck in
this realm of constantly being attracted to what we are not in order to replenish the
gene pool. The way our technology moves, the way in which mutation is moving, is
the potential that we bond through ideal. In other words, bond through what is
like.

But your question illustrates something that is at the deepest level of this know-
ledge. The deepest level is that this is a binary system. We are in a duality, we
are in a great binary and that binary is the nature of our lives. To bond according
to like is the ideal. To be correct and enter into a relationship with the other
through a field of attraction, because that is the way things operate now, but at
least to do it correctly is to create the opportunity not to be conditioned by the oth-
er, but to embrace the other as a path to wisdom. For me, this is one of the ways
to look at love, to see that love can bring us wisdom. Or wisdom can bring us love,
the wisdom of what it is to receive and to take and to accept the other. But again,
you can only do that from a place of real depth and correctness.

Lecture Two
Electromagnetics and Dominance
Hello everybody, and welcome to day two. To begin with, where I want to point
right from the very beginning is to these themes
and to just review them for a moment to make
sure you really have a grasp of each of these basic
connections we're going to look at. Obviously,
when we're dealing with any kind of connection be-
tween auras, we're always dealing with the same
phenomena. In other words, we're always dealing
with the four basic possibilities. You can have Do-
minance, Electromagnetic, Compromise or Compa-
nionship.
It's important to understand the nature of these
different kinds of connections just as basic themes.
It allows you to have a nice overview. One of the
things about the connection software is that you
get a listing based on those keys so you can see
right away where those various connections are
operating.
The Electromagnetic
Let's begin with the Electromagnetic. I think the Electromagnetic is one that is
overrated and perhaps misunderstood. An Electromagnetic connection is very in-
teresting. That is, you have one partner who has a gate at one
end of the channel and you have a partner who has a gate at
the other end of the channel. The moment you have that, you
have mutual conditioning. That's the first thing to recognize.
You have mutual conditioning.
After all, what is a hanging gate? A hanging gate is simply a
receptor to being conditioned by the other. Every time you look
at your design, look at those hanging gates because those
hanging gates are invitations to be conditioned. The moment you have gates at
either end that each person is carrying, and all of a sudden they meet each other in
that channel, there is a fundamental dynamic at work. There is always the glow of

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
"this is it." It has nothing to do with whether that thing that is “it” can be it or
could ever be it. It's the genes going, "Wow, terrific."
The whole thing about it is that this is really the opposites attracting. Everything
about the Electromagnetic is that it is a fundamental tension between—it's easy to
say love and hate, but it's normally not really that kind of extreme. It's a tension
between almost delicious and almost terrible. The very thing that attracts you to
somebody is the very thing that ultimately is going to be offensive to you. It's just
the way it is. It's this old line about familiarity breeding contempt.
An Electromagnetic connection is always going back and forth in one way or anoth-
er between this "wow isn't that fascinating and wonderful" to "isn't that a horrible
thing that I have to deal with all the time." You really have to see that Electro-
magnetics are the things that spark relationships. They spark them. You actually
don't need an Electromagnetic in your design for that sparking to take place. For
example, if you both have Companionship in a hanging gate and you meet each
other on a night where a planet is activating the harmonic, the fact of the matter is
that there is an Electromagnetic built into that moment, just a spark.
This spark is something that's lovely when you think about it. In other words, basi-
cally this is the way the genes turn you on. No other connection is so fundamental-
ly rooted in genetic imperative than the Electromagnetic. This is the heart and core
of what your genes want from you. They want you to be attracted to something
that is truly different than you.
So, in that Electromagnetic you end up with a dilemma. When you have a hanging
gate, think about what it really is a receptor to. On one side we see and we talk
about it all the time because it's the basic malaise we suffer from. We talk about
these receptors being open to conditioning, yearning for conditioning.
The Hanging Gate is an Indicator of the Pathway to Wisdom
But the other thing about a hanging gate is that it is an indicator of your pathway
to wisdom. The most magical thing about a hanging gate is that what it opens up
to is where all of its potential is to learn. Now, think about what happens when
somebody comes. They don't come with the gate; that's an illusion. They don't
come with the line; that's an illusion. You have to go all the down to the base.
When you go all the way down to the base, what you get to see is that the line that
is fixing you, this Electromagnetic spark you're locking into, is a very, very fine,
narrow, fixed line. Out of the 1,096 possibilities that are there as a potential in
that other gate—let alone the various combinations of planets that can activate
those 1,096 potentials—you're getting one and you're locked in.
So, you can understand why the honeymoon never really lasts for long. It's like
“wow that's great, now excuse me, could you step aside, I want to taste another
one and another one and another one.” The path to wisdom is through openness
and only through openness. This is where you learn. There are so many things to

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
learn about what's on the other side of that gate. But you don't learn anything
when you get locked in, when you get fixed and when you get conditioned.
So, an Electromagnetic is something that is a spark, but it's not the thing that is
going to make your relationship work. It isn't. It's interesting and it's often a val-
uable thing that it's in a relationship, because despite the one side where one is
tired of it and doesn't want it, it's still, in terms of your genes—and remember I'm
only really talking in terms of the genes—it‟s still something very, very rewarding
because it gives you precisely what the genes want you to get.
So, when you see an Electromagnetic—I've heard people say, “Wow, we have six,
we have seven.” For example, my young son, we have seven Electromagnetic con-
nections. That's not something necessarily you want to ring up on the flagpole and
broadcast as some great achievement, because in fact it's very risky. As much as
we can be fascinated by each other, we can be really bored to death and alienated
by each other on the other side. Because all of what that Electromagnetic is, is al-
ways something that is fluctuating here and there. In the end, what you recognize
is that you're being locked into something that's not you.
The fact is for most human beings that's not something that's ever conscious. It's
not like they figure it out in that way. They simply end up with a reaction to it. It's
fascinating when you listen to couples and work with them over the years that the
very things at the very beginning of their relationship that were so exciting, were
so beautiful, were so wonderful, it's the very things they moan about later. You
can see that this is just the Electromagnetic at work.
Everything about the quality of a relationship isn't simply just the mechanical con-
siderations. I tried to really emphasis that yesterday and to really give you that
sense that the individual human being has to operate correctly as themselves, and
only in operating correctly as themselves can they begin to communicate as them-
selves.
When we look at the potential transcendence of a human being, what we're really
looking at is moving away from the bodygraph to the Profile. This is really what it
is about: To move away from the bodygraph and its characteristics to the Profile
where purpose is something that can be achieved. So, one of the things to recog-
nize is that what you're looking at in a partnership is these mechanics, that the way
they connect represents the characteristics of that relationship. But to find the true
purpose of that relationship goes back to the individuals who are the aspects of that
whole that's larger than the sum of the two of them.
To begin with, we have the Electromagnetic and it's important to see that it's excit-
ing, because that's what it brings. But also, at the same time, what makes it so
difficult is what the reaction is going to be on the other side of that Electromagnetic
field. For many years, because I began by describing this as the love/hate, the
love took on a kind of quality as if this was the core of the relationship. It‟s not.
This very love/hate, even as a description, is not so much about loving and hating
the partner as loving and hating an aspect of your partner. This is what the Elec-
tromagnetic brings up. It brings up these aspects when you go from one moment

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
in time being excited and appreciating it, to resenting it and finding it annoying be-
cause it's in the way of a larger process. So, that's the Electromagnetic.
Dominance
The next thing we look at is Dominance. I think Dominance is perhaps the most
fascinating in the many ways we connect to each other. One of the things about
both Dominance and Compromise, as you will see, is that so much about the way in
which we deal with these relationship characteristics is deeply rooted in how we op-
erate ourselves, the way we look at the other, and the way we deal with the other.
Dominance is interesting because it is something that totally comes from the other
person. In other words, you don't have any of it. So, here they
are, they bring this definition into your life. The thing that is so
fascinating about it is that it gives you a glimpse of the other.
Let me tell you a black, black joke about partnership. You never
know your partner. You don't. You know the thing the two of
you become, maybe, depending on how deeply you look at
things. But you don't know your partner at all. Think about
what happens to you in a relationship. You have this hanging
gate and your partner has this or that, they have this connection and you have that
connection and this definition. All of a sudden you have a composite that's a crea-
ture that's totally different. And you learn to be that creature together.
But it doesn't mean that while you're that creature together when you're in the au-
ra of your partner that you have any idea who they are. It's like parents and child-
ren, because in many ways we're much more sensitive to that. That's my chart
theme for today: Parents and children. The moment a parent and a child are to-
gether in the aura they create together, they stop seeing each other. They see
each other within the context of that illusion of what they become when they're to-
gether.
If you're unemotional and you have an emotional partner, when you're together
you‟re emotional and you see that partner through the emotional lens. There is no
other way. But it doesn't mean that you see them. You're seeing the "it" that the
two of you become. The biblical beasts with two backs; it's another creature.
The thing that makes Dominance so interesting is that it is a way to look beneath
the veil of the partnership characteristics and see something about your partner
that is always there, that is truly them, because you're seeing their hardwiring or
their definition exposed. There is something fascinating about that. Think about
what happened in my generation after the war. They didn't do very well in rela-
tionships. There are all these enormous divorce statistics and all of these things
that are part of the post Second World War generation.

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
One of the things that's so fascinating about that is when you have these partners
who were together trying to work things out in the partnership characteristic, by
the time they're divorced and leave each other, what happens to them afterwards,
the relationships they go into with others, these kinds of things can often be incred-
ible mysteries to the other partner. "I didn't know they were like that. I didn't
know they really wanted that. I didn't know that was the thing that was so impor-
tant to them."
You don't enter into a relationship as yourself. You become the relationship charac-
teristics. You become them. So, Dominance gives you a view. It gives you a view
of the consistency of the being you're connected to. More than that, this is where
you have the deepest potential learning from a partner. In other words, somebody
who has a definition in some area that you don't have, that brings the opportunity
of really understanding that process. It's consistent, it's always there, and you get
access to it.
Again, there is a real dilemma about the characteristics of a partnership. How
you're going to function in the partnership goes back to how you're going to oper-
ate yourself. If you're not operating correctly, the characteristics in the partnership
are not going to work properly. It just isn't. And Dominance is something that can
be like the sound of its name. Dominance can end up being something very, very
uncomfortable. You end up with a partner who has a specific orientation in a cer-
tain way and you can never escape it. It's always there, it's always in your face,
it's always in your body, and you always have to deal with it.
One side of that is, "I'm not like that, why should I deal with that?" And the other
side is, "Isn't that fascinating, look how that person deals with that." And that's the
way that person is always going to deal with that. So when somebody comes up to
you and asks you about your partner, if you're talking about their Dominance
you're going to talk about something that is going to be recognized by others, be-
cause you're really seeing their definition. In many ways, this can be a very re-
warding aspect in a design, to be able to see your partner.
Now of course, we're dealing with binaries and sometimes it doesn't work both
ways. Sometimes you have somebody, because of the genetic attraction, who is
very open connecting to somebody who is very defined and then you end up in
those situations where you can have a lot of Dominance and it can be quite uncom-
fortable. There are all kinds of varying degrees of it. But when Dominance is
something that can be a commonality, this is one of the ways in which you can get
partners to actually see each other, even if it's just an aspect of their design, but
really see their uniqueness in those aspects.
It often gives them a sense that they know the other. I think the greatest difficulty
in relationships for the not-self is that they truly do not know the other. They can't.
They're caught in the characteristics of the partnership. They don't have their
unique perspective to be able to look at the partner, aside from the fact that these
are not necessarily beings who are going to be operating correctly as themselves.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Companionship
Companionship is obvious in that you share a definition. To answer what will later
be a question: Yes, if you have a shared gate there are certain Companionship val-
ues in that. It will be dependent on where those gates are as to how effective they
can be in terms of the relationship. For example, let‟s say you‟re a 7 and 2 and
have work to do, and yet one of those gates that is open, you have a Companion-
ship in the hanging gate, that can end up saving you from running away from each
other. The 7 and 2 always opens up that possibility of running
away from each other. And because there is a common Compa-
nionship bridging gate, you may end up finding a way to go out a
single way together and go out into the world together and enjoy
the experience of meeting something together through that Com-
panionship.
But basically, the thing to recognize about Companionship is that
it is stable. This is the „like like‟ and „like likes like.‟ Like is not
attracted to like. In other words, Companionship in and of itself
doesn‟t make a relationship. As a matter of fact, it often creates
invisibility. You meet somebody who has the same channels de-
fined as you in a large gathering, chances are you‟re not going to
bump into them or be interested in them. That‟s not because they may not be in-
teresting, it‟s simply the fact that genetics are not interested in sameness.
So, in many ways, Companionship goes against the grain. The thing to recognize
about Companionship is that this “like” is one of the bases of awareness relation-
ships. In other words, commonality when it comes to awareness is something that
is very, very soothing. So, Companionship in that sense can be quite soothing.
That is, it is very stable. But as I said, it‟s not something in and of itself is going to
make a relationship work.
Compromise
Finally the pill, or the dark pill, or whatever it is—Compromise. Compromise is
something that is an incredible challenge. This is the petty tyrant. There is nothing
more challenging to awareness than the power of Compromise
in intimacy to be so restrictive and painful. And Compromise is
something that is truly difficult.
Obviously, what we‟re dealing with is a partner who has the
whole channel defined and the other partner has part of that
channel defined. Unfortunately, by the laws of mechanics, the
one who defines the channel rules the roost. It‟s unfortunate,
but this is just the way it is. The fact that you may share an activation in one of
the gates in the channel simply leads to discomfort in the person who is being
Compromised, but does not change, in any way, the way in which, ultimately, the
definition is going to operate.

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
Of course, there are nuances to that. There are going to be situations where you
share a gate and the planet that you have influences the exaltation or detriment of
the other and so forth. And you can be the one who is Compromised and it does
give you some influence in that sense. But the way in which the definition operates
is always in the hands of the person who carries the definition. This is Compro-
mise. There is absolutely nothing that is more difficult.
Compare it to the Electromagnetic. In the Electromagnetic at least you stand from
your own position. In other words, where you meet, where the quantum takes
place, at least you‟re bringing your share and there is always at least you have
your side. By the way, the Electromagnetic is the 'his-side, her-side' story. That‟s
what it‟s always about. I‟m over here, you‟re over there and that‟s the way it is.
Surrendering to Compromise
But the moment you have Compromise, it doesn‟t even give you the opportunity to
enjoy being in your own spot over there. It‟s taken away from you. And every-
thing seems controlled. With most human beings in a relationship this is the killer.
It is the killer because of awareness, not because of anything else. But I want to
tell you, I live what I teach. I deal with Compromise in many situations. I deal
with Compromise in my personal life, in my business life; it is something that is
simply there. And it has taught me a lot. What it‟s taught me the most is that sur-
render is really holy, holy business, because to be surrendered in the face of Com-
promise is the ultimate confirmation that you are really ok, because that‟s what it‟s
all about.
I would always have these moments with couples where I would wait to see what
the hot points were, because I would go through their individual designs in front of
each other. I do overviews for each other so they really have a glimpse of how I
looked at each of them. And then I would go right to the dilemma. I would go to
the Compromise. The moment you hit those Compromise buttons, you can feel all
the stored resentment, annoyance, anger, all kinds of things. There‟s absolutely
nothing you can do about it. They would look at me with this look in their eyes as
if to say, “Yes, you‟ve pointed it out, now fix it.” Well, gee, sorry. There is no fix-
ing of Compromise. It‟s simply not possible. It doesn‟t work. There‟s nothing you
can do. There‟s nothing you can do but surrender to it. There is nothing else you
can do.
Some of the most delicious experiences of my life are rooted in dealing with Com-
promise. Now, I may have an odd sense of humor. But then, again, I think that‟s
just part of not being fooled in the maia. Compromise is something when you have
it in a relationship and you‟re operating correctly, then from my perspective, if
you‟re aware, it‟s an incredible gift. And it‟s not a gift because of what you get
from your partner. It‟s a gift in terms of your ability to accept what they are as a
being.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
Compromise is a Wonderful Thing
I‟m a really bright man and I teach people very important things. I‟m a 62 and I
don‟t have the 17. I‟ve lived with a woman for 22 years now who has the 17/62
and basically I‟m an idiot. And I‟ve been an idiot all these years and I‟m never
right and there‟s nothing I can do. There is no way to have that conversation and
come out in anyway the way I want. I don‟t have any fixed opinions.
Somebody with a 17/62 always has fixed opinions with their own facts, and they‟re
not going accept your facts. They don‟t. Now, what do you do? Do you beat them
with a stick until they‟re senseless? It doesn‟t work. What do you do? You don‟t
get into those kinds of conversations because they don‟t lead anywhere. And then
you begin to realize that they‟re not important and they don‟t belong within the re-
lationship.
Compromise is a wonderful thing. It stands there and says, “Hey, love it or leave
it. Accept it or go away. This is what you get when you get me. You don‟t just get
this over here that you like and this over here that you admire and this over here
that you want. You get me and the way in which this me meets you.” After all,
Compromise is not your partner‟s fault. They don‟t have Compromise. They have
a defined channel. It‟s not their fault. It‟s nobody‟s fault. There is no blame in all
of this.
Of course, the moment you‟re dealing with the not-self couple and they have Com-
promise, there is a part of them that wants to kill, punish, all those things, erase it,
tear it out. If it doesn‟t go away, I‟m going away, but to miss the point. When all
of these things began to happen to me in the „80s, I had a hard time with the new
age consciousness business. It all seemed so light and perfect and ideal and
blissed out and all of these things. I guess it‟s my integration. I‟m a realist about
the nature of the world. Being individual, I‟ve understood all my life that life being
good doesn‟t mean you can‟t be moody and sad. I‟ve learned to see in my process
as Ra that life gives you everything. It gives you the good and the bad. It gives
you allies, it brings you thieves. It does everything. It‟s just life. It‟s a not-self
world.
And relationships, there is nothing more difficult for a human being than truly to
connect with grace and awareness with the other. After all, that‟s not why we con-
nect. We connect because we‟re driven by basic biological drives. We‟re driven by
genetics. We‟re driven by the not-self that is determined by the openness which is
the genetics that drives the mind. We don‟t know anything about meeting the oth-
er. We don‟t know anything about truly being open to the other for what they are.
Compromise will tell you right away. If you don‟t enter into a relationship correctly
and you‟re dealing with Compromise, it‟s going to bring you discomfort and pain. It
just will.
It becomes a sore. You can always see that sore, because as I mentioned to you
yesterday, it‟s the surface where everybody‟s stuck. Compromise on the surface is
a big pain in the butt. It just is. And every single one of those relationships, every
single one of those people who will come to you and say, “I‟m having a problem

Electromagnetics and Dominance
with Joe or Jane” or whatever it may be, all you have to do is look at the Compro-
mise. You‟re going to see right away, let alone all the other nuances we can look
at, because there are so many.
But for you as professional, you have to see this is what they have to deal with.
This is where you have to go, just to reveal so they recognize that this is not some-
thing you change. When you want to change your partner, and I don‟t mean get a
new one, I mean alter the one you have, you‟re already their enemy. After all, with
just about every partnership you‟re ever going to meet there is going to be the
partner who says, “If she or he could only be this or that, then everything would be
ok.”
And of course, this is not what it‟s about. What it‟s about is recognizing deeply that
you, yourself can operate correctly as a being. When you operate correctly as a
being, you expect to be treated correctly and you will also bring into your life those
beings who are here to treat you correctly. There you can begin a real process of a
relationship that can be of value.
The not-self is tormented by these things. I always thought that we are raised with
a romantic tradition. We‟re raised with Hollywood and all of these things. It‟s so
important to see that the real depth of a relationship is the good, the bad and the
ugly, and even when you‟re absolutely correct, there is no way to avoid any of that.
It is life.
The Trick to Dealing with Compromise
The Compromise for me is one of these things, where like the Profile in somebody‟s
individual design means very little until they are experimenting with their nature.
That Profile is a gateway. It‟s a gateway to the true fulfillment of their purpose.
One of the things that Compromise brings you in a relationship is the potential to
see beyond the Compromise. The moment you can go beyond that and you can
see this being as what they are, this is what happens when we‟re together.
In recognizing that and in having a place within you in which you have an inner Au-
thority to make a decision, you can decide very clearly whether it‟s correct for you
or not to be with this being despite the Compromise. You‟ll never get rid of it and it
will always be there. The moment you venture into that line, you will see right
away that it just blows up.
I have a trick. It‟s a good trick. It‟s one I‟ve learned through experience. When I
deal with Compromise I treat it as a Dominance, and it really works. I just don‟t
get involved with it. I just watch it. There is nothing else to do. I just watch it in
the same way that I watch Dominance because it teaches me a great deal.
Accepting somebody for who they are is the bedrock of what we really bring to any
Partnership Analysis. It‟s not about how you can change or he can change or she
can change, or all of this will change and blah, blah, blah they‟re going to be a bet-

ter person and they‟re not going to do that anymore and they‟re not going to annoy
you in that anymore; it‟s not true. The most interesting thing for me about operat-
ing correctly as yourself is that you see differently. You‟re looking at the same
things; stupid before enlightenment, stupid after. You‟re seeing the same things,
but you see it differently. That thing you saw as a problem, it does not necessarily
need to be seen that way. It‟s all about awareness.
So, these four variations are the basis of the way in which you‟re going to look at
the overall characteristics of that partnership. In other words, you‟re going to look
at those configurations and it‟s going to give you a basic roadmap. It‟s going to
say to you: Where is the attraction between them? Where is this basic attraction
that‟s there? Where are the problems? Where is the Compromise? Is there stabili-
ty in the relationship through Companionship? Look at each of these things.
Where‟s the Dominance? Is there a way of identifying the individual within the re-
lationship? These various keys give you an overview when you're just looking at
the bodygraph structure. These two themes, the Centers that are open and the
way the channels connect is all you need in order to be able to interpret what‟s
there within the bodygraph configuration.
The Two Basic Keys in a Partnership Analysis
We‟re going to talk about the database as well. So we‟re going to look at some
charts today within the context of two things. We‟re going to look at the Center
configuration, the 9 and 0, the 8 and 1, the 7 and 2, and so forth. We‟re going to
look at the channel configuration so that we have an overview of the bodygraph.
You need two things when you‟re doing a Partnership Analysis. You need an over-
view of the partnership characteristics, the way in which that arrangement oper-
ates. Then you need the guidelines of the Sun/Earths and the Nodes of the part-
ners in order to see the way in which all of that is coming together.
Obviously, there are other considerations, the considerations of Type, the consider-
ations of Authority, particularly when you‟re dealing with emotional Authority.
There are other considerations and we‟re going to take a look at each of them. But
remember, the basic configuration, the basic keys that you need to operate with in
terms of the bodygraph, that‟s what‟s there in this guide. In other words, it‟s very
straightforward, it‟s very simple. You have these four variations of the way we
connect, you have a basic thematic to them, you have the nine-center configuration
and how they come together in terms of the Centers.
The only thing you‟re not seeing there as a bodygraph consideration is the presence
of splits. Of course, this is something that is going to make a difference. I already
mentioned to you yesterday that immediately when you see a split definition in a
connection, you know right away there are going to be difficulties that are always
present one way or another. So, I want you to just keep in mind that these are the
keys you need now and we‟ll see how we put them into operation.

Animal Feeding Hierarchy
Comment: During the break there was a discussion concerning animals.
Ra: It's getting very catty around here; I think I'd better go back to work. Speak-
ing of animals, because I have my own thing with animals, I can remember years
ago when we were living deep in the countryside here. We had a number of dogs
and two adult cats that both had litters. It was really a circus when it came to
feeding time. But the thing that was most fascinating to me was that they had
their own hierarchy and it literally was an age hierarchy. The oldest animal in the
house was a cat, then came the two dogs and then came the other adult cat. They
would always eat in turns and then the rest of the cats would show up. It was al-
ways interesting to watch these hierarchies at work and the way in which these
things get ordered in relationships.
Donald Sutherland: Emotional Generator
I‟ve put up a chart for you. I hope everybody see that. We‟re going to take a look
at Donald Sutherland and his son. Just some basic things again, remember that
there is no way you can look at any kind of Partnership Analysis unless you have a
basic understanding of the individuals. [Donald Sutherland‟s birth data for this
course: July 17, 1935 at 11:30 AM in St John, Canada.]

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
So, for example, if you have a client of yours and they want to have an analysis
with their partner, you make sure that you look at that partner‟s chart very careful-
ly on its own. Mostly what you‟re looking for is whatever is going to be the dilem-
mas. Here, first of all, we‟re dealing with an emotional Generator with a split defi-
nition. You‟ll notice that the split cannot be resolved by a single gate activation. In
other words, in order for this split to be linked together you‟re going to have to
have a full channel. The easiest one, by the way, would be the 59/6 to draw them
together.
Split Definitions
First of all, when you‟re dealing with a split definition it‟s very important for them to
have relationships. Again, I‟m not really so interested in who I‟m talking about in
these charts because basically I‟m just talking about basic connection themes and
have no interest in doing analyses of these charts. But it‟s important to grasp
something. When you‟re dealing with a split definition, immediately you know that
partnership for them is
something that‟s very im-
portant.
However, there is a big dif-
ference. If you have a
simple-split, that is, two
aspects that can be linked
by a single gate, the lack of
that single gate becomes
the deepest theme in their
not-self strategies. It‟s
very, very important for
them and something they
feel they lack.
But the moment you have a
split definition like this
where you have these two
areas away from each oth-
er, you need at least a channel to connect them together, then this is always that
the problem is with the other people. In other words, this is not somebody who
thinks their lack of wholeness is their problem; their lack of wholeness is the prob-
lem of the other and the other doesn‟t bring them the right kind of relationship. It
doesn‟t bring them the right kind of connection, whatever the language happens to
be.
Of course, you‟re dealing with somebody who has an open self, an open G Center,
so the not-self strategy of being uncertain about their direction in life, uncertain
about love; undefined Spleen, holding on to things that aren‟t good for them; open
Throat Center, attracting attention; the open Ajna, trying to pretend they‟re certain

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
about things; the open Head, thinking about things that don‟t matter, all the basic
not-self themes. And yet, the reality is you‟re dealing with somebody where the
other is very important, and yet, the other is going to always be seen as the one
who is at fault unless you‟re dealing with somebody who‟s aware.
The 4/6 Profile
You have a 4/6 Profile. In having a 4/6 Profile, and by the way this is a Right Angle
Cross of Maia, you have somebody who is going to go through a tripartite process
in their life. It‟s going to make a difference, for example, in the way they relate. A
child who would come early to this person, for example, in their first 28 years, this
would be a child who would have a parent who was basically a 4/3. One of the di-
lemmas of the 4/6 is the wrong kinds of connections, making mistakes about who
to connect with when they are young.
But you can also see from the Personality perspective of the 4th line that we‟re look-
ing at the theme of relationship. The 4th line is the theme of brother-
hood/sisterhood. Of course, friendship is an essential ingredient for the 4. And the
4 in the Profile is an indication that before there can be any kind of enriching, dee-
per relationship there has to be a friendship to begin with. One of the basic strate-
gies of 4th line sexuality, one of the basic strategies of 4th line bonding is that first
you become a friend, first you become an intimate, and first you dig into things.
The 59/6
You‟ll also see in this configura-
tion, which is unusual, this
very, very deep not-self pres-
sure that will exist in terms of
intimacy. In other words, the
channel 59/6 is a very impor-
tant channel to this being. It‟s
the easiest way to connect up
the split. By the way, this split
can be connected up through
the Root Center over to the
emotional system as well,
through all three of those par-
ticular channels. Probably the
one that would be the strongest
would be the 19/49 because it
would be in the same circuitry
as the 37/40.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
But in terms of the partnership part, and this is why I‟m focusing on the 59/6, the
59/6 coming into this being‟s life would be deep, deep conditioning. And because
the other always has the problem, if anything goes wrong, it‟s going to be some-
thing wrong with their ability to be intimate.
Kiefer Sutherland: Generator
I have a funny story about this. I was in the media business in the late 1970s, ear-
ly 1980s. I was producing rock „n‟ roll videos, some of the earliest ones in Canada.
I was doing a particular production and needed somebody to role-play. There was
a story being told in the song. I had opened auditions. I had called a couple of
agents and they had sent me some people. One of the people they sent me was a
16-year-old Kiefer Sutherland, which was rather cute. So, anyway, I gave Kiefer
Sutherland his first media job, which I think is funny in and of itself. [Kiefer Su-
therland‟s birth data for this course: December 12, 1966 at 9:00 AM in London,
UK.]
Anyway, here he is. In looking at him, you can see that we‟re dealing with a split.
But you can see that this is a very different kind of split. In other words, the 16th
gate or the 57th gate is going to be able to link this split together. A single activa-
tion will bring the two
parts of the split to-
gether. So again, with-
in the context of part-
nership, here is some-
body who is going to
feel a certain inadequa-
cy or a certain problem
that they have in order
to be able to connect to
the other.
The 57th gate and the
16th gate are going to
be things that are very,
very important to this
person. Developing
their form and develop-
ing their talent is going
to be a driving force in
their life, even though
this is the conditioning. After all, this is not what they‟re necessarily about. It‟s
what they‟re going to be most deeply attracted to. When you‟re a split definition
and it‟s a single gate that‟s makes the difference, if there is a dilemma in the rela-
tionship you tend to bring the blame in on yourself that there is something you
lack, that there‟s something you don‟t have. You lack the skills, you lack the intui-
tion, whatever it is you‟re going to find within the configuration.

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
The Open Solar Plexus
The other thing, of course, is the open Centers. Obviously, it's an undefined emo-
tional system so there is the avoidance of confrontation and truth. When you have
somebody with an open emotional system—and again the assumption is that they
are not-self—the chances that they‟re really dealing with their partner is slim.
They‟ve been developing their avoid-confrontation-and-truth strategies since they
were babies popping out of the womb. So, it‟s not like all of a sudden just because
they‟re attracted to somebody that that configuration doesn‟t operate any more.
You really have to see that the moment you see the open Solar Plexus.
The Open Ego
It‟s the same thing with the open Ego. The majority of humans have an open Ego,
so you end up with people who feel unworthy. Of course, they‟re the ones who are
the most trapped into negative relationships where somebody says “I think you‟re
terrific” and the fact that they say you‟re terrific has nothing to do with who they
are and what they are
and what they can
mean for you in your
process. Just the fact
that they think you‟re
worthy automatically
hooks you into thinking
this could be the one.
The fact is, within the
partnership context,
with the open Ego there
are a lot of dilemmas
that arise out of that.
The biggest dilemma of
all is the marriage oath,
“I promise to love you
forever.” Well, before
you have anybody say
such a thing, you should
really check and see whether they have an open Ego or not, because if they have
an open Ego, they might as well not say it. Save their breath. They‟re not going to
be able to keep that promise. You just can‟t. And of course, the fact that you can't
keep that promise means that you can end up being deeply uncomfortable with
yourself. That is a malaise that goes deep within the being.

The 1/3 Profile, Open Head & Ajna
Again, here you have an open Ajna, an open Head Center and you have the not-self
strategies that apply. But the real pressure on this being is in the 57 and the 16.
You‟re dealing with a 1/3 on the Vessel of Love. So you do have somebody who,
from the Personality perspective, right away you can see there is a harmony with
his father who has a 4th line Personality. And of course, there is the extraordinary
harmony between the 1/3 and the 4/6. The 1/3 is the first of the Right Angle
crosses; the 4/6 is the last of the Right Angle crosses. And of course, they're direct
harmonies both from the Design and Personality sides. So, this is an interesting
bond. There is this ability to recognize the other in a harmonic way.
But you‟re dealing with a 1st line Personality so you‟re dealing with an introspective
Personality. Behavior is going to be very important for this being, obviously, so
behavior for their partners. If you have the 10th gate and you meet somebody who
doesn‟t have the 10th gate, chances are that your relationship won‟t last because
the moment they don‟t behave correctly it will just drive you absolutely insane.
Again, I‟m talking about the not-self.
The 25.3
You have a 3rd line unconscious. You have a trial and error process. You have the
very unusual 25.3, which is one of my favorite gate/line combinations because it
functions so oddly.
This is one of these
lines that has Pluto as
aspect of the exalta-
tion/detriment. Pluto
is actually in detriment
in this line. But it
doesn‟t exist, which is
interesting about the
way the Program
works. It takes Pluto
well over 260 years to
go all the way around
the wheel. And it so
happens that the 25th
gate is on the cusp of
Pisces and Aries. It
has been a very, very
long time, probably
170 years since Pluto
has actually been in
Aries and it‟s going to be another 60 or 70 years before it will get to the
Pisces/Aries cusp.

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
What that means is that there is nobody alive in the world today who carries the
imprint of Pluto in the 25.3 which means that the detriment of the 25.3 doesn‟t op-
erate. It‟s interesting. The detriment in the 25.3 is The potential of loss of inno-
cence through misfortune that in the extreme can manifest from crime to suicide.
The potential loss of spirit through failure or shock. Think about it. That is not in
the world now. So, somebody carrying the 25.3 automatically gets the Martian ex-
altation, which is: The power of the Ego to withstand failure and still maintain its
nature. The power of the spirit to withstand failure and shock.
What's so interesting for me about that is in the last several hundred years since
we have had the activation of this gate/line by Pluto so that the energy would have
been in the world, there has been an enormous ability for human beings to literally
not fail. You keep on working, you keep on plowing and you get there. There is
tremendous amount of power initiation in the scientific realm based on this ability
to be able to withstand failure and to keep on moving on. Anyway, this is an inter-
esting aspect and obviously is very much a 3rd line theme, this ability to keep one's
balance, to keep on one's feet.
Donald & Kiefer Sutherland‟s Connection Chart
So, you look at the basic structure of the design. I'll talk about the Nodes in a
moment when we get into the combination. First things first. Whenever you're
looking at the characteristics of a partnership, the first thing you're looking for is
the Center configuration. It's very easy to see right away that we have a 9 and 0,
so we have nowhere to go.
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

51
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
But we also have a problem. The problem is that we have a triple-split and it‟s be-
tween the Head-Ajna and the two other defined parts. You'll see the 40/37, the
defining of the Ego to the emotional system, that there is no way that 40/37 inte-
grates with the central split definition which is the G down to the Sacral down to
the Root and up on the side over to the Spleen. Then you have the third definition
above. So you have a triple-split 9 and 0.
You know right away that this is the kind of relationship where there is going to be
a certain amount of recognition, but the recognition is coming from the Profile. It is
coming from the individual plane, but there are going to be enormous problems in
the actual relationship itself. And of course, that is immediately the triple-split.
Triple-Splits Don‟t Want to be Whole
Remember something about the nature of triples: They don't want to be whole.
The moment you have three aspects in a partnership configuration, they're not
looking for each other at all. So, you have a relationship in which once you're in,
there's no way out and there isn't anywhere to go anyway. These are not beings
who would feel a
strong connection to
each other. The real
connection is one
that comes through
their Sun/Earths be-
cause there is this
obvious relationship
through their Profile.
Let's take a look at
some of the aspects
in the configuration.
By the way, if these
were lovers, my first
reaction in doing any
analysis would be to
point to the obvious.
This is going to be an
emotionally frustrating relationship. It's going to be emotionally frustrating be-
cause there is a trap of the karma of this kind of couple being locked into together,
and at the same time not really being able to connect to each other, and in not be-
ing able to connect to each other, the real frustration that arises in having that kind
of a relationship.

The Parent/Child Relationship
However, when you're talking about the relationship between a parent and a child,
this is a transitory relationship. It doesn't seem that way when you start off with a
baby and you have 20 years ahead of you in terms of your responsibilities as a par-
ent. When it's a parent/child, it's a very different process, obviously. One of the
things to recognize about the whole parent/child thing is really they are not proper-
ty. And the fact that there is some genetic alignment—most of it is grand-parental
anyway—obviously there are aspects of one that is in the new combination or the
new recombination that emerges.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
But the moment you look at a baby's design and you look at the design of the
mother, you know right away that this is just another life force coming into the
world. It's a life force that is intended to have its own unique geometry and its own
unique trajectory in this life. The reality is that in the relationship it has with its
parents, what really matters most of all is the acceptance of the other through be-
ing able to treat the other correctly and with respect.
If this was a parent and child I would have a reading with—and I have had quite a
few of those over the years and I must say that they're very rewarding because it's
exciting to be able to talk to the parent and the child in exactly the same language
with the exact same intent. There is a tendency to pontificate to children; there is
a tendency to talk down to children. There is a tendency to simplify in ways that
are offensive. One of the most beautiful things about doing a parent/child reading
is that it is fair, it's correct and you get to point out the good, the bad and the diffi-
cult of whatever is there in a way that is without blame and without responsibility.
In other words, you just get to see clearly what's there.
In a relationship like this, my thing would be, “You're always going to have a good
feeling towards each other. That's very much the Profile configuration. And yet, at
the same time you're going to realize that it's not easy for the two of you to deal
with each other. And that, in fact, the less you have to deal with each other is
something that is going to enhance your relationship rather than diminish it.”
This is the kind of parent/child relationship that you can really help them. Because
if there is this feeling on the part of the child that they're not being paid attention
to, that they can't communicate properly, that they can't get across what they real-
ly want to; if you have the parent saying I don't know what to do with this child,
I've tried everything, we seem to have time together but it seems like empty
space, it doesn't really work, and all these various things. To be able to give just a
simple reference point, “All you have to do is see that you're three different beings
when you're together and it doesn't always work and it doesn't have to always work
as long as you're correct with each other” is where it all begins.
The Compromises: 18/58 and the 15/5
So, let's move on from the surface of the Centers and take some examples in terms
of the way in which the configurations are working. Let's go immediately to the
problems. We get to Compromise and there are two Compromises. With both of
the Compromises, it is the son who is forcing the Compromise on the parent. Here
you have the child with the 18/58 and the parent only has the 18. That's a prob-
lem. The 18th gate: Work on What Has Been Spoilt by the father and the mother.
This is the 18th gate.
So you can see right away both of them have the 18th gate, but the energy for the
correction and the force that wins out here is going to be the child. In other words,
it's the child who is going to insist on correcting the father. And of course, the fa-

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
ther sees the problem automatically in the child because the father is that kind of a
split where when there is a problem, it's always the other person who is the prob-
lem.
So, here you have a Compromise. For example, here's the father saying, “I want
you to correct this—18/58, channel of Judgment—I don't like this.” But it's the
child who controls the energy and it's the child who controls the feel-good for the
father. The child is defining the father's splenic system. And the Root Center is
bringing all of this pressure to the Spleen, but controlling it. So, here is a father
who says, “What-
ever I try just
doesn't work. He
just won't do what
I tell him to do.”
Then he has the
15/5. If you have
a child who has the
15/5—and I know
because I have a
few of them—
beware. The child
who has the 15/5
is controlling your
flow. It's control-
ling your rhythm.
And more than
that, they never
clean up, by the way. So, you'd better either be a laundry slave or be able to af-
ford a laundry slave because the fact is that no matter hard you try to tell this child
to clean up its room, its 58 and its 15/5 is going to say "no." It just will.
So, this Compromise is going to end up being a dilemma for the father because the
father is not going to be able to get this across. No matter how hard they're going
to try, they're always going to face the brick wall of that Compromise. Now, there
are ways to get around that if you're aware. This is one of the things to under-
stand. Give up trying to correct this child, at least not that way, because it's just
not going to work. The moment you get into those kinds of confrontations with the
child, you don't have the juice. The child has the juice. It isn't going to work.
They control the Compromise. You're just going to get annoyed.
It's not going to lead to anything and you can't control their timing. You can't even
begin to try to imagine controlling their timing. So, what do you do? It's simple.
The father is a 40/37. Well, what do you do? You make a deal. It's all a bargain.
Of course, the dilemma is what kind of a bargain do you make? Is it the bargain
that if you're a good boy you'll get this? Is it the bargain that says whatever, be-
cause there are all these possible configurations that can come out.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
What I really want to explain is that when you're looking at the mechanics and you
see a Compromise, what you're really saying to that partnership is if you keep
going to that place, you're going to end up with problems. So find a way around it.
Find a way around the Compromise. If you don't find your way around the Com-
promise, you're going to end up being locked into that over and over and over
again.
Dominance: The 31/7, the 40/37, and the 3/60
Let's look at some other things: Dominance. The child is a 31/7 so the father will
get to see something about this child and it will help to understand that perhaps his
flow is actually ok because this child has the potential to be a leader. It's some-
thing that is going to be recognized by the father because this is the Dominance.
What the father won't
like is when the child
tries to lead him.
When you have a 31/7
child, even when
they're 2 years old,
they're trying to lead
you.
On the other side, you
have the father's Do-
minance. The channel
of Community, the
40/37, what we've
looked at. This is the
bonding into the sup-
port system of the
family, but, also the
3/60. In other words, the father brings mutation. For the son is the possibility to
really see the father and to see uniqueness in the father. In other words, he's ac-
tually seeing his father's definition. He sees his father outside of the relationship
inside the relationship. He can really see him for what he is. This gives him a
counterpoint to what happens to all of that when it meets him.
Electromagnetics: the 64/47 and the 20/10
Then we have the Electromagnetics. The Electromagnetics are in the 64/47, the
defining of the Ajna Center up to the Head Center; and also the channel of Awaken-
ing, which is very interesting, the 20/10. So, the basic attraction between them is
that they're going to have a mental attraction to each other. One of the things
they're going to enjoy, because it's very much a part of the abstract mental process

is being able to talk about the past together. Nostalgia for the two of them, the old
days are always going to be better for them to discuss than the present.
And yet, at the same time they have also this Electromagnetic connection bringing
them existentially into the now. The dilemma with being brought existentially into
the now is that there is this conflict in this Throat. And it is a very strong conflict in
the Throat. After all, the father has an open Throat. Having your Throat fixed in
not a comfortable thing, particularly being fixed through the Dominance. And the
Dominance, by the way, is going to be much more powerful than that Electromag-
netic. Remember,
the Electromagnet-
ic is as much about
being interested in
something or ex-
cited with some-
thing as it is about
being uncomforta-
ble with it and get-
ting tired of it in a
hurry.
So, here we have
some basic dynam-
ics in the relation-
ship. We can see
right away that this
is going to be a
difficult child to try
to control. You can see, interestingly enough, that both of them have Companion-
ship in the 21st gate. This is also going to be a child who sees his father as being
unchangeable. He's always seeing the Dominance and that is the definition of his
father. So there is something about the father that is very, very fixed and rigid in
the way in which he is going to be regarded by the son.
The Potential in the Profile
What holds this relationship together is a potential that is to be found in the Profile.
We've already seen this relationship between the 1 and the 4. So, this is a very
strong kinship. It's the same thing with the 3 and the 6. This is a father who can
very much understand, in a way, from his own youth the dilemmas of what the
child goes through with its 3rd line. And the father having learned from the ordeal
of the trial and error phase is less likely to be heavy with the trial and error phase
that the child is going to go through.

The Nodes
Where there is a clear indication that the genetic continuity is at work is that this
triple-split where you see the child with its own flow and its own direction, is the
moment you get to the Nodes there is only dissonance. In other words, their
worlds are going to be populated by very different kinds of people. The father has
2nd line Personality Nodes. For the father, being the natural who comes in and out
of seclusion, this is a basic theme.
For the child, this is the continuation of the 3rd line process and very much a
process of direction, a process of finding their vision. You have the double Gates 1
and 2 in the son's
design with the 5th
line at the uncons-
cious. You can see
the kinds of forces;
the child is going to
live in the material
world much more
than the father.
This is the 3rd line
Personality. He's
going to deal much
more with the trial
and error of life
because this is a
deep theme for
them.
Of course, this is
their discovery theme. They're going to want to find out about the world on their
own. They're going to want to find out how things work and not take that from an-
yone, including their father. Remember, they're here to challenge the authority of
the father. That's their basic Compromise advantage with the father.
What's interesting for me is that the father, from the distance, is going to enjoy the
son. You can see that with the Nodal configuration at the unconscious level for the
father, the 1st line and its resonance to the 1st line Personality of the son and very
much seeking out that stimulation. If I were to talk to them about their relation-
ship, what I would focus on is the fact that their idea of what a father/son relation-
ship should be is not something they're going to get. They're going to get the fa-
ther/son relationship that is simply there.
Understanding and Respecting Each Other for Who They Are
They have to go back to understanding how each has to be treated according to
their nature. It's going to be much more productive for the father to ask the

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
child/son. After all, this is not a child any more. Kiefer Sutherland is an adult. But
just talking about their original relationship, how important it would have been for
the father to begin that process of respecting the nature of the child and respecting
the generative quality of the child. In the same way, it's for the child to understand
the emotional nature of the father so there is not this avoidance of confrontation
and truth.
What you can see as a not-self relationship is both the father and the child disap-
pointed in what was their actual relationship, but not in each other. Of course,
that's one of the things that's interesting. Again, this is coming out of the harmony
that is in the Profile. The harmony in the Profile brings out this possibility.
The other thing is that by letting them understand they will enjoy their relationship
as they mature, but at the same time be able to recognize, particularly the parent,
what's there and what to get away from because it isn't going to do any good. It
just isn't. The fact of the matter is that the only way in which the father can work
out any kind of or-
der in the relation-
ship with the son
when the son is a
child, is that this
all has to be done
through the bar-
gain, because this
is the only way.
The child will rec-
ognize that the fa-
ther making a bar-
gain is the same
process that the
father does with
the world on the
outside. In other
words, they're be-
ing treated with
respect. It's this bargain that is the only balance to get away from the power of the
fact that both of the Compromises are in the hands of the child and that the child is
automatically ready to challenge the authority of the father because of the 18/58
configuration.
Parental Dominance Can Balance the Compromises
So, you look at this and you see 9 and 0. It's a triple-split. You know that the
Nodal configuration is going to move them strongly in different directions. You
know that the child is going to be difficult to correct and that the child is going to
be difficult to move out of its rhythms and habits. The compensation for the father

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
is going to be able to work out of Dominance because it leads from the Dominance.
The child sees it clearly. It's not confused by the relationship. And that Dominance
in the 40/37 could bring a possible balance to the Compromise.
For them to understand that to deal with each other correctly and not blame each
other for the fact that they don't integrate well when they're together or communi-
cate well when they're together, that that's not a problem. They don't have to see
that their relationship is a problem. They can actually begin to see the positives
and the benefits of the way in which they operate.
Of course, this is a clear example of what happens in the maturation of the par-
ent/child process, that is, the child becoming an adult themselves and a parent
themselves and so forth. This is the kind of relationship that benefits with time.
It's much more difficult in the early years when the control mechanism is so much
at work.
Returning to the Basics
We can do wonders with describing mechanics in relationships. The relationship
between parent and child is something that is the bedrock of creating a whole
world. It's a bedrock of where we have to do our work in order to be able to
change the way in which human beings operate. Of course, the children are inno-
cent. They need to be taught these things. Human Design is like reading, writing
and arithmetic. It's a basic thing that every human being has a right to know. You
have a right to know your design. You have a right to understand the way in which
it's correct for you to make decisions. You have a right to be treated correctly ac-
cording to your nature. This is the essence.
Whenever I do any kind of connection reading, what I always return to after I have
described the characteristics and given whatever my advice happens to be, is that I
return to the basics: The experimentation with being yourself, the experimentation
with operating correctly, and the experimentation with communicating clearly.
Here is a classic example of what can go wrong. You have an emotional father and
an unemotional child. That means that the child is going to amplify the emotional
wave. The father gets angry, the child gets angrier. The father gets angrier, the
child gets angrier. The father gets even angrier, the child gets even angrier until
there is an incredible explosion. And it's often a violent explosion.
These are things you can point out in the surface mechanics and this is what they
need. This is the beginning of the process. And then you return them to the es-
sence. You return them to their aura where they live their life regardless of what
happens to them when they move through the auras of others. They have to re-
turn to their own design. They have to return to their own question: Are they
going to operate correctly? If they operate correctly, slowly but surely the whole
story of the connection is transformed.

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
Q & A
The Sun/Earth and the Nodes Aligned
Questions from the Spanish class asked by Alok: It's about a couple, obvious-
ly. They are a different Type, a Manifestor and a Projector, and one has the
Sun/Earth axis where the other one has the Nodal axis. They share the same line
in the Nodes, but basically the key question here is about the importance of having
the Sun/Earth aligned in the gates of the Nodes with the other and especially in this
case where there is an alignment in the line.
Ra: A lot of people always remark at these kinds of things. Obviously, there is a
deep fractal line that is there. Within the context of the way allies work in life,
what's so interesting is that they may not be any more than the person who bumps
into you at exactly the right time to get you to look in another direction and you
never know who those people are and off they go.
They're as likely to have that kind of configuration with you, for example a
Sun/Earth/Nodal configuration, as will people who are close to you in your process.
However, the fact that that is there obviously does open up the possibilities that
you belong in the landscape of the other person because that's basically what it
represents. But in terms of the relationship, when you have a Manifestor and a
Projector—and you'll notice today I've not talked about Type, that's tomorrow's
theme—right away you're going to end up with basic dilemmas that go far beyond
whatever the characteristics happen to be and go to the very nature of how the be-
ings operate.
Energy Types and non-energy Types are truly very, very different. Sacral beings
and non-Sacral beings are very different from each other. There are all kinds of
very important and very significant qualities attached to what kind of Type you're
with and what kind of Type you are. So, within the context of the question regard-
ing the Nodes, yes, these are strong geometries. All it's really saying to you is
when somebody has the Sun/Earth on your Nodes, you're meeting somebody who
belongs in your landscape. But that doesn't mean they're your lover or have to be
your mother or your brother or your friend or whatever. But they do belong in your
landscape. So often we confuse that with, ok, they must be right for us simply be-
cause they are there on the scene.
A Couple with the Same Incarnation Cross
Question: In the same line, it's a couple that has the same Cross. They have the
same Sun/Earth configuration, but they have different Type and they have different
Profile. So what's the conditioning here in this kind of connection?
Ra: There are aspects of 'like likes like.' Again, this is the real dilemma between
the way in which we are ruled genetically and what the ideal could be in terms of
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

61
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
awareness. In terms of awareness, having the same Cross as somebody can ac-
tually be quite interesting. After all, it's ironic to hear that, because of course hav-
ing the same Cross as somebody, unless you're born at exactly the same time, it's
not like having the same Cross. In most cases where you have people who have
the same Cross with each other, they actually have the planetary configurations in
different aspects.
But regardless, even if it's exactly the same Sun/Earth Personality configuration as
an example, again this is not something that by its very nature will hold a relation-
ship together or even attract somebody to the relationship. It's very much like
Companionship where, in fact, it's something that can actually be boring and not
interesting at all. I don't hang out with Clarions.
Is the Public Aura of Value for Triple-Split Relationships?
Question: (on the value the public aura for triple-splits)
Ra: You're absolutely correct. You can see that up there. Donald Sutherland has
a triple-split. The question is whether the public aura would be of value in bridging
the relationship. Remember something about triples, and this is one of the real
keys for them: It's very important for them to move. It's not so much the father
and son being in a public place togeth-
er as the travelling to the public place
in many ways is really the remedy.
This is the kind of thing where moving
around together and doing things to-
gether where they can remain basically
separate and find things of interest so
they don't have to get stuck with the
fact that they can't cross their triple-
split lines, yes, it would be very much
of value. And certainly the best memo-
ries they're going to have are not
memories of the two of them stuck in the room somewhere. The best memories
they're going to have are of things they were doing, because again, this is an ad-
vantage with splits always to be in the public domain.
What‟s the Influence of Harmony between Nodal Lines?
Question: (on the Sutherland‟s 2nd and 5th Nodal lines)
Ra: The question is about the 2nd line Nodes of the father and the 5th line Nodes of
the son. Obviously we are dealing with a harmony there. The thing that's interest-
ing is that the son has a way of inspiring the father. And I think that's the thing
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

62
Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
you can see most directly from that. In other words, the 5th line is the ability to call
and the 2nd line is all about waiting for that call. So there is this potential of the
child being able to inspire the father with a creative direction or with a vision.
That's very much a possibility.
At the same time, also for the father it gives him a sense of the power of the child.
Yet, when we're looking at the Nodes within the context of the landscape, the fa-
ther is going to find difficulty with the kinds of friends and the kinds of associations
that the son is going to have. The son is going to be dealing with the projection
field a lot, the trial and error in the projection field. And certainly the father is
going to be very much aware of all that at work. He's going to be very concerned
about the child not being able to make it.
But to answer your question directly, that 5 would very much influence the father.
The child would be special in that sense. When I looked at this relationship the
other day when I was figuring out which ones to use, it was obvious to me that
here was a clear example of what is not a bad relationship, just one that without
understanding the mechanics could end up being considered a bad relationship
when, in fact, there is a real potential in this relationship for recognition of both for
each other.
Are Splits a Focus in a Connection Chart?
Question: (on splits in a connection chart)
Ra: A question is about a split in the relationship chart. Is that a focus for them
just like it would be a focus for an individual? It would be if it was a simple-split,
but it's not. It's a triple-split. As a simple-split, all the pressure is going to be on
that gate. You can see very clearly if you could track when those people met each
other—I'm not talking about parent/child, but lovers or associates or whatever—it's
a guarantee that either in the aura that split was being connected or there was a
planetary imprint that was connecting that split. The simple-split is always looking
for wholeness; the triple-split is not. So, in this particular configuration, no, it
would not be having that impact.
Is Age a Factor in Relationship Analysis?
Question: Ra, coming back to the 'like likes like,' a couple that has the same
Cross and same Profile, but being in a different cycle, for example, if the female
being in a Saturn cycle and the male being in the Kiron cycle, does that have a sig-
nificant factor in the relationship?
Ra: I honestly don't think that age has anything to do with relationships. I really
don't, because you don't see it in the chart. I don't mean to be simple; but it's
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

true, you don't. There are obviously cultural and conditioned things that are at
work when it comes to relationships where there is a distance in age.
Again, when I'm looking at a relationship in the same way I'm looking at some-
body's chart, I don't look at their Profile, I look at their characteristics. I don't look
at their Profile because I know that they're not looking at their purpose. So, I look
at the characteristics and I see what's getting in the way. The same thing is true
about the way I've presented this information today.
The first thing I do is look at the characteristics of the partnership before I would
look at the Sun/Earth relationships and the Nodal relationships because the charac-
teristics are what define the relationship. Most relationships having this configura-
tion, most parent/child configurations that would be like this in the not-self world,
you would have a very contentious environment. You would have a child who
would really feel not recognized, not really loved, always fighting control, always
complaining about the quality of the relationship; the parent being very unhappy
not being able to apply basic rules or basic regimen to the child, always meeting
resistance, and not being able to communicate with each other.
In the not-self basis, you look at the characteristics and you see what the dilemma
is. Then, if you're dealing with beings that—I don't think the knowledge of the
Sun/Earths and the Nodes are as much for the client as they are for the analyst.
For me, I never got into such things. I really didn't. I stayed with the surface be-
cause I know that this is where the truth is, this is where the problem is, this is
where you have to start. I always stayed just with the characteristics of the rela-
tionship because the surface shows you where the surface problems are and you're
dealing with not-self.
At a higher level, at a level in which awareness is beginning to work, then you can
look at the higher relationships. What does it mean for two people to have the
same Cross if they don't operate as themselves in a relationship that is dysfunc-
tional? It doesn't mean anything. It is what's there in the characteristics that pro-
vide anything.
However, when things are ok, when you go through that period where the transits
are right, or whatever the case may be and it appears that the relationship is all
right, it's in those moments that individuals can catch glimpses of what the Nodal
configuration or the Sun/Earth configuration can really express. But most human
beings are just caught on the surface of the characteristics of how they connect.
Coming Back to the Same Basics of Authority
Question: So, really we're all talking about coming back to the same basics of the
Authority.
Ra: Yes, that's my secret. I don't know if it's a secret. It's my obsession. I don't
even know if it's an obsession. I just realize that it's the only thing worthwhile

teaching. It is the very, very basis of the teaching of anyone who is coming to you
for knowledge, this knowledge. It's the best teaching there is. It works. It's sim-
ple. It's direct. And it's where everything begins.
So often, it's like people who like to study things in order to avoid the truth of it.
It's the same thing. It's so easy to get into this relationship and that relationship
and this thing and the other thing and it's interesting to look at all these configura-
tions. But the fact of the matter is that the real question is you. It's always you.
If you're correct, you can deal with somebody who is dysfunctional. If you're cor-
rect, you can live in a world of dysfunction. If you're correct, then you can live as
you should. This is really what it's all about. It's only then that you begin to open
up to the possibility of the other.
It's very, very difficult for human beings to truly accept the other. It's quite some-
thing. You have to go through layers and layers and layers of resistance. I know.
I've been through that movie. Every open Center I have, I've gone through layers
and layers of resistance of finally just accepting that what passes through those
open Centers is just what passes through. And that ultimately I can turn my gaze
upon it and see what it is and learn something from it instead of being the victim of
it.
But it comes back to each and every one of us as ourselves. The rest of it, yeah,
and of course, what you're dealing with is not-self people who want not-self solu-
tions. They don't want the higher this or that. They don't want to understand that
if they can be correct and their partner can be correct, that they have a shared
purpose on the same Cross. It all sounds interesting, but the fact of the matter is
in order for them to operate in their relationship, the most they can handle is what
you give them on the surface. And that, in and of itself, is going to be difficult for
them.
Comment: Thanks very much.
In the 7 and 2, What Does the 'Work to Do Mean'?
Question: (on the 7 and 2)
Ra: What does the 'work to do' mean? Basically what it is saying is it's not fun.
That's the 8 and 1. So, there are always dilemmas, always. You have two open
windows, or two open doors, however you want to look at it, and there are always
ways to get out the relationship.
You can see on the mundane level the characteristics of the way in which people
meet. The moment you have areas of Compromise, you always have the attempt
of escape. There is always this "I have to get away from this." Whether it's "I
have to get away from this" so you go early to work and you come home late, or
whether it's "I have to get away from this" and you lie in bed and pretend you don't
feel good, the fact of the matter is the 'work to do' means that the relationship is

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
not something that is guaranteed. It means there is going to have to be effort. If
the effort isn't made, then the relationship won't survive.
This is where you get the cliché of these couples who talk about how they've
worked on their relationship. My partner and I after 20 plus years, we're a 7 and 2
and I have a real good idea of what 'work to do' means. It is work. And yet, it
can't be a cliché for other kinds of relationships. The 8 and 1 doesn't have any
work to do. As a matter of fact, for the 8 and 1 it's learning how to have fun to-
gether, which is a totally different thing. 7 and 2s don't learn how to have fun to-
gether; they learn how to survive each other. It's all part of the different mechan-
ics that are there in any of these configurations.
They tell you so much. It's what I love about the simple. It's what I love about the
surface. And it's what I try to remind intelligent people, because intelligent people
tend to be dumb. They tend to forget that a simple truth has the greatest potential
to be a universal truth. As long as we stay on the surface, we are dealing with real
mechanical truths and we're able to provide what is honest and useful guidance to
anyone. They don't need all the details.
Again, as a professional class, you really have to see that you need the details, you
need to be deep. You need to know all of this. You need to have that feel for what
that Sun/Earth and those Nodes are talking about. But it's not for them. It's not
for them because it's not time. If they really get into it, if they go through a
process where they want to find out more, it can always be available for them, but
not when they're coming for that reading, because for that reading, the surface is
going to deal with everything that they're dealing with. This is where you have to
put your focus.
It also gives you very clear, very straightforward tools for you to use so that you
can be confident in your approach. You're able to point at things because they are
the surface where you can be absolutely accurate and confident and it's going to
have its correct impact. So, the surface is the place for us to work in these kinds of
analyses.
Written Comment: (on 7 and 2 Relationships)
Ra: Yes, there is that aspect. The comment about a failed 7 and 2 relationship
where you say, “I hated it but I learned a lot.” That's true. 7 and 2 relationships
are often the kinds of relationships where if you do walk away from them, you feel
like you blew it the rest of your life, regardless of whatever happens to you after-
wards, whether you enter into other relationships or whatever. There is always a
part of you that understands that more could have been done, that it could have
been worked out. Of course, that's given that with the 7 and 2, the other configu-
rations in the design are actually something that contribute to their being a poten-
tially good relationship.

Lesson 2
Electromagnetics and Dominance
Written Question: (on the 6 and 3)
Ra: A question about the 6 and 3; it's better to be free. It's just that simple. It
doesn't mean you have to be free. It doesn't mean that at all. But what it means
is that you're going to have to look at a different kind of relationship. Basically the
'better to be free' kind of relationship is you can almost see that in this trend over
the last 25 years to move away from formal marriage. That is, the formal bond.
The 7 and 2s tend to be formally bonded. They need something to hold them to-
gether while they do their work.
But the 6 and 3 don't like that at all. And as long as they can have, through
awareness, a relationship where you really don't need to have a strong connection
to the other, then I suppose it's possible. I do know of many cases of 6 and 3s who
have a lot of children and had a lot of children quickly. These are the kinds of
things that the moment you move from a connection into a Penta, you change all
the configurations and many things are possible. But of course, it doesn't mean
that, in essence, their relationship has improved. It still has the same dilemmas
and the same problems. The moment I'm dealing with somebody who has a 6 and
3 relationship, I'm very straightforward. I give them the rhyme.
Written Question: (on the Rhymes)
Ra: These rhymes don't leave much room for good relationships, do they? They
do actually. All of them do. After all, these names—9 and 0 nowhere to go—if you
have the right person, why go anywhere? You can be locked into them forever.
There is great potential in that.
8 and 1 have some fun, yeah, good; the two of you exploring the world together,
fighting the good cause together, and doing things together, whatever the case
may be. The 7 and 2 'work to do,' well, doing the work is very satisfying. You ask
any couple that is a 7 and 2 who survive long enough and they'll tell you it was
worth it and it was interesting to go through that process because they end up
probing each other much more deeply, as an example.
And 6 and 3s, yeah, sure it's better to be free, but it doesn't mean you have to be
free. But it does say that you're going to have to do even more work than the 7
and 2, and you're going to have to do that work in a way in which you're not going
to have the same quality of dependency that will arise in different kinds of configu-
rations.
There is no such thing as a negative configuration. But the not-self in and of itself
is negative. This is the beginning of the problem. Every single aspect, every de-
sign, I can look at any design and I can describe it as if Jesus Christ was walking
again, because quite frankly, every design is like that. But the reality is that we
don't live that. We don't live the correctness of the potential. We are not surren-
dered. So, all of these things turn out to be quagmires. If you go and do surveys
of couples, you'll discover right away that there are a lot of problems out there in
the way in which human beings deal with each other.

Written Comment: (on having many Centers defined)
Ra: That's true, Theresa's comment about if you have a lot of Centers defined, ob-
viously, you're going to end up in different configurations. Yes, this is just one of
those genetic predispositions. Obviously, any relationship, even the 5 and 4, not a
relationship any more. I know a couple who is a 5 and 4, clients I knew years ago
with children and they managed. They had their problems. Obviously, they have
their problems. But these are exceptions.
Most 7 and 2s with the Compromise in their design, the work is never going to real-
ly be fulfilling. They're going to end up with real problems. Most 8 and 1s don't
know how to have fun together. Most 6 and 3s are better to be free. Again, it all
has to do with awareness.
Ok folks, I want to thank you all. It's been fun tonight. I enjoyed it. I hope you
did. We're going to take a focus on Type tomorrow and look at sameness as a
theme. I'd also like to say so long to our friends who are linked up in Spanish and
our friends who are linked up in Italian and to thank Alok and Viviane for their
translation and Gennaro for hooking us all up so that we can all enjoy our virtual
now. Until then, until the next time, ciao.

Lecture Three
Type
Hello everybody. Welcome to day three. This is an interesting day for me. This is
the exact Design Nodal return of my experience or my encounter with the Voice.
It's exactly 18.6 years ago today, at least from the Design Nodal configuration. So,
it's really the beginning of a brand new cycle and certainly all of you who are partic-
ipating in this environment, in this way of teaching, are really part of what is the
foundation of the cycle to come. [Date: June 10, 2005.]
The Dilemma of Type
But anyway, welcome to all of you. Today I want to begin with a look at one of the
most basic things about the way in which we meet each other. Obviously, that has
to do with the basis of Design which is Type. I think that in most cases, most con-
nections at the very beginning—because I really want to see it within the context of
any kind of one-on-one with anyone—that within that context, Type is first and
foremost the thing that can be a dilemma.
We already have a situation where you have approximately 68% of the human
population are Generators. Then you have the other 32% who are non-Generator,
regardless of what type of configuration you look at—the Manifestor, the Projector
or the Reflector. There is an enormous difference. I cannot stress the large gigan-
tic capitalization of enormous; there is an enormous difference between Types. It's
just enormous.
The deeper I go in my process in the knowledge of Human Design, the longer my
experience after going through this entire Nodal cycle, the thing that strikes me so
clearly over and over and over again is how different Types are from each other.
The longer I've had to settle into what it is to be me, which is an Ego Manifestor,
how clear it is that anyone who is not an Ego Manifestor is an alien. It's just clear
to me. They didn't get off the same bundle. We're not related. It's almost a dif-
ference as vast as gender. It's huge.
I think that my relationship to it, or to see it in that way is rooted in how long I've
been away from being homogenized. It's so clear to me that the closer you come
to your own nature, the more you realize how differently everyone else functions. I
look at the Generator world and I slowly wag my head. It's like wow, how do they
do that, how do they function like that? How is it possible to have that thing that is

always pounding away inside of them? If you just breathe in Generator when
you're not a Generator, it's like wow, what is that and how do they do that?
The fact is, despite the fact that I'm somebody who is non-Sacral, Projectors for me
are as alien as Generators. I'm an energy Type and they're not. And the differ-
ence between energy Types and non-energy Types is enormous. Enormous is a big
word. It's just huge. I really want you to consider at all times the fact that we're
in this deep imprint and there is this huge homogenization going on through the
receptors we have. Obviously we have an enormous number of receptors in every-
one's design
Everyone has Receptors Open to Conditioning
Anything that's not activated, all of it that's hanging is all open to conditioning; it's
all open to being impacted. Through all of that impacting there is this kind of mix-
ing of the soup. I have a friend who is very enthralled with Human Design these
days and he was telling me he's doing an exercise. His exercise is trying to figure
out what people's designs are, just trying to figure it out by just talking to them,
feeling them out in that sense. He's a Projector.
I said that's interesting, but I said it's going to be very, very difficult to tell a non-
energy Type from a Generator. How do you tell a non-energy Type from a Genera-
tor unless you really have a sensitivity to the way in which they work with energy,
because of course, it's not there's. Most of the Projectors you will see going around
doing their daily business have the quality of a kind of super Generator. The only
difference is that the super Generator/Projector crawls home half dead from doing
all of that stuff and the Generator is still buzzing and buzzing and buzzing and
buzzing.
We're dealing with an enormous barrier that's in the way of being able to get to any
deeper level in a relationship. What I mean by “deeper level” is the surface we've
been talking about for the first two days. In other words, the first thing that's
going to stand in the way is Type. I've always had a dilemma with partnership. My
dilemma with partnership is that if you're absolutely rigid in the mechanics, then
it's very clear that the basis upon which most human beings have their relationship
is really just off and it doesn't work and it's not going to work. What you get from
not-self relationships is the development of strategies and ways of trying to survive
relationships. You build up myths and all kinds of things to give you the ability to
tolerate what is, in fact, mechanically, relationships that are simply not intended to
work.
We are Driven by Genetic Attractions
We had this discussion, I think it was on the first day, about the difference between
being attracted to the opposite and liking what is similar. Of course, this is the ba-

Lesson 3
Type
sic dilemma. If you're going to operate correctly and you're going to be aware,
then what is truly going to be attractive is what you can share with the other, in
other words, commonality, likeness. Likeness is going to be something that opens
up the potential of a really deep relationship.
However, the only way you can have a relationship like that now is in a deep strug-
gle with your genetics. It's your genetics, this 'opposite attracts,' that makes eve-
rything exciting. Unfortunately, when you look at the not-self, when they meet
something that is similar, though in fact there is a certain comfort level to it, it is
invariably not attractive. It's not like your genes are twigging you and saying that's
interesting. That over there is interesting. It doesn't do that.
So, we have a real dilemma. The fact of the matter is that if you're a non-Sacral
being, you're going to be attracted to Sacral beings. It's just an obvious. You have
that 32% who don't have it, who want it and it's the way the genes set it up. It's
very, very difficult to break those habits because these are not intellectual con-
structs. They're genetic imperatives. We're ruled by the genetic imperatives.
The only thing we can pray for—and it's coming—is for mutation because mutation
changes the rules. As long as the rules don't change, we're stuck with the limita-
tion and the limitation is that what we're really going to find attractive is always
what we're not because that's what the genes are doing.
So, on one hand I'm going to raise up the banner of ideal and say if you're Projec-
tor and you fall for a Generator, you have to consider that you already have several
strikes against you in terms of having a relationship that is going to be mutually
satisfying and beneficial; period. It's not like that's going to stop the Projector from
being excited by the potential of their relationship with the Generator, or vice ver-
sa, whatever the reasons are for the genetic connection. In other words, we're
dealing with a very, very difficult dilemma. It really is a difficult dilemma. The fact
is we are driven by these genetic attractions. That's what drives us.
Moving Away from the Genetic Trap
This movement away from this kind of trap, this kind of genetic trap is a two-fold
process. One side of it is simply the awareness of the limitation of crossing the
Type line. And also, to be clear that there are varying mechanics at work. So, bas-
ically what I want to describe to you are some of these mechanics and the way to
look at them as an overview.
The ideal within the context of the not-self genetic domain is Generator with Gene-
rator. There is a better chance with Generator with Generator than just about any
kind of mixing. Now, a lot of that has to do with the fact that the Sacral Center is
so powerful. It's so powerful in the way in which it is going to dominate. If you're
dealing with two Generators and they both have these powerful Sacral systems, the
genetic attraction has nothing to do with that Sacral energy. In other words, it is a

companion and the genetic attraction is going to be somewhere else within the de-
sign.
In that sense, they bypass Type as a conflict unless, of course, they don't pay any
attention to their nature. In other words, the way in which Generators need to deal
with each other is highly specialized. This is the mutual decision making process.
And this mutual decision making process between Generators is very important. It
illustrates one of those things that is often confusing to people who first come into
Human Design and discover they're a Generator and they're supposedly here to
wait and respond. There is this sense that, oh, my God I cannot initiate anything
ever again. Of course, it's simply not true.
Strategy and the Decision Making Process
Everything about Strategy—and it's something to remind anyone you're dealing
with—the whole business in Strategy in Human Design is related to one thing and
one thing only. It's related to the decision making process. So, for example, you
have two Generators who are together and one Generator has a sudden brainstorm
and they decide, “Why don't we go for a drive out to this place and do this thing
and that thing.” The other Generator goes, “Uh-huh, good idea.” Now, the whole
point of the Generator-to-Generator communication is that it has to be confirmed.
This is a very, very important awareness that arises when you realize that when
you ask the person who just make the suggestion if they really want to do that,
there's no guarantee that they're actually going to say yes; none.
The fact that things are moving through, the fact that things move through our
mind, if you are in a partnership relationship with somebody and you have Throat
activations, there are things that are going to be said; it's always going on. This is
the whole business of life. But the decision always has to go back to the Authority.
So, when I'm in a situation where I have a connection between beings and they're
both Generators then there is a very, very easy way, a very beautiful way to just
simply go to the core of how they can deal with each other in terms of communica-
tion and decision making.
The moment a couple can comfortably make decisions together, this is an enorm-
ous triumph. It is. It is very, very difficult for couples to make decisions together.
Most couple decisions are majority votes in the sense that somebody is pushing
much harder and somebody is giving in. Rarely is it truly mutual decision making.
One of the advantages of Sacral beings being together is that they really have this
mechanical way in which they can have this mutual confirmation in decision making
together. This is a very healthy kind of relationship. After all, for Generators the
gene pool is huge. There are over four billion Generators on the planet. It means
that the Generator-to-Generator relationship is one that has the highest potential of
commonality and it is one that can be very, very successful.
But again, anything about the Generator-to-Generator relationship—and by the way
you notice that I'm not adding any caveats to whether they're Manifesting Genera-

Lesson 3
Type
tors or emotional Generators, I'm simply talking about the Sacral phenomena in
and of itself, that if you bring two Sacral beings together they are both Generators,
there is a fundamental comfort in the way their energy process works. This is the
other thing that's so important.
A Generator with a Non-Sacral Being
Think about a Generator with a non-Sacral being. They can never truly end the day
together. If they end the day together, one of them is doing something wrong be-
cause they have a very different end-of-the-day process. They have a very differ-
ent way of dealing with things. The Sacral energy has to wind its way down and it
gets there through going to a point of exhaustion. But the non-Sacral being has to
be very, very careful about extending their use of energy beyond what is reasona-
ble or orderly. In other words, it's very important for non-Sacral beings to con-
serve their energy, to lie down early, to go to sleep before exhaustion.
So, in fact, a Generator and a Projector, if they're staying up together and they're
having what appears to be a good time, one of them is going to be suffering. It's
simply a fact, because they're different. Oh yeah, you can get to the point of
awareness where the Generator keeps on going and the Projector drops off. You
can have those kinds of things. Obviously, awareness can benefit any kind of rela-
tionship. But after all, let's be practical. This is a not-self plane and connection is
the basis of the world. The moment you're dealing with energy phenomena that is
different, you immediately have problems that are going to arise in the way in
which you work out how you live together.
A Manifestor with a Generator; one would assume, all right, they're energy Types.
But the fact of the matter is that they're very, very different from each other and
very different in the way they're going to use their energy. And Manifestors, any-
way, are different because they have different kinds of energy systems they oper-
ate out of. I'm very different than an emotional Manifestor. That is, the only mo-
tor I have is my Ego which means that I will only use my energy out of my own
willfulness. There is no other way. If I don't have the will, it isn't going to happen.
That has absolutely nothing to do with what it is to be a Generator. A Generator
can go for a walk simply because going for a walk is using their energy and they
need to use their energy. To ask an Ego Manifestor to go for a walk, the Ego Mani-
festor says, “Why should I invest my energy in this? I'm not going anywhere,
there's nothing really to do. Why should I put my will to this? I don't need the ex-
ercise.”
Generators and Projectors
You have to see that there are fundamental, deep differences between the physical
Types. Now, there are some potentials. For example, the vast majority of humani-

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

ty is either Generators or Projectors. That's just the story. Somewhere around
90%, nine out of every ten people you're either going to be a Generator or you're
going to be a Projector. I know that mystically there is a very profound relationship
between the Generator and the Projector. That it is the very basis of the underly-
ing potential of humanity to be transformed. They have a very special connection
to each other.
The Generator is here to leave behind, through finding their true voice, their true
Authority, their slavery, and in leaving behind their slavery, leave behind the fru-
stration that slavery brought. At the same time, that's transformed into building.
But building is one of these vast generics; building what, building when, building
with whom, all of these various things.
Basically what that term 'building' means is that a slave is conditioned to do work
on things that may not be of any value to it or creatively are not of any value to it.
To be a builder is to use your energy to construct, to build, to invest in, whatever
language you want to use, to use your energy correctly. The fact is, in terms of the
way the hierarchy works, the Generator in and of themselves, particularly in terms
of the kinds of things that would be transforming at a planetary scale, the direction
for that is intended to come from Projectors. After all, the Projector who is the ul-
timate non-energy Type, the vast majority of the non-energy Type, the Projector is
here to guide energy.
Obviously, the Projector has a particular gift for that. That is, the gift of recogni-
tion, the ability to be able to recognize capacity in the other. The dilemma for the
Projector is because they are so disturbed by being a non-energy Type, one of the
difficult things for them to do is ask for energy instead of taking it. So there is a
basic struggle between the Projector and the Generator. It's interesting to note—
the discussions I have with professionals over the years—there is almost a level of
distaste that is expressed by Generators for Projectors and Projectors in return for
Generators. There is a dilemma in their relationship.
Of course, the Generator is here to be asked and the Projector is here to recognize
what needs to be asked. Asking someone something is not telling them anything.
This is one of the dilemmas for Projector consciousness. That is, how do you use a
question to aid somebody? What is the right question for the Generator? What is
the right thing that will allow them to respond with a certainty and an authority
that is going to be mutually beneficial for the both, because there is a real—how
can I put this? A Generator and a Projector have something special to offer each
other. And that's very important.
The Sacral being is the only being who knows how to work. They really know how
to work. They're here to work. They're here to fill the life with productivity. The
Projector is looking for a good life. They want the life. They're not here for the
work. The work is not something that is designed for them. They're non-energy
Types, after all. They're looking for the quality of life. What the Projector can offer
the Generator is a life. And what the Generator can teach the Projector is the value
of work.

Lesson 3
Type
Now, these two things are very important. It really is the crux of their relationship
together. Now, I'm not suggesting for a moment that the not-self Projector with a
not-self Generator is going to be a good relationship. But what I am saying is that
there is a potential in working with couples, or in working with connections where
you have this kind of a relationship, to recognize that there is a deep potential ben-
efit in it. But again, it goes back to the two of them really, mutually coming into
that relationship together correctly.
The Protocol between the Generator and the Projector
Think about how that works. The Projector is here to be invited. And the Genera-
tor is here to respond. The relationship between the Generator and the Projector
has to be initiated by the Generator. Yet, the Generator never knows if that's cor-
rect. Think about that. So, the Generator invites the Projector out for lunch. The
Projector says to the Generator: Are you interested in me? And the Generator
goes: Uh-huh. Then you have something that's working.
But it's one of the things to understand that there is a protocol in the way in which
these relationships work. And just as there has to be conformation between Gene-
rator and Generator, there has to be a very complex protocol between the Genera-
tor and the Projector. I think the term that's used is genuflection. The ancient
shah in Persia—if you were going to be an emissary from another place, another
tribe, and you were wanting to have an audience with shah, you would have to
train for three months to learn all the different things you would have to do as you
approached him, the bending down, the curtsy, and the words you had to say, this
and that, and this gesture and that gesture and the other thing. It's like watching
these nature television shows and you get to see a couple of creatures doing their
mating dance.
What I want to really make clear—I'm using the technical language of protocol, but
there is this bonding protocol that is necessary between Types. What it leads to is
the ability through their Authority to confirm that they're in the right kind of rela-
tionship. Again, I'm not just referring to whether this is going to be a lover or a
friend or a business associate. As a matter of fact, the Generator/Projector busi-
ness relationship is one that can be enormously beneficial. But again, it goes back
to the protocol.
The Manifestor/Generator Relationship
Now, what's left out of that, and you can tell there's something left out, if most of
the Generators are to be with Generators and the rest of them are designed to form
this alliance with Projectors, then 10% of humanity is left out there on the edges.
That is, the larger group of Manifestors and of course the Reflectors. Now, Manifes-
tors have a dilemma. It would be an ideal for Manifestors to be with Manifestors,
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

75
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
except that the gene pool is very limited. The fact is that Manifestors end up in re-
lationships with Generators more than anything else.
Again, this has to do with the fact that they are energy Types and there is an illu-
sion that they are similar because they are energy Types. The dilemma is that the
Manifestor/Generator relationship is often one in which communication is very diffi-
cult. The Manifestor is here to inform, not to ask. That leads to a dilemma. The
Generator is waiting to be asked, but instead of being asked they're simply told
something. This becomes a real problem. Most Manifestor/Generator relationships
simply root themselves in the fact that they are mutually productive as energy
Types and don't overly concern themselves with the fact that the basic communica-
tion doesn't work. They don't really belong together.
Interestingly enough, if you look at the way in which the mutative process has tak-
en place since the advent of the nine-centered being, the fact that the hierarchical
structure has changed with Projectors replacing Manifestors, in many ways as we
become more aware, there will be less and less Manifestors. In other words, in a
sense, it is a Type that is fading. I've often talked about the fact that you can
sense that. If you bring a room of Manifestors together it's like having former ra-
cehorses that have been out to pasture for many years. There is no sense that
their impact is there anymore. And there is a real transition in that.
Reflector/Reflector Couples
Where it is exceedingly difficult is for Reflectors. The fact is that the Reflector be-
ing with a Reflector, well, it's interesting. I know Reflector couples. As a matter of
fact, I know a Reflector couple who have Reflector children, which is really fascinat-
ing. I think there is a four-member family that is actually a 5/4 as a family. It's
very strange. Of course, you have all of these oddities out there. And there is no
question that when you're with somebody in terms of being the same Type, there
are always certain advantages because there is this fundamental similarity of your
own kind. It really is such a defining difference.
That group of Generators and Projectors who are intended to bond, because that's
really is what's out there in the program, this is a kind of mutative revolutionary
group in that sense. They're the ones who have built in the ability to be able to
communicate most successfully across that boundary of Type.
The Not-Self and Its Strategies
The moment we enter into this whole complexity of looking at connections between
beings, the first thing you have to see when you sit down with a couple and one of
them is a Generator and the other one is a Projector, you know right away the ba-
sic dilemma. And you have good advice for them, advice about how to use their
energy, how to go to sleep at night, the requirement of having their own bedroom,

Lesson 3
Type
particularly if you're cross-energy Types. You can save a dysfunctional energy
Type/non-energy Type relationship just by introducing separate bedrooms for them
because at least that is going to take some of the pressure off.
As long as humanity as a whole doesn't operate correctly, and obviously it doesn't,
there is enormous dysfunction in the way in which we deal with each other. Most
people would say, “Gee, that means all relationships,” and so forth and so on. Yes,
that's true. The whole thing about the not-self is how clever it is at developing its
strategies. These not-self strategies that end up saying, “I'm staying with the
jerk”—somebody with an open Spleen—“because even though this is a jerk, I feel
secure.” You come up with all kinds of reasons for that. They come up with all
kinds of stuff out of the not-self and the way in which the not-self organizes the
dysfunction in the maia.
Generator/Generator Couples
Type is something that is right there at the very beginning. A lot of couples are
going to be Generator/Generator couples, and then you really have a chance.
These are the ones you can have the most success with. You will see that. When I
was given the knowledge, it was clear to me that success in awakening was the
Generator. If anyone had the potential to truly be awakened mechanically it was a
Generator. They're designed for it. As long as there were enough people who had
courage to experiment with response, you finally get to a point where you begin to
see that the liberation of Generators is something that's really possible. It's not
easy, but it's certainly very possible.
The Generator couple in the same way can really find a language within the charac-
teristics of the relationship. This is what's so special. They can have a very consis-
tent, very productive way to be able to communicate with each other within their
relationship. The other thing is that it builds mutual respect. In the same way, as
a Generator you enter into your process of listening to your Sacral, slowly but sure-
ly you become very impressed with your Sacral. It really is quite something.
The moment you have couples who are asking each other through their Sacrals in
communication with each other, there's something interesting about that. The Sa-
cral cannot be perceived as being manipulative or conniving. Do you understand?
In other words, when two Generators are communicating with each other and
they're getting back the tonal responses, immediately this no longer sits within the
way the mind will say, "Well, you're only saying that because…," because when
you're dealing with the Sacral you can't do that anymore. You have an essential
truth that is coming out of someone.

Advice to the Emotional Relationship
Now, in dealing with partnership and in dealing with Type, there is one last thing
that has to be kept really clear. Almost 80-85% of the relationships that you're
going to look at are going to be emotional in their partnership characteristics. One
of the basic things for us to understand in terms of what advice can provide just
mechanically is to recognize that in emotional relationships, there is no way deci-
sions can be made in the now.
When you're dealing with two Generators who are experimenting with communicat-
ing with each other in a way that there is a shared decision making process, and if
they're experimenting with that over time, it will really be remarkable for them to
discover the value of what it means for them to work together. Here is the real po-
tential for a highly successful relationship you can work with.
Now, I've not talked about whatever the characteristics happen to be, the way they
connect together; we're not talking about Sun/Earth and Nodes and all of these
other things that we have been discussing. But you have to see that this is the first
door. It's the first level of looking at them. The moment somebody says to me
that this is a Generator with a Projector I go, uh-huh. There is like eight zillion
things that I already know about the dilemmas and the problems and the potential
difficulties that are inherent in that kind of a bond. And it already starts the
process.
Live Life According to Your Nature
Do you realize that in every description I give you about all of these aspects, the
real solution in terms of being able to provide or offer them advice that can be
beneficial to their relationship, it always returns to themselves? It always returns
to who they are and how they live their life and do they live their life according to
their nature. If you're living your life according to your nature, this is the thing.
It's not about the relationship that you may be in now.
It is about the connections that you will make today and tomorrow and the next
day and the day after that. It is about beginning to see that if you're operating
correctly, you begin to change the way in which you connect to the other and the
problems that seem so obvious in the not-self way of connecting to people, most of
those problems just peter away, at least from your side of the perspective.
So much of what it means to be with the other is what it is to be within ourselves.
My teaching is not „love thy neighbor.' I don't have anything against loving your
neighbor, though I've never had that occasion. My thing is you love yourself. If
you can love yourself and if you can love what is yourself in the sense that it is you,
it is what is correct about you, it is your differentiated self, you are your only au-
thority, then you're really open to love. It doesn't mean it's going to be there. It
just means that you're really open to it. And you're not carrying any conditions.

Lesson 3
Type
You're not carrying any 'it's got to be this or that, or this way or that way.' It all
begins with the self and it all begins with the way in which you operate in this life.
The first thing you're going to look at when looking at their designs, you have to
see their nature and these combinations of Type. It doesn't do any good to tell a
Generator who's with a Projector that this is an enormous mistake and get di-
vorced. It doesn't do any good. What you can do in most of these cases is that by
returning them to themselves and by giving them a hint of what's possible when as
themselves they come together, they can begin to see the real benefit that is inhe-
rent in the relationship.
Offer Relief
But most of the things we're here to offer them are things that bring relief. The
separate bedroom brings relief. Knowing how to make decisions together brings
relief. These are things that are very, very important for us.
The other thing is advice. The longer you operate as a professional, the more
you're going to have people who will call you up when they have their latest what-
ever. They meet somebody to fall in love with or they're about to form a partner-
ship with somebody and they want to have a look at it or there's a new baby arriv-
ing and you want to see what the relationship is going to be. You have to see that
the moment you're looking at the Type, this is going to tell you right away the most
superficial thing that is going to impact on the way in which these people are going
to connect with each other and the basic advice you can give them. You're inter-
ested in this person? Well, make sure you always ask them. It's simple advice.
Simple advice based on the simple, based on the surface.
The Projector/Generator Relationship has Potential
So, Type makes a big difference. It's very important to see that the moment you
have cross-Type configurations, you're always going to have difficulties. The only
one that truly has potential, and it's not the case for all Generators or all Projectors,
but the one that does have potential as a cross-Type relationship is the relationship
between the Projector and the Generator. This is one, quite frankly, that over time
has to be nurtured because our future and the way we're going to operate and the
way our civilization is going to mature is going to be deeply dependent on the
quality of this relationship between the Projector and the Generator.
The further we are removed from the potential of that relationship, the more diffi-
cult our own process will be in terms of the way in which we manage resources on
the planet, the way we focus our energy on the things that are going to be neces-
sary for us to deal with the vagaries of what it is to be a bio-form on this planet.
So, Type is really at the core.

Shirley MacLaine: Emotional Projector
Here we're looking at a brother and sister relationship. We're going to be looking
at the relationship between her and Warren Beatty, who is her brother. But again,
my interest isn't in them, it's simply about the configurations.
Here you can see a Projector configuration and we have a split definition. Again,
remember it's very important in relationship to partnerships that you always keep
in mind that when you're dealing with a split definition, that relationships are very
important and the quality of the bridge, the kind of bridging that is necessary to
bring their split together is going to be the area where you're going to have the
deepest conditioning. [MacLaine‟s birth data for this course: April 24, 1934 at
15:57 in Richmond, Virginia USA.]
So if you look carefully at her chart you'll see that the 12th gate is the only gate, if
it's activated, is going to have the defining of that chart. So, that 12th gate is going
to be very important. Here is somebody who is looking for something to listen to.
This is going to be one of the deepest themes in this being's life. And of course,
you are dealing with somebody who is on the Right Angle Cross of the Unexpected,
so you know this is a life that can have strange turns and twists in it.
But the deepest theme for this person is going to be this mutative, waiting for the
mutative message in many ways. In looking at that you also have to see that the
real dilemmas are there, the secondary conditioning of the open Centers, the unde-

Lesson 3
Type
fined Ego having to prove herself, and the open Sacral Center. The moment you
see somebody with an open Sacral Center and you're looking at a Projector then
you know what the limitation is for them.
In other words, Projector/Projector relationships can be very effective, very valua-
ble and very good relationships as long as the combination leads to either generat-
ing or manifesting. As long as
there is that combination be-
tween two Projectors then it's
very easy for them. As a mat-
ter of fact, they can have quite
a strong dependency on each
other because they need each
other in order to be able to
create that energy dynamic.
So, when you're dealing with a
Projector there are two kinds
of relationships that can work
for them: The Projec-
tor/Projector relationship in
which there is going to be a
defined Sacral or a manifesting
capacity, and the potential of
the Projector with the right Generator, but again that is going to be a matter of how
they are going to operate and whether or not they're going to operate correctly as
themselves.
Undefined Sacral, not knowing when enough is enough; undefined Spleen, holding
on to things that aren't good for her; and of course, the open Head and the open
Ajna, so you're dealing with somebody who does not have mental certainty; and
this is somebody who is always under pressure. You can see that this is somebody
with the 17th gate being open, and this very strong 62 pointed upwards, it's the two
Plutos, always looking for an opinion. Here's somebody always looking for some-
thing mutative to hear and always looking for an opinion. You can begin to see the
kinds of pulls that are going to be there for that not-self mind.
Warren Beatty: Emotional Manifesting Generator
Here we are dealing with an emotional Manifesting Generator. [Beatty‟s birth data
for this course: March 30, 1937 at 17:30 in Washington, DC USA. His chart is on
the next page.] We are dealing with a split definition. Again, in looking at this split
definition you can see that there are a number of ways in which the split can be
brought together. The 44th gate will bring the Sacral/Spleen into the configuration
with the emotional Ego and Throat. You can also have the presence of the 20th
gate forming the definition with the 20/34 bringing the splits together or there can
be the presence of the 16th gate. So, you're looking at three gates that are going
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

to be the core dynamic in terms of the way in which the not-self is going to operate
in this being.
You can see that as an emotional Manifesting Generator, this is a very powerful
configuration. It is very difficult to get this kind of Manifesting Generator to be a
Generator. It's very difficult because the split on its own is a pure manifesting ele-
ment. In other words, you have the 45/21, you have the 12/22 so you have emo-
tional and Ego manifesting capacity that totally bypasses what is, in fact, the Sacral
Center as the core of the Strategy.
Obviously, this is somebody who operates out of emotional Authority. But the
emotional Authority has to be guided by response and the response invariably is
going to be ignored because there is all this pressure of the direct motors to the
Throat. If you look at those three gates that are missing—the 20, the 16 and the
44—then you begin to see the themes that are going to drive this person: The
themes of talent and the skills for talent, the searching for charisma, looking for the
44, the ability to be able to transmit. In other words, these attributes, the skills
and the ability to be able to do in the now with real power and the ability to be able
to transmit become the themes that the not-self is going to seek. So these are
going to be the strongest conditioning gates for this being.
Here we have something entirely different in the sense that we have a 1/3, so we
are dealing with somebody who is very much self-absorbed. As with every single
aspect you look at, if you look at the aspects through the lens of partnership you

see the obvious. If you have a 1/3, and the 1/3 is the most self-absorbed of Pro-
files, then you know that this is not somebody who's going to be all there for the
other person. It's not their fault; no blame. They're a 1/3 after all. They're very
much absorbed in their own process.
The Cross of Tension and Undefined G Center
The other thing is that this is the Cross of Tension. The Cross of Tension is often
very difficult in relationships because everything about the fulfillment of the pur-
pose of this Cross is that each and every one of those gates in that Cross is there to
provide pressure, to push, to bring out tension in others through the harmonic
gate. In other
words, that Sun in
21 is to create ten-
sion in the gatherers
to do their work.
That Earth in 48 is to
create this tension to
get the skills, to
push the others. It's
a very, very pro-
vocative Cross.
It's there to stimu-
late the spirit. It‟s
there to stimulate
the struggle for pur-
pose. It's there to
stimulate games on
the material plane.
It's there to stimu-
late the perfection of
the potential of our
future through practice and through skills and through the perfection that can come
with logical talent. But it's pushy. It's the Cross of Tension. If the Cross of Ten-
sion is not getting out, then there is another dilemma. The tension begins to work
on the inside. The other thing is that you have somebody who has a totally unde-
fined G Center so you know there is a question about love in this being's life.
The Undefined Root Center
And then you have somebody who has an undefined Root, but an interesting one.
If you look at the Root Center you can see that there are five unconscious poten-
tials that impact on that Root Center. Three of them are within the Root itself. So,
this is somebody who can be very, very uncomfortable if you define their Root.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

You're really putting them under pressure; they rarely are going to have any sense
of why that pressure is there. They're simply going to feel the pressure.
Remember that the obvious is the thing that tells you so much. You have an open
Root and your partner has a defined Root. You're under pressure. You'll always be
under pressure in your relationship. You can't escape it. There's nothing you can
do. Not only that, you're going to be under pressure and they're going to appear to
be very calm. Think about
the timing of things. You
have somebody who has a
defined Root and they have
a week to do something.
They will do that thing in a
way in which they do not
demonstrate in any way
pressure. There's no pres-
sure. They just go through
their consistent way of using
the energy of the Root sys-
tem.
But if you have an undefined
Root and somebody gives
you a deadline, you race to
finish it. You just do. It's
not comfortable. It's not
natural to carry that pressure. So, think about the sex life of people who have this
combination of Root and undefined Root. There is always somebody who is under
pressure to be faster. There are all of these various things that are rooted in just
the very simple, in the very obvious of what's there. And you know what they're
going to get. If this person gets somebody with the Root, they're going to have to
deal with the pressure that this person puts them under.
The Undefined G Center
Think of somebody with a fixed identity. They're going to have to deal with the
pressure that comes with having their identity fixed in a certain way, whereas be-
fore, they had this enormous freedom. The other thing is if you have an undefined
G, who belongs in your life starts not with a person but with a place. You're not
going to meet the right people if you're in the wrong place. And it's only when
you're in the right place that you're going to meet the right people and that your
relationship with whomever it may be, that's a relationship that's going to work well
in a certain place.
The very same relationship with the very same person in a different place isn't
going to do that at all. That's one of the things that is so spooky about the open G
Center. You can meet this wonderful person in this wonderful place and then you

invite them home and somehow everything is different. It's not the same person.
But it is the same person. It's the place that's changed. And for an undefined G
Center, the right place means everything for them.
Shirley MacLaine/Warren Beatty‟s Connection Chart
So, you have these two basic combinations. Now if we take a look at the configura-
tion of the two of them together, the first thing you'll notice, and it's interesting if
you look at the characteristics of the partnership graph, you can see that first of all
it's a 9 and 0, there's nowhere to go. So there is the potential of a strong bond,
after all. 9 and 0s are strong bonds, even if they don't work, it's still a strong
bond. There is a locking in the aura.
If you look at this you see that all of it is a single definition; everything is inte-
grated. But notice something and it's interesting. If you think about her chart, she
was a split definition and what she was looking for in her split was the 12th gate.
Now, boy, does she ever get it with her brother because he has the whole channel.
So it actually ends up being a Compromise. She ends up in a situation where it's
not so much that her 22 is deciding what's worthy of being attracted to, as some-
thing to listen to that is mutative, he's controlling what the listening to should even
be. In other words, he's controlling the social connection in all of that. He's con-
trolling the mutation in all of that. There is a Compromise in all of this.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

So, at first glance he's linking the split. And then in that sense as a 9 and 0 with
the split being linked, for her this is going to be a strong connection to her sibling.
But look at him. Do you remember the gates? The 44, 16, and the 20—he doesn't
get any of those gates from her. The way in which the split comes together is
through a combination of things. That is, the 34/57, the 3/60 and the 28/38, these
Electromagnetic connections. It's very powerful, these three Electromagnetics. It's
these three Electromag-
netic connections that
integrate his design,
that bring together his
split definition. But it's
not the way he likes it.
It's not the way that it's
really attractive for him.
It's just there. And it's
just there through those
Electromagnetics.
One of the things that
arises out of that is
those Electromagnetics
bring a certain spark,
and one of the sparks
they bring is that these
are going to be struggling siblings. These are siblings who are going to struggle
with each other. They're going to fight with each other as kids. I don't mean that
in a bad way, by the way. I just mean struggle. This is a point/counterpoint for
them. And sometimes that's struggle's going to be fun and sometimes that strug-
gle is not going to be fun at all.
They are also very mutative together. This is the presence of the 3/60. But it also
means that they can really bring depression into each other's life as well; the 3/60
being that kind of a channel that if you cannot accept what „is‟ until mutation takes
place, then you can end up being very uncomfortable in your relationship with the
other being.
However, in looking at this as a general configuration, the first thing you have to
deal with is the basic dilemma that there is a Sacral Center that is defined and this
Sacral Center is being imposed on the Projector. And you have a very, very differ-
ent frequency that's at work.
Here you have a 9 and 0, they're locked in together. There are certain strengths in
their Profiles that are indications that there is a potential for them to recognize
each other. They both carry 3rd lines in their Profiles. They both understand the
trial and error process. They're both very much connected to the discovery process
and the material plane. They can learn from each other from the mistake-making
business. Look at that combination between his Personality Earth in the 28.3 and
her Design Sun in the 38.3; you have this harmonic defining of the channel of
Struggle.

That's something that can be an interesting dynamic for them in their relationship.
It's the same thing with the Nodes. He has a 1st line Personality Node, she has a
1st line Design Node. And she has a 4th line in the Personality, which of course is
the harmony to the 1st line so there are similarities in their landscape in that sense
and a potential to really be able to deal with similar kinds of forces. And they have
similar techniques in the way in which they need to look into things and figure
things out.
Two Negative Aspects in their Connection Chart
So, on the surface you have many things that are positive, but you have two very
powerful things that are negative. One is she is a Projector and he's a very power-
ful Manifesting Genera-
tor. She can be over-
whelmed by this energy
and also become ad-
dicted to that energy.
The other thing is that
the moment you look at
Compromise, oh, does
that ever tell you a sto-
ry. In the first couple of
days, what I really
wanted to get across to
you is that Partnership
Analysis in terms of
what the person wants
who is coming to you,
all you have to ever do
is truly look at the Compromises, because the moment you go there, this is where
there is always going to be a problem; always. And that problem in the Compro-
mise is going to exacerbate all the other problems, whatever they may be.
There are many things that are very harmonic in their connection. So, the things
that are going to be exacerbated here are going to be the phenomena that she is a
Projector and he's a Generator. This is the kind of thing that's going to stand out
and become a problem. But more than that, he controls four Compromises and she
one. That's an impossible situation. It's impossible in the sense the person who
has only the one—her, in this case—you can really end up feeling like not so much
a victim but simply that you're always going to be second best. You're never the
one who's really going to be able to be respected. You're never the one who's real-
ly going to have that recognition from the other.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

After all, it's interesting. The channel where she has her Compromise is the chan-
nel of Recognition. She's a Projector. She needs to have her feelings recognized.
It's one of the essential things about her. She needs to be respected for that pow-
er in her. And yet, at the same time, he has four Compromises—the 64/47 is a
Compromise, the 27/50 is a Compromise, the 21/45 is a Compromise, and the
12/22 is a Compromise. Wherever she turns in this relationship with this man,
whether it is mentally—think about what a 64/47 does as a Compromise: It's al-
ways making sense for you. It's always determining what needs to be made sense
of. It controls the way in which the not-self mind is really going to operate.
And the 27/50 is all about Custodianship and this is about nurturing the other and
looking after the other. He's the one who always decides. He's the one who de-
cides what should be cared for. He is the one who decides what the rules should be
in the caring. That's something where she just bangs her head against the wall.
It's the same thing with the channel of Openness, the 12/22 that's so important to
her. Think about what that's going to mean for her in her life. After all, I'm only
thinking of these beings as if they were children. That's the way that I look at de-
signs because it helps me have a much clearer insight about the human being. If
you look at them as children, you can see the way in which the role model male
was going to be established for her. Here was this gate that she needs so deeply in
her process.
Remember, if you're split definition and there's one gate that can join that split,
this becomes the whole thing. You want to be whole and this is your way and then
all of a sudden to end up in that situation where it's compromised, where you don't
get out of it what you want. You don't get out of it the wholeness you want. It's so
obvious that you're being held together rather than finding a wholeness.

Lesson 3

Having Relationships Over and Over Again with Our Relatives
In many ways, this is the kind of thing where we end up having relationships over
and over again with our relatives. We end up having relationships with our siblings
and our parents over the years through other people, through the connections that
they bring, these conditioning connections at the beginning. It's not whether
you're just a split, or this or that. It's about any hanging gate you have. It's about
seeing that definitions brought to you by your mother and father is this deep, deep
conditioning that lasts
for dozens of years. To
be able to shed that is
very difficult. You end
up being comfortable
with somebody who car-
ries the same gate be-
cause that's the condi-
tioning, that's what you
think you're supposed to
feel like.
For her, dealing with all
of that Compromise is
going to be an enorm-
ous dilemma. Now, with
brothers and sisters you
can always say you're
going to grow up, you're going to go your own way and this is the way it's going to
be; it's all right. There is always going to be that basis for them in terms of being
able to recognize aspects of each other's life through the Nodes, through the
Sun/Earth, through the Profile. There is a 9 and 0 that's at work; it is a single defi-
nition. There are all kinds of things you can say that are positive, but there's this
real limitation in the relationship and he can't help it. It's to like he's to blame. It's
not his fault. This is simply what happens when these two auras come together.
Looking at this Connection Chart as if it's a Partnership
Now, imagine for a moment that this is a partnership, that is, lovers. Of course,
this is the kind of thing that happens. What would happen to these two beings in
the moment they met? There are the three very powerful Electromagnetic connec-
tions, all of them fueling with power the splenic system, both the Sacral and the
Root hooking into the Spleen. There's an enormous potential for feel-good in this
kind of a relationship. There's this real potential. For her, she's the one with the
open Spleen. She's the one who‟s ready to hold onto what isn't good for her.

So think about this as a meeting between two people. They meet each other.
They're a 9 and 0. For the open G there seems to be this real power of direction.
Here she has her Dominance in the 31/7. There is this wonderful feeling that's
possible in the way in which the splenic system is being activated. There is the
commonality of the 3rd line themes. There's the commonality in the Nodes. They
can come together, there can be this delightful electromagnetic spark and then
slowly but surely here
comes the Compromise.
And that's the moment
there begins to be the
problems. That other
stuff all has possibilities,
but here's all this Com-
promise. And one of
them is a Projector and
the other one is a Gene-
rator.
If there's a solution in
terms of the way in
which you would handle
that, again it goes back
to a number of things.
First of all, illustrating
the dilemma, reminding people of their responsibility to act according to their na-
ture and to teach them the protocol of how they need to communicate with each
other in order to be able to make decisions mutually and decisions that allow each
of them to feel respected. One of the interesting aspects of this combination—and
it's a very, very interesting chart combination—is the Dominance channels because
they both have two. He brings the 11/56 and the 61/24, so he has a very interest-
ing mind. She brings the 31/7 and the 49/19. So she really brings a mystical qual-
ity and the real leadership potential is there.
So they both have a way of looking at each other and seeing something in each
other. She will always see him in the context of his mind. This is going to be the
strongest impression she's going to receive. The dilemma is that along with that,
the conditioning taking place in the Compromise of the 64/47 which adds up to all
of that, is the way in which the past is going to be seen. I guarantee you that the
way in which these two beings will look back on their childhood is so different.
The Need to Communicate with Each Other
Despite the benefits that are there, what you can bring to them is the need to un-
derstand how to communicate with each other. You need to point out what the
problems are. You need to point out the helplessness in that. Obviously, as broth-
ers and sisters they're going to have separate bedrooms to begin with, but if this
was a couple or a connection of a partnership of some kind, whatever the case may

be, how important it is that they have their own environment; how important it is
that they have a different timing system. Projectors truly need to understand how
important it is for them to really just recognize that they need to pull away from
the energy aura. They need to go into an environment where they can truly just
relax, take the pressure off themselves to operate in an energy environment.
You cannot imagine. I'm somebody who has an undefined Sacral and despite the
fact that I'm an energy Type, it' so obvious to me, I live in a house with nothing but
Generators. There is a buzz and woof and a warp that is really incredible. It's like
I open my door and I can see spirals of energy bouncing all over the place. I'm be-
ing cute but I'm telling you the truth. It is really something. There's a point where
I just have to close my door. I just have to get away from that frequency. It's not
healthy for me to get caught up in that frequency. I'm not a Sacral being. I have a
totally undefined Sacral Center. It is not equipped to operate under Generator
pressure. It's not healthy for me to be conditioned by Generator pressure.
So, when you're dealing with the complexity in the relationship, you're always
going to be able to see where the dilemmas are. Whether you see the dilemma in
the Type configuration or whether you see the dilemma in dissonance in the Profile
or dissonance in the
Nodes. Or whether
you find it simply in
the Compromise,
you're always going to
find those places
where you're going to
be able to describe
the dilemma and offer
the solution.
The solution goes
back to them. It goes
back to their individu-
al process. She has
to see that the power
of that 12th gate is
very distorting in her
life. She has to begin
to operate correctly as somebody who is an emotional Projector. She has to learn
to wait for things in the emotional wave. She has to begin to understand the im-
portance of invitation. She has to be able to understand how distorting the energy
field of energy Types is to her. And how much of her life has been spent holding on
to energy that has not brought her anything but problems and difficulties because
of her open Spleen.
He, on the other hand, is really a loose cannon. This is an emotional bombshell, an
emotional Ego bombshell. It doesn't have any control mechanism on it. It's not
intended to manifest. For this person to be connected to their Sacral, that would
be quite something. It's very difficult for this kind of very powerful, separated,

manifestation potential separated from a much weaker Sacral system. You can see
that the manifesting aspect of the Throat in his design is much, much, more power-
ful than his Sacral configuration. It would take an enormous amount of work for
somebody like this to put a break on initiating because it is their natural Ego ten-
dency; not only initiating, but wanting to control everything that they initiate.
The Compromise of the 21/45
Of course, in the end, the most difficult of all the aspects of their relationship is fi-
nally the Compromise of the 21/45. He has the whole channel, she has the 45.
They both have a sense on their own of entitlement, but he always has to be in
control. And there is no
way for her to fight that.
He is the one who is al-
ways going to be in con-
trol. This is somebody
who has a very, very
powerful Ego trip and a
very powerful controlling
Ego trip.
So, this would not be an
easy process. If this
was a couple, I guaran-
tee you that only the
female would show up.
This male would not
show up. He would not
be happy with the situa-
tion in which it's been taken out of his control, that he‟s not going to be able to be
the one who really determines the way in which the relationship works. So it would
really be quite a job.
You have to see that for many relationships and many configurations, because of
the density of the characteristics in the individual chart, it's often very difficult to
reach them. These are the kind of people who nod their heads at mechanics but it
can be very, very difficult for them to accept that they have to operate in another
way. For this kind of Manifesting Generator that would really be work. This is the
kind of relationship that has potential if it's the Manifesting Generator who comes
for the help. If they're the ones who initiate wanting some guidance and wanting
some help, at least would be a good start because it would be an indication that
they would be ready to look at themselves.

Lesson 3

Most Partnership Analysis Will Come from One Partner Only
Unfortunately, most of the Partnership Analysis that you're going to get as profes-
sionals are always going to come from one partner only. Again, as I mentioned on
the first day, this is one of our dilemmas. This is not, in the end, as productive as
it could be simply because there is no guarantee whatsoever that what you can re-
ally share with a part of that partnership ultimately is going to be of benefit to the
partnership as a whole.
You really do need to have the involvement at one level or another with the other
partner. That's quite different than simply giving people advice about arrange-
ments or connections with people that are less intimate than personal relationships.
But with real partnerships, if you have somebody who is coming to you, one of the
first things to ask them: Is it possible for the two of you to come together? Be-
cause that's really what it's all about.
You'll know right away from the response how much and what kind of information
you can give. Quite clearly you can see in that situation where they simply want to
have secret knowledge, this is what it's really about. "Let me know; they don't
care, they don‟t want to find out, I want to know." You move these people directly
to themselves. This is the whole point. You bring them to themselves.
It gives you an opportunity to say to them, “The first thing you have to do in work-
ing on your partnership is that you have to work on you. When you're ok, when
you're correct, when you're operating properly, then you can begin to really put
your attention to the problems that are there in your partnership.” What you can
offer them is the way to see their partner in terms of the best way to treat them,
the best way to talk with them or try to communicate with them, the kind of
changes that would be beneficial in their relationship if they could be actualized.
One of the most difficult things is the recommendation of your own room. Often
that's just economical.
Economical Problems with Having Separate Bedrooms
My family discovered that right away because normally, we would be an average
size family that would need a three-bedroom place and we had many years where
we travelled. But we're not because we have separate bedrooms. So we actually
required an extra bedroom. They don't build that many houses anymore that have
those extra rooms. The reality is that this is really a dilemma for a lot of people.
They just don't have the room. They don't have the room in their flats or their
houses, or whatever the case may be.
Of course, it is something that is a bedrock of being able to survive in partnership.
I think that it does more good than just about anything else. It really is remarka-
ble how much of a change that brings to one's peacefulness, one's ability to go into
a space and be alone and to be within your own aura, to sleep in your own aura, to
wake up in your own aura, and then to be able to enter into the world.

In doing so, you begin again in your relationship with the other every time you
meet them. There is always that opportunity to begin that relationship each time in
a new way, in a correct way in which you deal with each other, in a way that's mu-
tually beneficial. But you can see that wherever you're looking in configurations,
what you're going to find with the not-self is a dilemma. It's like those couples who
will say, “Oh we have no problems.” I never, ever, ever believe any of that be-
cause there is no such thing as a not-self relationship that does not have plenty of
problems. They're just there.
There are characteristic configurations that can make certain bonds easier than
others. It's just the way people will mix the kind of lines they have, the kind of
channel connections and so forth, all these things. But the fact of the matter is
that relationships on the whole are a problem area for humanity and it begins with
the individual. You can always see it immediately in this combination of the super
surface—the Type—and then that locking surface where they meet and it doesn't
work in the Compromise. Right away you see what the dilemma is and then you
have your opportunity to be able to offer them guidance about what they can do
with that.
Q & A
I like that Heisenberg, an interesting creature. Like Dirac; Dirac dreamed the neu-
trino before he theoretically postulated it before it was ever discovered. It's really
amazing the way in which the consciousness field operates and the way certain
human beings in their neutrino field pick up these little wonders along the way.
Sleeping and Aura Fields
Written Question: If a person with gate 15 is sleeping in flat with someone in the
room above. Are they in each other auras?
Ra: It doesn't even have to be a gate 15. Auras are a funny thing. My favorite
description for the typical apartment building was to call them aura boxes and
that's basically what they are. They're really aura boxes. If you think about the
way in which apartments are structured and how many people in the west live in
these things, if you think about there is always a common wall and that common
wall may be where one of the bedrooms is and on the other side is the other flat, or
it could be another room in the house, whatever the case maybe, let alone above
and below. Auras are something that are expansive. The aura is something that
breathes.
A long time ago a shaman friend of mine gave me some aura sticks. I used to en-
joy doing aura measurements. It was always fascinating to me. It's like my dog.
Dogs have huge auras. I don't let my dog in my room any more at night. I haven't

done so for a very, very long time because they have a very big aura and they can
really affect you. Your aura is something that has a prana. My classic description
of the aura is that if you spread your arms to either direction, like wings spread out
and you go twice as far and you make a huge circle, basically that's within reason
the auric field.
In most cases, what that means is that not so much when you're lying down that
you're connected to the flat above, which is possible, but it's more likely when
you're lying down that somebody in the flat below who is standing up is for sure
standing in your aura. The other thing is that if you're sleeping where there is a
common wall, you can end up with a relationship with somebody on the other side.
It's one of the most frightening things that you have somebody who's a stranger,
literally, who is deeply connected to you and is conditioning the very way in which
you operate. So, aura boxes are frightening.
It's one of the classic things about—I mentioned briefly about the Sacral Center and
this concept of the movement from slave to builder. Architecture and the way in
which human beings have been protected and housed, however language you want
to use for that, the business of architecture is not-self. Think about it. Everybody
likes to say that Gary is a genius, but he's a not-self architect and the world is filled
with nothing but not-self architects. And what do not-self architects do? They
create environments in which your aura is constantly being contaminated by friend
and foe. It's really frightening to imagine what that really has brought to our civili-
zation. You really don't want to think about it.
I remember in the late '50's, early '60's, there was this enormous drive in North
America, particularly in the States, to clean up the slums. There were these
projects to tear down all of these old dilapidated, horrible places and replace them
with these towering apartment blocks, aura boxes. Then they filled these towering
aura boxes with the flotsam and jetsam of an underclass that was deprived and un-
dereducated, and all kinds of things and they were all living together in the same
environment. They were all living in each other's aura. Everybody was amazed to
see that that whole development concept was a terrible failure because all of these
places began to deteriorate almost immediately. It had nothing to do with the
quality of the individual beings who were living there, but it had to do with the way
in which the aura as a whole was operating.
Again, this whole business about space is one of my comments about wealth.
Wealth brings only one thing truly. It brings the privilege of space. There is noth-
ing that is more cherished in humanity than space. Think about these families in
the Third World in which you raise seven or eight children in a residence with ex-
tended family and relatives and they're all sleeping together in the same environ-
ment. It's quite common. This is an enormous disadvantage to the development
of unique, differentiated Authority and awakeness. You're never going to be
awake; we're not raves. We're not here to have this kind of melded consciousness
field. In order for us to reach a state of awakeness, we have to reach that state
alone. It is a process within oneself.

Where you live, the kind of environment you live in, and the nature of the architec-
ture of that environment really is something to consider. For me, it's one of my
oldest black jokes. People have rarely understood it. I've always said that the first
criminals were architects and the way they cut us off from the sky and the way
they forced us into the controlled aura. After all, think about what the first city re-
ally was. The first city was the first attempt at a controlled aura box. You built a
wall—Ur in ancient Mesopotamia—you build this walled compound around and you
house everybody close together and all of a sudden you begin the process of ho-
mogenizing everybody into what would become the beginnings of civilization. Civi-
lization began as a not-self crowding process and we've been doing that ever since.
So, yes, to answer your question, it's a big deal. You can end up literally being
conditioned by people you actually have no real connection to whatsoever.
Gate 15: The Real Magnetism is Initiated by the Sacral
Question: It sounds as though I have more of a problem with my two cats that
sleep with me than the man upstairs. But I was concerned about the gate 15 be-
cause I thought it had twice the range than a normal person.
Ra: That's the actual channel. It's true about the 15th gate and it's a good point.
This is the most magnetic of the gates. After all, in the G Center you have the
Magnetic Monopole and the very magnetism of that, this magnet that only attracts.
The 15th gate is part of the way of pulling people into the flow works. So, they
have very strong auras. 15/5s, particularly, are beings who are going to be very
much impacting forces.
What's interesting about them is that, just as a joke, if you have a 15/5 in a family,
they're the ones who invariably never really clean up. They're the ones who make
messes that everybody else cleans up. Now, think about what that's like to live in
an aura box and your neighbor is a 15/5. They bring you into their flow. They
change your rhythm, they change your habits and you may not even know them.
So, it's really something to keep in mind.
Written Question: (about the 15/5)
Ra: No, again, this whole business about the 15, I'm just commenting on your
question Inga. The 15th gate, in and of itself, yes, it has the potential for magnet-
ism, but remember that's a dormant gate unless it's defined. And the real magnet-
ism is only initiated by being empowered by the motor of the Sacral. So, it's the
15/5 as a channel that is so deeply magnetic.

Lesson 3
Type
Gender Differentiation in Human Design
Question: Ra, earlier on you said how the difference between an Ego Manifestor
and a Generator is huge. Then you said it's just as huge as the difference in gend-
er which made me think. I'm still a bit boggled by the fact that there is no gender
differentiation in Human Design.
Ra: Well, I find it one of the most fascinating things. There are differences. If you
go back into my teachings in the mid '90s, there were courses I did on the Sacral
Center that showed the gates of sexual differentiation. You can also see, for exam-
ple, in the line configurations of the 3rd gate that you have recessives for male, for
female, all kinds of things. So there are aspects of it.
But there is a deep joke in all of this. This bodygraph is female. I don't mean to
upset any of the males. But it is female. Female is not the right word. Even yin is
not the right word. But I don't have the language to describe that. The Voice was
very clear about the nature of gender as an extraordinary illusion, but a necessary
one. But one of the things that was clear to me was that I was told that the totali-
ty, if we could give the totality a gender, that whatever this totality is on its path to
emergence into whatever the realm of what made it, this is something that is defi-
nitely not in any sense of the word male. In other words, we are living within the
frame of a female construct.
So, in many ways, the question isn't so much how come the chart doesn't show
gender, but how come the chart doesn't show what it is to be male. The only place
you can find that is in the mutative potential that's in the 3rd gate, in the actual
process of sexual differentiation that takes place in the womb. After all, all fetuses
begin as female, if we can describe it as that, and then a mutation can take place
for the male. The fact is that all of that is taking place in the 3rd gate. But in terms
of the way in which this mystical ideogram is intended to be understood at its
deepest level is that this is a form construct. Within the deepest sense of that
meaning, it is inherently yin, inherently female, or whatever kind of language you
want to put to that.
Question: I understood your comment, but going back to genetics, you have an X
and a Y chromosome. That really makes a difference. Well, can you comment on
that?
Ra: It's a wonderful question. I don't know. There are things I certainly don't
have answers to. I can only look at it—because I was very aware of it from the
very beginning because these were some of the earliest questions I was asked
about the nature of where's the gender, where's the difference between male and
female, where's the difference between whatever. And it's obvious to me that I
don't really know. What I do know is that the construct itself is yin. Now, obvious-
ly, there are variations that take place. There is a mutation that has taken place in
order for this, the way in which the maia works out, the way in which we look at
what we call genetics in all of that, in order for the male potential to function.
There's no question about that.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
But it is clear to me from everything I understand about the way bio-forms were
evolved on this planet, we're dealing with a female principle. But the exact place?
Maybe we'll find that one day, after all. It's one of those things, like with sequenc-
ing, where there are paths for us to go where the actual exploration can lead us to
some of those answers. But that's one that has to be dealt with.
Written Comment: (on Differentiation)
Ra: Your comment, differentiation is the construct of one illusion in comparison to
another. After all, this is not about the fulfillment of your purpose. It doesn't mat-
ter what your sexuality is. The fulfillment of the potential of awakeness has noth-
ing to do with gender. And individual Authority has nothing to do with gender. It is
individual Authority, your ability to operate correctly as yourself that actually allows
the differentiation to take place.
I don't think in any sense that that‟s strange. I think the very basis of what we're
dealing with is that the potential of the unique being regardless—after all, the bo-
dygraph is beneath the level of the skin. It's not like you're seeing race there, ei-
ther. There is no race there, unless you want to get into the equivalences of Type
and all these kinds of things. It is another way of looking at how we do differen-
tiate as these illusions, as these constructs.
Written Question: (on Nature)
Ra: It's a funny thing about people who like to be in nature. Take a look at the
design of plants and you'll begin to see that one of the things that brings tranquility
to so many people is the very rooted integration, the very archetype that's alive in
the plant world. So when you're walking through a forest and you're touching the
plants and they're rubbing against your body, you're making aura contact with the
consciousness field of that aspect of nature. Of course, that's something that is
very special.
But it's also bringing something. It's bringing security. Plant nature is highly
splenic so there is this potential for this feel-good, so this is just an indication of a
need within the being. This kind of environment can be very soothing.
The Nodes: Gates and Lines
Question: Ra, I have a question about this composite thing and it's about the
Nodes. Whenever I hear you comment upon the potential we have within the Nod-
al structure, I always feel that you stress a lot the potential resonance between the
lines, and you don't seem to pay so much attention to the gate itself. You don't
even mention the gate.
For example, that both their Nodal axes might be different gates, but aligned in the
quarters that they go from the Mind to Duality in their trip. So, you stressed a lot
of the importance of the line and don't mention much of the gate. Is that really so

Lesson 3
Type
in the hierarchy? Is the line so important that it leaves behind the importance to
even mention the gate or the difference or affinity that might be there within the
gate structure in the partnership?
Ra: The dilemma is that when I'm working with this kind of responsibility, that is,
beings who are going to go out there and do analysis for the not-self, I'm always
deeply concerned about them going too deep and seeing too many things. It's so
obvious to you and to me that it means a lot what the gate is, what the quarter is,
what this is, what that is. There is an enormous amount of information that can be
explored.
Yet at the same time, I do not think and I have never thought that this kind of level
of information is what a client deserves when they come for a reading for the first
time. I think somebody who is concerned about their relationship and is willing to
invest in having somebody give them advice about that relationship, for me, the
responsibility is not to educate them, but the responsibly is simply to get to the
surface things that they're dealing with because they really never get past the sur-
face.
So yes, I've consciously avoided talking about any of the gates. And just by being
able to look at the line factors, actually what that does is, on the surface, it really
gives you enough to understand whether there is going to be a relationship at that
level, whether there is a similarity, whether there is a harmony, whether there is a
resonance. But the real key in that relationship is that it's either going to be mixed
Types or it's going to be what it usually is, which is the Compromise situations.
And that's the place where the client who's coming—I'm always concerned that
they get what they want.
I went through, as you did because we've been in this so long together, that period
giving people much more than they needed and they didn't get what they wanted.
They didn't get it. And then I went through a whole period of understanding that
through synthesis, through being able to come up with these basic little formulas,
that you can give people what they wanted because they're only coming for the
surface. It's one of our tendencies, because we can go so deep, we can bring so
much knowledge to any of these aspects that we lose the power of what we can do
for people. My concern is always stay on the surface, stay on the surface with
them, and make sure they understand what they're dealing with on the surface.
I use the stuff around as just background. I'm not interested in doing detailed
readings any more. I've stopped. When somebody has a reading with me, what
they're getting is my skill at being able to read the surface and it's the surface that
I know is the place they have to do their work before they can get to anything dee-
per. And then obviously, there has to be more for them, if they're ready for that.
I think the big thing for us is that we need to see that the reading process is no
longer really aligned to the way in which, for example, somebody comes to have a
reading and that's it. There is this ability to be able to provide greater depth, to be
able to take people through, at a later time when they're ready for it, when they
can actually do something with the information. But my real concern for teaching
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
this is to make sure that you as professionals are able to go to the surface and you
can be comfortable with that, you can be assured in your authority in that, you can
have the right things to say about it and the right advice to give. And that's what
the clients really want.
So, I am leaving out those descriptions. It does not mean they don't matter.
Again, my assumption is that if you're an analyst, you're going to look at all of that
stuff and it's going to be there in you. It's important to really know the chart.
That's something we began with on our first day. But the fact of the matter is that
what you can know in the depth of that chart and its relationship to the other one is
background for you in bringing them to the surface of where the dilemma is.
Connection Detriments Can Become a Benefit
Question: Well, I'm trying to absorb really deeply. Some times when I've done a
connection chart between people, when you get them together you get detriments
that are very difficult. Sometimes in some of those detriments, I can't even re-
member which ones it is now, I think it's in the 28th or 27th gate, it says it's better
to leave this alone. It's actually right there in the hexagram. When you come
across situations like that, my question is when someone puts you in the detriment,
by following your own response, can you step yourself back out of that?
Ra: No, you can't. It's one of the things that is so interesting for me because we
have a way of looking at detriments that leave out their magic. I don't see detri-
ments as being bad or difficult. I like what the Chinese say: Good news, bad news,
who knows? If you're operating correctly and somebody is bringing out a detriment
in the characteristic of your partnership, there is something in that that is essential
for you to confront and deal with. It isn't necessarily something that's going to be
bad.
What I've discovered most about detriments is that if you're really operating cor-
rectly, the detriment becomes a benefit. There are things that it brings to you
when you're not resisting it, when you're not falling into its not-self quality, that
can really be remarkable. And most of them need to be discovered. A couple of
years ago I was mentioning that one of these days I would like to write a Rave
I'Ching that is for the awake being and how different that would be. Of course, it's
the same chops and it's the same formula and it's the same thing. But the fact is
that the same thing seems different. All of those detriments are things that can be
seen, experienced and felt differently.
The Rave I'Ching itself is mostly—when I processed that work, and that was a long
time ago, it was in 1989, I was surrounded by only not-self. The only thing I saw
was not-self. The Rave I'Ching is the by-product of that. It's a not-self manual.
So much of the way in which it's written is intended to express the dilemmas of the
not-self and the way in which the worst aspects of the potential of humanity can
come out. After all, those 384 lines carry every archetype of what it is to be a hu-
man being.

Lesson 3
Type
My thing about it is I think that any configuration between any two beings, regard-
less of what the dilemmas are, regardless of what this and that is, that that rela-
tionship can function as a relationship of grace as long as those two beings are op-
erating correctly. It may not mean that relationship is fulfilling; it may not mean
the relationship occupies much time. But the reality is that each and every one of
us has a potential to be able to connect to the other with grace. That's really my
concern.
My concern is not the nuances, because I don‟t think that really is the point. How-
ever, when you get to a place like that, you have to see whether that works within
the genetic continuity. I'm talking specifically about your question, Cathy. In other
words, within the genetic continuity, if the conflicts that are going to arise, if there
are high levels of Compromise, if there are dilemmas in Nodal or Profile dissonance,
if there is cross-Type stuff, if there are other things that will support that detri-
ment, then you bet it's going to be something that's going to stand out.
But again, any negative in a chart that is a result of two people coming together, it
only becomes a dilemma when those beings are not operating correctly. That's
when it becomes a problem. And it's always going to be highlighted through the
same place. Every single problem you have in a relationship comes out in a Com-
promise. It's like what Saturn is to you in a chart. Every time something needs to
be pointed out to you, it comes to the place where your Saturns are active in your
design.
My thing is: Let's return people to the integrity of what it is to be their own Authori-
ty. Let's give them the tools to be able to understand how to meet the other. Let's
show them what the basic problems are and let's encourage them to experiment
and see the transformation that can take place in their process.
Anyway, the third day is done. Thank you all. I've enjoyed that. Good questions
tonight. I'll think about those X's and Y's as I go to sleep Andrea. I'll count them
as like sheep. We'll see what tomorrow brings. So wherever you are, have a good
one. See you then.

Lecture Four
Professionalism, Splits and Compromises
Professionalism: Depth Needed
I wanted to begin with a comment. It's something that arises from time to time. It
was brought to my mind yesterday. My assumption when I'm doing a training like
this is that the nuances of partnership really have be looked at, that people have
taken partnership courses and they've read about it. Because you have to see that
my concern in a certificate program like this where basically we are giving authori-
zation to analysts to do a specific kind of work, and in fact, the reputation of the
Human Design system rides in some way with everyone who represents it.
It's very important to me that these trainings are about the way in which we
present material to a client. Over the years, and this is a process now that has
been going on for many years, I've been very much involved in trying to bring a
synthetic, simple, superficial approach to the way in which we introduce basic read-
ings to a client.
One of the things about the nature of Human Design is that it is deeply elaborate
and mental. There's an enormous amount of information. And there is a deep se-
riousness that can come with all of that depth. I appreciate the fact that so many
of the beings who are involved in Human Design are in fact people who enjoy the
deeper, probing, intellectual process of grasping things in their minutiae and grasp-
ing things to a point where they are satisfied with its depth and secure in the know-
ledge. Obviously, to be a good professional or any good representative of Human
Design, it's essential that there is depth.
But for me, that depth is the framework upon which you can enter into a profes-
sional life. The fact is that in terms of what happens when we sit in a room with
somebody and we are there to bring them through a process of identifying what is
very intimate and very important information in their lives, I think we have to avoid
at all cost overwhelming them with too much information. It's just overwhelming
for the average person.
Most people, when they get their initial encounter with the very cold accuracy of
Human Design, are already surprised and already have to deal with the conse-
quences of it being so revealing. There is nothing more revealing, and I have dealt
with thousands of beings in that situation, than the surface of identifying aspects in
somebody's basic design and being able to point to any open Center, to any of the

103
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

basic things that condition us and being able to impress upon the other the basic
certainty and authority with which we speak.
Deal with the Surface
This carries more weight than anything else. It is really something to grasp. If you
go back and think about your encounter with Human Design, the thing that's strik-
ing is that it reveals something very, very clearly, very mechanically. Yet, some-
thing that is in you, to nod your head to and say, “Aha, that's how it works, that's
why.” What I want from a connection reading as professional methodology is: This
is about dealing with the surface.
I don‟t want to frustrate any potential teachers. I'm more than happy to have
people trained to be able to do wonderful partnership courses, to be able to develop
a deep understanding of all the various aspects and the way in which, in detail,
graphs integrate with each other. But, in fact, this service that we provide in doing
a professional reading, we have a client who is going to be paying a considerable
amount of money. They're investing in something.
The Client is Paying for a Solution to a Problem
I deeply respect the fact that anyone who is going to invest in a reading, you have
to give them what they're trying to buy. It is what it's all about. They're not buy-
ing an education. They're looking for a solution, they're trying to pay for a solution
to a problem, a problem they do not grasp and yet a problem at the same time is
there in their life.
It is extremely rare that somebody is just being voyeuristic and is curious. The fact
of the matter is, when somebody comes to a reading there is something that's bo-
thering them. They're all coming for an answer. It was my standard joke for years
with doing the individual analysis, I'd go through this individual analysis with people
and I'd keep on pointing out where the dilemma is and what the solution is. The
solution is your Authority and Strategy, blah, blah, blah. And you go on and on and
on and on. And then I'd get to the end of the reading and there would be that
client looking at me and saying to me, “Can I ask you a question?” “Yeah, sure
what's your question?” “Well, I have this problem with my dog, my husband, my
car,” whatever the case may be. This bell kept going off in my head and it kept on
saying to me, they didn't get it. There is just all this stuff, it just all rattles by, that
while you're rattling all that stuff by them, they're holding onto that question that's
inside of them.
When somebody wants a Partnership Analysis, they either want to prove they're
right or the other one is wrong. Nine times out of ten it's all very not-self and un-
aware. The thing you have to realize as a professional: You have to understand
that about your client. You have to recognize that they are not ready for so much

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
of the information you can offer them. They're just not. Not only that, but even if
they were, it would be pointless because that's not why they're there. They want
to know what the problem is. The magic of the connection characteristics is that it
is so easy to see where the problem is.
You have partners who are together, they want a reading, you go and you see
there is a Compromise. Let's say there are a couple of them. It doesn't matter
who's compromised. You go to them and say, for example, here's this; you can
end up discovering that's all they came for. That's what they needed to hear be-
cause that was the place where they kept on rubbing against each other with the
friction with something that was really becoming uncomfortable, where they were
really getting to a point where that was becoming the straw that breaks the camel's
back. That's what they want.
Oh yeah, I could have told them all kinds of other things. Well, there's this and
there's this and there's this; no. It's very clear to me that when a client is coming,
this is very different from education. The advent of the Biversity is intended to be
able to level a proper landscape for education in Human Design. If you really want
to understand how to look at somebody's chart, how to see somebody's chart with
somebody else's, take my three year Rave Psychology course and you really get all
the data down to the bones; ninety-nine weeks of classes. That's something else.
But that has nothing to do with a professional service. It has nothing to do with the
arrangement that exists between somebody who offers a Human Design profes-
sional service and the client who's paying for it. The client is there to be given a
formula that satisfies their question. And I don‟t think—and it's something for me
is just a knowing—that there is anything else on this planet that can provide such a
service other than Human Design. It is so important for us to realize that. I think
there is a real insecurity in professionals when they're only dealing with the sur-
face. I think there is an insecurity. It's like anybody could know this. Yes, that's
true, but they don't know it. They're paying for somebody to reveal it to them.
Again, there is so much you can do. You can go on for hours and hours and hours
with them, have cookies and tea, but it's not the point. And you won't get paid for
all those hours and hours and hours. You want to be able to take them mechani-
cally, directly to where the dilemma is. Partners are not coming to you because
they want to find out why they have such a wonderful relationship. When you get
those, please tell me. I want to add them to my book of records. And I assume
there are some. But the reality of it—I'm a 5th line being, I'm very practical. It's
just a practical thing.
When somebody is concerned about their relationship and is willing to explore a
way of resolving what may be the dilemmas in their relationship, that already de-
serves a worthy response. The fact that somebody cares about that, the fact that
somebody wants to know, what they deserve is an answer. So, the approach I've
been giving you, the approach that we have been looking at over the several days,
this is the surface.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
The Surface is Where Clients Can Work Directly and Immediately
I want you to see that if you experiment with this surface, what you're going to get
to is the place where partners are going to be able to work directly and immediately
with what you give them. Think about what we're actually doing. Every not-self
relationship is going to have a problem. And the only thing I'm ever interested in
in the relationship characteristics is to find that problem, because I know there is
no solution directly within the characteristics. This is a game.
You go to somebody's Compromise and you explain it. Now, explaining it is some-
thing that's a relief because it begins the process of no blame, no choice. And this
is one of the most important things about beginning to level out the quality of the
environment in a relationship, that there is this helplessness. It's not your part-
ner's fault because they have a channel and you only have part of it, and so forth.
There is no direct resolution within the characteristic other than you step out of the
person's aura, and remember that's part of our recommendation to all partners that
they have their own sleeping environment.
What the dilemma in the partnership chart allows me to do is to remind each of
them of who they are and the way they're suppose to operate correctly within
themselves and what the protocol is for their relationship with the other based on
their Type, based on their Angle, based on any of those tools we can use to help
them understand the way in which the other operates and the way you can com-
municate with the other. It's not about resolving it within the partnership. I think
this is one of the most interesting things in terms of what makes Human Design
connection analysis so different is that there is no resolution within the characteris-
tics map. There are only these dead ends that point you to wherever that area of
conflict may be.
No Fault/No Blame; Just Helpless in the Connections
The resolution is in the way in which the beings who are within that connection, the
way they operate within themselves and the way in which they communicate with
each other. So my goal when I do a Partnership Analysis is to put my thumb im-
mediately on the place where the pain is and the annoyance is and the aggravation
is, to be able to bring that out, to be able to show them that they're helpless in
this. It's not fault.
Now, I'm not a negative. I don't just bring a negative vibe when I do this kind of
analysis. What I always try to do is to counterpoint it. The way I do that is I say,
“Here is the place where the problem is. Oh, there are a lot of other places where
you really fit together,” because you can see it. The fact is they're together in that
geometry; it's their fractal lines; one way or another they've banged into each oth-
er. The fact of the matter is you're always going to be able to see why they're con-
nected, where the Electromagnetics are, what the commonalities may be, whatever
those things are.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
So, it's not that I'm just saying, look, this is the thing. What I'm saying is, “This is
the thing that gets in the way of you appreciating who you're really with, and be-
ginning to enjoy being together and the possibilities of what can come for the two
of you when you're operating correctly. But here is the problem and you can't get
rid of it. And it's not about he has to change and you have to change and so forth
and so on.” It's simply about returning them to what our work is.
Individual Human Rights
The revolution of Human Design is the introduction of individual Authority. That is,
individual human rights. I'm not talking about social human rights. I'm talking
about individual human rights. The individual human right is to be your own au-
thority in this life. Everyone has the capacity to be able to be in charge of their
lives. Everything about this knowledge is that no matter where you look, whether
you're looking at connections, Pentas, you name it, wherever you look, the charac-
teristics within the combined auric configuration are things that are locks. They're
not going to change. They're going to operate that way any time those two auras
or more auras come together because that's simply the mechanics.
So you have to see that the approach to that connection is what will make the dif-
ference. It's this wonderful thing about seeing, seeing, seeing. It's really about
seeing the same person you've been dealing with for years, that the two of you in
operating correctly and beginning the experiment of operating correctly as yourself,
you will see each other in a way and be able to see a relationship in a way that
you've never seen it before. And yet, it's the same thing. It's the way it's per-
ceived. It's the way you enter into it. It's the way in which you communicate with-
in it, but all of it is going back to you.
Living Correctly as Oneself
When we look at a partnership composite, you're not looking at something that's—
it comes and goes. It's not always there. The moment you're out of that aura it's
gone, it dissolves into thin air, it's really illusion in so many ways. It's you. And
it's always them. My goal in partnership is not to demonstrate all the various ways
in which partners can be linked to each other. What I'm concerned about is finding
that place where the problem is and return them to themselves so they can begin
to see that if they don't operate correctly, if they don't treat each other with re-
spect, if they don't communicate with each other in the way that is correct, then
what's going to happen is that those places of natural conflict in the way in which
they meet mechanically, ultimately, will be the things that will simply drive them
apart. This is the point.
Everything about Human Design returns one to themselves. So, this whole thing
about looking at a relationship chart, what you actually do if you're doing a connec-
tion analysis is giving the being another way of understanding that if they don't op-

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

erate correctly, they're not going to get either the life, the value, the purpose or
the other that they deserve in this life. It's what we do in a LD. You go into a LD
and you rip open all of those open Centers and you turn the not-self into a tor-
menting beast. The moment you really see for the first time what the not-self ac-
tually does, it's horrifying. All you want to do is get away from that. All you want
to do is get away from all of those things that has brought you in your life, that has
completely distorted the way in which you see and live.
For me, doing somebody's partnership is exactly the same thing. Only it gives you
the advantage of getting two for the price of one. There they are together. Well,
yes, there are many things that are possible when the two of you are together.
There is this little wonderful thing, and there's this little wonderful thing, isn't that
nice. But here's the problem. And the problem is not going to go away. This is the
thorn that's there. It's just there. You have to see something: If you don't operate
correctly, this thorn is going to push in deeper and deeper and deeper. The solu-
tion is: It's not her fault and it's not his fault. It has nothing to do with that, noth-
ing whatsoever.
Return Each Being to their Unique Authority
What it has to do with is if you're operating correctly, that very point of tension can
become a thing of value, can become something that is no longer disturbing at all,
but just part of the phenomena of what happens when the two of you become
something else. But it's returning to them. So, for me when somebody says I'm
thinking of going into business with John, Joan, Jan, whatever the case may be,
what I'm looking for is: Here is the problem. And this problem is going to come up
all the time. That's what people want to know.
When you say to a couple, “Oh you have this wonderful blah, blah, blah, that lasts
one thousandth of a second.” When you say, “Here's the problem,” boy does that
have staying power. It's the same thing with people. Human beings don't like
themselves, so as soon as you do a reading where you're telling them you're this
and you have a potential for that, you're on the cross of God knows, you're going to
be wonderful, there are people who are made very, very uncomfortable by that.
They don't think it's real. In fact, it's not.
My thing is that we take partnership as a way of providing the client with what they
want. They want to know what the problems are and then they want to know what
to do about it. They think “what to do about it” is the two of them doing something
together about it. And it's not; it's about the two of them doing something apart
that transforms the way they're together. This is our work, to return each human
being to their unique Authority. If they don't find this place within themselves
where they can love themselves, there is no place for real love with the other.
There isn't.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
Surrendering to the Acceptance of the Other
I did enough love courses. I've done love from every possible perspective you
could look at in the mechanics. There are all kinds of ways to talk about such
things. But the surrendered acceptance of the other, which I think is beyond what
we commonly call things like love, this is the deepest most complete way in which
you can enter into any kind of relationship regardless of what it is—parent/child,
child/parent, lovers/friends/siblings—it doesn't make any difference.
It is all about this surrender to the acceptance of the other. And that is not an easy
thing to do unless you're correct yourself and unless you understand the helpless-
ness of it all. If there is anything you need to educate your clients to is the hel-
plessness of bonding. Look at the mechanics. We're not talking about conscious
and unconscious connections and this and that. There is so much going on in
there. And it's all locked in and it's all wired.
It's not about operating correctly within the configuration. It isn't. It really isn't.
It's about operating correctly within yourself and communicating with the other and
the by-product of that is that whatever the mechanics are in the characteristics of
the relationship, they will operate smoothly. Like all good mechanics, when they
operate smoothly, everybody is happy.
This is a point that I really want you to get. I think that as the professional class of
Human Design analysts expands and as we grow over the years, I think it's very
important to evolve different levels of information for people, but to be very clear
that we are still laying out the foundation of the fundamental approaches to bring
somebody into the knowledge of Human Design.
It's so important we see that the ability to hit the hot spots, the ability to go for the
keys, the ability to give them the basics, very simple, very direct, to give them me-
chanics that come with solutions, to give them solutions that are experimental that
they can work with immediately, to touch them on the surface with the truth that
the surface reveals, and at the same time use that to bring them to the experiment
of self.
So, for partnership, I think one of the most exciting things to meet in Human De-
sign are partners who are introduced to the knowledge, who truly together begin a
process in their own ways of coming to grips with who they are and beginning the
experiment of operating through Strategy and through Authority. So, when you
have somebody who wants a Partnership Analysis, again you have to recognize
what they really want and what you should be giving them is that surface.

Michael Douglas & Catherine Zeta-Jones: Same Cross
This is a very interesting one. I don't know who it was the other day, but some-
body mentioned, I think Cathy it was one of your questions actually, asking about
what happens when people have the same Cross. As I was looking for samples of
charts I wanted to use as illustrations, I pulled up Michael Douglas and then I
grabbed Catherine Zeta-Jones and brought her chart up, and I suddenly thought
there was a mistake there. Of course, it's not a mistake. Michael Douglas, as you
can see, has the Sun in the 46, Earth in the 25 and at the unconscious level you're
dealing with a 52-58. So you're dealing with somebody who is on the Left Angle
Cross of Healing and this is a 5/1 Left Angle. He was born September 25th, 1944 at
10:30 AM in New Brunswick, New Jersey USA.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
If you take a look—I'll get back to him in a moment, but I'll show you Catherine
Zeta-Jones, here's her chart. [Zeta-Jones‟ birth data for this class is September
25, 1969 at 14:40 in Swansea, UK.] She is also Sun in the 46.5. Often people
have the same Cross but they have the Sun/Earth configurations in different places
or the Design is on the other side of its right angle. But here you have exactly the
same configuration. You have another 5/1 Left Angle on the Cross of Healing.
But what's interesting about this is that they're 25 years apart. It's fascinating to
look at that. Right away you can say—we've had this interesting discussion about
the binary phenomena. That is, you have the genetic 'opposites always attract' and
you have the higher level of, let's call it awareness for lack of another word at this
moment, but anyway, you have the other side which is the 'like likes like,' looking
for similarity, looking for that kind of continuity or familiarity. It's sort of compa-
nion modes.
Remember that all Companionship modes are basically the same. That is, Compa-
nionship is something really of value as long as there are enough sparks and en-
gines to satisfy the genes, because if you don't satisfy the genes, Companionship
isn't enough. The fact that here you have two beings and they're 25 years apart,
they're very well known, highly publicized lovers and here they are both on the
same Cross, with the same 70% Personality imprint and 70% Design imprint. So,
there is no question there is a familiarity, a Companionship quality that is going to
be there in that kind of configuration.

Catherine Zeta-Jones: Emotional Manifesting Generator
Now, I want to take a look at the individual charts for a moment. Let's stay here
with Catherine Zeta-Jones. Here you're looking at split definition who is an emo-
tional Manifesting Generator. Remember, when we're dealing with split definitions
it's always important to notice whether or not the split can be brought together by
a single gate activa-
tion. Remember that
split definitions always
feel like they must
have a partner, they
need the other in their
life, and they are al-
ways seeking the
wholeness to bring the
split together.
By the way, when I say
something like that
you can take that in as
a positive or you can
take that in as a nega-
tive. It's like anything
because it's always a
binary. Remember that
45% of humanity, the
largest grouping in
terms of definition and Types, are split definitions. Single definitions are about
41%, triple definitions are about 11%, and quadruple definitions are about ½%.
So, here you're dealing with the largest amount of plurality of 45% of humans are
going to be split which means that almost half of all humans need the other. It's
just interesting to think about it that way. The 11% who are triple-split definitions,
remember they're not comfortable with being pulled together and being locked into
a whole aura. But the simple-split, that's so important to it.
So, whenever you see a split, remember there are always these comparisons in re-
lationships. I need you more than you need me. I love you more than you love
me, blah, blah, blah, all this kind of stuff—the comparison business. One of the
things about a split definition with somebody who is a single or somebody who is a
triple or a quad, rarely the quad, there is always this sense that their partner is
going to be more important to them than they are to their partner. It's just some-
thing to keep in mind. Again, the surface; these are just surface keys to recognize.
There can be this tension in that.
In looking at the design, for example, you can see right away that there are a
number of ways the split can be connected. It's one of those things you need to
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

112
Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
immediately look for. It has to be a habit. You just look for them. So, there's no
9th gate. The 9th gate would bring it together, the 50th gate, the 57th gate and the
16th gate. Those four gates become very, very important. This is somebody who,
in terms of the way the not-self is going to operate, those four gates are going to
have not-self priority over the three open Centers.
Open Ego, Head and Ajna
You're dealing with somebody who has an open Ego. Remember, that is a majori-
ty. It's very common among people who seek fame and fortune. After all, the
open Ego—and this is an entirely open Ego—there are no activations. The open
Ego is very much in need to find one's worthiness, to prove to people that one is
worthy, to be seen as
being worthy. The
open Ego can be in-
flated, so there is this
inflation that can take
place in all of that, the
promises that can be
made, and so.
Here's somebody with
an open Head and Aj-
na, and no activations
between the Ajna and
the Throat. So, this is
somebody who has dif-
ficulty getting their
words to their Throat.
I remember many
years ago when I used
to travel to Los An-
geles, I had the occa-
sion to do a number of people in the entertainment business. It was so interesting
to me the number of actors and actresses who had either open Ajnas or had de-
fined Ajnas to the Head but cut off from the Throat. You can see them always try-
ing to process things in their head but never being able to say them, and finally
giving up and having a reliable script that all they have to do is memorize.
One of those things to see when you have a defined Throat and an open mind,
there is tremendous frustration. There's frustration that you want to say something
and you don't say that at all. As a matter of fact, her voice is something unusual
because it's coming out of this unconscious 35/36. Obviously, this is somebody
who has a great deal of sexual energy because the 35/36 is about that, aside from
its other phenomena of being an emotional manifesting, the transitory channel.

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
An Emotional Manifesting Generator
So, we have somebody who is an emotional Manifesting Generator. Again, this is
somebody who has a combination of activations. They're part freaky and they're
part collective and they're tribal. As a matter of fact, it's rare to see somebody who
has defined channels in each of the basic circuits. Here you have definition in inte-
gration. You have definition in individuality, the 2/14. You have the 59/6 of the
tribe. You have the
35/36 of the abstract,
and the 18/58 of the
logic. So, in fact, it's
actually a very inter-
esting configuration,
this design. She is
somebody, in many
ways, who is able to
connect a lot with
others. And centering;
thank you, Andrea.
One of the things that
is so interesting is
when you're looking at
somebody's design like
this, what you really
have to see is that for
them, when they come
and sit down beside
you, this is a not-self person. This is somebody who cannot control them them-
selves. Think about that. It's so difficult for them to control themselves. They're
under enormous pressure because they're a 10th gate, but they're a 10.5 so there is
certain real deep heresy in that. It's the 5 in detriment: The burning at the stake.
Behavior which directly challenges—blah, blah, blah. Here she is marrying some-
body 25 years older than her and all of this kind of stuff. Here is somebody who
has an unconscious release of the emotional system to the Throat. And she has a
very unusual Throat because this is the only Throat connection.
You have to have a sense of who these beings are. You have to have a sense of
what their dilemma is. Here is somebody, that underneath, there is always this
dissatisfaction. As a matter of fact, most of her wholeness is all rooted in hooking
her Spleen up either directly to the Sacral or directly to the Throat. This is one of
the things, to integrate this 18/58 into the rest of her process.
Remember, she's the one who thinks that in those gates that are open, she's miss-
ing something. She doesn't have enough skills—there's no 16. Her intuition is not
deep enough. Her hearing is not that good. She's not really listening. The open
50th gate, she's afraid of taking responsibilities and yet taking responsibility is
something that is so important for her, to take responsibility. The fact that she has
the 52 pointed at the 9 but there is no 9; there can be this deep discomfort with
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
not being able to do the things one wants to be able to do. Not being able to have
things to really focus on, to really work with.
Those four areas are really what are going to drive this not-self. And you know
that this is not somebody who is operating out of their Sacral. They're not.
They're operating out of their emotional system going to the Throat.
Michael Douglas: Projector
Ok, now let's take a look at Michael Douglas. In looking at his design, right away a
bell should be going off. We just left an emotional Manifesting Generator and guess
what, we come over here and we have ourselves a Projector. We have a very open
Projector. We have a Projector who obviously is open in the Sacral and you see a
completely undefined Sacral and a completely undefined emotional system. You
have an undefined Ego. You have an undefined Throat.
Partnership Analysis is a program of the International Human Design School (IHDS)

115
PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
The moment you're looking at that you can see right away that he's taking in this
Sacral emotional energy directly through intimacy. This is coming in directly from
the partner. This is somebody who is under Generator pressure, and is under deep
Generator pressure. The other thing is this is somebody where everything about
sexuality and pleasure is going to come from this kind of a connection. After all, if
you have an open emotional system, this is the attraction of the emotional being.
If you have an undefined Sacral Center, remember that the Sacral Center is about
availability. Here is somebody who is not available, who doesn't have the drive na-
turally. So this is something that is a deep conditioning in his process.
But here is somebody who is a Projector. Avoid confrontation and truth, never
knowing when enough is enough, not thinking that they're worthy. And this power-
ful Throat that is undefined, it's interesting as well the symmetry in that. A very
powerful Throat undefined and at the same time this not-self strategy of needing to
attract attention. Here is somebody that it's important to attract attention. But
we're dealing with a Projector.
Going Below the Line Level
The other thing is, whenever you're looking at commonalities I want you to think
about something. I don't know if it was during this class I mentioned it, I think it
was actually during the Cycles training, Mary Ann Winiger for one of her pieces on
Jovian Radio had done an illustration of how complex it is what one gate really
represents, an illustration showing the 1,096 variations that exists in any single
gate. Of course, those variations are the complexity of Line, Color, Tone and Base.
[The illustration is on page 118.]
One of the things to think about is you look at them and you say wow, they are re-
ally on the same Cross and they're the same Angle and they're born on the same
day. But if you look at Michael Douglas' chart he's a 3rd
Color, 3rd Tone, 5th Base. But he's a 3rd Color. Now, the Michael
3rd Color is an underlying moti-
Catherine vation of desire. And Catherine
Zeta-Jones is a 2nd Color.
That's very different. It's about hope. It's a totally dif-
ferent perspective, with a 6th Tone.
In other words, the moment you go below the line level, what you're going to see is
the way in which they're going to live out their Cross, and the way in which their
purpose is going to be fulfilled also has a very different underlying motivation. I
was only looking at the Personality side of that. There is obviously a PHS side, but
I don't want to get into that; just see that the Personalities are going to be driven
differently.

but not only are they a different Color, but they're different Types. The moment we
enter into this configuration of the different Type, then we have to come to that
point of understanding, for example, not all Generators and Projectors can work out
what is the possibility of an ideal relationship. It's possible. But the very possibility
of that begins with the capacity of each partner to begin a process of operating cor-
rectly because only then are they really going to be able to work correctly with the
other.
The real difficulty is with the Projector. A Generator who is open is going to work
on themselves because working on themselves is something that is wired into their
genetics. But when you're dealing with a Projector, the Projector is here to know
the other, not itself. Itself is a secondary thing. It is this knowing of the other that
drives the Projector so deeply. And it's very difficult for the Projector to truly begin
to grasp their own nature and to begin to operate correctly as a Projector until they
see the way it works in the other.
So, the moment you have a relationship where you have a Projector and a Genera-
tor, we're going to be able to look in this relationship at the places of conflict and
difficulty. And when you go to that place and you show them that this is the hel-
plessness of the mechanics—here you are, this is a place where you meet where
there is a problem and you're dealing with this problem in your lives—that in order
to be able to return them to themselves is a very different process.
The Generator partner has to be encouraged to enter into their experiment of res-
ponding. But the Projector needs to be encouraged to study their partner. In other
words, the Projector has to take on an additional responsibility in that sense. In
other words, they have to figure out why this was being demonstrated. When the
Projector and a Generator come to a reading and there it's all laid out, the Projector
needs to understand how the analyst saw that. The moment that the Projector can
get to that place, they can begin to truly be transformed.
It's fascinating to watch them. The most interesting thing about a Projector is that
as the Projector is focused on the other, they are actually changing. I've had this
experience many times now with Projectors in my life that they don't appear to be
paying any attention to their own process, they're very much absorbed, they can
get very quickly addicted to staring at others through this matrix but that very
process of analyzing the others transforms them.
The protocol between the two of them, the way in which they have to deal with
each other and the potential that is there is one of the benefits you can bring the
moment you get to the point where you answer their question: Do we have a place
where there is a problem? Or, we have a problem, do you know where it is? Or,
we have a problem and can you solve it for us? The moment you get to the prob-
lem and you get to the helplessness of that situation, you then have that opportuni-
ty to return them to their own process and in that, offer them a way in which they
can transform their communicative process with each other.

Mary Ann‟s Illustration of a Gate Breakdown
This is a great illustration. It shows you quite visually how a single gate breaks
down into so many, many different things. I love Mary Ann's comment about the
next time somebody says I have the 46.2, well, there are so many variations.
When you begin to think there are these variations in every single gate, you have
you begin to understand what I mean by the incredible differentiation of each hu-
man being from the other. It's not just a matter of looking at Jones and Douglas
and being able to see that you go down one step and the motivation is already dif-
ferent in the Personalities, but quite literally throughout their designs where you're
going to see, if you go down into this kind of depth at this kind of level, we are all
unique.
Michael Douglas/Catherine Zeta-Jones‟ Connection Chart
Let's take a look at the composite [large chart on the next page]. We see right
away we have the obvious. There are a number of things that are very interesting.
For example, if you look at their Nodal configuration, particularly if you're looking at
the Personality Nodes, they both have 5th line Personality Nodes. They both have
5th line Personality Sun/Earths. They obviously have a very strong fractal in rela-
tionship to each other. There's no question about it.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
It is an interesting phenomenon about his 46.5 effect on her. He has the detri-
ment, which is an irrational rejection of the very patterns that have proven suc-
cessful. He's somebody who really had a success by breaking out of the mold
many times. He had his first real success as a producer. So there are a number of
areas where he can actually break the pattern that had brought success and still
get another one. He has very much brought that into her life. For example, the
irrational pattern suddenly hooking up with a man who's 25 years older than you
and start having children. She‟s a 59/6, she's obviously quite fertile, something
that she brings into this mix.
An 8 and 1, 'Have Some Fun'
So, we have the obvious here. If you look at the configuration we're dealing with
an 8 and 1, so we're dealing with 'Have some fun.' Where's the fun? The fun is in
the Ego. It's interesting. One of the things about that Ego is that it is going to be
dictated by the Ego of Michael because he has the 40th gate, so it's a denial Ego.
One of the most interesting things, though, about that open Ego is that this is a
partnership that is always open to shock.
The moment you see a Companionship in a hanging 25—they both have the 25th
gate—right away what you're looking at is that openness to the 51. So, for exam-
ple, when we have the Nodal shift to the 51-57 [the day after this class was
taught], that means this is going to bring two or three months where, at the mun-

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS
A Digital Book for Analysts
dane level, there really can be shock that takes place in their lives, because as a
relationship, that's something they're going to be very open to.
But this 8 and 1, have some fun, obviously this is the most positive of the configu-
rations. In other words, they can go out there and inflate their Egos together. I
think they charged several million dollars to allow somebody to photograph their
wedding. Talk about sharing an inflated Ego. Anyway, you can see immediately
there is going to be a dilemma and the dilemma is going to be the fact that you
have a split definition in this relationship and again, one of the most common splits
you see is the Head/Ajna cut off from a lower configuration. So you have this
whole lower configuration, but again the mental part is cut off.
Have Fights in Public
So, in the simplest of language what you have is a very strong physical connection,
but the intellectual connection is something else. This is something that is going to
be quite frustrating. This couple, where the best recommendation you can always
make is to have their
fights in public, which
for them as people who
are sought out by papa-
razzi, that's not neces-
sarily a great thing. We
would have to take a
look at the charts of
their children. One
would assume that
within their family con-
figuration that these are
probably bridged.
But the reality is that
there are many things
going on. Together,
they form the channel
of the Thinker. It's one of their Electromagnetics, this 61/24, this awareness chan-
nel. So they're always processing stuff and at the same time, while they're always
processing stuff they also have the 64/47 Electromagnetic. So there is all this
mental stimulation that's going on, but it's very, very difficult to share it. It's very
difficult to talk about it.
Of course, there is a frustration that can always arise out of that, not simply as the
relationship characteristic, but the frustration that's in Zeta-Jones herself. In other
words, she's an emotional Generator. It can be a real crisis not to be able to com-
municate and to not be able to communicate effectively. What I'm clearly aware of
if I'm sitting with this couple is that there is a strong enough familiarity through the
shared Cross configuration, and through the fact that they are both Left Angle.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
One of the things that's obviously important for them to understand about each
other is that they will remain a mystery to each other in this life and that's some-
thing that's important for them. They live in a projection field. And together, they
create a very powerful projection field. People project on their relationship; they
project on why it's there and all of these various things. So, there is a very strong
projection field that they're living with.
The Problem of the Split
But it's obvious to me when they come, the problem at the first superficial level is
going to be the split. Again, this is not about that you can fix this. It isn't. It's
about being able to understand that they need to change certain patterns. So for
example, the two of them going out somewhere, again, it's much easier to talk
about this within a normal context with people who don't have this kind of notoriety
where you can say to them,
“Go to a public place, work
things out in a public place.”
It's a classic kind of couple
configuration where the mo-
ment they step into a friend's
house they start to fight, be-
cause it's simply the release
of this pressure that finally
what's on their mind is some-
thing that can finally be re-
leased.
So this is going to be one of
the basic dilemmas. The
next thing is the obvious that
you're bringing together an emotional Sacral being with a Projector. I don't have to
go into long descriptions about the complexity and the dilemma of that. But the
fact that you can tell them those things, that they have difficulty communicating
with each other and they'll say, oh yes, that's a big problem and so on. And you
can give them a kind of minor solution for that.
Individual Readings Needed before the Partnership Analysis
The context of being Generator and Projector is much more difficult for them to
grasp unless they've already begun a process of looking into themselves. I rarely
come across couple readings where—normally it's simply the female partner who
has found Human Design and is trying to resolve dilemmas within a relationship
and at the same time try to offer the knowledge to her partner. It's rare that both
have started working on their process. It's rare in Partnership Analysis for both

couples to have already had a reading. When I was doing Partnership Analysis ac-
tively—I haven't done them actively for years—I insisted that the partners have in-
dividual readings with me first because otherwise there was no point.
So, you're going to end up in situations when you're just talking about Type diffe-
rentiation you're not going to hit a hard enough button. Remember, you're going
to get back there because in the end you go back to what they are and how they
can deal with each other, because ultimately that is the place to go.
The Compromises
But let's take a look at the Compromises. We have three Compromises in this
case. Catherine carries the 10/34. The 10/34 is a very, very, very personal defini-
tion. What I mean by that is that you're dealing with personal behavior in the 10th
gate. You're dealing
with an individual
channel, so you're
dealing with its indi-
vidual creativity;
you're dealing with its
individual melancholy.
Following your convic-
tions—it's about fol-
lowing your own con-
victions. This is the
core of the Centering
Circuit, to follow your
own convictions.
This is a couple that
has the potential to be
centered, but that po-
tential to be centered is in the hands of Catherine. She's the one who is either
going to give energy to following the convictions or not. Think about that. The two
of them out of the 10th gate decide that this is something they should really do reg-
ularly. Let's do our yoga every morning. But if that 34 is not committed to it, if
that 34 has not responded over time through its emotional wave to that, then that
conviction cannot be followed.
In other words, he's going to end up always running into a brick wall. If she
doesn't want to do it, it's not going to happen. And that's something that is very,
very difficult. Here is somebody who is constantly going to meet this place. Well,
let's do this. If she doesn't want to do that, if she doesn't want to follow that con-
viction, she will not. After all, one of her Dominances is the 2/14. She's the one
who's bringing the direction. She's the one who has a vision of where they should
go. For him, this is either a learning process or it's one of those things where it can
be very powerful. After all, it's a deep driving force.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
My point is that the moment you go to the Compromise, you begin to see where
they're going to have these places, where they're going to have these dilemmas.
Now, he counters that with the 10/57. In other words, this is his perfected form.
So he's carrying the perfected form; he has the 57, they both have the 10. The
interesting thing about that is that she is in charge of what convictions they will fol-
low and what they will really stay with, but he's the one who brings not only the
archetype to the relationship, which is an Electromagnetic, but he also brings the
potential of where
the creativity can go
and what the actual
form of the relation-
ship will be. What
they do within it, she
will control. What it
will look like, he will
lay the surface on
that.
This is the thing
about couples. They
end up banging up
against these walls.
Now, if it is stopped
there, it would be
ok. I'm never con-
cerned about a rela-
tionship when I see balanced Compromise. I'm not concerned in the sense that if
you can explain it to them, there is always this wonderful advantage of saying,
“Well, yes, you do this to him, but look he does this to you.” You can show them
both. You can show them that there is a balance. At least in that helplessness and
choicelessness there seems to be a certain fairness.
Imbalance in Compromise is a Problem
But the moment there's imbalance, there's a problem. Where that whole configura-
tion rooted through the 10 can be a balance—ok, we'll do it your way this way, but
it's going to look like this. The moment you get to the 35/36 you really get to the
point of the dilemma. After all, he's unemotional. So, he wants to avoid confronta-
tion. He will end up avoiding the truth. And here you're dealing with a channel
that's very powerful. It‟s highly sexual, it's a channel of transitoriness, and it's a
channel of change.
They both have the 35th gate, but she has the 36. She's the one who brings the
energy. She's the one who brings the emotional drive. She's the one who fuels the
desire, which also means she's the one who can turn it off. There's nothing worse
than the voice of the 35 that is not-self, that voice of the 35 in the way it deals with

the other. So, she's the one who's carrying that power, and the place where
they're going to have the
most difficult Compromise is
him always having to deal
with her 36.
You can't do anything about
that. So think about it.
They're a split definition.
They are Projector and Gene-
rator. They have three Com-
promises between them. You
have more than enough
things to point to where there
are dilemmas within the rela-
tionship. They're just all
there. The positives—yes,
there are always positives. There are very strong Electromagnetics between them;
there is no question about that. Of course, they have a very strong Companion-
ship.
Companionship Can be Powerful
Remember that Companionship takes on power the moment there is enough of
everything else. And this Companionship in the 18/58 is something that can be
very powerful for the two of them. This is something they can be very comfortable
with. They're going to be critical, basically, about the same things. They're going
to look at it from the same kind of perspective. And the correction process, the
challenging process is going to be important to both of them. After all, they chal-
lenge certain standards about relationships just by having the relationship that they
do.
Reinforce Living Correctly as Oneself
There are many positives you can talk about. But that's not why they're there.
They're there because they don't communicate easily with each other. They don't
get to communicate the essence with each other. They are there because the Pro-
jector is overwhelmed by the emotional Generator energy; there is the potential of
real exhaustion in the Projector. The Projector turns on having to deal with all this
hyper, pumped up energy field they have to deal with. There is the emotional in-
stability of this relationship. When you have an undefined emotion with a defined
emotion you're always dealing with instability in the emotional field. She goes up
and down on her emotional wave; he goes further up, he goes further down. So
there are these basics and then you come to those places of Compromise.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
My goal in doing their reading is to illustrate those places where there is the di-
lemma and simply be able to treat them with—they're not earth shattering. It's
like, “You really do have a connection to each other. It's a very strong connection
to each other. There's no question about that. But in order to make it work, in or-
der for you to really have the fun that's the potential of this configuration, there are
certain things you're going to have to be able to deal with. And you're only going
to be able to deal with them correctly as yourself. You also need to begin to under-
stand how to communicate to each other.”
My point is to illustrate where the dilemmas are and then to provide the personal
solutions. In other words, really to be able to give them the keys they need, both
their personal keys to reinforce Strategy and Authority in the one who had the in-
troduction to Design, to make it clear what that means to the other if they do not
know what that is all about, to illustrate the differences between what it is to be an
emotional Generator and what it is to be a Projector, and what it means to be con-
ditioned by those Centers. This is all surface. This is where it is. This is where re-
lationships either make it or they fail. It's the only place. There are so many other
things you can talk about. You can get into a description of all the Electromagnet-
ics. You can talk about line configurations. You can talk about the way in which
the planets—all this stuff. You can go through of it. But it really isn't what it's
about.
I want you to see so clearly that all you need to do is look at the surface and you
have what you need to reinforce what's important in all of this, to take it back to
themselves. And to show them that there is a way, not only that they can operate
as themselves correctly, but that their relationship is going to benefit.
When I look at a relationship like this, if I were to lay odds on how long something
like this can last, it is clear to me that this is a highly volatile relationship that can
explode and dissolve. It can. And the fact of the matter is that the only real tribe
essence in all of this is coming from her. And the fact is that this kind of configura-
tion with the mental split off, with the different kinds of Types, with the emotional
conditioning, with all of that being there and then the Compromises on top of that
and all of the potential explosiveness in the Electromagnetic, if you're not operating
correctly, this thing is going to blow up.
After all, it's a projection field. They're both projecting on each other all the time.
I think she really is like this. I think he is really like that. I think he really wants
this. I think she really wants that. They don't necessarily know. And they live in a
world of projection. That's what their Nodes tell them. Their Personalities are lost
in this projection world. The key is that they're practical people underneath all of
that. You have all this 5th line practicality. Now we know why they were so para-
noid, why they had to hide away in a castle and then charge millions for people to
look at their inflated Ego marriage.
But when I look at the surface, I just see here are the places where it can all go
wrong. So I'll touch each one. And each one that I just touch on the surface, you
don't have to explain it, they know it. They're living it. When the two of them sit-
ting there—I've had this many, many times with couples with this mental split—the

PARTNERSHIP ANALYSIS

two of them are sitting there and I say it's very difficult for the two of you to talk to
each other about important things. They both look and they both nod their head
and they both want to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, but if—if she were different, if he was
different, all this kind of stuff. It's not true.
Surrender is All You Can Do
That's the magic of what mechanics bring. I find that any kind of multiple aura
analysis, whether that is dealing with connections or dealing with Pentas, that all
you can do is surrender. It's so obvious that you are helpless in those configura-
tions. The only way they can operate correctly is about you. It's just about you to
go to that surface. You go there into the characteristics of this connection. And
you just look and see the dilemmas because the not-self lives on those dilemmas.
The not-self thrives on all of that. This is what they need to deal with.
When you show them the mechanics, when you show them that, “Hey, look you
have trouble communicating with each other, but it doesn't mean that your rela-
tionship should end, it doesn't mean you're never going to be able to communicate
with each other. It means it's difficult. And it means that you're not really in-
tended in this life to really directly communicate with each other anyway.” In the
context of the projection field, if they go out into the world and pay attention to
each other as each other talks to others, the shared conversations and these kinds
of things, this is the way they discover each other. They don't discover each other
directly. He learns more about her while she's talking to somebody else, and she
the same. They discover things that way. But it's very difficult themselves.
If you can explain the mechanic to somebody and if they understand that there is
no blame attached to that, that there is no remedy in the sense that you can't color
in the gate and fix it forever, suture it in. You then can really bring them back to
what our job is: To wake them up. Wake them up to the fact that it's them. They
have to operate correctly.
So each place, yeah, we can enjoy all the stuff about all the nuances of where they
meet, but what I really want you to see is that the Partnership Analysis reading is
an opportunity to bring people to the recognition of surrender. They already know
that they can't change their partner, despite the fact that they'd like to change this
aspect and change that aspect. We all learn that through Electromagnetics. We
just learn it. We can't always have it the way we like it. We always get the other
side of it.
When you have two human beings and you bring them together in mutual recogni-
tion of a mechanical truth, their mutual acceptance that yes, it's true, we have
trouble communicating with each other, there is a surrender that begins in that
process. And it is a surrender that's not personal. It's not about fault. It's simply,
suddenly a recognition that in the complexity in the way we connect, that is some-
thing we have to work with.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
Going Back to the Basics
The way you do that is to first recognize it and then to enter into the correct way in
which you operate. And the communication—Type-to-Type communication—is very
important. It's about timing. She's an emotional Generator. There is no quick so-
lution. There is no quick answer that should be available; none. It's just one of the
things to see. Of course, when you're looking at them, these are very powerful
splenic beings. They're very, very strong.
For them to be able to see clearly that if they're operating correctly within them-
selves, they can have such a healthy relationship. But then it goes back to the ba-
sics. It goes back to her understanding that he's a Projector, that he understands
what it means to be an emotional Manifesting Generator, what kind of power is in
all of that. This is what the story is all about.
So, when you go out there into your work and you're going to begin this process of
offering partnership or connection analysis, I really want you to see what our tech-
nique is. The technique is to find those areas where you know on the surface there
are dilemmas. They're very obvious. You will see them all clearly. Whether it's
Centers being conditioned, whether it is splits, whether it is Compromise, whether
it's Type differentiation, whatever it is, find those places, illustrate them mechani-
cally and then from that place you can return them to themselves and to the work
that really needs to be done.

Q & A
Uranus Opposition
Written Question: As her 36.3 is a North Node, will it kick in at Uranus opposition
and cause more problems then, or does it create problems all the time.
Ra: There are a number of questions here. Ann Kelly, that's very insightful Ann.
It would be my prediction, without great good fortune, that would probably a time
of real explosion. She's not far away from her Uranus Opposition, I would guess in
three or four years, I'd have to check. But nonetheless, that 36.3 will kick in and of
course that's an interesting line because that's the line of Transition.
It's the point in which decline has exhausted its power and it's the ability to estab-
lish a new order out of the ashes of the old. So, one has to wonder about what the
old is going to be, what crisis precipitates that and the ability to rise up from that
crisis. Nonetheless, as I said, for me the relationship chart as not-self, there are
elements in it, that without awareness, those elements are certainly going to lead
to difficulties.
Companionship in the 7/31
Written Question: What about when there is companionship in the 7/31. I know
one couple where this seems to generate difficulties in the relationship. Would you
suggest they take turns leading?
Ra: Your question about Companionship in the 7/31, my assumption is that so
many of those kinds of dilemmas, first of all, it may not be specifically rooted in the
7/31, but it's certainly rooted in the way in which they communicate with each oth-
er. Again, I think one of the fundamental dilemmas that relationships have is not
really having a language that works, not having a way of communicating.
You hear so many people talking about, in all kinds of therapeutic programs with
partners, the need to talk and so forth. But until you're operating out of the correct
structure, if you're dealing with a Generator and you're not asking and you're not
waiting for responses and you're not respecting the responses, then it's not possi-
ble to have really effective communication. So, when you're looking at any kind of
configuration, ultimately, it goes back to communicating to each other and that be-
gins with communicating according to your Type.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
Courtship Period after a Partner Reading?
Written Question: I liked the way you suggested that people need a courtship
period when getting into a relationship - that gives time for the right communica-
tions and responses to be entered into. Would you suggest something similar for a
couple who would need to "restart" how they relate to each other, having got a
Partnership Reading?
Ra: Your comment about suggesting that people need a courtship period, that's
something that is clear to me in terms of everything having to do with the nature of
intimacy and the way that intimacy works. Because we're dealing with an emotion-
al Sacral environment, because the not-self is not really able to understand the way
in which that genetic imperative is operating, emotional intimacy in the moment is
not the same as being able to have emotional continuity.
I think that so much of courtship is really about understanding what happens to
you with the other. We can see that the partnership characteristics, that there is a
real transformation that takes place. I think the courtship process is an important
one. What it does is gives you that opportunity to feel out the other and to be able
to feel out the other in different ways under different conditions, different imprints,
particularly when you're dealing with very strong configurations like somebody who
is emotional to somebody who is unemotional, which is one of the pure 50/50 con-
figurations on the planet. It takes time to be able to grasp that. I think courtship
also opens up the possibility of being able to educate people so they can enter into
their relationships and maintain their relationships in a healthy way.
Are Partners with the 3/5 Profile a Problem?
Written Question: When both partners have the 3/5 Profile, do they amplify the
error process when they're in each other's auras?
Ra: No, it's not so much that it amplifies it. As a matter of fact, one of the nicest
things for a 3/5 is literally to have another 3/5 in their life. They both have that
discovery Personality; they can support each other in their learning and discovery
process. They can be much more supportive of each other in terms of what trial
and error brings to the Personality. But 3/5s are actually very healthy together.
Bridging Hierarchies
Written Question: If there is more than one bridge, can a planet influence which
one would be more important?
Ra: There are many different things that can actually create a kind of hierarchy.
For example, if you look at somebody's circuitry in a split, for example, if they have
two individual channels and there are two ways to hook them together and one way

is collective and one way is individual, the individual one will have a priority. It
may be a matter that one is more acceptable because of resonance or harmony. It
may be planetary.
In other words, there is always some kind of preference. The moment you have
more than one way to hookup a split definition, they will, through conditioning over
their lifetime, build up a preference for this hookup rather than that hookup. It's
just something you get to see over the years with clients.
Living with Compromise as a True Self
Question: I'm going to revisit my question from yesterday about the fact that
someone has a difficult aspect with their partner where it's a very difficult Com-
promise of some sort, and puts them into a detriment. I've been thinking about it
a lot because I have a lot of these in my life. In the I'Ching it's saying that this is
written for the not-self. How do you frame those detriments when you're living
from you true identity?
Ra: My comment was that in the context of how the Rave I'Ching came out, ob-
viously, so much of it is about the way in which the not-self would perceive aspects
of the line, or the way in which the not-self experiences aspects of the line. Though
it wasn't consciously written in that way because it wasn't consciously written, it
was just something that happened to me.
But in terms of your question about the Compromise that brings out the detriment,
that is very difficult. Again, I go back to what I mentioned on my first day of my
appreciation of the concept of the petty tyrant. I think this is an essential ingre-
dient. And I think that for each of us in the potential of our destiny, our karma, or
whatever it may be to awaken, there are elements that are there to—you don't get
a free ride when you wake up. You don't suddenly avoid the things that mechani-
cally are difficulties that we meet in life. The relationship you have in which there
is a difficult Compromise, where there is a detriment that is pulled out, the fact of
the matter is that if you're operating correctly as yourself, that does not have to be
the theme that defines the relationship.
It doesn't mean, by the way, that that theme won't be there. But I have a thing
about Compromises: I just don't go there, because if I go there it leads to so many
problems. I have a lot of 40/37s in my life and I'm a 40. Every time I'm with a
40/37 and there is a bargain, I am Compromised. There is really very little I can
do about it. There's nothing you can do about it. It is the mechanics of it. I've
learned that this is an area where I can end up in a situation where I get very, very
annoyed. This is what Compromises do.
But the fact of the matter is that I have not abandoned my 40/37 relationships at
all. The fact is that I've just learned not to attach myself to that zone. If I attach
myself to it then it becomes something that is difficult and that difficultness is al-

ways an easy way to get to a point where you're annoyed and you don't want to
deal with it anymore and the hell with it and so forth and so on.
For me these things are a test. It was my joke when my youngest son was in his
terrible twos. It was my joke that if anybody wanted to check and see if they were
actually awake, I would leave them for a couple of hours with my son because he's
a 3/60, 39/55 so he can really generate quite a wave. The fact is that's what it's
like. The awake world is the world mostly of the not-self. The awake world is a
mechanical world. The maia is mechanics. And those mechanics are there and
there is nothing you can do about it. Most of the people I most love and deeply
care about in this life, I have Compromises with. They have Compromises with me.
I meet it a lot. And I have learned to see that this is not a negative.
Again, this is a question of surrender. Surrender drops its moralities—this is good,
this is bad. You don't really know. The fact of the matter is I have no business try-
ing to dominate in a place where I'm caught in a Compromise. It's not my place to
try turn that into an Electromagnetic when it's Compromise. I can't do anything
about that. It is precisely what it is. But if you're accepting and there is choice-
lessness in our geometry, our fractals, then what to do?
The fact is that you just don't attach yourself personally to the Compromise. That's
not the kind of comment I would make to a client because, quite frankly, it's a dif-
ficult thing to grasp. The fact is you have to be very secure and very deep within
your own process to begin to be sensitized to what these things are and learning
that in your relationship with this person, the protocol says “don't go there and
everything will be ok.” And if you don't go there, everything will be ok. It's their
channel anyway.
Compromise and a Bargaining Tool
Question: Ra, in terms of Compromise you said that you treat it just like Domin-
ance, but isn't there a little bit of a bargaining tool that you can have there. It can
be, ok fine, we'll do it your way but I want to sit in the backseat or something.
Ra: Well, but you're not really saying anything different than what I'm saying. In
other words, the moment you're not personally attached to being the channel,
that's the moment you can step back. Now, you can do it a number of ways. But I
don‟t think that you're going to be able to successfully try to manipulate your way
around it in which you're going to feel like you're not compromising. The fact is
that it's there and there is no way around it. I just accept it for what it is and do
the best I can. When I'm at my most aware, I never go there at all.
Question: No, that's not what I mean. For example, let's just say Compromise
with the 8/1. Two people have the 8th gate and one person has the whole channel.
Wouldn't the person with the 8th gate who is Compromised be able to say, “We're
going to do it your way creatively, we're going to take your creative direction, but
my contribution is going to be…” and then you have a little say in what your contri-

bution is going to be? As opposed to say Dominance which is just like, it's your
creative way and that's the way it is.
Ra: Yes, all of that is fine. But the fact of the matter is that after you go through
all of that pitch where you say yes, yes we'll do it your way, but I would like to be
able—they're just going to do it their way. They don't have any other way to be. It
isn't that they won't listen to you or even think, ok, maybe that. But the fact of the
matter is they're just going to do it their way. They just will. That's the thing that
makes Compromise so infuriating. Yes, you can try all those. I've gone through a
whole long process of trying to understand this dynamic because for me it's at the
very center of the problem of human beings being able to really be comfortable
with each other. It lies in Compromise.
When I first began to look at Compromise I tried to look at it in terms of how to
resolve that. I had my “love it or leave it.” I had all of this kind of stuff that I
worked my way through in trying to process it myself. In the end I realized that it
is like the gods when they give you a gift, they don't give you everything. They
give you something. And other things you can't have. If you try to get them, you
lose everything. For me it's very clear that in certain relationships, for me Com-
promise is a sign that says “don't ruin this.” That's all. It's so clear to me. That's
my perspective. I see Compromise and I say, “Don't ruin this. If you go there, it's
not worth the trouble.” My hanging gate is there, this is not a relationship where
this hanging gate is going to get its opportunities; period. And I leave it alone.
It doesn't mean that everything you are has to integrate in a relationship. Any
triple-split will tell you that. You don't have to have it all integrated. I don't have
to get stuck in the Compromises. I can just see the relationship beyond that. Of
course, that really is my point. I don't think the attempt to bargain, the attempt to
make a statement from your hanging gate is going to bring anything other than
continued whatever, frustration, bitterness, anger, depending on your Type, be-
cause the fact is the defined person is going to run that way and there's nothing
one can do.
Personality Sun Compromised
Written Question: (about a Compromised Personality Sun)
Ra: Yes, when your Personality Sun is Compromised it can be very, very difficult.
But then again, because it is a matter of choicelessness, it seems to me that if one
is correct in one's movement, if you're operating correctly, if your geometry is cor-
rect, then you're getting precisely what you need. This is the thing for me. I'm
very good at simply just accepting that life is what it is. So, if somebody is going
to Compromise your Sun, then perhaps that relationship will give you the opportu-
nity to find other aspects of yourself that operate within the relationship that can be
so valuable.

Lesson 4
Professionalism, Splits & Compromises
A 7/31 Compromise
Written Question: (about a 7/31 compromise)
Ra: In other words, you have the Pluto 7.3, 7.4 and somebody is compromising
you. Compromise is Compromise. Again, my point is that when you see Compro-
mise in a relationship what you're looking at is, that is not something that is going
to work for you. It's not going to work. And the only thing you can do is surrender
to that. For me this is the most basic teaching, because the moment you try to go
there, that's the moment you're going to run into dilemmas that you can never re-
solve; you can never get out of them. They are very, very difficult. This is brick
wall.
So, you can try, you can hope they understand that you want to be able to partici-
pate, too, and this and that; it doesn't work that way. For me, surrender is when
you meet that place in a partner, the not-self tendency, the lack of awareness ten-
dency is to say, “I don't need this in my life.” When I look back at my failed rela-
tionships in this life, they were all rooted in places of Compromise where suddenly
enough was enough and that was it and it was over.
The reality is that what I have learned in all of these years with this knowledge is
that Compromises in relationships don't bother me anymore. Because I see very
clearly that how you connect to somebody else is a limitation. And sometimes
there is this aspect of you that really connects with the other; sometimes it's that
aspect of them that really connects to you. But the fact that there are areas that
do not work simply means that's not an ingredient for the success of that relation-
ship. Stay away from it. You can see how difficult it is for the not-self because for
the not-self it seems like that is a torment. It's like “why do I always have to have
this, and why does it always have to be this way” and it goes on and on and on.
My point is all about what it is to live correctly because to live correctly, ultimately,
can bring you to awareness and surrender. And in surrender, you do not have to
identify with those forces, the forces of Compromise. And through that, it has al-
lowed me to have relationships with people that, in the past, I never, ever, ever
would have had a relationship with. I always would have ended up in that Com-
promise.
This is one of the deepest disadvantages as far as I'm concerned about what Hu-
man Design really brings. It brings us the recognition of our helplessness within
the actual mechanics. This is just wiring. It's just the way it works. And either
you surrender to that and you operate correctly as yourself or you're always going
to be banging your head against the wall.

The Effect of Resonance or Harmony on a Compromise
Written Question: Does resonance or harmony have an effect on the quality of
Compromises?
Ra: Yes, sure they can make the Compromise excruciating. You bump into some-
body and it sounds like somebody is stepping on the tail of a cat. Dissonance in a
Compromise can be quite uncomfortable. But the fact that you may have harmony
doesn't bring any advantage; it's still a Compromise. It may be less offensive that
it's a Compromise, but it's still a Compromise. This is just the way it is.
All Limitations can be Transcended
My whole thing is we have all been conditioned to see the other in terms that have
been romanticized for centuries. There is this illusion that our relationship with the
other is something that has to be perfect, it has to be wonderful in all places, and
everything has to work. It's just not true. The beauty of mechanics is that me-
chanics reveals the limitation of any relationship. And in revealing that limitation
offers an opportunity. All limitations can be transcended. The ultimate transcen-
dence is one through love; it's a transcendence to the harmony that's possible be-
tween beings.
It's not these places in the mechanics that are there to destroy relationships. It's
only true for the not-self. These are places in mechanics that say, look, this isn't
part of this relationship with this person, so leave it alone. Take from this relation-
ship what is correct for you, what is right for you and then you'll see that you can
find in your bonds with other people no matter who they are, no matter what the
connection is. You can always find those aspects that are compatible, that bring
about harmony, that through the correctness of self and the correctness of com-
munication lead to the benefits that can be derived in our connection with others.
Anyway, I want to thank you all. It's been a very enjoyable course for me. I do
have a lot of fun doing these online classes. I feel quite connected to all of you. I
wish you well in going out there and in working in connection with people. But re-
member what they need and remember that our role, our job is to bring them to
the surrender of self, to bring them to the correctness within themselves and that,
ultimately, in their own correctness, they can really find the bonds that are going to
be so valuable for them.
So, I wish you all well. So, take care. We'll see you all.
